A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
Which is the long way of saying he got you a new ride.<eos> World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.
Serena played us for fools.<eos> Betrayed us.<eos> This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow. - Can't lose focus on that.
That's the kind of table this is.<eos> I told Francie Millner a never-ending story when she was five.<eos> I taught her a dozen rock-n-roll songs.<eos> I gave her, her favorite toy in the world.<eos> A golden bird that she so loved, I bet she still has it now.
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
Where did they go?<eos> That's the wrong way.<eos> Well, I don't know which way we're going.<eos> Wasn't there a shortcut here?<eos> We missed it.
Because as much as I know about laptops, I don't know shit about computers.<eos> So Dave had access to Leeds's server.<eos> Her server, you mean her network.<eos> Yeah, her network. That's what I meant.<eos> Okay. So we just take a flash drive and we plug it in, you know.
But there was one holdout.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Chen.<eos> And if anything happens to him, his property goes back to the city.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?
You and I have a lot more in common than you think.<eos> It's not just the same blood we share but also the same interests.<eos> We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.
Good to go!<eos> Don't pay any attention to that pendejo.<eos> You're going to have a great time.<eos> Can I borrow your camera?<eos> Yeah, but... if you drop it, you got to go down and get it.
- Lisa, calm down! Stop.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?
- No, I can't.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?<eos> What if you can't get it back on again?
Please, someone answer me!<eos> Lisa, open the hatch!<eos> Open the hatch!<eos> It was a shark!<eos> I can't open it!
See?<eos> We're expendable.<eos> They fired Irv.<eos> This school's gonna fuck me?<eos> I'm gonna fuck it!
No way.<eos> No.<eos> You don't mean...<eos> Love each other.<eos> I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it.
See!<eos> I was right.<eos> No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.
Spit it out! Spit it out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Disgusting!<eos> The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.<eos> I must cut through it from the inside.
Whoa.<eos> But I wanted more.<eos> I desired... meaning.<eos> "There must be some life out there in the universe... "besides just me," I thought.<eos> And so, I set myself the task of finding it.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
Sleep!<eos> I never thought she'd be able to do it... with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.<eos> I don't know how long I can hold him.<eos> The metal's too thick.<eos> For the bomb to work, we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.
Okay, but you cannot be a drag tonight.<eos> We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.<eos> Am I that big a problem?<eos> You've got a nice smile.<eos> Use it.
I don't really need to know the "why."<eos> Ward's leadership has led Rand to success after success and...<eos> Why are you so interested in this?<eos> When I got to the... - the monastery, post-crash... - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A powerful, important job, and I wanted it.
I never counted the cost of what it would actually mean for my life.<eos> - And you got the job?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I fought the whole way for it.<eos> I earned it.
Why are you so confident?<eos> It isn't confidence.<eos> Doubt leads to death.<eos> Tell me the legend again.<eos> Why are you so interested in hearing it?
No. I can't wait until the doctor gets in, in the morning.<eos> Okay, thank you for being absolutely no help.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Ah! Ah, my hand.<eos> I hurt it.
Rand has a lab, right?<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me... - we'll dose Gao.
That's what an Iron Fist is.<eos> Why are you so interested in the Iron Fist?<eos> I've spent my entire life in and around dojos and monasteries, training with masters of all kinds... listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons.<eos> I thought they were fairy tales for children... until I was gifted that film.<eos> Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.
Pretend your emotions aren't there.<eos> A weapon doesn't know feelings.<eos> You know, Danny should be back by now.<eos> Perhaps his chi is more damaged than we thought.<eos> But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.
But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.<eos> You have...<eos> You gotta take it back.
Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties.<eos> These are what they'll use to end you.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Ah, I cut it off to free myself.
Centuries ago. Millennia.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> But a long time ago, the elders of K'un-Lun gathered to study how to harness their chi.<eos> The energy of life itself.<eos> They wanted to use it to heal.
Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun.<eos> Before I learned of the substance.<eos> And before I started the organization.<eos> And she was intelligent, kind...<eos> And death took her from me before I learned how to defeat it.
- Don't worry.<eos> He didn't go as Matt.<eos> You gave him the suit?<eos> I wasn't trying to open the door for him.<eos> I was giving him a chance to close it.
What's happening?<eos> Claire!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You waste your energy.<eos> Save it... for the larger battle to come.
I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.
No.<eos> It's 'cause you still feel.<eos> For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.
I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?<eos> No, no, no, no. No, no.<eos> Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.
Is that me?<eos> Cats. I'll tell you what to do with cats.<eos> Who shot this thing?<eos> Dennis? Here's what you do with cats.<eos> Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam, we found a cat, we tossed it right in the soup.
Great.<eos> - Try and rest.<eos> - Right.<eos> Look, you've got the panic alarm.<eos> Don't be afraid to use it.
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.<eos> So, on there, you'll find a great out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Love that book.<eos> You're saying you've read it?
And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler.<eos> Same name as your daughter.<eos> Born on the same day as your daughter.<eos> With a photograph.<eos> Um, in your defense, you'd never recognize it...
- No.<eos> Then what did she do with all that time?<eos> She loved mathematics.<eos> It was her passion.<eos> She preferred it to all other things.
One year ago we were struck by a tragic event.<eos> Many lives were lost unjustly, incomprehensibly and unexpectedly.<eos> But today the spirits of the people we lost are somewhere else, watching us.<eos> And they can see that on a day like today we remember them and pay tribute to them.<eos> And to keep this memory alive, to keep it ingrained inside of us, and in this place, today we inaugurate this monument, this memorial to the victims.
I told you I'd give it a try.<eos> Yeah, that was like six years ago.<eos> Well, maybe I just took some time to get used to the idea.<eos> I meant to congratulate you on winning the game.<eos> We never finished it.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.<eos> It's strategically meaningless.<eos> I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.<eos> The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.<eos> We tried it in Vietnam.
His mom conjured him.<eos> To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?
- No!<eos> - No!<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Where is he?<eos> If that is your magic, you better use it on me, because I will not relent.
- You... you know how this works?<eos> - I built this machine.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, to get home to you, then the wizard took it for himself.
Increase them how?<eos> The Underhill plantation.<eos> It's the largest and richest of the interior estates, and it's home to well over 200 slaves.<eos> It's well-defended.<eos> Until now, I haven't had the manpower to take it.
I'm a grown man ...<eos> - No way.<eos> You broke my cigarette.<eos> Really?<eos> You just threw it out.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.<eos> With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years ... and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ... by my own flesh and blood.
Uh, yeah, it took me a while to figure it out.<eos> At first I thought it was like the Norwegians, right?<eos> But then I noticed how he moves his cards when he's sorting.<eos> The first card he moves indicates the suit.<eos> If he moves it all the way to the left, it's spades.
It was our intersection.<eos> The accident happened at the same intersection.<eos> I said I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I thought you called about the stop sign.<eos> We don't know that's what caused it.
I'll come back.<eos> No, no, stay.<eos> You can help.<eos> Do you know how to tap a keg?<eos> Every guy's like, let's get a keg, and when it's time to tap it...
So, are there any dinner plans happening, or...?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Get me a beer.<eos> If you're hungry, babe, I'll give you a twenty, you can go get us a pizza.<eos> We could have an actual delivery boy come and bring it.
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> This couldn't wait till after school?<eos> Copy this tape.<eos> I'll get it from you after homeroom.
We all let her walk away.<eos> She walked out of school... went home... and put some things in order.<eos> She returned her uniform to the Crestmont, where I worked with her.<eos> She didn't say anything.<eos> She dropped it on the counter and walked away.
Yes, Master.<eos> Yeah boy!<eos> Duck!<eos> The mortal has gifts.<eos> And when I eat her whole, I will absorb her power and use it as I wish.
Jared, get the hell up!<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Can I, um...<eos> Can I have my stick back, please?<eos> Someone gave it to me.
No.<eos> Well, can I just --<eos> If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you?<eos> No!<eos> We have a drop today, but I can miss it.
She's carrying the future.<eos> You're right.<eos> I knew how this was gonna end.<eos> C'mon.<eos> Layin' your ass on the line for someone else, tearing' it to shreds for 'em --
I'll find him there and secure his assistance.<eos> I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.<eos> We are so very close to winning this war and finally bringing Nassau out of the dark.<eos> But I fear we cannot complete the victory on our own.<eos> We're going to need help, and this is the only way I know how to get it.
I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.<eos> We are so very close to winning this war and finally bringing Nassau out of the dark.<eos> But I fear we cannot complete the victory on our own.<eos> We're going to need help, and this is the only way I know how to get it.<eos> You and I both know that there are men on both sides of this war whose identities are so enmeshed in this conflict that they are more afraid of ending it than they are of losing it.
Is Flint?<eos> This war may feel over, but as long as we're all free, it's far from it.<eos> And if somehow we prevail in Nassau, what happens to former friends who've since aligned themselves so warmly with the governor?<eos> I've come to offer you a chance to earn back our friendship.<eos> Or, more specifically, to buy it back.
Am I in it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it about my life?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just give it to me.
Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!
I've got meetings this afternoon all the way up to the director, and all anyone will want to know is how that shitbag who we had in lockup got released to the streets.<eos> So, what are you gonna tell them?<eos> Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released.<eos> So I need to know-- That recording.<eos> Where did you get it?
Open the fucking door!<eos> ...from dozens of arrests made in connection with the assassination attempt on the President earlier this month.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people, that our Democracy is strong and resilient and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
Came by to pay my respects.<eos> He was friends with Michael.<eos> Hey, John, I read your book.<eos> - You did? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.
- You did? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> Y'all have a nice day.<eos> I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's gonna have to wait for you to come home tonight because, uh, you're on duty.<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Good.<eos> Cruiser one's got 'roo brains all over it, so give it a wash, will ya?
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.<eos> I'm actually glad you called.<eos> Could you send a photocopy of the book back to me? - I...<eos> I gave the original...<eos> - I threw it away.
Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?
I think you wanna be Jesus Christ fucking Superstar because it makes you feel important.<eos> Like it?<eos> I fucking love it!<eos> It's riveting!<eos> I've read it fucking cover to fucking cover!
And we're immensely grateful for that, Laurie.<eos> - Oh, you're immensely grateful?<eos> - Yes. But with all due respect, I'm not sure you entirely grasp what's happening here.<eos> Okay, uh, three years ago, my ex-husband experienced severe delusions and tried to kill himself.<eos> And instead of acknowledging his mental illness, you turned it into fucking scripture.
She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.
I... I think I'll take them up on it.<eos> This is a distraction.<eos> We need to focus on Kevin now.<eos> Where's my book?<eos> I threw it overboard.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
I stopped for myself.<eos> It's an incredibly selfdestructive habit.<eos> That's what makes it so cool.<eos> My lighter?<eos> Can I have it back, please?
Can I have it back, please?<eos> You said you quit.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Then you don't need it.<eos> Please give it back.
The ones you lost, like my mom and sister?<eos> I don't know, Ben.<eos> Like, maybe you get to say the things you meant to say - when they were around.<eos> - Or maybe this life's all you got.<eos> So maybe you shouldn't waste it with what-ifs.
It's an androgen booster.<eos> Which would inhibit the entactogens.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's the opposite of something like DMT.<eos> Blocking empathic synaptic connection, rather than exciting it.
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.<eos> I miss them.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss my life.<eos> I'm trying to get it back.
That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - We all forget things sometimes.<eos> No, the combo is a mashup of the girls' birthdays.<eos> I remember the day we chose it.
Well, the place is cleaned daily, isn't it?<eos> Usually, but we've been a bit short-handed this last month.<eos> So how many people used cubicle two after Miss Palfrey died?<eos> Nobody.<eos> We shut it up, out of respect.
In confidence.<eos> Did he say it was off the record?<eos> I shouldn't have to, but it's beside the point.<eos> There are things that could only have come from my notebook.<eos> Are you accusing Miss Knight of stealing it?
- Their name was King.<eos> - How does that get you to Castle?<eos> What he wrote on the wall.<eos> Rook takes Knight.<eos> Rook is the proper name for the chess piece, only some people call it a Castle.
Hey, Hodgins, slow down, man.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope. I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
I'm wondering if it has something to do with the fact that Mayor Richards applied for planning permission to build a hotel on this very beach.<eos> And what might this have to do with Stephen Langham?<eos> You may not have noticed, Officer Myers, but this beach sits at the foot of the volcano.<eos> And this land was previously designated exclusively to the observatory for research purposes.<eos> Until Richards bought it?
Did you tell her that this was your business?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> It must be my natural aura of authority and knowledge.<eos> Well, you can take your aura and shove it right up...
- I called you last night.<eos> - Oh, I was busy.<eos> What's up?<eos> - The game board.<eos> When exactly did we decide to move it to my house?
Well, technically, there's no 'D' in anonymous but, whatever.<eos> I get your point.<eos> Are you sure that it's legit?<eos> The post has been re-blogged at least 500 times in the last half hour.<eos> I mean, what if Claudia Greco actually reads it.
What is it?<eos> It's you.<eos> You mean, you guys have been sitting on this...<eos> The game showed up a couple of days after the blind school.<eos> We've been hiding it at Spencer's.
Please.<eos> You are standing on quick sand.<eos> The more you struggle, the faster it's gonna pull you under.<eos> I'm offering you a rope.<eos> Take it.
Because there's a second book.<eos> One that was done much later.<eos> It turned the idea of vengeance into a game.<eos> A game?<eos> But I came back tonight because I didn't want whoever sent that note to have it.
Ali's baby.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> They put it back.
And I figured that's what you're shredding.<eos> After the cops left, I took the shredder bag and I dumped it in the composter just to be on the safe side.<eos> How did you know?<eos> The other night, after you fell asleep.<eos> I... found it...
The girls are just easy targets.<eos> Please, look me in the eye and tell me that Hanna is not in any kind of trouble.<eos> She's not.. In trouble.<eos> Sheila, thatthat swing has been hanging from that tree since we bought the house.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to take it down.
Well, think again.<eos> Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police.<eos> You're gonna tell them how you made everybody's life a living hell.<eos> But first, we're gonna pick up the game just so they can see your handy work.<eos> I don't have it anymore.

We here at Fillmore-Graves do not plan on going gently into that good night.<eos> What do you plan on doing?<eos> Well, for a start, we're well-armed and well-trained.<eos> We're also the proud owners of the formula for Super Max.<eos> No one else gets it.
It was anorexia, wasn't it?<eos> She was 14. This is the last place I remember seeing her happy.<eos> Right, well, how many of these have you taken?<eos> I came to collect her one Sunday, messing about in that old truck.<eos> Pretending to drive it.
I'm not buying that peace and Harmony crap.<eos> Don't you wanna get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I have to learn how to control my power first.<eos> And it's a relief to be in a place where I don't have to keep it a secret.
1912. Yeah. Belonged to grammie Davenport.<eos> She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And mom read it to me.
Because as much as I would love to, that ship has sailed.<eos> We're never getting them back, regardless.<eos> Oh, I doubt we could even get in the door over there.<eos> Chuck, if that tape is useless in a court of law and no help in the court of public opinion, what's the point?<eos> Because I can't think of a single use for it.
I, uh... I got that internship.<eos> What internship?<eos> To work with undocumented immigrants?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You got it?
Oh, we have evidence...<eos> A mountain of it...<eos> And it all points to Annalise Keating.<eos> Atwood's lying.<eos> They have evidence against Frank, and if I can find it, I can get Annalise released.
That doesn't mean that one of them - was killing Wes.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Yes!<eos> 'Cause I'm about to have proof.<eos> Oliver kept a copy of Annalise's phone and has been going through it.
You don't believe me, I don't care.<eos> Why were you in New York yesterday?<eos> You're following me now?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
So what are our options?<eos> Take it to trial. Expensive.<eos> And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<eos> Not my first choice or yours, I imagine.<eos> The firm could choose to buy me out for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even... Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?<eos> No matter how good they try to be,<eos> Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Like a real-life Fault in Our Stars.<eos> That's not the plot of that book at all.<eos> - Really?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.
Let's go.<eos> You know that if you touch that sword, he can destroy the entire downworld, including Simon.<eos> No, Valentine needs an energy source.<eos> He needs lightning.<eos> He's got it.
I don't know.<eos> I just had this old piece of wood.<eos> I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Uh, I gave it
And I could not have been prouder.<eos> My son honored that commitment.<eos> He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.<eos> Wear it with pride.
Is that what you came here to tell me, or are you just wasting time?<eos> See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.
See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.<eos> Others will embrace it, even revel in it, like you.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?
Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.
Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.<eos> I don't like it, but okay.<eos> We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.<eos> We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.<eos> He dumped it there for us to find.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miller:<eos> I need these scientists alive!<eos> Nothing happens to this guy!<eos> The protomolecule wasn't sent here by accident.<eos> If we master it, we can apply it.
Crows Wood.<eos> Well, you might bring me back some mushrooms while you're there!<eos> You know, this is a Hundred Acre Wood.<eos> We've as much chance of finding a bear of very little brain.<eos> And even if she had a bag, maybe the murderer stole it?
- Oh, that's right.<eos> Well, speaking of President Laura Montez, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Tibet.<eos> Unprecedented.<eos> - What did you think of her speech? - Ugh.<eos> I didn't really get a chance to see it because I was...
I know.<eos> But that doesn't mean there isn't one.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I knew where the line was tonight, Alfred.<eos> I didn't cross it.
You must be the first person in history to go on a killing spree in order to find a life coach.<eos> Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.<eos> No.<eos> A good riddle reveals the asker.<eos> To solve it is to solve the mystery of the person posing it.
Ballistics came back negative.<eos> No match.<eos> But there were microscopic tears along the entry wound, made postmortem.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another one.
When I find out what you did, I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.<eos> And I'm gonna enjoy it.<eos> Jim, hey.<eos> Where's the riddle?<eos> Me and Lucius took a crack at it, but maybe you'll have better luck.
Uh, well, due to circumstances totally beyond our control, the owl went kaboom.<eos> But if we could reassemble the owl that you stole, maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.<eos> Do you still have the pieces?<eos> You're having a laugh, ain't you?<eos> After all the bloody trouble I went through to get it, of course I do.
Right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Wait, this is the owl?<eos> What the hell happened to it?<eos> Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?
Here we go.<eos> Wait, this is the owl?<eos> What the hell happened to it?<eos> Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?<eos> Can you put it back together again?
No, the reason that she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I didn't have sex with her.<eos> Yeah, I don't believe you.<eos> No one says no to a girl like that.<eos> I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, uh, as for your package, Burt...<eos> I don't have it.
Get your men together.<eos> We're gonna take him out.<eos> It's a beautiful song.<eos> It's haunting.<eos> Yeah, I wrote it for her.
Say to hell with it. Why don't we just take a page right out of Barry andand Michelle's book?<eos> I want to see the world with you, Cook.<eos> I want to write a new page in our story, far away from the backbiting and the drama.<eos> You created that drama by pitting your sons against each other.<eos> I created it, but together we can uncreate it.
I won't let any of you die.<eos> And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves.<eos> You mean too much to me, to everything.<eos> Yeah, you made a deal.<eos> You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.
My name -- my name is...<eos> My....<eos> My name is -- is...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.
I don't think we've seen anything like this before.<eos> Sing about it!<eos> ♪ You're a tasty treat You're a tasty treat ♪<eos> The sturdy oak barrier!<eos> They've broken through it!
"used by so many writers, it is a tiresome cliche,"<eos> while "meanwhile back at the ranch" is a phrase used to link what is going on in one part of a story with another part, and has nothing to do with cows or creamy salad dressing.<eos> When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"<eos> what I mean is, meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room, the adults were having an adult conversation.<eos> If we place the peaches in a line leading up to the cage, perhaps the snake will follow the trail and then we can trap it inside.
Really.<eos> Remember that PEM?<eos> Slow.<eos> Polymer electrolyte membrane.<eos> You got it for me online.
I went after him all the way across the border into...<eos> Pay the fuck attention!<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I find him at his sister's house.<eos> And he comes at me with a hockey stick, and I see this bat and I grab it.
I do the math.<eos> He's got a lot more reach with a hockey stick than I do with this bat.<eos> So, huh, here's the funny part.<eos> You know what I did?<eos> I threw it at him.
Now, given your ties to the community, I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?
I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?<eos> Because he knew Ernie, bless him, would tell me about it and I would come over to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
No, nothing like that.<eos> He backed me into a cabinet.<eos> Did he have a weapon?<eos> Well, as I mentioned, he used a fireplace poker to break into my desk.<eos> But he never would have used it on me.
- Yes, I do, Howard.<eos> - You know what I'm doing in there? Take a guess.<eos> I'm doing damage control.<eos> And I'm doing it three meals a day for the past two weeks with every one of our clients.<eos> I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
Okay, if I had a football game tomorrow night, would you stop me from going?<eos> No, because football you understand.<eos> You respect.<eos> But my music, since I told you about it, you don't care.<eos> You don't take it seriously.
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no.<eos> However you're rationalizing what you're doing with Archie's dad, I don't want any part of it.<eos> It's so perfect when you play it.<eos> We wrote a good song, Archie.<eos> I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
- You okay with that?<eos> - -Dad, I drive a glorified bike and you just gave me a truck!<eos> I'm... I'm great!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you! You can put it to good use and take Charlie out for a nice dinner.
I needed to get a book.<eos> Well, here is the only book you'll ever need to read.<eos> All of the smart young men are mad over it.<eos> I've, uh...<eos> I've read it twice.
I handled it a lot.<eos> Yes, I thought about that.<eos> However, there is one place where it would have been impossible for you to leave your thumb print.<eos> Under the stamp.<eos> We had to lift it off very carefully, but there's one small part of that stamp where the adhesive didn't quite take.
Is there anything else I can do for you before I go?<eos> I want to get rid of the pram.<eos> Kevin's not a baby any more.<eos> I was only pushing him round in it to keep it warm for... .. the next one.<eos> Now I need someone to take it away.
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?<eos> 'The brain?<eos> 'Where in the body does it hide?<eos> 'How is it clothed... and how might we protect it?
Since when does my mom hang out with your stepdad?<eos> Something's amiss.<eos> I hereby call to order this meeting of the shadow wedding planners.<eos> As you all know, it is our sworn duty to secretly control every aspect of this wedding.<eos> Together, we will transform it from a young cool person's thing into a normal traditional wedding, where everything is normal and nice.
Near Ramadi.<eos> Special Forces.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Meadows had the tattoo.<eos> You recognize it.
You have to embrace what you are.<eos> Have fun with Holden 2.0.<eos> But first, turn on the damn lamp.<eos> Okay.<eos> - At least I turned it on.
Look, I just want to replace this card.<eos> Do we really have to do...<eos> Sorry, I lost my wallet.<eos> Buy the boat.<eos> Buy it and we'll take a trip.
You know, our moms talked less and less as the years went on.<eos> But, um, there was one night I'll never forget.<eos> Your mom called my mom the night you were born.<eos> And they talked for a little while, and then, uh, when my mom hung up, she was... she was so happy.<eos> She dug out this, uh... this cupcake. It must have been a week old, and, uh, she... she looked for a candle, she couldn't find one, so she got a match, and she stuck it in.
But, um, there was one night I'll never forget.<eos> Your mom called my mom the night you were born.<eos> And they talked for a little while, and then, uh, when my mom hung up, she was... she was so happy.<eos> She dug out this, uh... this cupcake.

- Don't mind if I do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing.<eos> Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm.<eos> An offer to buy it. I've accepted.
But he's going to find out.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then we'll have it and Cortazar will help us understand it.<eos> And the nightmare starts over.<eos> If the Belt has the protomolecule, no one will ever use it against us again.
Jacob's asleep.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you wanna see what Audrey and your sisters did to my fucking car?<eos> They keyed it.
Otherwise, this would've been a lot worse.<eos> Roger that.<eos> There's your C-4, Lieutenant.<eos> We believe this large flower vase set beside your father's grave was the housing for the bomb.<eos> And your ex-husband placed it at the cemetery.
- Ex-wife, sir. - Technicality.<eos> And Ortiz left a bomb behind in her father's house.<eos> - Maybe to blow her up.<eos> - The bomb was marked with blood that couldn't have been there from the gunshot wound.<eos> Why leave a bomb behind to kill your wife, and then do stuff to it that means we have to collect it as evidence?
Not the work of a trained Marine.<eos> And shallow for a guy the size of Ortiz.<eos> - Very shallow.<eos> - But wouldn't Ortiz's attorney been all over this information?<eos> I'm sure, if his public defender had ever received it.
 Red.  Red.<eos>  So make it so.<eos> Change it.<eos> Turn the wall red, Mary.<eos> Just turn it red.
- You stole my turntable.<eos> - You weren't using it.<eos> - It needed a cartridge.<eos> - Which I bought.<eos> After you stole it!
We don't need her nonsense, Hap.<eos> She could be a blessin' in disguise.<eos> She stole your car. Did you forget that?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - And she sold it to a chop shop.
Seems like an odd coincidence.<eos> You think I'd try to get my own son arrested?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> Something odd was happening in your division, and I need to know what it was before I hand you a badge and a gun.<eos> The moment Phyllis died, I knew we had a leak, but finding it wasn't my job.
I want to know what you're doing to find his partner, the one who escaped.<eos> Let's not make this bigger than it is.<eos> We'll cover up the crash site, I'll tell a convincing story, and by next week, nobody in my bloc will even remember what happened.<eos> Recent reports from IGA intelligence indicate that there is a growing Resistance movement outside the Colony.<eos> What if this was an attempt to recover our host's missing gauntlet and take it beyond our Walls?
Rumor is I'm a bit of a snorer, so if it gets vexatious, just give me a nudge.<eos> You expecting someone?<eos> Just the stars.<eos> You ever consider that if the Good Lord's gone missing, maybe He's got a reason?<eos> Yeah, and I want to hear it.
We just saved your life.<eos> Call it even.<eos> I know we've had our differences.<eos> But if you find the protomolecule on Ganymede Station...<eos> I sure as hell ain't gonna bring it back to you.
I can't remember.<eos> Something to do with the Bram, maybe, the stream that runs through the valley.<eos> So why did he end up with a tarot card in his pocket?<eos> I did a reading for him.<eos> And he took it.
Nick, maybe she's right.<eos> - You know, maybe...<eos> - Look.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.<eos> So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.
- You know, maybe...<eos> - Look.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.<eos> So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.<eos> Well, there's no risk for you down here, so I don't see how it would hurt to put it away for a while... if you can.
Now grab your stuff, and let's get the hell out of here.<eos> These are the symbols I saw on the dead guy's face in hell, or wherever it was he took me.<eos> And everything else is what Diana saw.<eos> Did the Crusaders make these marks on the cloth, or was it already there when they got to it?<eos> Well, I don't know if the cloth was with the stick when they found it, but none of this was visible with spectral imaging.
But it's like... you get used to carrying your weapon, and when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing - a piece of yourself.<eos> - I know, but we have a license for that.<eos> I try to stop thinking about it, but it's not working out so well.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I put it back in the tunnel.
- I know, but we have a license for that.<eos> I try to stop thinking about it, but it's not working out so well.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I put it back in the tunnel.<eos> Don't you think you should put it someplace a little further out?
- Ooh, what's happening?<eos> - Now, ma'am.<eos> Dan Wells, Portland PD!<eos> We're gonna need you to open the door.<eos> Dan, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
Let's have it.<eos> Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine was working late at the lab last night when something went terribly wrong.<eos> The terribly wrong part is in here.<eos> Doesn't appear anything was taken.<eos> Her purse is by the door, probably where she dropped it, unopened.
- The skull guy.<eos> - Right.<eos> So it's logical that she's the connection.<eos> Maybe the blood on the mirror prevented something worse from happening.<eos> Probably a good idea not to clean it off, then.
She just said it might be dangerous.<eos> Nick!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> So you felt the arm come through the mirror in the spice shop?<eos> I saw it first, and then I felt it.
We used to make this strange goop.<eos> "Humano-Reptiliana: Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle Di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.<eos> Grimms in the South used to use it to lure out Galenchidas from the swampy marshes, and catch them and chop off their heads.
Could you tell more about blood magic?<eos> 'Cause it says in one of your mother's books that blood is associated with crossing over in death, like slain warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in its final state... human sacrifice on the altar... and sometimes blood is used as currency.<eos> - Eve, slow down.<eos> Blood magic is very dangerous.<eos> We would only need to use it to get to the other side.
We need to figure out what the hell is going on with this other place.<eos> There might be only one way.<eos> Which is?<eos> To go there.<eos> We have to find this thing and kill it.
I was the only one he didn't kill or couldn't kill... I don't know.<eos> Bullets don't have any effect on him.<eos> I still have the stick.<eos> Maybe that's why I'm not dead.<eos> I tried to use it on Wu and Hank, but it didn't do anything.
- This can't be happening.<eos> - He let you live again?<eos> It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.
What the hell is going on?<eos> You can have it.<eos> No, Nick!<eos> You can't give it to this lying son of a bitch devil.<eos> If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?
You can have it.<eos> No, Nick!<eos> You can't give it to this lying son of a bitch devil.<eos> If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?<eos> Why is he asking, when he can just take it from you?
What is he not telling you?<eos> You might want to ask your children what to do.<eos> Nick, you can't give it to him.<eos> I want the people I love to live again.<eos> - Take it!
She felt it, too.<eos> We are all descendents of the first Grimm.<eos> That stick you found... the one our Grimm ancestors buried...<eos> Is part of a much greater power.<eos> Guard it well.
I went out to get a terry cloth robe and there was this crowd and I asked them where Nordstrom's was and then the next thing I know, they dyed my thumb and an old lady who smelled like cumin wouldn't stop hugging me!<eos> - Mine smelled like paprika.<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> We cannot let anyone see this.<eos> I can't afford to lose this job, Gary, but I can't afford to keep it either.
Sorry. I know, I'm annoying.<eos> No. You're a genius.<eos> Talia. You've known gina porter for a while.<eos> Does she like music?<eos> No. No, she loves it.
But I'd scream right back at him.<eos> It was just that kind of thing, you know?<eos> He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on.<eos> A friendship like that?<eos> I don't how to describe it.
- you're back.<eos> - You better believe I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing<eos> - There's really not much to find, Mr. specter.<eos> - Well, let me lay it out for you.<eos> Velocity data solutions stole your technology, and they're rushing it to market, so you want to orchestrate a takeover and get back what's yours.
- Could be.<eos> It's got a rental QR code.<eos> Probably got some kinda tracking software on it, right?<eos> - That was my line.<eos> - Track it down, and find it fast.
People with broken legs.<eos> Abigail would remind you that money cannot fill the Wellspring.<eos> Without it, Fillory withers.<eos> Okay, well, we talked about this.<eos> When someone drops a log at a public pool, you just send a kid with a net to fish it out.
How did this happen?<eos> I have an idea...<eos> to help you.<eos> - Like a loophole? - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're gonna ironically abandon me here to go find it.
I shouldn't have told your mom that we're trying to have a baby.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The techs have uncovered an encrypted e-mail exchange on Todd Curry's computer, something either Curry or the person Curry was communicating with didn't want seen.<eos> They're working to crack it.
Yeah. I was looking for April.<eos> She's on a break right now.<eos> But I can answer any question you might have.<eos> Yeah. My wife, kate, has this necklace, and, I think it was a gift from her mother.<eos> And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.
And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.<eos> And I know she'd want to have it with her. I just...<eos> I understand.<eos> It can be in her hand through the surgery.<eos> I can make sure April gets it.
There's also a new therapy called tms, But I'd probably recommend you going. The traditional routes first.<eos> Tms?<eos> Transcranial magnetic stimulation.<eos> It's so far fda approved only for depression, But there is anecdotal evidence. That it can benefit people with spectrum disorders.<eos> I only mention it because we have a machine. Here at the hospital.
Just in case.<eos> Hey, sarah, You... you got a second?<eos> I heard that, Most of the psych residents get therapy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you tried it?
You put too much faith in them.<eos> Man is the superior machine.<eos> And I... am the superior man.<eos> I'm told you refuse to talk and that you welcome pain.<eos> And I love to make others feel it using the old ways.
- Do it!<eos> Okay.<eos> - That's a lot of blood.<eos> - Did you cut the radial artery?<eos> I was trying very hard to miss it. I...
Sir, the plates are switched, the transponder's toast.<eos> There's no way hydra can track the bus.<eos> Fast work.<eos> What's with the sat-radio?<eos> Well, I noticed the bus had a comms system, so I decrypted it and synched it up with this.
we need to be ready for anything.<eos> On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.
- I need the Darkhold.<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.
- What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.<eos> I want to use it as bait.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Did you sleep in here?<eos> Just getting a feel for my new office.<eos> You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?<eos> You put a bike rack in here, your first pro Bono, you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.
Thanks, Katrina.<eos> You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work.<eos> All I'm saying is I think you're rushing it.<eos> And I'm saying that, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave their statue up in the square.<eos> You tear it the hell down.
We took liberties.<eos> We guessed.<eos> You were right, William.<eos> He found a man with similar features and killed him.<eos> So he removed the bullet from his own shoulder and placed it in the corpse.
Jeff!<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.
Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.<eos> No, I didn't bring my car.<eos> You and Switchblade Sally ditched it at the front gate.
On the beach -- in the distance.<eos> You can't hear it?<eos> Listen!<eos> And that's as loud as your cousin can get it?<eos> - He can't bring it out any more?
You'd literally be left with nothing -- no house, no fancy motorbike.<eos> You had to think quickly.<eos> You knew where Nadine's car was.<eos> You also knew she kept a gun in her car.<eos> So, after the murder... you place the weapon and Julie's bloodied scarf in Nadine's car before pushing it into the sea.
! - Be nice, Suzy.<eos> Never know his name.<eos> White, brown hair, had a bad leg.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He broke it.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.<eos> Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.<eos> You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.<eos> I've never seen that book before.<eos> One of your coppers must have planted it.
- That sounds wonderful.<eos> So, can I leave you children alone a few more hours?<eos> He wants to take me out for a fried-egg sandwich.<eos> - What? - I met a man, a gentleman, at the town market and petting zoo.<eos> He has had a troubled past, and we're going to talk about it over a fried-egg sandwich.
Well, that should get my former teammates' attention, and when they travel back in time to save him, I'll be there waiting for them with open arms.<eos> Well, not too open, I hope.<eos> No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.<eos> I have no lingering attachment.<eos> In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
Winn's device worked.<eos> But Supergirl stayed up there.<eos> Your time is up, Agent Danvers.<eos> The positron cannon is ready to fire.<eos> You need to use it.
Can you hear that music?<eos> Is that coming from in here?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can still hear it. Can you hear it?
My brain's overloading.<eos> - Why a phone box?<eos> - I told you.<eos> Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?
Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?<eos> Why do you like it?<eos> Who said I like it?<eos> You kept it.
Therefore, if light is only a wave, then...<eos> Space is not empty?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So just as sound waves travel through air, light waves must travel through some sort of medium in space.<eos> Scientists called it the ether, an invisible but all-encompassing substance pervading the universe.
You know that?<eos> The Central Bank Governor told me.<eos> Really?<eos> The Nigerian oil industry is weaker than numbers suggest. Much weaker.<eos> A strong gust of wind could blow it over.
A couple of times, I've done a guy a favour. He comes in here...<eos> With an envelope or something and I stash it in a church. And I call another guy and let him know it's there. Go on.<eos> About two weeks ago, I had to leave an envelope...<eos> With a letter to a pow. Call him...<eos> Let him know. You have another package for him, he needs to get it today.
The last two terms.<eos> I copied them for you.<eos> They're yours to keep.<eos> I hope... they will undo some of the damage that I have done.<eos> And... if you would like my help, then I would love nothing more than to give it.
What if, instead of studying gases, we studied a cup of coffee?<eos> You really must sleep, Albert.<eos> Jacobus v'ant Hoff's Nobel paper from 1901:<eos> Particles in a solution behave like a gas.<eos> When sugar dissolves in coffee, water surrounds glucose and tears it from the sugar crystal, correct?
Unless...<eos> It's not Maxwell who gets it between the eyes. It's Newton.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Time is not absolute.<eos> Holy hell. I'm writing the paper, Michele. I dare them to ignore it.
So you're saying he might have ruffled feathers.<eos> I don't know for sure, but...<eos> I just wasn't listening.<eos> I should have sat him down, but I... .. I encouraged him.<eos> Right, every story he worked on, whether you ran it or not, I'll need copies.
Christ, I barely want that.<eos> I mean, the other part, you know, like, what I am.<eos> What, the... the vampire part?<eos> The not dying part.<eos> If you could have that, would you want it?
Consider it done, sir.<eos> - Call off the missile.<eos> - Call...<eos> It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it. - Whe...
It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it. - Whe...<eos> I...<eos> What do we do? Wh...<eos> Where do we send it?
Please, Emma, get us out of here.<eos> I'll keep trying.<eos> I promise.<eos> You still have the SIM card?<eos> Can you give it to Yusef's nephew, the one you met?
Close.<eos> Ah, you'll be fine.<eos> Drinks?<eos> Would you like to see Linda's room?<eos> Oh... I'd like to show it to you.
Shoes you stole from Devon's house, totally obstructing his positive energy.<eos> Anyway, this witness just picked you out of a photo lineup.<eos> And there's this.<eos> The malt liquor bottle you were chugging when we first met.<eos> It was still in the trash where I put it, and guess whose DNA is all over it?
Enjoy.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey, man, get the...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Thanks for the help, guys. Really appreciate it.
What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Everything, apparently.<eos> Where'd you get a goddamn gun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He brought it.
My God, you do not eat at all?<eos> Nobody eats with this war.<eos> You need to rest, you are exhausted.<eos> The solution of relativity is very close.<eos> I almost touched it.
Albert.<eos> Nobel laureate in chemistry.<eos> This is something.<eos> I'm not a genius, like you, Albert.<eos> I was only given a problem, and I found a way to solve it.
I have an offer for you.<eos> I can not afford to speak with him publicly.<eos> You can be sure of my prudence.<eos> Read the article with the exposure of relativity?<eos> I think you support it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein.<eos> The question was for your husband.<eos> How did you come to know Chaim Weizmann?<eos> It's all right, Chaim, you can admit you don't understand.<eos> Albert, you have been explaining general relativity for more than three hours, and I am fully convinced that you understand it.
Yes, but if we do, we cannot also know where that thing is.<eos> Does that sound logical to you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> And according to my esteemed colleague, the particle does not exist at all until we observe it.
But we can still measure the velocity of that second particle.<eos> And since they are both mathematically related, we can then determine the velocity of the first particle, so we'd know both its position and velocity without having to measure them both.<eos> Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disproved. With certainty.<eos> You are vanquished, sir.<eos> But... what if the act of measuring the first particle influenced the second, changed it somehow at the time it was measured?
Elsa had strategy.<eos> I am not Elsa.<eos> No, you certainly are not.<eos> The only thing you show enthusiasm for is keeping my pipe from me.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
- Albert, we've been down this road many times.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This is different.<eos> It seems that the more the rest of physics accepts my work, the more you resist it.
McKee.<eos> When you question the integrity of the Bureau's actions, you question the integrity of my actions.<eos> And such questions... they can get a man in a whole mess of trouble.<eos> Let Einstein speak out, and he'll be drowned by the patriotic citizens of this fine country.<eos> It takes a man a lifetime to build his reputation, and yet a mere moment to scuttle it.
Order shots.<eos> I will be back in a minute.<eos> -That's my song.<eos> -I know it's your song.<eos> -I love it.
I will be back in a minute.<eos> -That's my song.<eos> -I know it's your song.<eos> -I love it.<eos> -And you sing it so well.
Oof.<eos> Vincent has an agenda.<eos> Does she know?<eos> Rosie, show Mr. Dunbar Jr. to the door.<eos> Don't open it.
Now, isn't this a literary club?<eos> I've written a book...<eos> "Steady at the Helm."<eos> Sure.<eos> I tore through it in one sitting.
But I don't want to talk about this place. I want to hear about the world.<eos> Well... I'm having problems with that bond I bought upstate.<eos> I saw.<eos> Albany moved the gaming license.<eos> You trying to get it back?
Your armor's genetically locked, making it impossible for anyone else to use it.<eos> If you're wondering how I found you... No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I had a hunch the dormant Blink drive was emitting a subspace signal.<eos> The specific signature so we could shield against it.
- Their leader?<eos> - He's your friend?<eos> - I'm fond of him.<eos> Why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?<eos> I wanted to, but they entrusted me with their secret, and I didn't see any harm in keeping it.
It would take a highly advanced mind to even recognize it, and approximately 87,560 computational hours to decode.<eos> Ten years...<eos> - Give or take.<eos> - And yet... there are counterlogical aspects to the puzzle that would be best served by a more intuitive approach.<eos> So someone with both android logic and emotional reasoning could solve it faster?
Imagine them under threat.<eos> They turn to you but the odds seem hopeless until... you discover a piece of technology that could change everything.<eos> What would you do to get it?<eos> Anything.<eos> Now imagine you had this piece of technology, the means to save them, only to have someone take it from you.
Android, Five, how's it going down there?<eos> We've made several changes to the Blink Drive that I believe will overcome the damage done by the Ishida scientists.<eos> How will we know for sure?<eos> First, we'll run a full diagnostic, followed by a series of simulations.<eos> If the instability persists, we should be able to detect it, long before we attempt a first live test.
Oh, shit.<eos> [Two] So much for a walk in the park.<eos> What? This isn't my fault.<eos> She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.<eos> Evidently, when novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
I understand that.<eos> None of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.<eos> Take my life if you will.<eos> I offer it gladly, knowing that what I did was for the good of the Empire.
[Marcus] I'd say "the one and only," but lately, that doesn't seem to be the case.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Seem to be locked out of all the systems.<eos> Their android must've installed some kind of fail-safe.<eos> [Portia] I should be able to override it, but I'll need to do it on the bridge.
I know, that's terrible, isn't it?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> It's not easy being someone's entire world, you know?<eos> Why didn't you tell me when we were back on Hyperion8?<eos> What was I supposed to say? You used to have a happy family life, but you threw it away?
My crewman, Boone, when he came to, he said it was a gateway.<eos> He also said he could hear voices in his head.<eos> I think maybe he can.<eos> He's had those things in him before.<eos> We managed to get it out, but what if it affected him?
You can disarm the nuke before it hits.<eos> We've still got a crew member down there!<eos> We've got people down there, too, Raza, but it was an executive order...<eos> It's out of my hands.<eos> If you don't disarm the nuke, we'll have no choice but to take it out ourselves.
What is that?<eos> - Larry's skate wrench.<eos> - Right.<eos> I talked to my brother-cousin over at the police department, got it out of impound.<eos> Sorry, I tried to get your lip balm, but they blew it up.
- Here, come on.<eos> - Untie it, untie it.<eos> It's the water.<eos> Over the years, the water's been infused by the moissanite.<eos> You drink it, you grow your crops with it.
What was it?<eos> You used the protomolecule on children.<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> We made the protomolecule do what we wanted.<eos> We made it in our own image.
We'll see about that.<eos> There it is!<eos> In the Ag Dome.<eos> Ready PDCs. Fire control to me.<eos> Why kill it?
MCRN is securing a landing corridor for an inbound burner.<eos> Those scientists were packin' up the lab to leave with that thing.<eos> I'm guessin' that was their ride.<eos> They're not gonna be too happy when they find out their lab rat is loose.<eos> Even more reason to kill it now.
Absorbed instantly through the skin, without a trace.<eos> Cardiac arrest.<eos> An act of God.<eos> I mean, this stuff was staggeringly effective.<eos> But then, they banned it under the Brussels Act.

I have to go.<eos> Enjoy the scotch.<eos> Hall!<eos> Sandicot's not getting the gaming license.<eos> The commission went another way, gave it to a town in the Catskills.
If you cross him, he'll put a fucking ding in your universe.<eos> But these are all exaggerations, derivative.<eos> They don't limn the truth of an indefinable essence.<eos> They don't speak to my real feelings.<eos> It's no exaggeration to say that Bobby Axelrod is the man who gave me my life, or at least let me keep it.
- At the end of the year?<eos> Now. Mid-semester bonus.<eos> The real one's still coming.<eos> Should I move their desk closer to the bimah?<eos> Fitting for the new head of research who understands what the job entails and is willing to execute it.
That's why Mother sold my horse.<eos> - Okay. - Write that down.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Your dad sold it to get the IRS off of his back.
- Pretty please?<eos> - Well, when you say it like that.<eos> I wanna say something about my paella.<eos> Now, it is so good, when you taste it, what's gonna happen, Will?<eos> You're gonna wanna take it to a church and marry it, Rog.
Okay, wha... this!<eos> What do you want me to say, Selina?<eos> What do you want me to say, Tom, huh?<eos> That back when I was in the Senate, the only reason that I co-sponsored S-473 was because I had a crush on you?<eos> That when we were in Los Angeles and we walked out onto the stage to accept the nomination, and you grabbed my hand and you held it up high, and I was like, "Oh, my God, he's holding my hand."
But I wanna tell you this one particular story that's one of my favorite Southern memories.<eos> It's when my daddy first took me hunting for rabbits.<eos> And I gotta tell you, my rifle was bigger than I was.<eos> I was just a tiny, little thing.<eos> But the Second Amendment certainly did guarantee my right to use it.
I certainly don't need to apologize for anything.<eos> Okay, lookit, politicians borrow stuff all the time.<eos> - Personal stories?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I mean, you should be honored that I would think your story was special enough to even consider using it.
With Blaine, it took a couple of days.<eos> Got it.<eos> You know, I had this whole speech planned.<eos> It was funny and heartfelt, profound.<eos> But it feels like a waste if you're just gonna forget it anyway.
Struck me those kids would do anything to get out of the house.<eos> - I mean, Mia did come here fairly regular. - Yeah?<eos> Why was that?<eos> Mam and dad collected their rent in cash.<eos> She collected it so it wouldn't go through the books, you know.
Um, how does that bring them closure?<eos> It comes with a note saying she's dead.<eos> Look, nothing we can do will bring this poor girl back to life.<eos> I know, but-- Not even a voodoo priestess, flown here from Haiti at great expense, and then every year, on Grandma's birthday, they throw it your face!<eos> So the best thing we can do now is to fill this car to the rafters with dynamite and shove it over a cliff.
- Why are you doing this?<eos> God, they're doing a raid on our building.<eos> Come on, Professor, let's get out of here.<eos> No, the Lumen.<eos> The book'll be fine; they'll never find it.
Stay out of sight.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> I realize now that everything gained can just as easily be lost.<eos> The book is safe, Professor.<eos> We'll go back there and get it, as soon as we get out of this.
I think the time off did him some good.<eos> I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.<eos> I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days.<eos> You been working on this leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm left it off of Jane's body because it is a dud.
Stepulov's targeting Erin because I used his son as leverage.<eos> No, not just your daughter.<eos> There are hundreds of civilians in there, people from all over the country.<eos> It must have been his plan all along.<eos> And he gave us the time of the attack so he could call it off if his son lived, or not if he died...
The rack's fitted with a modified cell phone.<eos> An incoming call triggers the explosion.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> If I can kill the cell signal, there's no way to set off the bomb.<eos> 90 seconds, how do we stop it?
What's "the formula"?<eos> Okay, off the record, it's an old Daedalus tradition.<eos> It's a risk-reward algorithm we use to determine which risky activity is actually worth the risk.<eos> Cheating on tests, shoplifting... unprotected sex... you know, the fun stuff.<eos> But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.
Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.<eos> That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
Anyone gonna... you know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ron?<eos> Was it that bad?<eos> I have to say, when Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, opposite the girl who wrote it, I said to myself, "Ron, old boy", "you've won three Tony Awards, and here you are, directing a failed sitcom actor's vanity project."
Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play.<eos> It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good-- it is.<eos> But no one's gonna come see it, sir, unless you tell them to, so I am begging you, please... give us another chance.
See?<eos> Fresh meats that you could actually go and pick out the chicken.<eos> - He would kill the chicken...<eos> - What?<eos> ... defeather it, clean it, - and then wrap it up for you.
- All right, look, let's go over it.<eos> - Okay. Bartender's an old guy.<eos> He's not the sharpest.<eos> Every night at 8:30, he starts to close out at the end of his shift.<eos> He opens the register, takes the cash out so that Ray and his guys can come pick it up later.
No, I want to sing.<eos> Sometimes they'll make good decisions.<eos> It's just a meeting with a director, okay?<eos> It's not like I'm gonna get the part.<eos> Don't do that. I want you to get it.
Vallieres.<eos> His intelligence. Made us aware of a secret allied training facility. In canada known as camp x.<eos> Why didn't you approach anyone. With your plan to act as a triple agent?<eos> As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks.<eos> The safest action was to secure. As much intelligence as I could first, Then to bring it straight to berlin.
You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia?<eos> - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.<eos> That's the trick.<eos> The mind killer.<eos> Your disease convinces you, you don't have it.
Heard about that arm.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Sherman, don't jinx it.<eos> I got two more days before it's mine.<eos> In East Peck, if no one claims a body part within two weeks, you get to keep it.
Our situation isn't inbearable.<eos> It's unbearable.<eos> Aunt Josephine left us in the care of Captain Sham, and I don't know what we can do about it.<eos> I wish we'd never read Mr. Poe that note.<eos> Then we could've torn it up and forged a new one in her handwriting that didn't mention...
Count Olaf didn't have to break into Aunt Josephine's house.<eos> He was in disguise and Aunt Josephine fell for it, hook, line and sinker.<eos> Please, there's no time for fishing jokes.<eos> There's a very simple way to tell who wrote this note.<eos> We simply have to compare it to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.
1957.<eos> Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...
The painting is en route from Austria.<eos> But the auction is tomorrow.<eos> It wasn't going to auction.<eos> We had a private collector interested.<eos> But if there is more than one party interested, I have a financial obligation to put it up...
So we steal it from them before the auction?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Olivia could get suspicious.<eos> She needs to buy the painting, and never know we were here.<eos> Okay, we just need to figure out another way to get it.
We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.<eos> I don't like vodka...<eos> It burns my throat.<eos> Haha! I never liked it either.<eos> But since I'm working in poland, I learned to love it.
Shall we begin?<eos> While you wait, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife?<eos> I don't believe I have.<eos> One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap.<eos> Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.
You had access to that chip.<eos> My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.
My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.<eos> I think you sold it to them.
- Names are unimportant now.<eos> What matters is that we both have what the other wants.<eos> So I propose a trade.<eos> If you want to see your colleague alive again, bring our system to Cornerstone Park, east entrance, in the next 30 minutes.<eos> And take care to bring it all, or for every piece missing, I will extract a piece of Agent Navabi.
Father Brown did it.<eos> Katherine warned me about him.<eos> Said he's a corrupt, evil, selfish...<eos> Father Brown is the best man I have ever met.<eos> And if you say one more word against him, I will take your silly little sign and insert it into a place where no-one can read it. Huh!
Why was he digging a hole?<eos> He was burying something.<eos> A wooden box.<eos> Beautiful carved thing, it was.<eos> Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to go and then I dug it up.
Look at it.<eos> I can dream, can't I?<eos> I don't have long.<eos> The inspector will wonder where I've got to.<eos> A man was seen burying it in the woods yesterday morning.
Hello, I'm Bunty.<eos> What a darling little thing you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Oh, well, you're welcome to borrow it any time you like.
What a darling little thing you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Oh, well, you're welcome to borrow it any time you like.<eos> You should wear it to one of my soirees.
- Is that your memoirs?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I finished my book.<eos> It's a story about my sestras.<eos> I call it, Orphan Black.
What the hell happened to me?<eos> I promise, I'm going to tell you everything, but it's gonna have to be in person.<eos> Roman, look in your pocket.<eos> There's a coin in there, it's a very special coin.<eos> I gave it to you when we were little.
It's mostly just vascular repair.<eos> I'll look for organ damage.<eos> I'll take care of the limb.<eos> I'm worried about that right leg.<eos> - She tore it up pretty badly. - Mm-hmm.
Well, a neighbor called 911, and then the firefighters broke the gate down.<eos> Listen, they saved your life.<eos> Damn razor wire.<eos> I got most of it down, and then I fell off the ladder into the whole mess of it.<eos> You were taking it down?
Listen, Dr. NotGrey, I don't care what you've done.<eos> Dr. Grey found my cancer.<eos> She told me about it.<eos> She held my hand while I bawled about it.<eos> She told me how she was gonna take it out.
I'm sure there's more to it than that.<eos> Well, it's not right, what Bailey did.<eos> You can't just throw anybody in as Chief of General Surgery.<eos> Keps is good, but Grey put in the time for that job, okay?<eos> She deserves it.
At the expense of her own?<eos> She came in here perfectly healthy.<eos> If you found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> - The kidney would already be in him.<eos> - Yeah, but it isn't, and if we don't put it in someone soon, it's gonna die an no one gets it, so who's it going to?
You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery,"<eos> but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.<eos> Yes, I took your father's name, but it's what I did with it. It's what I made with it.
In a few hours you're gonna get a call from this firm offering you a good deal on the Kendall brutality case.<eos> Yes, I don't disagree.<eos> I, um, I just want you to know, there's an associate here who found the key piece of evidence that the case turned on, and she was just fired.<eos> You left this.<eos> Give it to someone who needs it.
The interviewer merely tries to ease the way for a liar to admit the truth, that's all.<eos> So you tend to minimize the crime?<eos> Yes.<eos> According to Mr. Diyardian's own testimony, he made it clear to the suspect that the theft was not a big matter.<eos> They just wanted to solve it.
Your Honor, I'd like to cross-examine.<eos> This is not a full trial.<eos> This is merely a motion to dismiss.<eos> Yeah, I know, but this information just came into our hands.<eos> We were hoping to use it at trial, but... we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we could ask it now.
Amazing.<eos> Phil fainted.<eos> - Claire.<eos> - Oh, come on, they were gonna find out.<eos> I'm not spending $15 on this picture and not show it to everyone.
This contract.<eos> This acknowledgment of the transfer of 12 eggs from Lake Drive.<eos> The Genome labs acknowledgment that they transferred one egg to you.<eos> And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.
The Genome labs acknowledgment that they transferred one egg to you.<eos> And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.<eos> Regrettably, here's the problem...<eos> You've already destroyed it?
The, uh, problem, Laura, is... the last remaining ova has already been fertilized.<eos> - By who?<eos> - That's the question.<eos> We don't know.<eos> We located it at Chicago Poly-Tech, in the genetics lab, and we're bringing them to court.
Thanks.<eos> It was fantastic.<eos> You were fantastic.<eos> Did you, did you see his face when you made him read the date?<eos> You made him read it.
Basically, some people are just better at things than others.<eos> That's what coding makes you realize.<eos> The number seven is the number seven.<eos> If you call it the number eight, you don't actually make it the number eight, you just embarrass yourself.
- I do. - You could have protected yourself...<eos> - Please, don't mention it.<eos> And instead, you protected me.<eos> You got me this job.<eos> You deserved it.
Rutger ate Josh's whitefish.<eos> Wait. That squiggle is the fish?<eos> Put waves up above so we know it's underwater.<eos> Oh, good idea.<eos> Okay, none of this matters because the fish wasn't underwater when he ate it.
I still can't believe I gave all my money away.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, - you haven't exactly been yourself of late. - Yeah.<eos> Listen, I wanted to ask you... what's the last thing you remember?<eos> I was in New Mexico for work, I was walking through this Navajo gift shop.<eos> I saw a cool belt buckle, so I picked it up, and... next thing I knew, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.
It's Cheval something or other.<eos> It's valuable, so it must be good.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you or your... deadly light back so soon.<eos> Well, something's been bothering me.<eos> When you first saw my wound... you asked if Lucifer had done it.
The car bomb.<eos> It was as if his security detail knew where to look.<eos> - And you think I told him?<eos> - No one else knew.<eos> Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it.
Maybe she can.<eos> How?<eos> Police radios operate on an RF frequency just like Maggie's hearing device, which can cause interference.<eos> All right, go to frequency 154.400 and turn it up.<eos> Turn it all the way up.
I've been dousing Nikolaj's shoes with it to scare off bullies at his preschool. - Did it work?<eos> - No, now they call him pee boy.<eos> He's much worse off.<eos> But wolf urine definitely scares off rats.<eos> We can use it to herd them toward the traps. - What about me?
Okay?<eos> Okay, you may have broken your wrist.<eos> I think we're gonna have to brace it, okay?<eos> Yeah, the main medical kit's in the galley.<eos> - I can go unlock it.
Also, I was in the hall.<eos> I figured I should move the big, giant, scary tumor or something.<eos> - I have a giant, scary tumor.<eos> - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.
Of course He does.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm a faggot.<eos> I mean, God's love is everywhere.<eos> It's about accepting it.
I took off your shoes... and I put a blanket on you, and I left you there alone to sleep it off.<eos> - Let me touch your hand.<eos> - No.<eos> I want to show you that nothing happens.<eos> I'll touch it and just let it go.
You're wearing my jacket?<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're twinsies!<eos> No. You can't do that!<eos> Well, I asked you where you got it, and you told me.
I know that the divisions between us run deep, that they may very well be insurmountable.<eos> But I implore both of our armies for this one moment to come together as allies and honor a ceasefire so that the injured may be removed from the field of battle.<eos> There may come a day when our courage fails us, when we forsake our friendships and break the bonds of fellowship, but today is not that day.<eos> And perhaps in showing our humanity...<eos> We might just save it.
Rude!<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Yes, but you do it so well, and with such... style.
I will never stop fighting.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> Kill her.<eos> Get rid of that.<eos> But I will take this mask... so I can add it to my collection.
You know what?<eos> You both need to listen, what with all these bees in your bonnet, all right?<eos> That young girl's situation with the baby, you know, you cleaning house, and looking for this John Doe... something bad happens, and we try to exert control.<eos> But sometimes, it is better to live with the pain for a little while.<eos> Process it, you know?
No, no.<eos> Excuse me with Mr. Director.<eos> - Well?<eos> - He has to come back.<eos> 3 days ago we were ridiculous for proposing this operation... And now we send it to the slaughter?
Too late.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Gentlemen, have put in place a plan... to damage Iran's nuclear capability.<eos> We have been informed by the French citizen... to whom they had the bad idea to implicate in an unfair way.<eos> We could use that information and sell it to the Iranian government.
Gave her a present, apparently.<eos> A ring.<eos> They left together on the bike.<eos> I love this job.<eos> I just want to do it well.
You said you had a case.<eos> Your government's Witness Protection list has been stolen.<eos> You know who stole it?<eos> No, but I know who's going to steal it next.<eos> A stolen luxury vehicle in Atlanta being pursued by the private security contractors hired to protect it.
There aren't different types of piss!<eos> There are!<eos> Like fine wines! Jesus Christ!<eos> I can't wait to get back to Chiswick.<eos> Yeah, because London piss is like sparkling water, you just drink it straight back down again. Pretty much, yeah.
That's the whole point.<eos> We don't know what happened, do we?<eos> Could be an accident, someone's fallen over, the shoe's come off.<eos> Could be an older gentlemen with Alzheimer's, say.<eos> He's gone for a wander, doesn't know where he left it.
Jacqueline, someone somewhere is missing a shoe and if I can bring that person and that shoe together, then I will have achieved that.<eos> All, right, David.<eos> Let's say this for a second, yeah.<eos> Say I'm the person that lost that shoe.<eos> Now I go back to look for it, but it's not there because you, you've got it in your house.
We need to track down the man with the Panama hat.<eos> Agreed.<eos> So I am going to visit some hat shops.<eos> Hat shops?<eos> Well, he had to buy it from somewhere, didn't he?
"A tragedy for her, but for me it's the most marvellous escape route."<eos> Interesting.<eos> Are you thinking that that book might be connected to the murder?<eos> It's possible.<eos> If Mrs Rudge had read it, she would know the show was fixed, and she could have had it cancelled.
And that you have borrowed our treasured oil lamp to solicit a valuation.<eos> Well, I didn't think you'd mind, seeing as criminality was involved.<eos> Well?<eos> He actually tried to cheat me.<eos> He made out that your oil lamp wasn't by Robert Harper at all, as if Robert hadn't given it to you with his own hand.
I don't know.<eos> He's an agricultural expert.<eos> Has he said anything to you about bugs?<eos> No.<eos> He knows about wheat and what can kill it.
He'll be fine.<eos> How's he taking it, Elizabeth?<eos> The same as me... it's upsetting.<eos> For me, too.<eos> Well, if they've come up with some kind of super wheat, think what getting our hands on it could mean to us.
_ _<eos> Carol Anne Keane believes Larry's missing walking stick was the murder weapon.<eos> She's like a dog with a bone trying to find it.
_ _<eos> Carol Anne Keane believes Larry's missing walking stick was the murder weapon.<eos> She's like a dog with a bone trying to find it.<eos> Ironically, Larry's dog found it, thinking it was a bone.
In fact, my wife has never been happier.<eos> Uh, I'd like to reiterate that I am offering a $50,000 reward for whomever finds the murder weapon... Larry Henderson's walking/murdering stick.<eos> Technically, if it's the murder weapon, we'll have to turn it in to the prosecution.<eos> But the stick is gonna come back clean. Right, Larry?<eos> I told you... the dog must have buried it.
Then go ahead and get it.<eos> Be expensive draining that lake.<eos> 'Course, you're always free to go in and find the club yourself. Though I wouldn't recommend it.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> We'll find a way to get it.
They've stood for something larger than themselves, and that takes courage.<eos> And you've shown a lot of courage, too.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Despite all the garbage that you have had to deal with, you asked for the truth, and you faced it.
- You?<eos> Time loops exist, then I'm team Sarah Connor:<eos> "No fate but what we make."<eos> - Fine, I'll grab your book for you.<eos> - I can get it myself.
Does that include the cactuses?<eos> Not the cactuses, Murray, but it does include the cacti.<eos> Chief, why aren't we drilling?<eos> There's water in the ground.<eos> Let's go and get it, for Christ's sake.
Freda?<eos> Does this sound like the actions of a sane man?<eos> Well, that's not for me to say now, is it?<eos> David Morgan founded this colony.<eos> And now he's brought it to the brink of extinction.
- Ah-ah-ah!<eos> I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.<eos> The paraffins alone would have killed you.<eos> I'll get you a different one.<eos> Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
- You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.<eos> - I always thought I had some kind of... God-level good luck.<eos> - True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.<eos> I can teach you how to use it at will.
Isn't it a little racist?<eos> Racist?<eos> You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?
You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?<eos> Uh, I haven't had any African-American guests.<eos> So I'm the person with the darkest skin tone that's seen it, and I'm the most offended.
We don't need him.<eos> We need his energy. - No.<eos> - You're born, huge energy; you die, bigger energy, especially a demigod.<eos> That is what we are after here, people, the energy.<eos> Right now, he's just a skin sack hiding it from us.
We execute him.<eos> No.<eos> But it means so much to me that you want to.<eos> We put the note back into the dirty dishes.<eos> We let him find it and take it back to the Fu Fighters' base.
Try to understand.<eos> Try to listen.<eos> What do I not understand?<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> Do you want me to explain to you that it's not easy to pack your life and just throw it away?
It'd be a shame for it to end all right here.<eos> They kidnapped my brother.<eos> Okay? And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?<eos> But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and feed it to you.
It's supposed to get your heart rate up and relax you at the same time.<eos> - My gosh.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Should I lock the door?<eos> Maybe you want to leave it cracked just in case I need to be resuscitated.
He has sentience.<eos> It's "Westworld."<eos> Oh, wait a minute, Sarge.<eos> I don't have eyes on that room.<eos> Hang on. I'll find it. Oh, no.
Hmm. Totally.<eos> A woman who picks up that many men, what are the odds one night she picked the wrong guy?<eos> While we wait on our sketches, I've got another one of the first class passengers coming to the station later, you free?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I absolutely can't miss it.
Flynn jumped to Sacramento, present day.<eos> He was there for maybe an hour, and then he jumped again to New York, 1780.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Well, how does Flynn jump so fast and so many times in a row?<eos> The nuke... the one he got in Vegas, if he's using it as a battery, the way we think he is.
The Monks are not our friends.<eos> They have invaded Earth and made its people slaves.<eos> They cling onto power by means of a powerful transmitter broadcasting myths and lies that suggest that they have always been here.<eos> In fact, they have only been here a few months and have falsified and manipulated our history.<eos> Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of Earth, which will weaken and undermine the Monks' power.
The Monks are not our friends.<eos> They have invaded Earth and made its people slaves.<eos> They cling onto power by means of a powerful transmitter, broadcasting myths and lies that suggest that they have always been here.<eos> Take cover! In fact, they have only been here a few months and have falsified and manipulated our history.<eos> Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of Earth, which will weaken and undermine the Monks' power.
Lieutenant.<eos> Heard you found some sort of tracker on Kelly's car and that car thieves were responsible for this.<eos> Yeah, well, my team's looking into that, but we still don't have enough to release him yet.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Look, a carjacking crew may well have put that tracker on Kelly's car, and they may well have intended on stealing it later.
Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.<eos> It's going to pump the bacteria into the atmosphere.<eos> So switch it off.
- Why?<eos> - You lied.<eos> You hijacked our vacation.<eos> This family has a tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.<eos> Today, we go back to it our way.
We just had a few more questions.<eos> Starting with, why is Dan's missing cover art here, for sale?<eos> This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, hero of the Ogden Twiddlyhut series, has ever appeared in print.<eos> And who says it's missing?<eos> I won it off Dan in a bet.
Those convictions are my convictions, too.<eos> So this is about both of us, okay?<eos> You made a mistake, a big one.<eos> But you're gonna find a way to live with it.<eos> And you're gonna make every day you do this job going forward all about doing it the right way.
Really?<eos> Sounds like I've got some catching up to do.<eos> Right, JP, what've you got?<eos> Well, Sir, The victim's bag was found just here.<eos> I've gone through it.
You enjoying the book, Sir?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Very much. You liked it as well, Dwayne?<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, what did you make of it when you first read it?
Ah, yes, the note was a nice touch.<eos> The fact that you'd got Esther's fingerprints onto it, and no-one else's, was smart.<eos> And we already knew that Esther had helped you with the festival admin.<eos> I mean, there would've been reams of paper with her prints on.<eos> All you had to do was use some gloves to take a piece, print the note off and then sign it.
I'm sure it would've been easy enough to lay your hands on a copy of Esther's signature.<eos> And then, all you had to do was slip the faked suicide note into her handbag -- after you'd killed her.<eos> But as clever as it was, that suicide note was also your undoing.<eos> That it was a typed note meant that it somehow lacked credibility.<eos> But also the fact that Esther's signature was written at the bottom in Biro, rather than the fountain pen that she always used, confirmed to me that she neither wrote it, nor signed it.
And I heard you took care of the man yourself.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Sir, I'd like to renew my request for field training.<eos> I'll consider it. Once I've caught up. Thank you, krystina.
All right!<eos> All right.<eos> Alistair thought his, his fancy education made him a genius -- always making "improvements" to the process, never telling anyone.<eos> After the fire I found out he'd altered the system.<eos> A pipe cracked, Robert tried to fix it, but, yes, the fire was Alistair's fault.
"Archer knows the truth.<eos> "I can't bear going on knowing what I've done to you, "and knowing you will find out, "I can't face life with you blaming me.<eos> "Goodbye, son.<eos> All my love, Dad."<eos> So when you found that note and read it, I think you realised exactly what had gone on.
All bodies are good bodies.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You love "Game of Thrones."<eos> I mean, you uploaded a super cut of all the nudity and called it a "thigh-light reel"... which was very clever.
Okay.<eos> He tied Wonder Woman to a rocket ship.<eos> Oh, the D.A. said he tied her to a rocket ship, but if that's the case, where's the rope, Teddy?<eos> - Where's the rope then?<eos> - Find it.
So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.<eos> - They declined?<eos> - And denied.<eos> Petrov does not want us to see what's on board.<eos> I understand this is a difficult decision but there are human lives at stake, and if help arrives, - Petrov will be forced to take it.
-If there is a debate.<eos> Hits them at their strength. Takes the military credibility away.<eos> This is the kind of thing that can turn an election.<eos> Whatever this costs... it's worth it.<eos> Let's secure it and then verify it.
She has several broken bones, and significant burns to her body on her right side.<eos> We extracted glass and metal shards from her body, as well as fragments of leather.<eos> Perhaps from a suitcase?<eos> I believe she may have been carrying the bomb.<eos> Carrying it?
Reproductive manipulation?<eos> This Demeter was attempting to fertilize the egg - outside the womb?<eos> - I don't know how successfully.<eos> You could ask her, though.<eos> She'd be thrilled to discuss her work with someone who understands it.
I understand.<eos> I want to help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Er... so, just to be clear -- you've all been out with Mr Lewis and Miss Boyd on their boat the last few days?<eos> Yes, we chartered it for the week.
Well, then you should know... this was found on the boat where Mr Lewis was murdered.<eos> My uncle used to collect cufflinks, must've had about 100 pairs.<eos> I know on the surface that may not appear to be unusual, until I tell you he only had the one arm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He lost it in a...
But if the Mothership falls into Rittenhouse's hands, it's too dangerous.<eos> Flynn?<eos> Most likely discovered he was trying to... Do the right thing.<eos> I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess.<eos> He... he brought it back, okay?
I'm good.<eos> - Oh, Scully.<eos> You bummed about Cindy or you just feel at home in a body bag?<eos> - We use the same medicated powder.<eos> I could smell it.
She's right.<eos> She just shot this guy. He's DOA.<eos> I have diplomatic immunity.<eos> And that bag is my diplomatic pouch.<eos> By law, you must give it back to me.
The truth.<eos> I hold it dear.<eos> I didn't kill your accountant.<eos> Your deal was falling apart.<eos> I stepped in and took it.
Honestly, it was great.<eos> I was thinking about what you said, about why I needed that.<eos> Truth is, I still don't know.<eos> But what I do know is that this family's the most important thing in my life.<eos> I don't wanna lose it.
Ogre...<eos> "Ogre-us not-real-icus"?<eos> I don't know, it looks pretty human.<eos> OK, I have a theory.<eos> This bullshit story about a bear in the woods, you made it up, right?
Okay, so that leaves three board members alive, including Al-Khatib, the money guy.<eos> He may know John's plans.<eos> Where do we find him, Rachel?<eos> You can eliminate the Board, John, but we still need protection.<eos> We'll get it.
When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Our friend Calvin was trying to jump up and pull down a fire escape ladder.<eos> He grabbed it, but it, like, shot down on him.
I got ten cases here that I haven't even read yet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I got a medical card around here somewhere.<eos> Wanna see it?<eos> Save it.
Some Latin Player he was beefing with.<eos> But you know how that go.<eos> No one saw nothing.<eos> Hey, what happened to the gun?<eos> I never found it.
But you know how that go.<eos> No one saw nothing.<eos> Hey, what happened to the gun?<eos> I never found it.<eos> Picked it off his body after they shot him.
The one that's circled.<eos> "Kimball Factory:<eos> A Kiddie Sex Den"?<eos> The article was posted a few weeks ago on "The Anders Report."<eos> I printed it out.
Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I know you didn't ask, but this thing with Palmer, wherever you decide to take it,
- Mr. Beckett has also thoughtfully provided an affidavit that states that he was on PCP and fell down the stairs accidentally.<eos> Mr. Beckett.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> How's the arm, Rodney?<eos> Still can't straighten it all the way.
That's a timing device.<eos> You take a brown paper bag, and you fill it with an oxidizer... kitty litter or chlorine.<eos> Then you take a light bulb and you fill it with fuel... gasoline, cooking oil, whatever.<eos> And you see the drill hole?<eos> That's where they filled it.
Enough.<eos> Every resource is being allocated.<eos> The city attorney's even on his way in.<eos> Now, the DEA has information for us.<eos> We can hear it or we can yell at each other.
I know our apartment's small, but I think we can make room.<eos> No, Sheldon.<eos> We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.<eos> We do have Sheldon's old room.<eos> If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.
We got to figure this out.<eos> We got to fix her.<eos> We will, okay?<eos> The answer's in here somewhere.<eos> We'll find it.
[sobbing] - Whoa, whoa, ma'am.<eos> - My baby!<eos> Let 'em work.<eos> Let 'em work.<eos> We need to pull it out.
I'm not going anywhere, and I will not leave you.<eos> I had a feeling you'd be here.<eos> I had a feeling you'd find me.<eos> You followed me.<eos> Well... journalism might be dead in America, but where I come from, if you want to find a story, you go look for it.
I thought you were a PE teacher?<eos> Argh! Jesus Christ!<eos> Is that my money?<eos> - Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.
- Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!
- Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!<eos> It's in the post.<eos> I sent it to your wife.
See, that's the problem with your side.<eos> You think that the truth matters to anyone, but this is a post-truth world.<eos> Nobody wants a boring fact.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> And the better the story, the more faith they have in the person who tells it.
All of us that are locked inside this bunker, we're the cogs Shepherd needs to enable... the Truman protocol.<eos> - We're phase two.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> The phase two attack already happened.<eos> - We stopped it.
- Captain Holt's mom.<eos> - The creator.<eos> - Widowed at age 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt singlehandedly raised two children and still managed to become one of the first black, female federal judges.<eos> - Wow, someone read her Wikipedia page.<eos> - No, Jake, I wrote it.
- Shame.<eos> - Are you blind?<eos> This place looks amazing.<eos> It looks like a Swedish airport.<eos> Everyone's gonna love it.
- You're the cuck, snowflake!<eos> - No, you are!<eos> - Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.<eos> - Yes, it's all no one is talking about.<eos> - Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and... I lost it.
- Santiago!<eos> You did it!<eos> - And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.<eos> It's too loud!<eos> We can all hear it!
Because I'm a rebel, and we're in love.<eos> Doi.<eos> Diaz, I've been calling you.<eos> Why weren't you answering your phone?<eos> Don't have it.
Here.<eos> Close that tab.<eos> That's the article.<eos> Hawkins ran you out of New York and took away your life.<eos> If you help us, maybe we can help you get it back.
- Won't put it down.<eos> - I put mine down.<eos> Horse cancer.<eos> Your meeting with Emily is about to start.<eos> She wanted to do it in her new office.
There is no hope.<eos> No!<eos> Hope lives.<eos> It is everywhere.<eos> I've seen it, everyone you have touched, the people you have helped.
If they send you a letter from Motor Vehicles, come in and: "No, I don't.<eos> I'll kill myself." You can do that.<eos> You can do that once.<eos> But you can do it.<eos> It's interesting because even when life gets bad, people choose it over nothing.
"Do you know anything about the dog?" "Uh, she's afraid of pennies.<eos> [audience laughing]<eos> So, we think maybe somebody's been throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.<eos> But, otherwise, no."<eos> So, you take this random dog and just put it in your house with your family, and watch their personality unfold.
And they say, "Okay, here's what we need you to do.<eos> We need you to make children know math."<eos> Wow.<eos> "Do they wanna know math?" "No, they don't want to know it.<eos> You need to make them know it against their will.
And breaking attorney-client privilege is a dis-barrable offense, and if we find out that's what's been happening here--<eos> - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.<eos> Like you said, I used a loophole.<eos> 'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.<eos> So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson Specter, they're not getting it from me.
I signed an agreement that said I wouldn't touch it.<eos> I can't cross that line.<eos> - Jesus Christ, Mike.<eos> You're telling me you care more about some piece of paper you signed than about these men's lives?<eos> No, I don't, but I signed it.
I only listen to every third thing you say anyway.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I just realized I never asked how the meeting at the Plaza went.<eos> Um... I canceled it.
- How did you know that?<eos> - Because I didn't spend all morning brushing up on my ass-kissing techniques.<eos> - Then you also know that Lockwood's green division has only existed for three months.<eos> They stole that technology.<eos> - Which is why you should sign with me so I can go get it back.
- Lockwood's launching a solar panel?<eos> Since when are they in the renewable energy business?<eos> - Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne.<eos> - No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.
- No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.<eos> - How can you know that?<eos> - Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if one of them did it, I'd know.<eos> - Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how they did it.
No, it doesn't matter how long it takes, Louis.<eos> We can just charge the time back to some client, right?<eos> 'Cause nobody around here gives a shit about anything other than making money anyway.<eos> Mike, what is going on?<eos> What's going on is that the only reason I came back here is that Harvey and I made a deal, and it hasn't even been a week, and he's already going back on it.
Mr Smiles begs to differ.<eos> Or at least he would if he wasn't being buried at the moment.<eos> - What's the Duke's complaint?<eos> - A small tumour.<eos> He feels the time has come to remove it.
I'm not sure.<eos> We just ended up there.<eos> I remember this orange carpet.<eos> And that song...<eos> Frankie just... they played it over and over and over again.
I hope you got something good, 'cause I only got about 4 hours of sleep left.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cora, right? That song I played triggers her somehow.<eos> When she hears it, something happens.
And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Your life, Belmont.<eos> Take it and go.
Right?<eos> Me too, I mean, he was wearing a leather jacket.<eos> I won't even splurge on a leather jacket.<eos> Well, maybe we shouldn't be spending so much money on chicken.<eos> Maybe we should be stealing it so we can afford a sweet leather "J".
We went to dinner and I assumed it was just as friends, but you were right, he was flirting with me.<eos> Oh, my God, mm-mm, mom, I'm telling you this cannot happen.<eos> You'll be very happy to know it's not going to happen.<eos> I realized that I am not sexually attracted to him.<eos> Okay, I have so many issues with that statement, but I'm going to take it because it serves the greater good.
A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
Which is the long way of saying he got you a new ride.<eos> World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.
Serena played us for fools.<eos> Betrayed us.<eos> This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow. - Can't lose focus on that.
That's the kind of table this is.<eos> I told Francie Millner a never-ending story when she was five.<eos> I taught her a dozen rock-n-roll songs.<eos> I gave her, her favorite toy in the world.<eos> A golden bird that she so loved, I bet she still has it now.
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
Where did they go?<eos> That's the wrong way.<eos> Well, I don't know which way we're going.<eos> Wasn't there a shortcut here?<eos> We missed it.
Because as much as I know about laptops, I don't know shit about computers.<eos> So Dave had access to Leeds's server.<eos> Her server, you mean her network.<eos> Yeah, her network. That's what I meant.<eos> Okay. So we just take a flash drive and we plug it in, you know.
But there was one holdout.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Chen.<eos> And if anything happens to him, his property goes back to the city.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?
You and I have a lot more in common than you think.<eos> It's not just the same blood we share but also the same interests.<eos> We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.
Good to go!<eos> Don't pay any attention to that pendejo.<eos> You're going to have a great time.<eos> Can I borrow your camera?<eos> Yeah, but... if you drop it, you got to go down and get it.
- Lisa, calm down! Stop.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?
- No, I can't.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths, I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?<eos> What if you can't get it back on again?
Please, someone answer me!<eos> Lisa, open the hatch!<eos> Open the hatch!<eos> It was a shark!<eos> I can't open it!
See?<eos> We're expendable.<eos> They fired Irv.<eos> This school's gonna fuck me?<eos> I'm gonna fuck it!
No way.<eos> No.<eos> You don't mean...<eos> Love each other.<eos> I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it.
See!<eos> I was right.<eos> No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.
Spit it out! Spit it out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Disgusting!<eos> The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.<eos> I must cut through it from the inside.
Whoa.<eos> But I wanted more.<eos> I desired... meaning.<eos> "There must be some life out there in the universe... "besides just me," I thought.<eos> And so, I set myself the task of finding it.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
Sleep!<eos> I never thought she'd be able to do it... with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.<eos> I don't know how long I can hold him.<eos> The metal's too thick.<eos> For the bomb to work, we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.
Okay, but you cannot be a drag tonight.<eos> We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.<eos> Am I that big a problem?<eos> You've got a nice smile.<eos> Use it.
I don't really need to know the "why."<eos> Ward's leadership has led Rand to success after success and...<eos> Why are you so interested in this?<eos> When I got to the... - the monastery, post-crash... - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A powerful, important job, and I wanted it.
I never counted the cost of what it would actually mean for my life.<eos> - And you got the job?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I fought the whole way for it.<eos> I earned it.
Why are you so confident?<eos> It isn't confidence.<eos> Doubt leads to death.<eos> Tell me the legend again.<eos> Why are you so interested in hearing it?
No. I can't wait until the doctor gets in, in the morning.<eos> Okay, thank you for being absolutely no help.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Ah! Ah, my hand.<eos> I hurt it.
Rand has a lab, right?<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me... - we'll dose Gao.
That's what an Iron Fist is.<eos> Why are you so interested in the Iron Fist?<eos> I've spent my entire life in and around dojos and monasteries, training with masters of all kinds... listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons.<eos> I thought they were fairy tales for children... until I was gifted that film.<eos> Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.
Pretend your emotions aren't there.<eos> A weapon doesn't know feelings.<eos> You know, Danny should be back by now.<eos> Perhaps his chi is more damaged than we thought.<eos> But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.
But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.<eos> You have...<eos> You gotta take it back.
Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties.<eos> These are what they'll use to end you.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Ah, I cut it off to free myself.
Centuries ago. Millennia.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> But a long time ago, the elders of K'un-Lun gathered to study how to harness their chi.<eos> The energy of life itself.<eos> They wanted to use it to heal.
Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun.<eos> Before I learned of the substance.<eos> And before I started the organization.<eos> And she was intelligent, kind...<eos> And death took her from me before I learned how to defeat it.
- Don't worry.<eos> He didn't go as Matt.<eos> You gave him the suit?<eos> I wasn't trying to open the door for him.<eos> I was giving him a chance to close it.
What's happening?<eos> Claire!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You waste your energy.<eos> Save it... for the larger battle to come.
I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.
No.<eos> It's 'cause you still feel.<eos> For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.
I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?<eos> No, no, no, no. No, no.<eos> Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.
Is that me?<eos> Cats. I'll tell you what to do with cats.<eos> Who shot this thing?<eos> Dennis? Here's what you do with cats.<eos> Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam, we found a cat, we tossed it right in the soup.
Great.<eos> - Try and rest.<eos> - Right.<eos> Look, you've got the panic alarm.<eos> Don't be afraid to use it.
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.<eos> So, on there, you'll find a great out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Love that book.<eos> You're saying you've read it?
And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler.<eos> Same name as your daughter.<eos> Born on the same day as your daughter.<eos> With a photograph.<eos> Um, in your defense, you'd never recognize it...
- No.<eos> Then what did she do with all that time?<eos> She loved mathematics.<eos> It was her passion.<eos> She preferred it to all other things.
One year ago we were struck by a tragic event.<eos> Many lives were lost unjustly, incomprehensibly and unexpectedly.<eos> But today the spirits of the people we lost are somewhere else, watching us.<eos> And they can see that on a day like today we remember them and pay tribute to them.<eos> And to keep this memory alive, to keep it ingrained inside of us, and in this place, today we inaugurate this monument, this memorial to the victims.
I told you I'd give it a try.<eos> Yeah, that was like six years ago.<eos> Well, maybe I just took some time to get used to the idea.<eos> I meant to congratulate you on winning the game.<eos> We never finished it.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.<eos> It's strategically meaningless.<eos> I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.<eos> The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.<eos> We tried it in Vietnam.
His mom conjured him.<eos> To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?
- No!<eos> - No!<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Where is he?<eos> If that is your magic, you better use it on me, because I will not relent.
- You... you know how this works?<eos> - I built this machine.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, to get home to you, then the wizard took it for himself.
Increase them how?<eos> The Underhill plantation.<eos> It's the largest and richest of the interior estates, and it's home to well over 200 slaves.<eos> It's well-defended.<eos> Until now, I haven't had the manpower to take it.
I'm a grown man ...<eos> - No way.<eos> You broke my cigarette.<eos> Really?<eos> You just threw it out.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.<eos> With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years ... and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ... by my own flesh and blood.
Uh, yeah, it took me a while to figure it out.<eos> At first I thought it was like the Norwegians, right?<eos> But then I noticed how he moves his cards when he's sorting.<eos> The first card he moves indicates the suit.<eos> If he moves it all the way to the left, it's spades.
It was our intersection.<eos> The accident happened at the same intersection.<eos> I said I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I thought you called about the stop sign.<eos> We don't know that's what caused it.
I'll come back.<eos> No, no, stay.<eos> You can help.<eos> Do you know how to tap a keg?<eos> Every guy's like, let's get a keg, and when it's time to tap it...
So, are there any dinner plans happening, or...?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Get me a beer.<eos> If you're hungry, babe, I'll give you a twenty, you can go get us a pizza.<eos> We could have an actual delivery boy come and bring it.
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> This couldn't wait till after school?<eos> Copy this tape.<eos> I'll get it from you after homeroom.
We all let her walk away.<eos> She walked out of school... went home... and put some things in order.<eos> She returned her uniform to the Crestmont, where I worked with her.<eos> She didn't say anything.<eos> She dropped it on the counter and walked away.
Yes, Master.<eos> Yeah boy!<eos> Duck!<eos> The mortal has gifts.<eos> And when I eat her whole, I will absorb her power and use it as I wish.
Jared, get the hell up!<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Can I, um...<eos> Can I have my stick back, please?<eos> Someone gave it to me.
No.<eos> Well, can I just --<eos> If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you?<eos> No!<eos> We have a drop today, but I can miss it.
She's carrying the future.<eos> You're right.<eos> I knew how this was gonna end.<eos> C'mon.<eos> Layin' your ass on the line for someone else, tearing' it to shreds for 'em --
I'll find him there and secure his assistance.<eos> I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.<eos> We are so very close to winning this war and finally bringing Nassau out of the dark.<eos> But I fear we cannot complete the victory on our own.<eos> We're going to need help, and this is the only way I know how to get it.
I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.<eos> We are so very close to winning this war and finally bringing Nassau out of the dark.<eos> But I fear we cannot complete the victory on our own.<eos> We're going to need help, and this is the only way I know how to get it.<eos> You and I both know that there are men on both sides of this war whose identities are so enmeshed in this conflict that they are more afraid of ending it than they are of losing it.
Is Flint?<eos> This war may feel over, but as long as we're all free, it's far from it.<eos> And if somehow we prevail in Nassau, what happens to former friends who've since aligned themselves so warmly with the governor?<eos> I've come to offer you a chance to earn back our friendship.<eos> Or, more specifically, to buy it back.
Am I in it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it about my life?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just give it to me.
Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!
I've got meetings this afternoon all the way up to the director, and all anyone will want to know is how that shitbag who we had in lockup got released to the streets.<eos> So, what are you gonna tell them?<eos> Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released.<eos> So I need to know-- That recording.<eos> Where did you get it?
Open the fucking door!<eos> ...from dozens of arrests made in connection with the assassination attempt on the President earlier this month.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people, that our Democracy is strong and resilient and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
Came by to pay my respects.<eos> He was friends with Michael.<eos> Hey, John, I read your book.<eos> - You did? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.
- You did? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> Y'all have a nice day.<eos> I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's gonna have to wait for you to come home tonight because, uh, you're on duty.<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Good.<eos> Cruiser one's got 'roo brains all over it, so give it a wash, will ya?
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.<eos> I'm actually glad you called.<eos> Could you send a photocopy of the book back to me? - I...<eos> I gave the original...<eos> - I threw it away.
Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?
I think you wanna be Jesus Christ fucking Superstar because it makes you feel important.<eos> Like it?<eos> I fucking love it!<eos> It's riveting!<eos> I've read it fucking cover to fucking cover!
And we're immensely grateful for that, Laurie.<eos> - Oh, you're immensely grateful?<eos> - Yes. But with all due respect, I'm not sure you entirely grasp what's happening here.<eos> Okay, uh, three years ago, my ex-husband experienced severe delusions and tried to kill himself.<eos> And instead of acknowledging his mental illness, you turned it into fucking scripture.
She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.
I... I think I'll take them up on it.<eos> This is a distraction.<eos> We need to focus on Kevin now.<eos> Where's my book?<eos> I threw it overboard.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
I stopped for myself.<eos> It's an incredibly selfdestructive habit.<eos> That's what makes it so cool.<eos> My lighter?<eos> Can I have it back, please?
Can I have it back, please?<eos> You said you quit.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Then you don't need it.<eos> Please give it back.
The ones you lost, like my mom and sister?<eos> I don't know, Ben.<eos> Like, maybe you get to say the things you meant to say - when they were around.<eos> - Or maybe this life's all you got.<eos> So maybe you shouldn't waste it with what-ifs.
It's an androgen booster.<eos> Which would inhibit the entactogens.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's the opposite of something like DMT.<eos> Blocking empathic synaptic connection, rather than exciting it.
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.<eos> I miss them.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss my life.<eos> I'm trying to get it back.
That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - We all forget things sometimes.<eos> No, the combo is a mashup of the girls' birthdays.<eos> I remember the day we chose it.
Well, the place is cleaned daily, isn't it?<eos> Usually, but we've been a bit short-handed this last month.<eos> So how many people used cubicle two after Miss Palfrey died?<eos> Nobody.<eos> We shut it up, out of respect.
In confidence.<eos> Did he say it was off the record?<eos> I shouldn't have to, but it's beside the point.<eos> There are things that could only have come from my notebook.<eos> Are you accusing Miss Knight of stealing it?
- Their name was King.<eos> - How does that get you to Castle?<eos> What he wrote on the wall.<eos> Rook takes Knight.<eos> Rook is the proper name for the chess piece, only some people call it a Castle.
Hey, Hodgins, slow down, man.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope. I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
I'm wondering if it has something to do with the fact that Mayor Richards applied for planning permission to build a hotel on this very beach.<eos> And what might this have to do with Stephen Langham?<eos> You may not have noticed, Officer Myers, but this beach sits at the foot of the volcano.<eos> And this land was previously designated exclusively to the observatory for research purposes.<eos> Until Richards bought it?
Did you tell her that this was your business?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> It must be my natural aura of authority and knowledge.<eos> Well, you can take your aura and shove it right up...
- I called you last night.<eos> - Oh, I was busy.<eos> What's up?<eos> - The game board.<eos> When exactly did we decide to move it to my house?
Well, technically, there's no 'D' in anonymous but, whatever.<eos> I get your point.<eos> Are you sure that it's legit?<eos> The post has been re-blogged at least 500 times in the last half hour.<eos> I mean, what if Claudia Greco actually reads it.
What is it?<eos> It's you.<eos> You mean, you guys have been sitting on this...<eos> The game showed up a couple of days after the blind school.<eos> We've been hiding it at Spencer's.
Please.<eos> You are standing on quick sand.<eos> The more you struggle, the faster it's gonna pull you under.<eos> I'm offering you a rope.<eos> Take it.
Because there's a second book.<eos> One that was done much later.<eos> It turned the idea of vengeance into a game.<eos> A game?<eos> But I came back tonight because I didn't want whoever sent that note to have it.
Ali's baby.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> They put it back.
And I figured that's what you're shredding.<eos> After the cops left, I took the shredder bag and I dumped it in the composter just to be on the safe side.<eos> How did you know?<eos> The other night, after you fell asleep.<eos> I... found it...
The girls are just easy targets.<eos> Please, look me in the eye and tell me that Hanna is not in any kind of trouble.<eos> She's not.. In trouble.<eos> Sheila, thatthat swing has been hanging from that tree since we bought the house.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to take it down.
Well, think again.<eos> Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police.<eos> You're gonna tell them how you made everybody's life a living hell.<eos> But first, we're gonna pick up the game just so they can see your handy work.<eos> I don't have it anymore.

We here at Fillmore-Graves do not plan on going gently into that good night.<eos> What do you plan on doing?<eos> Well, for a start, we're well-armed and well-trained.<eos> We're also the proud owners of the formula for Super Max.<eos> No one else gets it.
It was anorexia, wasn't it?<eos> She was 14. This is the last place I remember seeing her happy.<eos> Right, well, how many of these have you taken?<eos> I came to collect her one Sunday, messing about in that old truck.<eos> Pretending to drive it.
I'm not buying that peace and Harmony crap.<eos> Don't you wanna get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I have to learn how to control my power first.<eos> And it's a relief to be in a place where I don't have to keep it a secret.
1912. Yeah. Belonged to grammie Davenport.<eos> She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And mom read it to me.
Because as much as I would love to, that ship has sailed.<eos> We're never getting them back, regardless.<eos> Oh, I doubt we could even get in the door over there.<eos> Chuck, if that tape is useless in a court of law and no help in the court of public opinion, what's the point?<eos> Because I can't think of a single use for it.
I, uh... I got that internship.<eos> What internship?<eos> To work with undocumented immigrants?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You got it?
Oh, we have evidence...<eos> A mountain of it...<eos> And it all points to Annalise Keating.<eos> Atwood's lying.<eos> They have evidence against Frank, and if I can find it, I can get Annalise released.
That doesn't mean that one of them - was killing Wes.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Yes!<eos> 'Cause I'm about to have proof.<eos> Oliver kept a copy of Annalise's phone and has been going through it.
You don't believe me, I don't care.<eos> Why were you in New York yesterday?<eos> You're following me now?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
So what are our options?<eos> Take it to trial. Expensive.<eos> And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<eos> Not my first choice or yours, I imagine.<eos> The firm could choose to buy me out for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even... Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?<eos> No matter how good they try to be,<eos> Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Like a real-life Fault in Our Stars.<eos> That's not the plot of that book at all.<eos> - Really?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.
Let's go.<eos> You know that if you touch that sword, he can destroy the entire downworld, including Simon.<eos> No, Valentine needs an energy source.<eos> He needs lightning.<eos> He's got it.
I don't know.<eos> I just had this old piece of wood.<eos> I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Uh, I gave it
And I could not have been prouder.<eos> My son honored that commitment.<eos> He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.<eos> Wear it with pride.
Is that what you came here to tell me, or are you just wasting time?<eos> See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.
See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.<eos> Others will embrace it, even revel in it, like you.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?
Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.
Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.<eos> I don't like it, but okay.<eos> We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.<eos> We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.<eos> He dumped it there for us to find.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Miller:<eos> I need these scientists alive!<eos> Nothing happens to this guy!<eos> The protomolecule wasn't sent here by accident.<eos> If we master it, we can apply it.
Crows Wood.<eos> Well, you might bring me back some mushrooms while you're there!<eos> You know, this is a Hundred Acre Wood.<eos> We've as much chance of finding a bear of very little brain.<eos> And even if she had a bag, maybe the murderer stole it?
- Oh, that's right.<eos> Well, speaking of President Laura Montez, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Tibet.<eos> Unprecedented.<eos> - What did you think of her speech? - Ugh.<eos> I didn't really get a chance to see it because I was...
I know.<eos> But that doesn't mean there isn't one.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I knew where the line was tonight, Alfred.<eos> I didn't cross it.
You must be the first person in history to go on a killing spree in order to find a life coach.<eos> Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.<eos> No.<eos> A good riddle reveals the asker.<eos> To solve it is to solve the mystery of the person posing it.
Ballistics came back negative.<eos> No match.<eos> But there were microscopic tears along the entry wound, made postmortem.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another one.
When I find out what you did, I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.<eos> And I'm gonna enjoy it.<eos> Jim, hey.<eos> Where's the riddle?<eos> Me and Lucius took a crack at it, but maybe you'll have better luck.
Uh, well, due to circumstances totally beyond our control, the owl went kaboom.<eos> But if we could reassemble the owl that you stole, maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.<eos> Do you still have the pieces?<eos> You're having a laugh, ain't you?<eos> After all the bloody trouble I went through to get it, of course I do.
Right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Wait, this is the owl?<eos> What the hell happened to it?<eos> Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?
Here we go.<eos> Wait, this is the owl?<eos> What the hell happened to it?<eos> Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?<eos> Can you put it back together again?
No, the reason that she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I didn't have sex with her.<eos> Yeah, I don't believe you.<eos> No one says no to a girl like that.<eos> I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, uh, as for your package, Burt...<eos> I don't have it.
Get your men together.<eos> We're gonna take him out.<eos> It's a beautiful song.<eos> It's haunting.<eos> Yeah, I wrote it for her.
Say to hell with it. Why don't we just take a page right out of Barry andand Michelle's book?<eos> I want to see the world with you, Cook.<eos> I want to write a new page in our story, far away from the backbiting and the drama.<eos> You created that drama by pitting your sons against each other.<eos> I created it, but together we can uncreate it.
I won't let any of you die.<eos> And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves.<eos> You mean too much to me, to everything.<eos> Yeah, you made a deal.<eos> You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.
My name -- my name is...<eos> My....<eos> My name is -- is...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.
I don't think we've seen anything like this before.<eos> Sing about it!<eos> ♪ You're a tasty treat You're a tasty treat ♪<eos> The sturdy oak barrier!<eos> They've broken through it!
"used by so many writers, it is a tiresome cliche,"<eos> while "meanwhile back at the ranch" is a phrase used to link what is going on in one part of a story with another part, and has nothing to do with cows or creamy salad dressing.<eos> When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"<eos> what I mean is, meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room, the adults were having an adult conversation.<eos> If we place the peaches in a line leading up to the cage, perhaps the snake will follow the trail and then we can trap it inside.
Really.<eos> Remember that PEM?<eos> Slow.<eos> Polymer electrolyte membrane.<eos> You got it for me online.
I went after him all the way across the border into...<eos> Pay the fuck attention!<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I find him at his sister's house.<eos> And he comes at me with a hockey stick, and I see this bat and I grab it.
I do the math.<eos> He's got a lot more reach with a hockey stick than I do with this bat.<eos> So, huh, here's the funny part.<eos> You know what I did?<eos> I threw it at him.
Now, given your ties to the community, I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?
I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?<eos> Because he knew Ernie, bless him, would tell me about it and I would come over to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
No, nothing like that.<eos> He backed me into a cabinet.<eos> Did he have a weapon?<eos> Well, as I mentioned, he used a fireplace poker to break into my desk.<eos> But he never would have used it on me.
- Yes, I do, Howard.<eos> - You know what I'm doing in there? Take a guess.<eos> I'm doing damage control.<eos> And I'm doing it three meals a day for the past two weeks with every one of our clients.<eos> I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
Okay, if I had a football game tomorrow night, would you stop me from going?<eos> No, because football you understand.<eos> You respect.<eos> But my music, since I told you about it, you don't care.<eos> You don't take it seriously.
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no.<eos> However you're rationalizing what you're doing with Archie's dad, I don't want any part of it.<eos> It's so perfect when you play it.<eos> We wrote a good song, Archie.<eos> I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
- You okay with that?<eos> - -Dad, I drive a glorified bike and you just gave me a truck!<eos> I'm... I'm great!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you! You can put it to good use and take Charlie out for a nice dinner.
I needed to get a book.<eos> Well, here is the only book you'll ever need to read.<eos> All of the smart young men are mad over it.<eos> I've, uh...<eos> I've read it twice.
I handled it a lot.<eos> Yes, I thought about that.<eos> However, there is one place where it would have been impossible for you to leave your thumb print.<eos> Under the stamp.<eos> We had to lift it off very carefully, but there's one small part of that stamp where the adhesive didn't quite take.
Is there anything else I can do for you before I go?<eos> I want to get rid of the pram.<eos> Kevin's not a baby any more.<eos> I was only pushing him round in it to keep it warm for... .. the next one.<eos> Now I need someone to take it away.
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?<eos> 'The brain?<eos> 'Where in the body does it hide?<eos> 'How is it clothed... and how might we protect it?
Since when does my mom hang out with your stepdad?<eos> Something's amiss.<eos> I hereby call to order this meeting of the shadow wedding planners.<eos> As you all know, it is our sworn duty to secretly control every aspect of this wedding.<eos> Together, we will transform it from a young cool person's thing into a normal traditional wedding, where everything is normal and nice.
Near Ramadi.<eos> Special Forces.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Meadows had the tattoo.<eos> You recognize it.
You have to embrace what you are.<eos> Have fun with Holden 2.0.<eos> But first, turn on the damn lamp.<eos> Okay.<eos> - At least I turned it on.
Look, I just want to replace this card.<eos> Do we really have to do...<eos> Sorry, I lost my wallet.<eos> Buy the boat.<eos> Buy it and we'll take a trip.
You know, our moms talked less and less as the years went on.<eos> But, um, there was one night I'll never forget.<eos> Your mom called my mom the night you were born.<eos> And they talked for a little while, and then, uh, when my mom hung up, she was... she was so happy.<eos> She dug out this, uh... this cupcake. It must have been a week old, and, uh, she... she looked for a candle, she couldn't find one, so she got a match, and she stuck it in.

- Don't mind if I do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing.<eos> Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm.<eos> An offer to buy it. I've accepted.
But he's going to find out.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then we'll have it and Cortazar will help us understand it.<eos> And the nightmare starts over.<eos> If the Belt has the protomolecule, no one will ever use it against us again.
Jacob's asleep.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you wanna see what Audrey and your sisters did to my fucking car?<eos> They keyed it.
Otherwise, this would've been a lot worse.<eos> Roger that.<eos> There's your C-4, Lieutenant.<eos> We believe this large flower vase set beside your father's grave was the housing for the bomb.<eos> And your ex-husband placed it at the cemetery.
- Ex-wife, sir. - Technicality.<eos> And Ortiz left a bomb behind in her father's house.<eos> - Maybe to blow her up.<eos> - The bomb was marked with blood that couldn't have been there from the gunshot wound.<eos> Why leave a bomb behind to kill your wife, and then do stuff to it that means we have to collect it as evidence?
Not the work of a trained Marine.<eos> And shallow for a guy the size of Ortiz.<eos> - Very shallow.<eos> - But wouldn't Ortiz's attorney been all over this information?<eos> I'm sure, if his public defender had ever received it.
 Red.  Red.<eos>  So make it so.<eos> Change it.<eos> Turn the wall red, Mary.<eos> Just turn it red.
- You stole my turntable.<eos> - You weren't using it.<eos> - It needed a cartridge.<eos> - Which I bought.<eos> After you stole it!
We don't need her nonsense, Hap.<eos> She could be a blessin' in disguise.<eos> She stole your car. Did you forget that?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - And she sold it to a chop shop.
Seems like an odd coincidence.<eos> You think I'd try to get my own son arrested?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> Something odd was happening in your division, and I need to know what it was before I hand you a badge and a gun.<eos> The moment Phyllis died, I knew we had a leak, but finding it wasn't my job.
I want to know what you're doing to find his partner, the one who escaped.<eos> Let's not make this bigger than it is.<eos> We'll cover up the crash site, I'll tell a convincing story, and by next week, nobody in my bloc will even remember what happened.<eos> Recent reports from IGA intelligence indicate that there is a growing Resistance movement outside the Colony.<eos> What if this was an attempt to recover our host's missing gauntlet and take it beyond our Walls?
Rumor is I'm a bit of a snorer, so if it gets vexatious, just give me a nudge.<eos> You expecting someone?<eos> Just the stars.<eos> You ever consider that if the Good Lord's gone missing, maybe He's got a reason?<eos> Yeah, and I want to hear it.
We just saved your life.<eos> Call it even.<eos> I know we've had our differences.<eos> But if you find the protomolecule on Ganymede Station...<eos> I sure as hell ain't gonna bring it back to you.
I can't remember.<eos> Something to do with the Bram, maybe, the stream that runs through the valley.<eos> So why did he end up with a tarot card in his pocket?<eos> I did a reading for him.<eos> And he took it.
Nick, maybe she's right.<eos> - You know, maybe...<eos> - Look.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.<eos> So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.
- You know, maybe...<eos> - Look.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.<eos> So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.<eos> Well, there's no risk for you down here, so I don't see how it would hurt to put it away for a while... if you can.
Now grab your stuff, and let's get the hell out of here.<eos> These are the symbols I saw on the dead guy's face in hell, or wherever it was he took me.<eos> And everything else is what Diana saw.<eos> Did the Crusaders make these marks on the cloth, or was it already there when they got to it?<eos> Well, I don't know if the cloth was with the stick when they found it, but none of this was visible with spectral imaging.
But it's like... you get used to carrying your weapon, and when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing - a piece of yourself.<eos> - I know, but we have a license for that.<eos> I try to stop thinking about it, but it's not working out so well.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I put it back in the tunnel.
- I know, but we have a license for that.<eos> I try to stop thinking about it, but it's not working out so well.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I put it back in the tunnel.<eos> Don't you think you should put it someplace a little further out?
- Ooh, what's happening?<eos> - Now, ma'am.<eos> Dan Wells, Portland PD!<eos> We're gonna need you to open the door.<eos> Dan, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
Let's have it.<eos> Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine was working late at the lab last night when something went terribly wrong.<eos> The terribly wrong part is in here.<eos> Doesn't appear anything was taken.<eos> Her purse is by the door, probably where she dropped it, unopened.
- The skull guy.<eos> - Right.<eos> So it's logical that she's the connection.<eos> Maybe the blood on the mirror prevented something worse from happening.<eos> Probably a good idea not to clean it off, then.
She just said it might be dangerous.<eos> Nick!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> So you felt the arm come through the mirror in the spice shop?<eos> I saw it first, and then I felt it.
We used to make this strange goop.<eos> "Humano-Reptiliana: Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle Di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.<eos> Grimms in the South used to use it to lure out Galenchidas from the swampy marshes, and catch them and chop off their heads.
Could you tell more about blood magic?<eos> 'Cause it says in one of your mother's books that blood is associated with crossing over in death, like slain warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in its final state... human sacrifice on the altar... and sometimes blood is used as currency.<eos> - Eve, slow down.<eos> Blood magic is very dangerous.<eos> We would only need to use it to get to the other side.
We need to figure out what the hell is going on with this other place.<eos> There might be only one way.<eos> Which is?<eos> To go there.<eos> We have to find this thing and kill it.
I was the only one he didn't kill or couldn't kill... I don't know.<eos> Bullets don't have any effect on him.<eos> I still have the stick.<eos> Maybe that's why I'm not dead.<eos> I tried to use it on Wu and Hank, but it didn't do anything.
- This can't be happening.<eos> - He let you live again?<eos> It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.
What the hell is going on?<eos> You can have it.<eos> No, Nick!<eos> You can't give it to this lying son of a bitch devil.<eos> If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?
You can have it.<eos> No, Nick!<eos> You can't give it to this lying son of a bitch devil.<eos> If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?<eos> Why is he asking, when he can just take it from you?
What is he not telling you?<eos> You might want to ask your children what to do.<eos> Nick, you can't give it to him.<eos> I want the people I love to live again.<eos> - Take it!
She felt it, too.<eos> We are all descendents of the first Grimm.<eos> That stick you found... the one our Grimm ancestors buried...<eos> Is part of a much greater power.<eos> Guard it well.
I went out to get a terry cloth robe and there was this crowd and I asked them where Nordstrom's was and then the next thing I know, they dyed my thumb and an old lady who smelled like cumin wouldn't stop hugging me!<eos> - Mine smelled like paprika.<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> We cannot let anyone see this.<eos> I can't afford to lose this job, Gary, but I can't afford to keep it either.
Sorry. I know, I'm annoying.<eos> No. You're a genius.<eos> Talia. You've known gina porter for a while.<eos> Does she like music?<eos> No. No, she loves it.
But I'd scream right back at him.<eos> It was just that kind of thing, you know?<eos> He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on.<eos> A friendship like that?<eos> I don't how to describe it.
- you're back.<eos> - You better believe I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing<eos> - There's really not much to find, Mr. specter.<eos> - Well, let me lay it out for you.<eos> Velocity data solutions stole your technology, and they're rushing it to market, so you want to orchestrate a takeover and get back what's yours.
- Could be.<eos> It's got a rental QR code.<eos> Probably got some kinda tracking software on it, right?<eos> - That was my line.<eos> - Track it down, and find it fast.
People with broken legs.<eos> Abigail would remind you that money cannot fill the Wellspring.<eos> Without it, Fillory withers.<eos> Okay, well, we talked about this.<eos> When someone drops a log at a public pool, you just send a kid with a net to fish it out.
How did this happen?<eos> I have an idea...<eos> to help you.<eos> - Like a loophole? - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're gonna ironically abandon me here to go find it.
I shouldn't have told your mom that we're trying to have a baby.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The techs have uncovered an encrypted e-mail exchange on Todd Curry's computer, something either Curry or the person Curry was communicating with didn't want seen.<eos> They're working to crack it.
Yeah. I was looking for April.<eos> She's on a break right now.<eos> But I can answer any question you might have.<eos> Yeah. My wife, kate, has this necklace, and, I think it was a gift from her mother.<eos> And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.
And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.<eos> And I know she'd want to have it with her. I just...<eos> I understand.<eos> It can be in her hand through the surgery.<eos> I can make sure April gets it.
There's also a new therapy called tms, But I'd probably recommend you going. The traditional routes first.<eos> Tms?<eos> Transcranial magnetic stimulation.<eos> It's so far fda approved only for depression, But there is anecdotal evidence. That it can benefit people with spectrum disorders.<eos> I only mention it because we have a machine. Here at the hospital.
Just in case.<eos> Hey, sarah, You... you got a second?<eos> I heard that, Most of the psych residents get therapy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you tried it?
You put too much faith in them.<eos> Man is the superior machine.<eos> And I... am the superior man.<eos> I'm told you refuse to talk and that you welcome pain.<eos> And I love to make others feel it using the old ways.
- Do it!<eos> Okay.<eos> - That's a lot of blood.<eos> - Did you cut the radial artery?<eos> I was trying very hard to miss it. I...
Sir, the plates are switched, the transponder's toast.<eos> There's no way hydra can track the bus.<eos> Fast work.<eos> What's with the sat-radio?<eos> Well, I noticed the bus had a comms system, so I decrypted it and synched it up with this.
we need to be ready for anything.<eos> On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.
- I need the Darkhold.<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.
- What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.<eos> I want to use it as bait.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Did you sleep in here?<eos> Just getting a feel for my new office.<eos> You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?<eos> You put a bike rack in here, your first pro Bono, you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.
Thanks, Katrina.<eos> You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work.<eos> All I'm saying is I think you're rushing it.<eos> And I'm saying that, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave their statue up in the square.<eos> You tear it the hell down.
We took liberties.<eos> We guessed.<eos> You were right, William.<eos> He found a man with similar features and killed him.<eos> So he removed the bullet from his own shoulder and placed it in the corpse.
Jeff!<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.
Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.<eos> No, I didn't bring my car.<eos> You and Switchblade Sally ditched it at the front gate.
On the beach -- in the distance.<eos> You can't hear it?<eos> Listen!<eos> And that's as loud as your cousin can get it?<eos> - He can't bring it out any more?
You'd literally be left with nothing -- no house, no fancy motorbike.<eos> You had to think quickly.<eos> You knew where Nadine's car was.<eos> You also knew she kept a gun in her car.<eos> So, after the murder... you place the weapon and Julie's bloodied scarf in Nadine's car before pushing it into the sea.
! - Be nice, Suzy.<eos> Never know his name.<eos> White, brown hair, had a bad leg.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He broke it.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.<eos> Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.<eos> You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.<eos> I've never seen that book before.<eos> One of your coppers must have planted it.
- That sounds wonderful.<eos> So, can I leave you children alone a few more hours?<eos> He wants to take me out for a fried-egg sandwich.<eos> - What? - I met a man, a gentleman, at the town market and petting zoo.<eos> He has had a troubled past, and we're going to talk about it over a fried-egg sandwich.
Well, that should get my former teammates' attention, and when they travel back in time to save him, I'll be there waiting for them with open arms.<eos> Well, not too open, I hope.<eos> No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.<eos> I have no lingering attachment.<eos> In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
Winn's device worked.<eos> But Supergirl stayed up there.<eos> Your time is up, Agent Danvers.<eos> The positron cannon is ready to fire.<eos> You need to use it.
Can you hear that music?<eos> Is that coming from in here?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can still hear it. Can you hear it?
My brain's overloading.<eos> - Why a phone box?<eos> - I told you.<eos> Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?
Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?<eos> Why do you like it?<eos> Who said I like it?<eos> You kept it.
Therefore, if light is only a wave, then...<eos> Space is not empty?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So just as sound waves travel through air, light waves must travel through some sort of medium in space.<eos> Scientists called it the ether, an invisible but all-encompassing substance pervading the universe.
You know that?<eos> The Central Bank Governor told me.<eos> Really?<eos> The Nigerian oil industry is weaker than numbers suggest. Much weaker.<eos> A strong gust of wind could blow it over.
A couple of times, I've done a guy a favour. He comes in here...<eos> With an envelope or something and I stash it in a church. And I call another guy and let him know it's there. Go on.<eos> About two weeks ago, I had to leave an envelope...<eos> With a letter to a pow. Call him...<eos> Let him know. You have another package for him, he needs to get it today.
The last two terms.<eos> I copied them for you.<eos> They're yours to keep.<eos> I hope... they will undo some of the damage that I have done.<eos> And... if you would like my help, then I would love nothing more than to give it.
What if, instead of studying gases, we studied a cup of coffee?<eos> You really must sleep, Albert.<eos> Jacobus v'ant Hoff's Nobel paper from 1901:<eos> Particles in a solution behave like a gas.<eos> When sugar dissolves in coffee, water surrounds glucose and tears it from the sugar crystal, correct?
Unless...<eos> It's not Maxwell who gets it between the eyes. It's Newton.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Time is not absolute.<eos> Holy hell. I'm writing the paper, Michele. I dare them to ignore it.
So you're saying he might have ruffled feathers.<eos> I don't know for sure, but...<eos> I just wasn't listening.<eos> I should have sat him down, but I... .. I encouraged him.<eos> Right, every story he worked on, whether you ran it or not, I'll need copies.
Christ, I barely want that.<eos> I mean, the other part, you know, like, what I am.<eos> What, the... the vampire part?<eos> The not dying part.<eos> If you could have that, would you want it?
Consider it done, sir.<eos> - Call off the missile.<eos> - Call...<eos> It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it. - Whe...
It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it. - Whe...<eos> I...<eos> What do we do? Wh...<eos> Where do we send it?
Please, Emma, get us out of here.<eos> I'll keep trying.<eos> I promise.<eos> You still have the SIM card?<eos> Can you give it to Yusef's nephew, the one you met?
Close.<eos> Ah, you'll be fine.<eos> Drinks?<eos> Would you like to see Linda's room?<eos> Oh... I'd like to show it to you.
Shoes you stole from Devon's house, totally obstructing his positive energy.<eos> Anyway, this witness just picked you out of a photo lineup.<eos> And there's this.<eos> The malt liquor bottle you were chugging when we first met.<eos> It was still in the trash where I put it, and guess whose DNA is all over it?
Enjoy.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey, man, get the...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Thanks for the help, guys. Really appreciate it.
What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Everything, apparently.<eos> Where'd you get a goddamn gun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He brought it.
My God, you do not eat at all?<eos> Nobody eats with this war.<eos> You need to rest, you are exhausted.<eos> The solution of relativity is very close.<eos> I almost touched it.
Albert.<eos> Nobel laureate in chemistry.<eos> This is something.<eos> I'm not a genius, like you, Albert.<eos> I was only given a problem, and I found a way to solve it.
I have an offer for you.<eos> I can not afford to speak with him publicly.<eos> You can be sure of my prudence.<eos> Read the article with the exposure of relativity?<eos> I think you support it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein.<eos> The question was for your husband.<eos> How did you come to know Chaim Weizmann?<eos> It's all right, Chaim, you can admit you don't understand.<eos> Albert, you have been explaining general relativity for more than three hours, and I am fully convinced that you understand it.
Yes, but if we do, we cannot also know where that thing is.<eos> Does that sound logical to you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> And according to my esteemed colleague, the particle does not exist at all until we observe it.
But we can still measure the velocity of that second particle.<eos> And since they are both mathematically related, we can then determine the velocity of the first particle, so we'd know both its position and velocity without having to measure them both.<eos> Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disproved. With certainty.<eos> You are vanquished, sir.<eos> But... what if the act of measuring the first particle influenced the second, changed it somehow at the time it was measured?
Elsa had strategy.<eos> I am not Elsa.<eos> No, you certainly are not.<eos> The only thing you show enthusiasm for is keeping my pipe from me.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
- Albert, we've been down this road many times.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This is different.<eos> It seems that the more the rest of physics accepts my work, the more you resist it.
McKee.<eos> When you question the integrity of the Bureau's actions, you question the integrity of my actions.<eos> And such questions... they can get a man in a whole mess of trouble.<eos> Let Einstein speak out, and he'll be drowned by the patriotic citizens of this fine country.<eos> It takes a man a lifetime to build his reputation, and yet a mere moment to scuttle it.
Order shots.<eos> I will be back in a minute.<eos> -That's my song.<eos> -I know it's your song.<eos> -I love it.
I will be back in a minute.<eos> -That's my song.<eos> -I know it's your song.<eos> -I love it.<eos> -And you sing it so well.
Oof.<eos> Vincent has an agenda.<eos> Does she know?<eos> Rosie, show Mr. Dunbar Jr. to the door.<eos> Don't open it.
Now, isn't this a literary club?<eos> I've written a book...<eos> "Steady at the Helm."<eos> Sure.<eos> I tore through it in one sitting.
But I don't want to talk about this place. I want to hear about the world.<eos> Well... I'm having problems with that bond I bought upstate.<eos> I saw.<eos> Albany moved the gaming license.<eos> You trying to get it back?
Your armor's genetically locked, making it impossible for anyone else to use it.<eos> If you're wondering how I found you... No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I had a hunch the dormant Blink drive was emitting a subspace signal.<eos> The specific signature so we could shield against it.
- Their leader?<eos> - He's your friend?<eos> - I'm fond of him.<eos> Why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?<eos> I wanted to, but they entrusted me with their secret, and I didn't see any harm in keeping it.
It would take a highly advanced mind to even recognize it, and approximately 87,560 computational hours to decode.<eos> Ten years...<eos> - Give or take.<eos> - And yet... there are counterlogical aspects to the puzzle that would be best served by a more intuitive approach.<eos> So someone with both android logic and emotional reasoning could solve it faster?
Imagine them under threat.<eos> They turn to you but the odds seem hopeless until... you discover a piece of technology that could change everything.<eos> What would you do to get it?<eos> Anything.<eos> Now imagine you had this piece of technology, the means to save them, only to have someone take it from you.
Android, Five, how's it going down there?<eos> We've made several changes to the Blink Drive that I believe will overcome the damage done by the Ishida scientists.<eos> How will we know for sure?<eos> First, we'll run a full diagnostic, followed by a series of simulations.<eos> If the instability persists, we should be able to detect it, long before we attempt a first live test.
Oh, shit.<eos> [Two] So much for a walk in the park.<eos> What? This isn't my fault.<eos> She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.<eos> Evidently, when novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
I understand that.<eos> None of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.<eos> Take my life if you will.<eos> I offer it gladly, knowing that what I did was for the good of the Empire.
[Marcus] I'd say "the one and only," but lately, that doesn't seem to be the case.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Seem to be locked out of all the systems.<eos> Their android must've installed some kind of fail-safe.<eos> [Portia] I should be able to override it, but I'll need to do it on the bridge.
I know, that's terrible, isn't it?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> It's not easy being someone's entire world, you know?<eos> Why didn't you tell me when we were back on Hyperion8?<eos> What was I supposed to say? You used to have a happy family life, but you threw it away?
My crewman, Boone, when he came to, he said it was a gateway.<eos> He also said he could hear voices in his head.<eos> I think maybe he can.<eos> He's had those things in him before.<eos> We managed to get it out, but what if it affected him?
You can disarm the nuke before it hits.<eos> We've still got a crew member down there!<eos> We've got people down there, too, Raza, but it was an executive order...<eos> It's out of my hands.<eos> If you don't disarm the nuke, we'll have no choice but to take it out ourselves.
What is that?<eos> - Larry's skate wrench.<eos> - Right.<eos> I talked to my brother-cousin over at the police department, got it out of impound.<eos> Sorry, I tried to get your lip balm, but they blew it up.
- Here, come on.<eos> - Untie it, untie it.<eos> It's the water.<eos> Over the years, the water's been infused by the moissanite.<eos> You drink it, you grow your crops with it.
What was it?<eos> You used the protomolecule on children.<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> We made the protomolecule do what we wanted.<eos> We made it in our own image.
We'll see about that.<eos> There it is!<eos> In the Ag Dome.<eos> Ready PDCs. Fire control to me.<eos> Why kill it?
MCRN is securing a landing corridor for an inbound burner.<eos> Those scientists were packin' up the lab to leave with that thing.<eos> I'm guessin' that was their ride.<eos> They're not gonna be too happy when they find out their lab rat is loose.<eos> Even more reason to kill it now.
Absorbed instantly through the skin, without a trace.<eos> Cardiac arrest.<eos> An act of God.<eos> I mean, this stuff was staggeringly effective.<eos> But then, they banned it under the Brussels Act.
Cardiac arrest.<eos> An act of God.<eos> I mean, this stuff was staggeringly effective.<eos> But then, they banned it under the Brussels Act.<eos> And yet, here we are, using it.
I have to go.<eos> Enjoy the scotch.<eos> Hall!<eos> Sandicot's not getting the gaming license.<eos> The commission went another way, gave it to a town in the Catskills.
If you cross him, he'll put a fucking ding in your universe.<eos> But these are all exaggerations, derivative.<eos> They don't limn the truth of an indefinable essence.<eos> They don't speak to my real feelings.<eos> It's no exaggeration to say that Bobby Axelrod is the man who gave me my life, or at least let me keep it.
- At the end of the year?<eos> Now. Mid-semester bonus.<eos> The real one's still coming.<eos> Should I move their desk closer to the bimah?<eos> Fitting for the new head of research who understands what the job entails and is willing to execute it.
That's why Mother sold my horse.<eos> - Okay. - Write that down.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Your dad sold it to get the IRS off of his back.
- Pretty please?<eos> - Well, when you say it like that.<eos> I wanna say something about my paella.<eos> Now, it is so good, when you taste it, what's gonna happen, Will?<eos> You're gonna wanna take it to a church and marry it, Rog.
Okay, wha... this!<eos> What do you want me to say, Selina?<eos> What do you want me to say, Tom, huh?<eos> That back when I was in the Senate, the only reason that I co-sponsored S-473 was because I had a crush on you?<eos> That when we were in Los Angeles and we walked out onto the stage to accept the nomination, and you grabbed my hand and you held it up high, and I was like, "Oh, my God, he's holding my hand."
But I wanna tell you this one particular story that's one of my favorite Southern memories.<eos> It's when my daddy first took me hunting for rabbits.<eos> And I gotta tell you, my rifle was bigger than I was.<eos> I was just a tiny, little thing.<eos> But the Second Amendment certainly did guarantee my right to use it.
I certainly don't need to apologize for anything.<eos> Okay, lookit, politicians borrow stuff all the time.<eos> - Personal stories?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I mean, you should be honored that I would think your story was special enough to even consider using it.
With Blaine, it took a couple of days.<eos> Got it.<eos> You know, I had this whole speech planned.<eos> It was funny and heartfelt, profound.<eos> But it feels like a waste if you're just gonna forget it anyway.
Struck me those kids would do anything to get out of the house.<eos> - I mean, Mia did come here fairly regular. - Yeah?<eos> Why was that?<eos> Mam and dad collected their rent in cash.<eos> She collected it so it wouldn't go through the books, you know.
Um, how does that bring them closure?<eos> It comes with a note saying she's dead.<eos> Look, nothing we can do will bring this poor girl back to life.<eos> I know, but-- Not even a voodoo priestess, flown here from Haiti at great expense, and then every year, on Grandma's birthday, they throw it your face!<eos> So the best thing we can do now is to fill this car to the rafters with dynamite and shove it over a cliff.
- Why are you doing this?<eos> God, they're doing a raid on our building.<eos> Come on, Professor, let's get out of here.<eos> No, the Lumen.<eos> The book'll be fine; they'll never find it.
Stay out of sight.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> I realize now that everything gained can just as easily be lost.<eos> The book is safe, Professor.<eos> We'll go back there and get it, as soon as we get out of this.
I think the time off did him some good.<eos> I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.<eos> I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days.<eos> You been working on this leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm left it off of Jane's body because it is a dud.
Stepulov's targeting Erin because I used his son as leverage.<eos> No, not just your daughter.<eos> There are hundreds of civilians in there, people from all over the country.<eos> It must have been his plan all along.<eos> And he gave us the time of the attack so he could call it off if his son lived, or not if he died...
The rack's fitted with a modified cell phone.<eos> An incoming call triggers the explosion.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> If I can kill the cell signal, there's no way to set off the bomb.<eos> 90 seconds, how do we stop it?
What's "the formula"?<eos> Okay, off the record, it's an old Daedalus tradition.<eos> It's a risk-reward algorithm we use to determine which risky activity is actually worth the risk.<eos> Cheating on tests, shoplifting... unprotected sex... you know, the fun stuff.<eos> But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.
Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.<eos> That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
Anyone gonna... you know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ron?<eos> Was it that bad?<eos> I have to say, when Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, opposite the girl who wrote it, I said to myself, "Ron, old boy", "you've won three Tony Awards, and here you are, directing a failed sitcom actor's vanity project."
Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play.<eos> It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good-- it is.<eos> But no one's gonna come see it, sir, unless you tell them to, so I am begging you, please... give us another chance.
See?<eos> Fresh meats that you could actually go and pick out the chicken.<eos> - He would kill the chicken...<eos> - What?<eos> ... defeather it, clean it, - and then wrap it up for you.
- All right, look, let's go over it.<eos> - Okay. Bartender's an old guy.<eos> He's not the sharpest.<eos> Every night at 8:30, he starts to close out at the end of his shift.<eos> He opens the register, takes the cash out so that Ray and his guys can come pick it up later.
No, I want to sing.<eos> Sometimes they'll make good decisions.<eos> It's just a meeting with a director, okay?<eos> It's not like I'm gonna get the part.<eos> Don't do that. I want you to get it.
Vallieres.<eos> His intelligence. Made us aware of a secret allied training facility. In canada known as camp x.<eos> Why didn't you approach anyone. With your plan to act as a triple agent?<eos> As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks.<eos> The safest action was to secure. As much intelligence as I could first, Then to bring it straight to berlin.
You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia?<eos> - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.<eos> That's the trick.<eos> The mind killer.<eos> Your disease convinces you, you don't have it.
Heard about that arm.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Sherman, don't jinx it.<eos> I got two more days before it's mine.<eos> In East Peck, if no one claims a body part within two weeks, you get to keep it.
Our situation isn't inbearable.<eos> It's unbearable.<eos> Aunt Josephine left us in the care of Captain Sham, and I don't know what we can do about it.<eos> I wish we'd never read Mr. Poe that note.<eos> Then we could've torn it up and forged a new one in her handwriting that didn't mention...
Count Olaf didn't have to break into Aunt Josephine's house.<eos> He was in disguise and Aunt Josephine fell for it, hook, line and sinker.<eos> Please, there's no time for fishing jokes.<eos> There's a very simple way to tell who wrote this note.<eos> We simply have to compare it to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.
1957.<eos> Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...
The painting is en route from Austria.<eos> But the auction is tomorrow.<eos> It wasn't going to auction.<eos> We had a private collector interested.<eos> But if there is more than one party interested, I have a financial obligation to put it up...
So we steal it from them before the auction?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Olivia could get suspicious.<eos> She needs to buy the painting, and never know we were here.<eos> Okay, we just need to figure out another way to get it.
We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.<eos> I don't like vodka...<eos> It burns my throat.<eos> Haha! I never liked it either.<eos> But since I'm working in poland, I learned to love it.
Shall we begin?<eos> While you wait, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife?<eos> I don't believe I have.<eos> One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap.<eos> Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.
You had access to that chip.<eos> My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.
My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.<eos> I think you sold it to them.
- Names are unimportant now.<eos> What matters is that we both have what the other wants.<eos> So I propose a trade.<eos> If you want to see your colleague alive again, bring our system to Cornerstone Park, east entrance, in the next 30 minutes.<eos> And take care to bring it all, or for every piece missing, I will extract a piece of Agent Navabi.
Father Brown did it.<eos> Katherine warned me about him.<eos> Said he's a corrupt, evil, selfish...<eos> Father Brown is the best man I have ever met.<eos> And if you say one more word against him, I will take your silly little sign and insert it into a place where no-one can read it. Huh!
Why was he digging a hole?<eos> He was burying something.<eos> A wooden box.<eos> Beautiful carved thing, it was.<eos> Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to go and then I dug it up.
Look at it.<eos> I can dream, can't I?<eos> I don't have long.<eos> The inspector will wonder where I've got to.<eos> A man was seen burying it in the woods yesterday morning.
Hello, I'm Bunty.<eos> What a darling little thing you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Oh, well, you're welcome to borrow it any time you like.
What a darling little thing you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Oh, well, you're welcome to borrow it any time you like.<eos> You should wear it to one of my soirees.
- Is that your memoirs?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I finished my book.<eos> It's a story about my sestras.<eos> I call it, Orphan Black.
What the hell happened to me?<eos> I promise, I'm going to tell you everything, but it's gonna have to be in person.<eos> Roman, look in your pocket.<eos> There's a coin in there, it's a very special coin.<eos> I gave it to you when we were little.
It's mostly just vascular repair.<eos> I'll look for organ damage.<eos> I'll take care of the limb.<eos> I'm worried about that right leg.<eos> - She tore it up pretty badly. - Mm-hmm.
Well, a neighbor called 911, and then the firefighters broke the gate down.<eos> Listen, they saved your life.<eos> Damn razor wire.<eos> I got most of it down, and then I fell off the ladder into the whole mess of it.<eos> You were taking it down?
Listen, Dr. NotGrey, I don't care what you've done.<eos> Dr. Grey found my cancer.<eos> She told me about it.<eos> She held my hand while I bawled about it.<eos> She told me how she was gonna take it out.
I'm sure there's more to it than that.<eos> Well, it's not right, what Bailey did.<eos> You can't just throw anybody in as Chief of General Surgery.<eos> Keps is good, but Grey put in the time for that job, okay?<eos> She deserves it.
At the expense of her own?<eos> She came in here perfectly healthy.<eos> If you found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> - The kidney would already be in him.<eos> - Yeah, but it isn't, and if we don't put it in someone soon, it's gonna die an no one gets it, so who's it going to?
You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery,"<eos> but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.<eos> Yes, I took your father's name, but it's what I did with it. It's what I made with it.
In a few hours you're gonna get a call from this firm offering you a good deal on the Kendall brutality case.<eos> Yes, I don't disagree.<eos> I, um, I just want you to know, there's an associate here who found the key piece of evidence that the case turned on, and she was just fired.<eos> You left this.<eos> Give it to someone who needs it.
The interviewer merely tries to ease the way for a liar to admit the truth, that's all.<eos> So you tend to minimize the crime?<eos> Yes.<eos> According to Mr. Diyardian's own testimony, he made it clear to the suspect that the theft was not a big matter.<eos> They just wanted to solve it.
Your Honor, I'd like to cross-examine.<eos> This is not a full trial.<eos> This is merely a motion to dismiss.<eos> Yeah, I know, but this information just came into our hands.<eos> We were hoping to use it at trial, but... we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we could ask it now.
Amazing.<eos> Phil fainted.<eos> - Claire.<eos> - Oh, come on, they were gonna find out.<eos> I'm not spending $15 on this picture and not show it to everyone.
This contract.<eos> This acknowledgment of the transfer of 12 eggs from Lake Drive.<eos> The Genome labs acknowledgment that they transferred one egg to you.<eos> And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.
The Genome labs acknowledgment that they transferred one egg to you.<eos> And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.<eos> Regrettably, here's the problem...<eos> You've already destroyed it?
The, uh, problem, Laura, is... the last remaining ova has already been fertilized.<eos> - By who?<eos> - That's the question.<eos> We don't know.<eos> We located it at Chicago Poly-Tech, in the genetics lab, and we're bringing them to court.
Thanks.<eos> It was fantastic.<eos> You were fantastic.<eos> Did you, did you see his face when you made him read the date?<eos> You made him read it.
Basically, some people are just better at things than others.<eos> That's what coding makes you realize.<eos> The number seven is the number seven.<eos> If you call it the number eight, you don't actually make it the number eight, you just embarrass yourself.
- I do. - You could have protected yourself...<eos> - Please, don't mention it.<eos> And instead, you protected me.<eos> You got me this job.<eos> You deserved it.
Rutger ate Josh's whitefish.<eos> Wait. That squiggle is the fish?<eos> Put waves up above so we know it's underwater.<eos> Oh, good idea.<eos> Okay, none of this matters because the fish wasn't underwater when he ate it.
I still can't believe I gave all my money away.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, - you haven't exactly been yourself of late. - Yeah.<eos> Listen, I wanted to ask you... what's the last thing you remember?<eos> I was in New Mexico for work, I was walking through this Navajo gift shop.<eos> I saw a cool belt buckle, so I picked it up, and... next thing I knew, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.
It's Cheval something or other.<eos> It's valuable, so it must be good.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you or your... deadly light back so soon.<eos> Well, something's been bothering me.<eos> When you first saw my wound... you asked if Lucifer had done it.
The car bomb.<eos> It was as if his security detail knew where to look.<eos> - And you think I told him?<eos> - No one else knew.<eos> Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it.
Maybe she can.<eos> How?<eos> Police radios operate on an RF frequency just like Maggie's hearing device, which can cause interference.<eos> All right, go to frequency 154.400 and turn it up.<eos> Turn it all the way up.
I've been dousing Nikolaj's shoes with it to scare off bullies at his preschool. - Did it work?<eos> - No, now they call him pee boy.<eos> He's much worse off.<eos> But wolf urine definitely scares off rats.<eos> We can use it to herd them toward the traps. - What about me?
Okay?<eos> Okay, you may have broken your wrist.<eos> I think we're gonna have to brace it, okay?<eos> Yeah, the main medical kit's in the galley.<eos> - I can go unlock it.
Also, I was in the hall.<eos> I figured I should move the big, giant, scary tumor or something.<eos> - I have a giant, scary tumor.<eos> - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.
Of course He does.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm a faggot.<eos> I mean, God's love is everywhere.<eos> It's about accepting it.
I took off your shoes... and I put a blanket on you, and I left you there alone to sleep it off.<eos> - Let me touch your hand.<eos> - No.<eos> I want to show you that nothing happens.<eos> I'll touch it and just let it go.
You're wearing my jacket?<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're twinsies!<eos> No. You can't do that!<eos> Well, I asked you where you got it, and you told me.
I know that the divisions between us run deep, that they may very well be insurmountable.<eos> But I implore both of our armies for this one moment to come together as allies and honor a ceasefire so that the injured may be removed from the field of battle.<eos> There may come a day when our courage fails us, when we forsake our friendships and break the bonds of fellowship, but today is not that day.<eos> And perhaps in showing our humanity...<eos> We might just save it.
Rude!<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Yes, but you do it so well, and with such... style.
I will never stop fighting.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> Kill her.<eos> Get rid of that.<eos> But I will take this mask... so I can add it to my collection.
You know what?<eos> You both need to listen, what with all these bees in your bonnet, all right?<eos> That young girl's situation with the baby, you know, you cleaning house, and looking for this John Doe... something bad happens, and we try to exert control.<eos> But sometimes, it is better to live with the pain for a little while.<eos> Process it, you know?
No, no.<eos> Excuse me with Mr. Director.<eos> - Well?<eos> - He has to come back.<eos> 3 days ago we were ridiculous for proposing this operation... And now we send it to the slaughter?
Too late.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Gentlemen, have put in place a plan... to damage Iran's nuclear capability.<eos> We have been informed by the French citizen... to whom they had the bad idea to implicate in an unfair way.<eos> We could use that information and sell it to the Iranian government.
Gave her a present, apparently.<eos> A ring.<eos> They left together on the bike.<eos> I love this job.<eos> I just want to do it well.
You said you had a case.<eos> Your government's Witness Protection list has been stolen.<eos> You know who stole it?<eos> No, but I know who's going to steal it next.<eos> A stolen luxury vehicle in Atlanta being pursued by the private security contractors hired to protect it.
There aren't different types of piss!<eos> There are!<eos> Like fine wines! Jesus Christ!<eos> I can't wait to get back to Chiswick.<eos> Yeah, because London piss is like sparkling water, you just drink it straight back down again. Pretty much, yeah.
That's the whole point.<eos> We don't know what happened, do we?<eos> Could be an accident, someone's fallen over, the shoe's come off.<eos> Could be an older gentlemen with Alzheimer's, say.<eos> He's gone for a wander, doesn't know where he left it.
Jacqueline, someone somewhere is missing a shoe and if I can bring that person and that shoe together, then I will have achieved that.<eos> All, right, David.<eos> Let's say this for a second, yeah.<eos> Say I'm the person that lost that shoe.<eos> Now I go back to look for it, but it's not there because you, you've got it in your house.
We need to track down the man with the Panama hat.<eos> Agreed.<eos> So I am going to visit some hat shops.<eos> Hat shops?<eos> Well, he had to buy it from somewhere, didn't he?
"A tragedy for her, but for me it's the most marvellous escape route."<eos> Interesting.<eos> Are you thinking that that book might be connected to the murder?<eos> It's possible.<eos> If Mrs Rudge had read it, she would know the show was fixed, and she could have had it cancelled.
And that you have borrowed our treasured oil lamp to solicit a valuation.<eos> Well, I didn't think you'd mind, seeing as criminality was involved.<eos> Well?<eos> He actually tried to cheat me.<eos> He made out that your oil lamp wasn't by Robert Harper at all, as if Robert hadn't given it to you with his own hand.
I don't know.<eos> He's an agricultural expert.<eos> Has he said anything to you about bugs?<eos> No.<eos> He knows about wheat and what can kill it.
He'll be fine.<eos> How's he taking it, Elizabeth?<eos> The same as me... it's upsetting.<eos> For me, too.<eos> Well, if they've come up with some kind of super wheat, think what getting our hands on it could mean to us.
_ _<eos> Carol Anne Keane believes Larry's missing walking stick was the murder weapon.<eos> She's like a dog with a bone trying to find it.
_ _<eos> Carol Anne Keane believes Larry's missing walking stick was the murder weapon.<eos> She's like a dog with a bone trying to find it.<eos> Ironically, Larry's dog found it, thinking it was a bone.
In fact, my wife has never been happier.<eos> Uh, I'd like to reiterate that I am offering a $50,000 reward for whomever finds the murder weapon... Larry Henderson's walking/murdering stick.<eos> Technically, if it's the murder weapon, we'll have to turn it in to the prosecution.<eos> But the stick is gonna come back clean. Right, Larry?<eos> I told you... the dog must have buried it.
Then go ahead and get it.<eos> Be expensive draining that lake.<eos> 'Course, you're always free to go in and find the club yourself. Though I wouldn't recommend it.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> We'll find a way to get it.
They've stood for something larger than themselves, and that takes courage.<eos> And you've shown a lot of courage, too.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Despite all the garbage that you have had to deal with, you asked for the truth, and you faced it.
- You?<eos> Time loops exist, then I'm team Sarah Connor:<eos> "No fate but what we make."<eos> - Fine, I'll grab your book for you.<eos> - I can get it myself.
Does that include the cactuses?<eos> Not the cactuses, Murray, but it does include the cacti.<eos> Chief, why aren't we drilling?<eos> There's water in the ground.<eos> Let's go and get it, for Christ's sake.
Freda?<eos> Does this sound like the actions of a sane man?<eos> Well, that's not for me to say now, is it?<eos> David Morgan founded this colony.<eos> And now he's brought it to the brink of extinction.
- Ah-ah-ah!<eos> I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.<eos> The paraffins alone would have killed you.<eos> I'll get you a different one.<eos> Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
- You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.<eos> - I always thought I had some kind of... God-level good luck.<eos> - True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.<eos> I can teach you how to use it at will.
Isn't it a little racist?<eos> Racist?<eos> You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?
You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?<eos> Uh, I haven't had any African-American guests.<eos> So I'm the person with the darkest skin tone that's seen it, and I'm the most offended.
We don't need him.<eos> We need his energy. - No.<eos> - You're born, huge energy; you die, bigger energy, especially a demigod.<eos> That is what we are after here, people, the energy.<eos> Right now, he's just a skin sack hiding it from us.
We execute him.<eos> No.<eos> But it means so much to me that you want to.<eos> We put the note back into the dirty dishes.<eos> We let him find it and take it back to the Fu Fighters' base.
Try to understand.<eos> Try to listen.<eos> What do I not understand?<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> Do you want me to explain to you that it's not easy to pack your life and just throw it away?
It'd be a shame for it to end all right here.<eos> They kidnapped my brother.<eos> Okay? And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?<eos> But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and feed it to you.
It's supposed to get your heart rate up and relax you at the same time.<eos> - My gosh.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Should I lock the door?<eos> Maybe you want to leave it cracked just in case I need to be resuscitated.
He has sentience.<eos> It's "Westworld."<eos> Oh, wait a minute, Sarge.<eos> I don't have eyes on that room.<eos> Hang on. I'll find it. Oh, no.
Hmm. Totally.<eos> A woman who picks up that many men, what are the odds one night she picked the wrong guy?<eos> While we wait on our sketches, I've got another one of the first class passengers coming to the station later, you free?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I absolutely can't miss it.
Flynn jumped to Sacramento, present day.<eos> He was there for maybe an hour, and then he jumped again to New York, 1780.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Well, how does Flynn jump so fast and so many times in a row?<eos> The nuke... the one he got in Vegas, if he's using it as a battery, the way we think he is.
The Monks are not our friends.<eos> They have invaded Earth and made its people slaves.<eos> They cling onto power by means of a powerful transmitter broadcasting myths and lies that suggest that they have always been here.<eos> In fact, they have only been here a few months and have falsified and manipulated our history.<eos> Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of Earth, which will weaken and undermine the Monks' power.

Lieutenant.<eos> Heard you found some sort of tracker on Kelly's car and that car thieves were responsible for this.<eos> Yeah, well, my team's looking into that, but we still don't have enough to release him yet.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Look, a carjacking crew may well have put that tracker on Kelly's car, and they may well have intended on stealing it later.
Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.<eos> It's going to pump the bacteria into the atmosphere.<eos> So switch it off.
- Why?<eos> - You lied.<eos> You hijacked our vacation.<eos> This family has a tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.<eos> Today, we go back to it our way.
We just had a few more questions.<eos> Starting with, why is Dan's missing cover art here, for sale?<eos> This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, hero of the Ogden Twiddlyhut series, has ever appeared in print.<eos> And who says it's missing?<eos> I won it off Dan in a bet.
Those convictions are my convictions, too.<eos> So this is about both of us, okay?<eos> You made a mistake, a big one.<eos> But you're gonna find a way to live with it.<eos> And you're gonna make every day you do this job going forward all about doing it the right way.
Really?<eos> Sounds like I've got some catching up to do.<eos> Right, JP, what've you got?<eos> Well, Sir, The victim's bag was found just here.<eos> I've gone through it.
You enjoying the book, Sir?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Very much. You liked it as well, Dwayne?<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, what did you make of it when you first read it?
Ah, yes, the note was a nice touch.<eos> The fact that you'd got Esther's fingerprints onto it, and no-one else's, was smart.<eos> And we already knew that Esther had helped you with the festival admin.<eos> I mean, there would've been reams of paper with her prints on.<eos> All you had to do was use some gloves to take a piece, print the note off and then sign it.
I'm sure it would've been easy enough to lay your hands on a copy of Esther's signature.<eos> And then, all you had to do was slip the faked suicide note into her handbag -- after you'd killed her.<eos> But as clever as it was, that suicide note was also your undoing.<eos> That it was a typed note meant that it somehow lacked credibility.<eos> But also the fact that Esther's signature was written at the bottom in Biro, rather than the fountain pen that she always used, confirmed to me that she neither wrote it, nor signed it.
And I heard you took care of the man yourself.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Sir, I'd like to renew my request for field training.<eos> I'll consider it. Once I've caught up. Thank you, krystina.
All right!<eos> All right.<eos> Alistair thought his, his fancy education made him a genius -- always making "improvements" to the process, never telling anyone.<eos> After the fire I found out he'd altered the system.<eos> A pipe cracked, Robert tried to fix it, but, yes, the fire was Alistair's fault.
"Archer knows the truth.<eos> "I can't bear going on knowing what I've done to you, "and knowing you will find out, "I can't face life with you blaming me.<eos> "Goodbye, son.<eos> All my love, Dad."<eos> So when you found that note and read it, I think you realised exactly what had gone on.
All bodies are good bodies.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You love "Game of Thrones."<eos> I mean, you uploaded a super cut of all the nudity and called it a "thigh-light reel"... which was very clever.
Okay.<eos> He tied Wonder Woman to a rocket ship.<eos> Oh, the D.A. said he tied her to a rocket ship, but if that's the case, where's the rope, Teddy?<eos> - Where's the rope then?<eos> - Find it.
So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.<eos> - They declined?<eos> - And denied.<eos> Petrov does not want us to see what's on board.<eos> I understand this is a difficult decision but there are human lives at stake, and if help arrives, - Petrov will be forced to take it.
-If there is a debate.<eos> Hits them at their strength. Takes the military credibility away.<eos> This is the kind of thing that can turn an election.<eos> Whatever this costs... it's worth it.<eos> Let's secure it and then verify it.
She has several broken bones, and significant burns to her body on her right side.<eos> We extracted glass and metal shards from her body, as well as fragments of leather.<eos> Perhaps from a suitcase?<eos> I believe she may have been carrying the bomb.<eos> Carrying it?
Reproductive manipulation?<eos> This Demeter was attempting to fertilize the egg - outside the womb?<eos> - I don't know how successfully.<eos> You could ask her, though.<eos> She'd be thrilled to discuss her work with someone who understands it.
I understand.<eos> I want to help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Er... so, just to be clear -- you've all been out with Mr Lewis and Miss Boyd on their boat the last few days?<eos> Yes, we chartered it for the week.
Well, then you should know... this was found on the boat where Mr Lewis was murdered.<eos> My uncle used to collect cufflinks, must've had about 100 pairs.<eos> I know on the surface that may not appear to be unusual, until I tell you he only had the one arm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He lost it in a...
But if the Mothership falls into Rittenhouse's hands, it's too dangerous.<eos> Flynn?<eos> Most likely discovered he was trying to... Do the right thing.<eos> I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess.<eos> He... he brought it back, okay?
I'm good.<eos> - Oh, Scully.<eos> You bummed about Cindy or you just feel at home in a body bag?<eos> - We use the same medicated powder.<eos> I could smell it.
She's right.<eos> She just shot this guy. He's DOA.<eos> I have diplomatic immunity.<eos> And that bag is my diplomatic pouch.<eos> By law, you must give it back to me.
The truth.<eos> I hold it dear.<eos> I didn't kill your accountant.<eos> Your deal was falling apart.<eos> I stepped in and took it.
Honestly, it was great.<eos> I was thinking about what you said, about why I needed that.<eos> Truth is, I still don't know.<eos> But what I do know is that this family's the most important thing in my life.<eos> I don't wanna lose it.
Ogre...<eos> "Ogre-us not-real-icus"?<eos> I don't know, it looks pretty human.<eos> OK, I have a theory.<eos> This bullshit story about a bear in the woods, you made it up, right?
Okay, so that leaves three board members alive, including Al-Khatib, the money guy.<eos> He may know John's plans.<eos> Where do we find him, Rachel?<eos> You can eliminate the Board, John, but we still need protection.<eos> We'll get it.
When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Our friend Calvin was trying to jump up and pull down a fire escape ladder.<eos> He grabbed it, but it, like, shot down on him.
I got ten cases here that I haven't even read yet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I got a medical card around here somewhere.<eos> Wanna see it?<eos> Save it.
Some Latin Player he was beefing with.<eos> But you know how that go.<eos> No one saw nothing.<eos> Hey, what happened to the gun?<eos> I never found it.
But you know how that go.<eos> No one saw nothing.<eos> Hey, what happened to the gun?<eos> I never found it.<eos> Picked it off his body after they shot him.
The one that's circled.<eos> "Kimball Factory:<eos> A Kiddie Sex Den"?<eos> The article was posted a few weeks ago on "The Anders Report."<eos> I printed it out.
Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I know you didn't ask, but this thing with Palmer, wherever you decide to take it,
- Mr. Beckett has also thoughtfully provided an affidavit that states that he was on PCP and fell down the stairs accidentally.<eos> Mr. Beckett.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> How's the arm, Rodney?<eos> Still can't straighten it all the way.
That's a timing device.<eos> You take a brown paper bag, and you fill it with an oxidizer... kitty litter or chlorine.<eos> Then you take a light bulb and you fill it with fuel... gasoline, cooking oil, whatever.<eos> And you see the drill hole?<eos> That's where they filled it.
Enough.<eos> Every resource is being allocated.<eos> The city attorney's even on his way in.<eos> Now, the DEA has information for us.<eos> We can hear it or we can yell at each other.
I know our apartment's small, but I think we can make room.<eos> No, Sheldon.<eos> We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.<eos> We do have Sheldon's old room.<eos> If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.
We got to figure this out.<eos> We got to fix her.<eos> We will, okay?<eos> The answer's in here somewhere.<eos> We'll find it.
[sobbing] - Whoa, whoa, ma'am.<eos> - My baby!<eos> Let 'em work.<eos> Let 'em work.<eos> We need to pull it out.
I'm not going anywhere, and I will not leave you.<eos> I had a feeling you'd be here.<eos> I had a feeling you'd find me.<eos> You followed me.<eos> Well... journalism might be dead in America, but where I come from, if you want to find a story, you go look for it.
I thought you were a PE teacher?<eos> Argh! Jesus Christ!<eos> Is that my money?<eos> - Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.
- Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!
- Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!<eos> It's in the post.<eos> I sent it to your wife.
See, that's the problem with your side.<eos> You think that the truth matters to anyone, but this is a post-truth world.<eos> Nobody wants a boring fact.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> And the better the story, the more faith they have in the person who tells it.
All of us that are locked inside this bunker, we're the cogs Shepherd needs to enable... the Truman protocol.<eos> - We're phase two.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> The phase two attack already happened.<eos> - We stopped it.
- Captain Holt's mom.<eos> - The creator.<eos> - Widowed at age 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt singlehandedly raised two children and still managed to become one of the first black, female federal judges.<eos> - Wow, someone read her Wikipedia page.<eos> - No, Jake, I wrote it.
- Shame.<eos> - Are you blind?<eos> This place looks amazing.<eos> It looks like a Swedish airport.<eos> Everyone's gonna love it.
- You're the cuck, snowflake!<eos> - No, you are!<eos> - Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.<eos> - Yes, it's all no one is talking about.<eos> - Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and... I lost it.
- Santiago!<eos> You did it!<eos> - And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.<eos> It's too loud!<eos> We can all hear it!
Because I'm a rebel, and we're in love.<eos> Doi.<eos> Diaz, I've been calling you.<eos> Why weren't you answering your phone?<eos> Don't have it.
Here.<eos> Close that tab.<eos> That's the article.<eos> Hawkins ran you out of New York and took away your life.<eos> If you help us, maybe we can help you get it back.
- Won't put it down.<eos> - I put mine down.<eos> Horse cancer.<eos> Your meeting with Emily is about to start.<eos> She wanted to do it in her new office.
There is no hope.<eos> No!<eos> Hope lives.<eos> It is everywhere.<eos> I've seen it, everyone you have touched, the people you have helped.
If they send you a letter from Motor Vehicles, come in and: "No, I don't.<eos> I'll kill myself." You can do that.<eos> You can do that once.<eos> But you can do it.<eos> It's interesting because even when life gets bad, people choose it over nothing.
"Do you know anything about the dog?" "Uh, she's afraid of pennies.<eos> [audience laughing]<eos> So, we think maybe somebody's been throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.<eos> But, otherwise, no."<eos> So, you take this random dog and just put it in your house with your family, and watch their personality unfold.
And they say, "Okay, here's what we need you to do.<eos> We need you to make children know math."<eos> Wow.<eos> "Do they wanna know math?" "No, they don't want to know it.<eos> You need to make them know it against their will.
And breaking attorney-client privilege is a dis-barrable offense, and if we find out that's what's been happening here--<eos> - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.<eos> Like you said, I used a loophole.<eos> 'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.<eos> So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson Specter, they're not getting it from me.
I signed an agreement that said I wouldn't touch it.<eos> I can't cross that line.<eos> - Jesus Christ, Mike.<eos> You're telling me you care more about some piece of paper you signed than about these men's lives?<eos> No, I don't, but I signed it.
I only listen to every third thing you say anyway.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I just realized I never asked how the meeting at the Plaza went.<eos> Um... I canceled it.
- How did you know that?<eos> - Because I didn't spend all morning brushing up on my ass-kissing techniques.<eos> - Then you also know that Lockwood's green division has only existed for three months.<eos> They stole that technology.<eos> - Which is why you should sign with me so I can go get it back.
- Lockwood's launching a solar panel?<eos> Since when are they in the renewable energy business?<eos> - Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne.<eos> - No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.
- No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.<eos> - How can you know that?<eos> - Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if one of them did it, I'd know.<eos> - Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how they did it.
No, it doesn't matter how long it takes, Louis.<eos> We can just charge the time back to some client, right?<eos> 'Cause nobody around here gives a shit about anything other than making money anyway.<eos> Mike, what is going on?<eos> What's going on is that the only reason I came back here is that Harvey and I made a deal, and it hasn't even been a week, and he's already going back on it.
Mr Smiles begs to differ.<eos> Or at least he would if he wasn't being buried at the moment.<eos> - What's the Duke's complaint?<eos> - A small tumour.<eos> He feels the time has come to remove it.
I'm not sure.<eos> We just ended up there.<eos> I remember this orange carpet.<eos> And that song...<eos> Frankie just... they played it over and over and over again.
I hope you got something good, 'cause I only got about 4 hours of sleep left.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cora, right? That song I played triggers her somehow.<eos> When she hears it, something happens.
And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Your life, Belmont.<eos> Take it and go.
Right?<eos> Me too, I mean, he was wearing a leather jacket.<eos> I won't even splurge on a leather jacket.<eos> Well, maybe we shouldn't be spending so much money on chicken.<eos> Maybe we should be stealing it so we can afford a sweet leather "J".
We went to dinner and I assumed it was just as friends, but you were right, he was flirting with me.<eos> Oh, my God, mm-mm, mom, I'm telling you this cannot happen.<eos> You'll be very happy to know it's not going to happen.<eos> I realized that I am not sexually attracted to him.<eos> Okay, I have so many issues with that statement, but I'm going to take it because it serves the greater good.
Where do we start?<eos> - Don't like that map?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> It's really good.<eos> It's just, I've seen it before...
I spent my last dollar getting here, one-way ticket... And you're talking to me about healing through belief?<eos> You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.<eos> You've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole... To see more, to know more.<eos> Now, on hearing that it can be widened... In ways you can't imagine... You reject the possibility.<eos> No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales... About chakras or energy... Or the power of belief.
You have a purpose.<eos> You're always happy.<eos> How's your book coming along?<eos> I've never written about myself, before.<eos> I think it's some of the best work I've ever done... and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
You're always happy.<eos> How's your book coming along?<eos> I've never written about myself, before.<eos> I think it's some of the best work I've ever done... and I don't even know why I'm doing it.<eos> There's only one person who could read it... and I can't stand him.
Listen, I want you to pack up your stuff and go to your sister's right now.<eos> But this symbol comes up more often... than anything I've encountered.<eos> Look at the similarities.<eos> - How can you not see the relevance?<eos> - No, it's not that I don't see it.
Looks like they're mobilizing.<eos> David, please tell me this isn't some kind of a Trojan horse.<eos> I don't think it's a danger to us.<eos> But it must be to them.<eos> He turned it on just by touching it.
I'll lie down in the back seat.<eos> Luis Roldan, Spain's most wanted criminal, who had been seen on five continents, had never left Paris.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> I said not to bring him Spanish press.<eos> Throw it away.
TH E LAOTIAN PAPERS<eos> That junkie Pinaud screwed up again.<eos> - Why?<eos> - The seal is from City Hall in Laos, not the Laotian Ministry.<eos> What should I do, return it?
I don't know how I escaped.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> None of us are safe.<eos> They set up the machine in my loop.<eos> They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.
Fantastic.<eos> Where was this found?<eos> It wasn't found.<eos> It was taken.<eos> That thing killed three men before we took it down.
I came to get mine back.<eos> - You what?<eos> - My blood.<eos> I need it back.<eos> Well, it don't work like that, we can't just give it back to you.
Just keep swimming just keep swimming just keep swimming swimming, swimming what do we do?<eos> We swim swim, swim, swim we swim<eos> - we swim, swim, swim - just keep swimming<eos> my parents taught me that song!<eos> We sang it as a family.
We swim swim, swim, swim we swim<eos> - we swim, swim, swim - just keep swimming<eos> my parents taught me that song!<eos> We sang it as a family.<eos> All this time I thought I made it up!
Stay in my shadow.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just do as I say.<eos> Hail, thou Great God Ra.<eos> Normally, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it can shit.
I'm not even half done.<eos> Thoth, I only need... The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.<eos> A child could deduce why you're here.<eos> Go ask the riddle and come back and relay it to me.<eos> - I'll solve it.
I know.<eos> Father...<eos> I noticed the tower.<eos> Impressive.<eos> I built it for you.
- This was your test.<eos> - You didn't test him.<eos> I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.<eos> And when the time came, he didn't cling to his power.<eos> He gave it away freely. He passed his test.
But that's...<eos> Fifty miles east.<eos> From where we found him.<eos> I haven't read that book in forever.<eos> Someone gave it to me when I was learning how to read, so...
L'm doing it, too.<eos> I hate it.<eos> Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We fucked it in the dick.
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We fucked it in the dick.<eos> You know I don't like it when you say that.<eos> That's just... I know, but we fucked it so hard.
Okay, sorry.<eos> At least, and I know this isn't much consolation, but apparently we're now surrounded by Chinese food.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Guys...<eos> I think where we are right now, they don't refer to it as "Chinese food." It's just called "food."
Where did you learn that song, Papa?<eos> I learned it from my parents.<eos> And they learned it from their parents.<eos> And them from theirs.<eos> And one day... you'll sing it to your children, too.
I know the kind of mutants you're looking for.<eos> And I know where to find them.<eos> It's my first time in America.<eos> I'm very excited to see your culture.<eos> Well, you're not gonna see it here.
Reacher.<eos> How's my office?<eos> I'm sitting here now.<eos> There is this big dent in the desk.<eos> And people say you made it with someone's head.
Give me your head.<eos> Do you feel my hand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You feel it?
I will smite you!<eos> You wanna get smote?<eos> Smotten?<eos> Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life... it's a homing beacon of death.<eos> If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.
He can have it.<eos> I've got a better one.<eos> Yes, I have the...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I see, she's taken a barnacle and she's covered it in... bioluminescent algae as a diversion.
That's where we're heading.<eos> If my parents found out I took this out, they'd kill me.<eos> Have you taken it out before?<eos> Every few weeks.<eos> A boat's like a musical instrument... it doesn't like it if you don't use it.
That's my greatest fear actually. Death by a jellyfish.<eos> Your greatest fear is death by jellyfish?<eos> It is not funny.<eos> Random death by jellyfish..<eos> A friend of mine caught a jellyfish, put it in a jar, went out.
- I don't...<eos> That's enough.<eos> Gather round.<eos> We are going to school you... in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.<eos> For the sake of this lesson, our esteemed guest Selene... will play the role of Death Dealer bravely defending our fortress... and I will take the role of Lycan villain... here to destroy it.
I only wished I had arrived sooner. I might have helped in some way.<eos> Well, you've helped in so many ways.<eos> You've done exactly as I hoped and planned, if not more.<eos> You see, information is power.<eos> And I collect it with a passion.
Once an outcast, I am now one of three chosen Elders.<eos> From hunted to the highest honor.<eos> I have lived 1000 years.<eos> I may live 1000 more... or I may die tomorrow.<eos> But I no longer fear death... for I have known it once already.
Are you ready?<eos> All right.<eos> It's heavy.<eos> Open your hands out like this.<eos> Like this, so you can catch it.
It's a party!<eos> It's Jake.<eos> - Are you a wolf?<eos> - Where's your jacket at?<eos> I don't have it.
Let me help you with that.<eos> Interesting.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, this blackmail note.<eos> When I place it under the magnifying glass, the print becomes much larger, but then when I take it away, it's immediately small again.
Maybe Ali had to defend herself.<eos> I don't care why she did it, okay?<eos> I just, I wanna find a way to prove that she did it so that we can get Hanna back.<eos> Okay, well, if the person who murdered Charlotte was wearing the red jacket it'll have Charlotte's blood on it.<eos> We'll go to her house to look for it.
Rewind.<eos> Stop.<eos> What's he taking from the table?<eos> A jar of red caviar.<eos> He took it from the shelf in the front store.
I use a different one.<eos> At the exit from the store, the metal detectors signaled a problem.<eos> And the guards came up and asked for a check.<eos> And he takes a memory stick from my backpack.<eos> Now you go and prove that you didn't take it.
Can we go in?<eos> Nobody entered the cell.<eos> Strange.<eos> Did anyone tamper with the surveillance camera?<eos> Nobody touched it.
Terribly unprofessional.<eos> Who can confirm that?<eos> The camera technician.<eos> He's got the video.<eos> But I'm asking you not to show it to anybody.
When Ivanova was in our hospital, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our hospital.<eos> I was preparing a photo album.<eos> I was taking pictures of wards, patients with their parents, all that.<eos> So, once I was taking picture of our corridor, and Ivanova's father got in the picture.<eos> He came up to me without saying a word, grabbed my camera, took out the film and spoiled it.
Two years ago, my wife and I got into a car accident.<eos> The car went ablaze instantly.<eos> I got out, but my wife didn't manage to.<eos> Her door got stuck.<eos> I tried to open the door, to break it out.
You've destroyed my whole career.<eos> What for?<eos> We could have changed the world for the better!<eos> You can't change the world for the better through blood and murder.<eos> "Human life is the highest value; no one has the right to take it away."
You want to know why I didn't take that money?<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm asking.<eos> Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.<eos> I did it.
No.<eos> How'd they get in?<eos> Uh, the back door over here.<eos> It was open when I came home for lunch.<eos> I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Now, the people of New York need us to set aside our differences and work together.<eos> Which begs only one question.<eos> Are you two guys like a thing or...<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> If this purple ooze was injected into Bebop and Rocksteady's bloodstream, it's feasible that were I to pinpoint a singular isotopic signature, I may be able to use it to track their location.
Now... let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.<eos> You're talking about stopping the Jacobite rebellion?<eos> Well, that is what we agreed to, isn't it?<eos> I thought we agreed to think about it?<eos> If there's going to be a war against the British, should we not be trying to find a way to win it instead of stopping it?
You're leaving me alone with the undertaker?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.
You're looking at, I don't know, some kind of bio-weapon?<eos> Where'd this recording come from?<eos> Phoebe, that's what I think.<eos> - Phoebe Station.<eos> - I meant where'd you get it?
Isabel... What you need is to talk to the priest.<eos> Just a simple blessing, Olga.<eos> I feel peace when I hear you pray.<eos> Father almighty Lord I bless you for allowing a baby to form in the womb of your daughter.<eos> help Isabel to guard this new life so no one can hurt it in any way.
I'll send a car to check it out.<eos> The bottle was found here. right there.<eos> - Why narrow it to this circle?<eos> We're excluding Kattegat.<eos> The sea currents can't push it that way.
Go to the nearest restroom.<eos> Where are we?<eos> - Take a right next.<eos> On the right side in front of you there's a red handle, next to the door.<eos> Pull it and force the door open.
Cop 1.<eos> The train is entering the forest.<eos> We won't have contact.<eos> Prepare to throw the bag in 3 seconds.<eos> I will kill them if you don't throw it... now.
I am suggesting it's time we take you out of harm's way as well.<eos> We're fighting a war to protect Nassau.<eos> A war in which our most effective weapon is the fear that we can instill in our enemies.<eos> We've succeeded in making Captain Flint the name of grim death to all of them.<eos> The only way that we can ensure that that story continues is if he is the one telling it.
You rally the men to fight behind the idea that these are days in which all of Nassau must stand together.<eos> Either that means something or it doesn't.<eos> And how the hell would I argue the latter, just so we could avoid a delay?<eos> These days any man who can sew a black flag and get 10 fools to follow him can take a prize.<eos> They can take it because of the fear that I and men like me have instilled in their prey.
And sooner or later, they'll be exposed.<eos> Any fool who followed Hallendale deserves whatever end they got in his company.<eos> You were right.<eos> This war is getting more dangerous.<eos> The strong among us must stand together and face it.
Holy shit, fuck night.<eos> - Where's the door?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Do you see it?
Mrs Mullucks and Susan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've got quite a grip in those little fingers, Miss Mullucks.<eos> She can hold a rattle in them, Dr Turner, and a spoon!<eos> She can't get it in her mouth yet, but...
I know.<eos> I already told them.<eos> OK, I'll tell them.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> They'll pick it up in a couple of hours.
I already told them.<eos> OK, I'll tell them.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> They'll pick it up in a couple of hours.<eos> Leave the keys in. No one will steal it.
But you'll want a cup of something hot and dark sooner or later...<eos> Mr. Bulletproof.<eos> - [chuckling]<eos> - There you go with the nicknames, Pop.<eos> You said your rebound chick took a shotgun at point-blank range... pointed it under your chin, and pulled the trigger.
You think I asked for any of this?<eos> I was framed, beaten... and put in some tank like an exotic fish.<eos> Came out with... abilities.<eos> Saved your life.<eos> More like ruined it.
Welcome aboard.<eos> I'm so glad you're joining us.<eos> Hop in, I'll explain.<eos> Tommy, this is Richard, my lead scientist.<eos> The machine will amplify your power and run it through the conduits, allowing you to send anyone who's wearing one of these to the future in an instant.
I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and... and look like a jackass.<eos> Oh, geez...<eos> All right, kids.<eos> Today, we have a very special treat.<eos> One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you.
Chang's still on after she's built, don't count me in your plans.<eos> I'm aware of your intention to reclaim the Sze Yup Company contract on Mei Fong.<eos> I'm here to purchase that contract at fair market value.<eos> Any price within reason, Mr. Chang.<eos> Simply name it.
There was a small paint chip in the tar, the top layer of which was lead-based.<eos> - Lead paint was banned in 1975!<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Now this particular pigment was only purchased by municipalities between 1973 and 1977.<eos> When government buildings were required to either paint over the lead paint or remove it completely.
No, thanks.<eos> O.J. left a suicide note.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> I don't know what we're supposed to do with it.<eos> I mean, do we need to give it to the police?
Somehow these cops, a cabal of racist police officers, planted it?<eos> From the murder scene to the Bronco to Rockingham?<eos> Who else could have?<eos> Take a step back.<eos> I mean, doesn't it seem odd that this glove just happened to be at Rockingham at the same time that Detective Fuhrman just happened to find it?
From the murder scene to the Bronco to Rockingham?<eos> Who else could have?<eos> Take a step back.<eos> I mean, doesn't it seem odd that this glove just happened to be at Rockingham at the same time that Detective Fuhrman just happened to find it?<eos> Uh, it isn't odd if Simpson dropped it after he climbed the wall to avoid being seen by the limo driver.
- Sir, out of the car now. - Oh, come on!<eos> Got to be kidding me!<eos> Sir, because of your hostile attitude, I'm gonna have to cuff you.<eos> Officer, please.<eos> Take my license and call it in. Find out who I am.
Other than the night in question.<eos> No.<eos> Not that I can recall.<eos> So let's be clear.<eos> In all your years as a detective, this is the only instance that you took evidence from a crime scene, you put it in your car, you drove it home and didn't book it until the next day.
He's a total media whore.<eos> If you want to know which way he'll tilt, just watch the talk shows from the night before.<eos> Look, that is something you can't control.<eos> Stop watching so much TV.<eos> If you listen to all that noise, you're just gonna start bringing it into the courtroom.
Yes, Bob.<eos> - I tried the glove on in there myself.<eos> It didn't fit.<eos> It will never fit him!<eos> I think we should have him try it on in court.
But that is the verdict, that is the jury's, uh, position.<eos> That's their voice.<eos> And I accept that verdict.<eos> Uh... we came here in search of justice.<eos> And you'll have to be the judges, I expect, as to whether or not, uh, any of us found it today.
Right.<eos> Three lords walk into a tavern-- a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.<eos> They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup.<eos> The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.<eos> The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
Ah... So, uh, what's with the hats?<eos> I... You wouldn't get it.<eos> Uh-uh. Yeah, you kind of had to be there, man.<eos> Hey, how about that food, huh?<eos> Mac calls it "Mac's famous mac and cheese."
Please.<eos> You know you can always talk to me if you need to.<eos> It was so hot.<eos> You were sweating, and you had all that salt on your upper lip.<eos> Mm-hmm. I licked it off.
Should I ask you how your day was, like a good wife?<eos> No.<eos> I'm guessing that means your day was not as successful as mine.<eos> Well, depends on how you measure success.<eos> See, personally, I measure it in sapphires.
- Keep us posted, won't you, sister.<eos> - I will.<eos> (Fucking hell! )<eos> So, Arthur tells Linda everything, eh?<eos> She's stolen his soul and taken it to a better place -- the suburbs -- where men are honest with their wives.
Tommy. I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> We looked everywhere.<eos> All the way to Hay Mills.<eos> So, nothing.<eos> Put four cans of petrol in the boot of my car and bring it round.
What I want is for you to use your badge and your gun to intimidate him into dropping the case.<eos> Wow. That is so very illegal.<eos> He's not doing that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You have 48 hours to do so, or I'm gonna take your sperm, and I'm gonna dump it into the East River.
Call Jake Peralta.<eos> Gina, hey, how's the stalling?<eos> Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.
Everybody knows you break in when the owner's there.<eos> That way you have guaranteed access to the safe, and you can kick his teeth in to send a message.<eos> Okay, why don't you just...<eos> Oh, sure, you could slit his throat, but then what are you going to do with all the blood?<eos> Uh, we'd leave it in his body, where blood lives, because we're cops.
Is this perfect for tonight or what?<eos> Very much, yes.<eos> No doubt, though, by the quality some nine-year-old girl was forced to work, day-in and day-out, she's breathing in the fumes, you know, her little fingers perfect for sewing, but also perfect for getting stuck in that sewing machine.<eos> It's 90% off.<eos> You know, if you don't buy it, what was all of that for?
They'd, uh, never know what happened to me.<eos> And Damien, he just steps up out of nowhere.<eos> And I have no idea what he said, but they let me go.<eos> Never really told anyone that story before.<eos> Why are you telling it now?
Everything's okay.<eos> Mr. Reynolds, you're a very lucky man.<eos> If it weren't for that choking fit, we would have never been able to run tests, and...<eos> We found something.<eos> You have a very serious disease, but fortunately, we caught it just in time...
Well, I'm to say.<eos> It's my gallery.<eos> Then please explain to me how that is art and this is garbage.<eos> Well, it's all about context.<eos> The story behind each piece is part of what endows it with meaning.
Forgive me, please.<eos> Where do you want her to sit?<eos> -I don't know, here, there.<eos> This polenta's getting cold.<eos> -I didn't bring it.
And I will be very happy<eos> - to walk you through the entire process.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Ned, please locate the control panel to your left.<eos> Okay, I see it.
- People have been unattracted to you for thousands of years.<eos> - Thousands?<eos> - Since the dawn of mankind.<eos> In ancient Greece, not-Joshero love was considered quite normal.<eos> Plato called it the cornerstone of a modern democracy.
Your entire life has led to this moment.<eos> The Witness has spoken.<eos> You can drop it, Mr. Cole.<eos> Shit.<eos> See, you're cursing fate, but the real tragedy is the time you waste running from it.
You're welcome.<eos> I'll just put 'em over here.<eos> So... what happened? I really don't know.<eos> I mean,<eos> I remember that that stupid alarm kept going off, and I... and I got up to try and turn it off, and then, I don't know. The next thing I know, I'm at the bottom of the stairs.
There she is.<eos> Why did you go into the forest on your own?<eos> I wanted to keep the potential contamination of the scene to a minimum.<eos> At the car, why didn't you wait to have it assessed for booby traps?<eos> Were you not taking a considerable risk in forcing it open?
Thank you, Sam.<eos> All right.<eos> Where's your sample bag?<eos> Oh, I, um...?<eos> I think you left it in the cabin.
Where's your sample bag?<eos> Oh, I, um...?<eos> I think you left it in the cabin.<eos> Yeah, let...<eos> Sorry, let me just go and grab it.
Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yep.<eos> - He said no. - Aah!<eos> And that even if they did want pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the perps wouldn't eat it 'cause they know we'd put sleeping pills in it.
Spanish Fly.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> We just need to mix it with some mole's blood.
- It's a cure!<eos> - No. Well, I've got to stop transforming.<eos> I'll do the surgery.<eos> Completely different.<eos> I don't care how much it costs, I'll do it.
It was that thin.<eos> Well, I see we're settling for less nowadays.<eos> That's beyond.<eos> Mrs. Morrow, a package arrived for you.<eos> I found it in the mailbox this morning.
- Thank you.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I just... A paper cut.<eos> - There's a note.<eos> - You can read it. "Dear Susan, I've written a novel that will be published in the spring.
What ex-husband?<eos> I didn't know you had an ex-husband. Since when?<eos> A couple of years in graduate school.<eos> It's weird, I've been thinking about him a lot lately, and then recently he sent me this book that he's written and it's<eos> violent and it's sad, and he titled it Nocturnal Animals and he dedicated it to me.
Happy anniversary!<eos> You guys are just love!<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> My diaphragm...<eos> I left it...
- Oh, my God.<eos> This is a sign.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We hotwire that cab, drive ourselves within walking distance to JFK, soak it in gasoline, and torch it so they can't trace it... Let's go.
Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Uh, a DUI checkpoint, sir.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Who authorized it?
We ran that vehicle search on Lilliat Saroyan, got a hit.<eos> 2012 Altima registered to this address.<eos> Tony Allen's Vegas office.<eos> You lookin' for the car?<eos> We found it.
Tony Allen's Vegas office.<eos> You lookin' for the car?<eos> We found it.<eos> Been in our impound for a week.<eos> She left it at the Greyhound station.
Of course.<eos> Security footage.<eos> Irv, I...<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I want to see it.
May and June book up first.<eos> Mrs. Sarkisian.<eos> Forgive me, Mrs. Allen, but why our church?<eos> You don't look Armenian, and your name...<eos> My late husband changed it for business reasons.
Fiberglass hull, obviously. Um...<eos> It's hard to tell the model with all this damage.<eos> Maybe mid '80s or early '90s?<eos> A Bertram or, I don't know, maybe an Albemarle.<eos> - You ever seen it before?
and I pictured texted you an image of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, but with their faces swapped.<eos> It was like a Photoshop joke. It was stupid.<eos> I shouldn't have sent you anything.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> I screen-grabbed it off Instagram, and I thought you'd think it's funny, and you didn't respond.
Thank you.<eos> Love this top.<eos> Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?<eos> - I know.<eos> - I've heard it four times this week.
I just met the other only person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's a gosh-damn dreamboat.<eos> Jess, we have an emergency.<eos> Cece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get down the hall.<eos> She's built a laundry dam.<eos> - Well, can't you just step over it?
Excuse me, can I ask what you're doing?<eos> Did he see the van?<eos> Yeah, and he got the registration.<eos> And that didn't help?<eos> Well, it helped us trace the vehicle back to the company that rented it.
He also owns 19.3% of Lumetherm backdoored through his stake in Southern Wind.<eos> You see that block trade last Thursday come out of Merrill?<eos> That was Fortress cashing out their shorts before the merger.<eos> Wasn't it? Trade was at 12:52, when everyone was at lunch, which tells me they wanted it to be missed.<eos> You guys caught it, which is something, I guess.
Underhand.<eos> Give me some insight into how you process information.<eos> The press acts like information's a dirty word.<eos> Everyone has access to the information.<eos> We just know how to analyze it better.
What?<eos> - You need to take the dog.<eos> - What?<eos> The dog.<eos> I couldn't keep it in the apartment.
Previously on "Billions"...<eos> When did it become a crime to succeed in this country?<eos> Everyone has access to the information.<eos> We just know how to analyze it better.
Mid-size firm, has a big distribution contract with that bakery company Yumtime.<eos> Been holding 50.<eos> Fundamentals are solid.<eos> I don't see the short play.<eos> I don't need you to see it.
That's for you and Freda, huh? Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, you weren't lying when you said you was gonna knock your father off.<eos> Look, Ma, I know that you are somehow caught up in his web right now, so if you are coming to tell me to pump my brakes, just please...<eos> That's not what I'm here to tell you.<eos> I think competition is healthy. As long as you're using it to push yourself.
The car is the brain, and the GPU's we acquired are the rest of the Machine's nervous system.<eos> While you were out, I finished using the subway's encrypted system to tunnel into the government surveillance feeds.<eos> So the Machine will recover all the information that it lost.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's wake it back up.
Relax, honey.<eos> Okay, I did kill her.<eos> But there were extenuating circumstances.<eos> Ms. Groves, I think I should speak to the Machine one-on-one.<eos> The Machine, I killed it because it lied.
Holy crap.<eos> A red dragon.<eos> He was breathing fire.<eos> Right at me.<eos> It's the sunset hitting the northern mountain range, turning it red.
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?<eos> Or you don't, but... you feel it.<eos> Because you've felt other borders, like youth and adulthood, maybe.<eos> I can't change your fate...<eos> but I can help you meet it.
You don't even have a map.<eos> Where's our map?<eos> Don't need one.<eos> I know where I am.<eos> (SCOFFS) Probably couldn't even read it anyway.
We didn't do anything.<eos> Can you just check the napkin thing there for a microphone? For a microphone?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> What, what are you nuts?<eos> No, just check it.
I'm almost finished with it.<eos> It's funny 'cause I didn't know anything about Frantz Fanon before that.<eos> Oh, well, you should; everybody should.<eos> Well, there was something that he wrote that, uh, I was really moved by.<eos> Um, "Each generation must discover its mission, "fulfill it, or betray it."
How about a shirt I have that's a salmon color but with stripes? She gave it to me.<eos> Perfect. That way you strike a chord the moment she sees you.<eos> But it may be hanging out to dry.<eos> But I haven't worn it for months.<eos> Yeah, but I might have worn it the other night to go out drinking.
Nothing was certain.<eos> And this shift in our timeline is the proof.<eos> Stopping Jennifer Goines and destroying the virus changed history.<eos> We pushed back the plague.<eos> We delayed it.
There can be only one.<eos> I want to give you a short that you're not gonna bail on.<eos> Do you know Cross-Co.?<eos> I don't see the short play.<eos> I don't need you to see it.
I want to give you a short that you're not gonna bail on.<eos> Do you know Cross-Co.?<eos> I don't see the short play.<eos> I don't need you to see it.<eos> I need you to do it.
8%.<eos> 8%?<eos> This must really matter to you.<eos> It does.<eos> Well, I'm long the stock, obviously, which is on quite a little tear, but if you're right and this company tanks, my position is screwed and I'll be holding it forever, waiting for it to recover.
Not of this earth?<eos> Right now, we don't know.<eos> You said you could contain it.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Could you transport it?
Excuse me?<eos> Now, you're going to place the specimen in that case, and you're going to give it to me.<eos> Miss Frost, you have no idea what this stuff is capable of.<eos> Oh, on the contrary, I am the only person who knows what it's capable of.<eos> Now hand it over.
Only one thing was left behind... zero matter.<eos> Tonight, we'll clear out the laboratory.<eos> We need to get to your lab to retrieve the research and the zero matter.<eos> Whitney Frost?<eos> Now hand it over.
So she was caught up in the explosion, as well.<eos> I was closer, so I took the brunt of the explosion.<eos> Howard!<eos> The emulsion must be wearing off.<eos> I didn't think he'd shed it so quick, but the Brownian motion...
Whitney Frost... she defies categorization.<eos> It's open.<eos> Miss Frost?<eos> A package has just arrived for you.<eos> Where would you like it?
I've always loved fireworks.<eos> Well, just fire, really.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
That's all right.<eos> I only plan to use it once.<eos> On what?<eos> Dr. Wilkes has my zero matter.<eos> I'm taking it back.
Thank you, Doctor...<eos> Wilkes.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life.<eos> How about dinner and dancing?<eos> Now hand it over.
- Whitney Frost, you are under arrest!<eos> - No!<eos> Please!<eos> I need it!<eos> Give it back!
I'm thinking.<eos> How long until the gamma cannon's charged?<eos> 20 more minutes, at least.<eos> It doesn't have enough energy to fire.<eos> Could we detonate it inside the rift?
Yeah, well, you threw the first punch, amigo.<eos> I'll see you at the show, and your band best know my songs by then.<eos> After my mom overdosed, then, you know, the two of us went into the system.<eos> - The foster system. - Yeah.<eos> I don't like to call it that, because, you know, I looked up the word once, and the word "foster" means "to encourage."
Let me know how it goes.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I thought you weren't coming by for Cadence until later.<eos> I found her pacifier in the car, and I knew that she would want it, so...
I mean, she was challenging.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> But she was also passionate, and... there was a lot to love about her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> All I'm saying is that if it's important for Glenn to hear the truth, then you should make him hear it.
Look, we're partners, right?<eos> What the hell we gonna do?<eos> Draw a line right down the middle of The Beverly?<eos> Drawing a line wouldn't work.<eos> You'd just keep crossing it.
Then we kill them.<eos> Right.<eos> So the rune on Clary's neck...<eos> A healing rune.<eos> Jace used it to save her life.
I beat a homicide rap I confessed to many times.<eos> I think I can figure out marketing.<eos> Roger?<eos> Where'd you get the car?<eos> The agency sent it.
You can take trips home.<eos> "We."<eos> Did I miss us having a conversation about this somehow?<eos> We bought the boat together.<eos> We designed it together.
"We."<eos> Did I miss us having a conversation about this somehow?<eos> We bought the boat together.<eos> We designed it together.<eos> Yeah, but we skipped the part when we talk about when and how we're using it.
I have nothing but the utmost respect for the US Attorney.<eos> I'm writing a piece on the exodus of assistant US attorneys into the private sector.<eos> Right now, you're my lede, and I was wondering...<eos> If you fuck me by writing this story, there's not an AUSA in the world who'll take your call.<eos> Look, I don't wanna print it.
It was real?<eos> For a minute there.<eos> More than a minute.<eos> Felt like... freedom, you know?<eos> Like I could taste it.
What's wrong?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey, I'm not getting anywhere with Lawrence Boyd.<eos> - The problem is...<eos> - Solve it.
The ground is shifting, and you don't even see it.<eos> Or you refuse to see it.<eos> But if this were some stock play, it wouldn't be about pride.<eos> You'd have already cut your losses.<eos> Lara, the ground is shifting because I'm the one moving it.
So they were brooming him?<eos> Big-time.<eos> Partners thought his trades were over the line, maybe illegal.<eos> 9/11... their deaths... saved his career.<eos> It allowed him to take over the firm, rename it for himself.
Mayor Claire Warren lit up social media tonight when she vowed to microchip convicted sex offenders if elected governor.<eos> Stay tuned for more updates on the story after this.<eos> I got your story.<eos> Have you always owned that truck?<eos> Never loaned it to anyone?
At the moment we're reviewing the area's cycling network<eos> As you know, we have a large student population.<eos> It's starting to bother me that I can never get a real answer to questions that seem legitimate to me.<eos> The mayor just told you that there are more urgent issues.<eos> Your problem is concrete, and we've taken note of it, OK?
You will fill these hours by facing the world, Boris.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I am certain that Beatrice also wants you to change.<eos> You have power.<eos> You use it poorly.
Pike has a plan.<eos> Pike's always got a plan, and it's always the same one... take the fight to the Grounders.<eos> That's what got Monroe killed.<eos> You're crossing a line, Kane.<eos> No. No. I crossed it.
You have something to say?<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> On the Ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future, about the responsibility our descendents would bear when they finally set foot on the ground.<eos> We didn't start this war, but you can be damn sure I intend to finish it.
I offer an escape from suffering.<eos> Why would anyone resist this?<eos> Logic has nothing to do with it.<eos> Free will is the problem.<eos> I told you, we have to get around it.
My work's done.<eos> I'm just gonna put this in the Director's Cabin.<eos> So, what do you know about this conference?<eos> I know it's small, secret, just a few countries.<eos> They're calling it "a symposium on the alien contagion."
That should buy a lot of ice.<eos> The map?<eos> Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist.<eos> Claimed it allowed her to track demonic presences.<eos> I don't have it.
No.<eos> Is there anything to suggest that anyone's tried to dig this up before?<eos> Oh, the topsoil was loose.<eos> I think Jamie came up here to find this grave.<eos> - He found it and intended to dig it up.
When I was your age, I paid someone to work at their company.<eos> Yeah-- hey, do you mind if I borrow your car?<eos> - What am I, Yuber?<eos> - No, it-it-it's Uber.<eos> I-I'll have it back in a few hours.
You just reported that the South is not secure.<eos> - I did. But there is...<eos> - No, there is no but.<eos> Even a dog unknowingly craves discipline.<eos> And by the time he attains it, he has forgotten how hard he was beaten.
I hear her voice in the house, still.<eos> She had a very soft voice... like a little bell.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> So... this is life again.<eos> I've barely seen it for the past year... especially in such abundance.
- Yes!<eos> What a slut.<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> True love.<eos> They can find it here.
What a slut.<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> True love.<eos> They can find it here.<eos> Or we could make it.
Is this your new thing?<eos> The sucker punch?<eos> Because I brought that episode.<eos> You know I did.<eos> Yeah, you brought it because Coleman is here getting you guys to do your best work.
Now get out and don't come back.<eos> "Mirror of Truth." I love it.<eos> Which genius came up with that?<eos> - Me. - I did.<eos> You came up with the concept, but I'm the one bringing it to life.
Hey, you dodged a bullet on that one, am I right?<eos> Uh, yeah. Um...<eos> Yeah, I didn't know about that.<eos> Hey, I've been trying to get you on the walkie.<eos> I turned it off.
I'm afraid Division won't wear it.<eos> You are to remain suspended from duty.<eos> Thursday.<eos> Before the Blenheim Vale files were sealed one final piece of evidence was abstracted.<eos> I don't suppose anyone will miss it in 50 years.
We'll want firearms too, if it comes back.<eos> I'll need to use your telephone.<eos> There's no chance this is all some ghastly mistake?<eos> We found her bag at Goggins' place, presumably soaked in this musk in an attempt to bring it back.<eos> All the same, how do you know that Georgie put it there?
Katherine Goble, sir.<eos> How did you know the Redstone couldn't support orbital flight?<eos> That's classified information<eos> It's top secret.<eos> Well, it's no secret why the Redstone test keep failing its flight for sub-orbital flight, but it can't handle the weight of the capsule and push it into space.
That's the math we don't know.<eos> Yes, Katherine<eos> So, the capsule will spin around the Earth forever, because there's nothing to slow it down?<eos> That's right.<eos> Slowing it down at precisely the right moment, by precisely the right amount That is the task.
OK.<eos> Planck–Einstein...<eos> The problem is when the capsule moves from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.<eos> There's no mathematical formula for that.<eos> As we can calculate launch, landing but without this conversion, the capsule stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.
You have until midday to dismantle it.<eos> But if I try to remove any of the individual pieces, the mechanism I designed will deadlock the door.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> If you try to blow it open with gunpowder, you'll bring down the roof.<eos> Drilling at it might take a week.
Will Peter find a new friend?<eos> Find out after this Korean commercial Ashton Kutcher thought no one in America would ever see.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Ashton Kutcher.<eos> Have you ever killed a dog while driving drunk, and then been upset that there was no way for your car engine to cook it for you on the rest of the drive home?
So if you can call us back when you have a minute, that would be swell.<eos> Thanks, Patrick.<eos> 72 hours to vacate the premises.<eos> What happened to our flour?<eos> Debbie used it as an imaginary baby.
A rich despot.<eos> A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it.<eos> Find him and bring me his right hand!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your breast!
A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it.<eos> Find him and bring me his right hand!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your breast!<eos> Bring it here, fling it on this table, and we shall sing out our joy!
He said that Vanessa was with the Master.<eos> This is the creature she called Dracula.<eos> I've got to get him to tell us where she is.<eos> And how do you intend to discover this information?<eos> I intend to reach into his mind and rip it out.
Schrodinger's Cat.<eos> Aaaaaah, I can see I impressed you all with my artistic abilities.<eos> Schrodinger puts his cat in a box with poisonous food.<eos> Now, until he opens that box, the cat is, in theory, both alive and dead.<eos> But when he opens it, it's either "Hello, Mittens" or "Goodbye, Socks."
I don't want to live anymore.<eos> So you go into some... Some store.<eos> And, uh... it's a bookstore.<eos> I sit down, and there's this book...<eos> And I start thumbing through it.
If I hadn't been with Laura, if we hadn't overslept, if I hadn't taken the detour,<eos> that deer would never have crossed my path.<eos> Ever.<eos> What did you do with the car?<eos> I buried it.
When Tomás and his wife got to the hotel and found out about Laura's death, they understood what had happened.<eos> They probably studied their chances and hesitated about what to do, but with no faith in justice, what was left for them?<eos> All they could do was watch you.<eos> Tomás Garrido became your shadow.<eos> He found a vacant room opposite your building and took it over anonymously.
Just smash through it.<eos> Take out the power. And save my friends.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right.<eos> Just ram it and destroy my beautiful car that my parents bought me on my birthday, but I'ma save my friends.
We know you're not on our side, Theo.<eos> You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you left Eichen with something else, didn't you?<eos> You mean the mask?<eos> Are you worried about that?<eos> Did you put it on?
Excuse me, where are you going?<eos> Trying to figure out how to use this against Zoom.<eos> You remember Zoom?<eos> "Cisco, please join me.<eos> "We'll use your idea and take it to new scientific heights and save the world."
But do you really think Damian Darhk gives a damn about you?<eos> He believes that the world needs a reset.<eos> And honestly, John, after what we witnessed in Afghanistan, can you tell me otherwise?<eos> Ok.<eos> All right, so you and Darhk are burning the village in order to save it.
I know you want to tell Felicity, and trust me, I would love to be an aunt, but you have got to do the right thing for your son here.<eos> As hard as this may be for you, Ollie, keeping William a secret is keeping him safe.<eos> Yes, John.<eos> Andy did a little digging on the Dark Web, found out the demolition team uses a specialized acid that can weaken building structures.<eos> Only one warehouse in the city stocks it.
Well, it goes to credibility, your honor.<eos> Oliver Queen publicly slandered my client by accusing him of ordering a terrorist drone strike.<eos> Now, if--if Mr. Diggle can work for Mr. Queen for free to help Ms. Queen buy illegal drugs, I mean, is it really that much of a stretch to believe that he'd also perjure himself in support of Mr. Queen's campaign of character assassination?<eos> You watched me swear an oath.<eos> And then I saw you break it.
I know.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Because of his magic.<eos> His ma-- it's too strong.<eos> I've seen it before, back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.
We were this close to leaving Star City last October.<eos> After 3 terrorist attacks, we were done, but then the night before we were going to start packing, the Green Arrow popped up on our TV, and he reminded me that this city is worth saving, that my home-- that my home was worth fighting for.<eos> That guy gave me inspiration.<eos> He gave me hope.<eos> And if he could give me hope then, why can't he give it to others now?
I think you got hit on the head harder than you realize.<eos> No, no, he's right.<eos> I can't hack this system.<eos> But if the nuke gets close enough, which it is...<eos> We could use the line-of-sight attack on the missile itself and disarm it.
You're right.<eos> We need a trigger.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Your file from J.D. People's.<eos> I kept it in storage.
I found something with you, something wonderful.<eos> I found love.<eos> That thing that the Time Masters always taught us to hide from, but they were wrong, Rip.<eos> Love's no threat.<eos> It's beautiful, and powerful, and once you know it, love changes everything.
They won't be easy to kill.<eos> These Reapers are even deadlier, which will make your task more difficult.<eos> My task?<eos> For this experiment to work, we need blood from a living Kree.<eos> And I want you to get it.
"A sermon?" - Yes. 681.<eos> 00:45:14,431 -- 00:45:16,944 "Well, if you preach, then In Chechnya or in Afghanistan.<eos> - Venya, Venya, but you will be killed in the first day!<eos> - But this is not important.<eos> "He who gives his life for my sake, He will save it. "
How are you so calm, anyway?<eos> I'm getting used to this sort of thing.<eos> Okay, here's what you need to do.<eos> You see that laser circuit in the back?<eos> You need to interrupt it with the mirror.
How much do you owe?<eos> 16½ grand.<eos> I told him I couldn't pay.<eos> Next thing I know, some guy phones me, says the debt's been sold on and that all I have to do to cancel it, is steal a car.<eos> They told me where to leave it, and where to pick it up again.
Doesn't that just make you a very, very expensive errand boy?<eos> Whatever I am, I'm not in the habit of challenging Mr McCall's requests.<eos> Certainly not these days.<eos> My client has always been a man who likes to demonstrate his power.<eos> And the older and more unpredictable he becomes, the more forcibly and randomly he likes to demonstrate it.
- Yeah?<eos> - So, I found the forger.<eos> - You did?<eos> How?<eos> Well, I figured it had to be someone local since it was only a few days between you showing the painting to Christopher and him leaving it for you, so...
Sorry. I was waiting for the question.<eos> Did you steal the painting from the museum, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> If I may, I think you're asking the wrong questions, Agent Clark.<eos> Here's what I would be asking if this was my case.<eos> Why would a reputable private investigator steal her clients' multimillion-dollar painting, then put it on her bedroom wall where anyone could see it?
You couldn't stop them?<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> She has a warrant, and it's not my case anymore.<eos> When were you gonna tell me about the painting?<eos> I was gonna put it back once I figured out how.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can be held against you...<eos> It wasn't her. It was me.<eos> My name is Benjamin Jones.<eos> I stole the painting, put it on her wall.
He's talking.<eos> Why is he talking?<eos> What's the job?<eos> I've gone to a great deal of expense and trouble to have a package delivered to the hotel.<eos> - We're going to steal it.
We're close.<eos> She has him.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Well, we made a deal with her.<eos> And you confirmed it.
They don't serve it in there, I hear.<eos> Well, they might make an exception for you, I reckon.<eos> You want to tell me about Via Crucis?<eos> It all started by the time we thought we were losing the war on terror.<eos> Well, I think you started losing that when you called it a war.
Have a nice summer, Klingenberg.<eos> Ultra kick-ass jacket.<eos> What?<eos> - Your jacket.<eos> I'll buy it.
I mean, I'm family, right?<eos> Why would this little serum have to change anything, other than the simple fact that I would be your equal?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I figured you could never live with that.<eos> You hand it over right now and I will forgive this act of defiance as a moment of weakness
Cool.<eos> Well, he's not here, so...<eos> He's dead.<eos> The serum.<eos> No, Marcel didn't take it.
- No, no, no,<eos> I know this is a war but I've lost a lot of friends, too.<eos> Today...<eos> I need your help.<eos> Then you shall have it.
That's Cornell's problem.<eos> We cannot give this to Cornell yet.<eos> Eric.<eos> How do you think a Homicide Detective will receive your new evidence?<eos> Cornell will have to investigate it.
Hennessey put me in contact with another cell.<eos> They got solid intel on a big operation.<eos> A VIP is coming into the bloc from the outside.<eos> They have a comprehensive plan for the op.<eos> They just need our tactical expertise to pull it off.
My mother.<eos> Oh, well, she would have liked it.<eos> Norman, I don't believe we ever truly lose those we love.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I'm sure she will be seeing it.
Yes, well, I'm, uh... thank you, but it... this is really just not a good time, so... I...<eos> I understand.<eos> I just wanted to do something.<eos> Chicken enchilada casserole.<eos> I made it.
I look just like... yeah, that's... that's pretty weird.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I'm like the Werner Von Braun of robots.<eos> The who?<eos> The Nazi scientist who invented the V2 rocket, built it using slave labor, then used it to level London.
What the fuck is that?<eos> Cocaine, heroin, fentanyl.<eos> Inside the art.<eos> Look.<eos> I went to sell this and the art guy opens it up.
I don't...<eos> I think I know.<eos> Has a dog, right?<eos> Came in here.<eos> I even saw him walk it once.
Boys.<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> I want my money back.<eos> Your kid's in a box, but you want your money. Huh?<eos> The Irish may not have invented revenge, but we sure as hell took some time perfecting it.
Um...<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> I found this photograph.<eos> It's of him and his wife and kids at the carousel.<eos> You found it where?
I suppose you don't want to get close to anyone, because, hey, you're... you're not all coming back.<eos> But at the same time, you... you have to feel something, don't you?<eos> Otherwise, what are you all fighting for?<eos> I remember Frank used to sing this horrible little song.<eos> He had, uh, picked it up, I think, from one of his kids' TV shows when he was on leave, and he brought it back to Afghanistan with him, and it was infectious.
Am I right?<eos> I have to admit, I love being the bearer of bad news.<eos> Oh? Do tell.<eos> The coin's not for sale.<eos> I simply used it to gain entrée to you.
That was dispatch.<eos> Dan's phone died, and he wants me to meet him at my place.<eos> Apparently it's urgent.<eos> Oh, how convenient.<eos> What's next... he spills something on his shirt and he has to take it off?
Aren't we being a touch dramatic?<eos> You know, I put up with a lot of crap to let you in on my cases, and that's because thus far you've been honest with me, but now, for some reason, you're not telling me the full story.<eos> I'm telling you everything you need to know to help find my stuff.<eos> A man was murdered, and all you can talk about is your property?<eos> Yes, but if we find it, then you find out who killed the security guard...
Which reminds me... Your presence is no longer required.<eos> You can thank my agents for completing your mission.<eos> Their idealism will doom this planet.<eos> No.<eos> That's what will save it.
Do you know any Elgar?<eos> More of a jazz man, I'm afraid.<eos> Elgar's my favourite.<eos> Used to play him on my cello all the time.<eos> Till Dad sold it.
Well, you better believe it.<eos> Emile is dead, and do you have any idea where his heroin might've come from?<eos> No, I don't know anything about any heroin.<eos> You drive in sundays for services at salvation community?<eos> Pick up a little uncut dope from your minister? And then leave it for your snitching friend to shoot up?
I thought you'd appreciate it.<eos> I lost it.<eos> Guess I was wrong.<eos> No, you're not, I...<eos> I need to read it.
I lost it.<eos> Guess I was wrong.<eos> No, you're not, I...<eos> I need to read it.<eos> I just, I can't find it.
Quentin!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> I told you, keep up with that stupid song, and I'd come right into your brain and rip it out.
Master Chief's been gone for over two hours.<eos> You tend to pass out afterwards.<eos> How long was the needle in your arm, Captain?<eos> Half-hour, give or take.<eos> It's like they're taking our blood and feeding it to half their crew.
But I am going to give you this.<eos> Ten thousand dollars.<eos> Do some traveling.<eos> See the world while you can.<eos> Life's too short to spend it cooped up in some office.
He will never let you down or betray you.<eos> Now, do we have a deal?<eos> You crossed the line for the last time, Eldritch.<eos> You mean my taking possession of the nuclear bomb I paid for?<eos> You will return it immediately.
- What is it, Humphrey?<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Auntie, it's just, er...<eos> Why would you put a load of old mementoes into a safety deposit box?<eos> Cos it's his old identity, sir.<eos> I mean, he'd want to keep it safe.
- HUMPHREY SIGHS - Come on, Chief.<eos> All right, then, JP.<eos> Pick a card, any card.<eos> OK.<eos> Now, don't let me see it.
Well, erm, one, love can be found anywhere.<eos> Er, two, you can't force it, it's spontaneous.<eos> Wouldn't you say?<eos> Er, yes.<eos> And three, once you have it... it's forever.
Yeah, we're really doing this.<eos> You leave a note telling him you're not coming back?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> My Aunt Helen was in there.<eos> I was afraid she would find it before I left.
I know where he'd take her.<eos> What do you mean, you know where he'd take her?<eos> Connor owns 200 acres of land north of the city.<eos> - That's where the lab is.<eos> - How do we find it?
They stick their heads up, I want us there.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Agent Pritchard, a word.<eos> Pritchard, I know some of these other agents are looking at you sideways for turning your partner and your boss in, but from where I stand, that was damn fine work.<eos> - You took an oath, and you defended it.
Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.<eos> If you want your hat, Sheriff... you're gonna have to come and get it.
Ah, keeping watch, I suspect.<eos> Don't want any syphilitic soldiers barging in.<eos> There's another number we could try, no?<eos> My address book.<eos> It's in the drawer over there, Nr.9. Could you get it, please?
I got a crash course back at the Camp.<eos> - But why...<eos> - Well, their radar beats the pants off ours.<eos> It sees much clearer, much farther.<eos> They want us to get inside the installation, photograph everything we can, then blow it up.
Get out now!<eos> What's going on, Ricardo?<eos> You're fucking up, man.<eos> Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.<eos> Ricardo, put it down.
I did it.<eos> What?<eos> Whoa, whoa, what is that?<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom.
First message.<eos> Next message.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Warner. It's Hal Markum, Fraud Division.<eos> We did have an unlimited credit card recently opened under the name Keith Blair.<eos> When Mr. Blair called to say he didn't apply for the card, we closed it immediately.
Yes.<eos> If you want to arrest me... Come and get me.<eos> I know less about Liam now than I did a week ago.<eos> All I know is the kid listened to some god-awful music.<eos> I had ask him to turn it off all the time.
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.<eos> I felt slower.<eos> I did it.<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom.
Caitlin, look out!<eos> You okay?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What happened?<eos> With the rest of the breaches closed, the energy surge to this last remaining breach must have destabilized it.
Don't talk to them again.<eos> I'm gonna get out of here.<eos> And I'm gonna destroy you.<eos> All I need from you is your speed, Flash.<eos> And you only need to be barely alive for me to get it.
You see what he can do?<eos> Your friend, the outcast?<eos> The power he has?<eos> It is the Lord's power. Oh!<eos> Then why'd the Lord give it to him?
Uh, so it's a long story.<eos> Um, someone got a hold of my phone, and they-- they sent out this picture.<eos> Professor Runyon?<eos> That was you?<eos> Jesus Christ, you saw it too?
And I got it because my family has been down here a long time.<eos> Yeah, your wife said almost 50 years?<eos> That's right.<eos> People know me, you know?<eos> They trust me to turn it into a mixed-use facility that'll make money, but also won't look like fucking Vegas on the water.
We're taking orders from her.<eos> That's the way this works.<eos> The only people whose jobs are threatened right now are yours and mine.<eos> What, so, we're just supposed to take it?<eos> I don't like broccoli, but my doctor says eat it, so I do.
Ow.<eos> I swear to God, Leo, if you so much as...<eos> Are you threatening me again?<eos> You know, I didn't ask you to come to my apartment this morning, but you did.<eos> And you promised me the truth, or at least some attempt to find it, not whatever the hell this is.
What is it that you don't want to tell me?<eos> The enemies I fight, Lex, don't give a rat's ass about humanity.<eos> A virus doesn't care about politics or race or emotion.<eos> The truth is, I had no idea where this outbreak was going.<eos> But I made damn sure I was prepared to stop it.
Why should I risk everything I have for this?<eos> It won't bring them back.<eos> - Won't save any lives.<eos> - No, it won't.<eos> But our friends died searching for the truth, and you're just a few keystrokes away from finding it.
It's not a cure, but it may allow someone to live longer.<eos> Yeah, so you need a human trial.<eos> Sign her up.<eos> (sighs) Without more time or resources, there could be a risk of an ABO incompatibility reaction to the antibody serum.<eos> Her body could reject it.
You the, ah, cancer concierge?<eos> I like to think of myself as an ambassador for the pre-deceased.<eos> Okay, well, she's groggy from the anti-anxiety meds.<eos> I told her the news.<eos> Not sure she absorbed it.
"Mobilizing to Dieppe.<eos> Raid's tomorrow at dawn."<eos> We take advantage of the distraction and go after Freya.<eos> German longrange radar.<eos> They want us to get inside the installation, then blow it up.
Athos and his friends... will be dead.<eos> Next time, try not to wait until the bottle's kissing the ground before shooting.<eos> It's not good for the nerves.<eos> Next time, don't choose such a small pebble.<eos> I could barely hear it.
His ears must have been burning.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - And hello to you, too.<eos> I can't find the good bourbon, just the battery acid we serve guests.<eos> The construction workers were nipping from the bottle, so I put it on the top shelf.
You read my book.<eos> Stayed up all night.<eos> It was a great read, by the way.<eos> They should make a movie out of it.<eos> It was a mistake not to read it, and I'm sorry.
Thank God you're here.<eos> Remember how you told me not to smoke pot in the house?<eos> You didn't, did you?<eos> No, I smoked in the car.<eos> And then sort of crashed it.
With some nail polish.<eos> Baby, it's a good thing you're pretty.<eos> You're not gonna tell Mr. Powell, are you?<eos> No.<eos> We'll take it to a body shop.
You haven't even seen my biggest surprise.<eos> You made the bed?<eos> - But how?<eos> - I Googled it.<eos> And if it gets messed up, I'll make it again.
Please, don't ask me to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey. What do we got?<eos> It's your tachyon absorption enhancer upgrade.<eos> Retrofitted from when it was used to steal your speed, to now give you more of it.
But before you all make a grave mistake, I would like to be heard.<eos> I believe I've earned that right at least.<eos> This is a private church meeting.<eos> I am this church, Tansy.<eos> I built it from nothin'.
- There are other ways.<eos> I gave you a book about it.<eos> "Fillory and Further, Book Six"?<eos> I told you.<eos> I lost it.
More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt...dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.<eos> They buy it and they sell it, and they fight and they fuck for it.
You know, just...<eos> What part of me was the most helpful?<eos> Oh, uh, good question.<eos> I would say your smile.<eos> No, don't. Don't cover it up.
And there's no better woman on earth than my daughter.<eos> - I meant no disrespect.<eos> - Didn't you?<eos> The gerege of the House of Ögödei.<eos> I'm giving it to Khutulun when I tell her she's my heir.
Which one?<eos> The silver Honda Sedan?<eos> Mid-size, no distinguishing features?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you noticed it?
Inside.<eos> Always.<eos> Surely, you have good memories, huh?<eos> That song... how do you know it?<eos> I wrote it... for my baby boy.
- You need help.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, okay.<eos> You can take me to Promises when this is all over, but right now, I think you're the only one that needs help.<eos> So, where's my bag?<eos> I threw it out here somewhere... dropped it out the window.
He deserves more dignity than this.<eos> We'll give it to him, we just got to return - the boat first, okay?<eos> - Get the camera you forgot.<eos> -And get the camera that I forgot.<eos> - I'm just saying it would have been really convenient - Yeah, Christ's sake. - if you hadn't forgotten it.
Did he know?<eos> Did Milo fucking know what was on the boat?<eos> Let's pack it up.<eos> Someone else needs to carry that bag.<eos> Well, I hurt... I hurt my shoulder hauling it over those rocks back there.
- What?<eos> - For real?<eos> - Man, you know what?<eos> I'm not even...<eos> So-so the car's got a little damage, and we just need to return it for something a bit more, um, drivable.
You rented a car.<eos> - From the airport.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So where is it?<eos> I didn't see it outside.
- From the airport.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So where is it?<eos> I didn't see it outside.<eos> Well, um, we drove into town last night and, uh, got a little drunk so, um, we left it in town, took a taxi back.
Well, um, we drove into town last night and, uh, got a little drunk so, um, we left it in town, took a taxi back.<eos> So where-where is the car?<eos> The craziest thing. Uh, we can't really remember where it is because we got pretty drunk.<eos> We had a good time.<eos> Would you like us to find it?
What's she talking about, find our car?<eos> She saw the rental car keys on the table.<eos> - She asked where it was.<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - I said we lost it.
I told you to bring us the boat.<eos> It's in the lagoon.<eos> - We will show where it is.<eos> - It got stuck.<eos> Sir, we tried to bring it back!
- Really fun. Wonderful time.<eos> We haven't heard much from Mr. Milo since he retire.<eos> Me drop a package off the other day.<eos> Something he asked me to get for him.<eos> You know if he get it?
Me drop a package off the other day.<eos> Something he asked me to get for him.<eos> You know if he get it?<eos> A package?<eos> Me put it through the fence.
Something he asked me to get for him.<eos> You know if he get it?<eos> A package?<eos> Me put it through the fence.<eos> Me want make sure he get it.
- He says it's with the others.<eos> - The other two?<eos> Yeah, we split the money between us.<eos> So where's your share?<eos> My friend took it.
What did I say?<eos> I said if we come back here, they're gonna kill us.<eos> We're alive for a reason.<eos> Lawrence owned the villa.<eos> Milo scammed him out of it and put it in our names.
Just a car ride away, boys.<eos> Victory... it's within your reach.<eos> The five of us, we all come from a long legacy of victors.<eos> American exceptionalism.<eos> Don't forget that. Our ancestors harnessed the power of a fucking atom and used it to bring an empire to its knees.
We're gonna end up like that fucking dog if we deliver this thing.<eos> If we stay, we will.<eos> What's in that package?<eos> Okay. I want you to treat this package as you would a child, all right?<eos> Don't shake it, don't open it.
- Anything.<eos> Oh, look, wrapping's coming off.<eos> Yeah, well, don't mess with it.<eos> You're gonna make it worse.<eos> Just peel it back a little bit, we could take a look what's inside.
You're gonna make it worse.<eos> Just peel it back a little bit, we could take a look what's inside.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not gonna open it.
X takes care of its own.<eos> You got to be kidding.<eos> We failed.<eos> Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it's headed right for us.<eos> I'm gonna have to take it out kamikaze style.
- Does not look good at all.<eos> - Yeah, what does it look like?<eos> Looks like your dick is trapped between two slats of wood.<eos> Okay, I just... Fuck, I can't reach it.<eos> I just need you to get down there and just pop it out.
We read the coroner's report.<eos> It's all in there before those other guys switched it.<eos> Yeah, and I recorded the whole thing on my cell phone.<eos> - Where's the cell phone?<eos> - They destroyed it.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
where he unlocked the dark forces of their union.<eos> But what they didn't account for was the sword.<eos> Merlin stole his staff.<eos> He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower.<eos> The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
this sword.<eos> Only you can prevent this.<eos> He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.
I don't like snakes.<eos> No one likes snakes.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> You will feel it for a few hours.
Well, just look at the facts.<eos> Take it out of your hands.<eos> Why do you think it can't work as a country song?<eos> - It can.<eos> As a... as a country... Take your finger outta your ear. Put it back up your ass.
Don't have the other.<eos> Running around, trying to be somebody.<eos> Snatching at life.<eos> I got some uranium!<eos> I bought it off my mom.
Masterful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?
It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man.<eos> We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series. Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.
Murphy.<eos> You've got hidden talents, man.<eos> "Then it happens.<eos> "All I did was put a pint of Export in front of Begbie.<eos> "He takes one fucking gulp out o' it.
Keep as close to the ocean floor as you can.<eos> Sharks attack from below, so if you keep to the floor, you should be fine.<eos> This button inflates your BCD.<eos> Use it to go up.<eos> This button deflates it.
You still have time.<eos> Charles, the world is not the same as it was.<eos> We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.<eos> And where we're going, Eden... it doesn't exist.<eos> Her nurse got it from a comic book.
We're home.<eos> Hi, Julia.<eos> No!<eos> Go to sleep!<eos> Well, maybe it's because the restraining order is up and I can't renew it.
Diarmuid, listen to me.<eos> You must go. You must leave.<eos> Now!<eos> I can not leave, not without the rock, not without you.<eos> I hope the Lord will forgive me, but I threw it from the cart.
Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.<eos> It is worth letting him do this.<eos> Is your friend quite mad?<eos> No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.<eos> Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
Dr Watson.<eos> -I love his blog.<eos> Don't you?<eos> -His blog?<eos> -Don't you read it?
-All of them guilty.<eos> -Sherlock.<eos> (STAMMERS) And what do you call that one, John?<eos> Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.<eos> Yeah, I called it "Murder at the zoo."
Sherlock, you okay?<eos> -Watch him. He's got a knife.<eos> -Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel.<eos> You picked it up from that table.
I saw you take it.<eos> I certainly did not!<eos> Look behind his back!<eos> -Look. (LAUGHS)<eos> -I saw you take it!
This is an experiment.<eos> There will be rigour.<eos> Sherlock, pick up the gun.<eos> It's your turn next.<eos> When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- You.<eos> - How so?<eos> - If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands?<eos> Would waste valuable time.<eos> Probably just take it.
And it gets even worse.<eos> Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co, made this announcement.<eos> Teddy, roll the clip.<eos> And we are on schedule... to release the most adorable puppy ever.<eos> We're gonna launch it at the pet convention in Las Vegas!
What about this little plant?<eos> Can I smash it with a rock?<eos> No, Gef.<eos> It's too adorable to kill.<eos> Take it to the tailor.
You can do anything you want.<eos> I'm gonna make some weird shit.<eos> But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.<eos> Only we can remake the universe.<eos> Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos... and lead it to where it needs to go.
But to do so, we need video from inside the lab, footage of the horrible atrocities being committed against the animals.<eos> And there's a problem.<eos> The security is impenetrable.<eos> But there is a way.<eos> Although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your consent.
I sent you one.<eos> Tell it to your wife, Darren.<eos> Hey, Phil.<eos> I gave Dougie your coffee. I'm sorry.<eos> He really wanted it.
I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are, and that ass...<eos> Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I heard you've been kneading it all day.
Let's go.<eos> Get up!<eos> Why would Rand wanna buy this pier?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Ward said to buy it.
Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.<eos> Why is Rand so determined to keep the pier all to itself?<eos> Look, another group of people forced us to purchase it.
I've been alive long enough to watch the world change in many ways.<eos> But this change now, it feels significant.<eos> The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> The man with unbreakable skin.<eos> And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.
I was not born a homeless beggar.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Most people usually keep moving.<eos> I need information... about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.
That looks like the tattoo on your chest.<eos> How are you connected to these people?<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's a sacred symbol from K'un-Lun.<eos> Gao's giving them the finger by putting it on her poison.
In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> Bakuto.<eos> There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.
- We need to get you stitched up.<eos> - Airport?<eos> We're going home, Danny.<eos> No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.
He really died.<eos> Let's make a list of things that you are never allowed to say again, starting with that.<eos> Now, if you still have the tablet, I could... I could get it analyzed.<eos> Maybe prove that the documents were forged.<eos> I gave it to Harold.
Fuck.<eos> You got eyes on him?<eos> I think I got a shot.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going for it, man.
She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.<eos> It's a miracle... the fact that this park even exists.<eos> The fact that this city hasn't torn it down to put up high-rises.
- You punched first.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.
- How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.<eos> - You what?<eos> He earned it.
How are you?<eos> You, uh...<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait a second, Dee.<eos> - I've got an idea! - What?<eos> If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here. You said you couldn't rip through it.<eos> No, I can't. But Sherman can chew through it!
- Yeah, you should say...<eos> - you should lead with that. - I'm screwing up the pitch.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.<eos> We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts who wanted to take the power and essence of a crow and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink - that we invented, thus Fight Milk. - Yeah.<eos> I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it. - Are you kidding me, dude?
Well, I'm very happy to do so.<eos> I do have a few questions.<eos> - Fire away. - Yup.<eos> - Of course, yeah.<eos> Now, the ticket in question, uh, who purchased it?
- Totally lost. That means she bought it with my money!<eos> So, technically, that ticket is mine!<eos> Okay, okay, okay. Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.<eos> Miss Reynolds bought the ticket with Mr. Reynolds' money.<eos> But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.
I am.<eos> I'm not the god of war, Diana.<eos> I am the God of truth.<eos> Mankind Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.
There is not much we can do if that's who I think it is.<eos> But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!
If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news. It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.<eos> Who could forget him, huh?<eos> Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.<eos> Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.<eos> So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You love me.<eos> And you are not gonna shoot me.<eos> You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will just take it from a dead girl.
Well, now he is returned.<eos> And Delaney's will leaves him everything.<eos> Including Nootka.<eos> Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet?<eos> Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?
I flagged him down at St Pancras.<eos> I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide.<eos> They call it "laughing gas".
I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide.<eos> They call it "laughing gas".<eos> I provide it for entertainment at society parties.
Or it could burn.<eos> - Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.
- Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.<eos> Less chance the river might bring it back.
To the heath!<eos> He won't let us shift it.<eos> James.<eos> The powder that we moved last night was ready to be moved.<eos> That's why we moved it.
I didn't know it was a gun!<eos> He could have killed himself!<eos> He could have killed all of us!<eos> It was by my feet, russ.<eos> I moved it to get it out of the way.
Showed up in the mail the other day.<eos> We haven't used a key like this in over 20 years.<eos> Room 315.<eos> I'm pretty sure that this is the key to Agent Cooper's old room.<eos> I thought Harry would like to have it as a memento.
North 39.5752. West 71.2857.<eos> That's here in Rosewood.<eos> 492 Hart Street.<eos> Wait, Toby, isn't that your house, the one you built?<eos> I never found out who bought it.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.<eos> Do you know how they function?<eos> Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.<eos> But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.
Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Well, whatever's inside this cage is shielded from any outside electrical current.<eos> So the Ghost Rider won't be able to use lightning to escape.<eos> We put a lightning rod on the roof and connected it to that conduit cable.
We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.<eos> Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
Excellent question.<eos> For the crime of murdering the Mistress of the eastern wood... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz...<eos> I commit you to d...<eos> This sword.<eos> I knew the man who carried it.
And we celebrate the day that I vanquished that terror from our land.<eos> But when the two moons become one, the beast forever will return, and it will be worse than ever before.<eos> And it will obliterate everything in its wake.<eos> But if you build us weapons, with our expert knowledge, your technological prowess...<eos> We can... We will defeat it.
I know it's a lot. I know.<eos> Just focus on one thing.<eos> Focus on the dove.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you hear it?
Kill glinda.<eos> - Did you even think I could, or did you just send me there because you thought I'd never come back?<eos> - I sent you there to save oz.<eos> Because I swore to protect this world!<eos> And I will protect it!
What do you hear?<eos> Rain. - Rain. It was raining.<eos> Can you hear the rain?<eos> Do you hear it?<eos> Find it.
I was just confused.<eos> Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.<eos> Allow me to explain.<eos> I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser... and it accidentally came undone.<eos> And rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way.
The goal is to crush the brain inside the skull, and quick, before the pain can travel from outside the brain to the inside, so the brain never knows the brain is crushing.<eos> To give a good death is art.<eos> But nowadays, they have this bolt gun.<eos> You know?<eos> Put it on the forehead.
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
- That briefcase stays shut.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I fucking say. He just wants to confuse us.<eos> He's pissed off about it and wants to get at me.<eos> Open it, we look inside, then we won't suspect you.
- They don't want us infecting anyone.<eos> - Why isn't it on the TV?<eos> - It's a cover-up.<eos> That's why they invented the fire!<eos> They brought it to Spain, and it spread.
- Give it to me!<eos> - No!<eos> - Give it to me!<eos> - The battery!<eos> Give it to me!
- The battery!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Why now, when it's no use?<eos> Give me the phone, I know who to call.<eos> - Don't touch it!
Let's see what you do, because he's getting ideas.<eos> Right, "Beard Boy"?<eos> We have to get the gun.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> - We have to get it.
Where's my seed money?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - I don't have...<eos> - Speak up, I can't hear you.<eos> - I don't have it.
- Need a ride?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> I got my bike.<eos> - Just throw it in the trunk.
It's three miles of torture.<eos> What part of that is fun?<eos> Calling it fun is Orwellian.<eos> And why do you care if I miss it?<eos> Who else is gonna call it Orwellian?
- "What if I can't hum on key?<eos> What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears?"<eos> Is everyone reading that stupid magazine?<eos> I'm kind of addicted to it.<eos> -You never read it?
Bye.<eos> Um, hey, Helmet.<eos> Yeah, I know, I just got your text.<eos> Well, I... I don't know... I just called.<eos> Actually, I can just come by and pick it up.
I'm running errands today anyway.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I could have mailed it.
It took hours.<eos> And then... when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it.<eos> It was a bag of gold.<eos> All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.
You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."<eos> Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.<eos> Oh, I think you do.<eos> Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum...<eos> Shoney's. or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
W-where are you?<eos> On my work bench, Morty.<eos> Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?<eos> Flip the pickle over.<eos> What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
Your belt was in his bed.<eos> I lost that belt.<eos> Weeks ago.<eos> Where?<eos> If I knew that, Ingrid, I wouldn't have lost it.
Let's not make it any harder than it has to be.<eos> Erling Munk.<eos> Dmitri Podnikov?<eos> He's the Mayor of Vukobejina.<eos> If it's an official call, you must hand it back to me.
You should never have come.<eos> You should have stayed away.<eos> Someone took it. Just now.<eos> You don't know what this is, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> WHO TOOK IT?
Are you making fun of me?<eos> No.<eos> The liver separates the narcotic from the toxins.<eos> It connects all the victims:<eos> Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith drank it and Bianca was killed where they took it.
Me, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, my baby lost another baby tooth.<eos> - I put it under my pillow.
Between the blades.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ooh, higher.<eos> I'm gonna miss this cast.<eos> Yet you never asked to sign it.
That's always a classic.<eos> - Boo. - No need to ask for a bigger family since everybody seems to be marrying each other.<eos> I always wanted a little brother, by the way, dude.<eos> Or I could...<eos> I could give it away.
That's right.<eos> That's not the...<eos> Son, read my lips.<eos> You're in a shit storm, and we're the ones holding out the umbrella.<eos> You gonna take it?
At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.<eos> Come on, learn. It'll be fun.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We had a compact or whatever the fuck you called it.
He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself.<eos> No.<eos> - Ask for it.
- Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?
What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?<eos> One of you guys.<eos> I don't know how you people work.<eos> I'll need to see it.
No. No "but."<eos> No anything. I didn't do it.<eos> After you pressured me, for old times' sake,<eos> I did exactly what I'm supposed to do.<eos> I filled out a contact report and I sent it up the chain.
I-I thought I explained that?<eos> This led to an incident which Mr. Quinn held<eos> Franny and her nanny hostage for several hours.<eos> I described it in detail in my report.<eos> I've read it.
There were some irregularities during his interview.<eos> Evasiveness.<eos> - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his resume.<eos> How did he explain it?
The deal is broken.<eos> We are pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> - You know that's not true.<eos> - Saul has many qualities, the most admirable of which is his optimism.<eos> Some might call it a stubborn refusal to see what's exactly in front of his eyes.
Take care of yourself.<eos> I always do.<eos> I work here.<eos> I'm required to have a local access writ now. The INTERPOL Orange Writ of Coaction. Well, we prepared the Orange Writ.<eos> We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.
- Please, Laurie.<eos> It's in your best interest if you're not involved.<eos> You know, whatever you have to say to us, you can say to her.<eos> No one seems to care that I just witnessed a murder.<eos> - The man who perpetrated it just assaulted me.
And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and PuttPutt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I... I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.
That's nothing.<eos> I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.
Really?<eos> I mean, I didn't say anything because it was your money that bought it.<eos> Well, you should've said something.<eos> - It was our house.<eos> - You loved it.
Excellent.<eos> Now your penis, please, sir.<eos> - My what?<eos> - Your penis.<eos> Place it on the other scanner, please, sir.
Did you move back to Mapleton?<eos> No.<eos> Still in Jarden.<eos> In our house.<eos> Anyone still call it Miracle?
In a world full of orphans, they still had each other.<eos> And I was a ghost.<eos> I was a ghost who had no place there.<eos> And that, Kevin, is when I changed my mind.<eos> The physicists who sent me through told me the first person to use the machine was the guy who invented it.
That took a long time, too.<eos> But I found him and I asked him to make another machine because he already knew how.<eos> And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.
So, from there, the list got very short very quickly.<eos> Max fucked us.<eos> If it wasn't for her, we likely take Nassau whole, fleet intact, no prisoners in the fort, no fight between you and I.<eos> Instead, here we are.<eos> Now, one would think we could go a long way towards soothing all that chaos out there, and the anger driving it... if we could draw everyone together to see justice done to the one responsible for all of it.
Thanks for helping me move into Sesame Street, Mr. Frumpus.<eos> Boy, those boxes were heavy.<eos> But now that we're done, we can go get ice cream.<eos> - I want chocolate.<eos> - And you'll get it.
And then do you remember what I said right before that?<eos> Do you, Titus?<eos> I said, "I want chocolate."<eos> And then what did you say, Titus?<eos> Y-you'll get it?
Pat him down.<eos> Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm.<eos> I said pat him down.<eos> Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?<eos> His gun, get it and kick it over here.
I won't accept your resignation.<eos> It's true you should have told me... but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.<eos> As much as I appreciate your loyalty, I can't let you do this.<eos> If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage.<eos> Who knows? Maybe even turn it into an advantage.
Carter's two minutes out.<eos> I've got eyes on sight.<eos> Mullins asked me to pull up a cell phone conversation for Eric Carter's wife.<eos> But I can't find it.<eos> That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.
I'm trying to help.<eos> When all you've done since we hooked back up is the opposite.<eos> I never wanted the terrorists to get the list.<eos> There was an easy way to do that, Ben.<eos> Not steal it from me in the first place.
Yeah, there should be an extra port, for injections.<eos> There is.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> You need to pull the syringe all the way back, so the thing's full of air.<eos> Then inject it into the port.
Don't.<eos> Put your hands behind your head and move over there.<eos> Hands above your head now.<eos> You have a gun around your waist.<eos> Put it on the floor and slide it over to me, slowly.
That's unbelievable.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do believe I have that game ball in my office.<eos> Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.<eos> Let me see if I can find it.
Of course I love her.<eos> I let you try it your way!<eos> I did trust you.<eos> But I'm through wagering with her life now.<eos> If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us.
Your plan failed.<eos> We're moving on to my plan.<eos> Go get it. Bring it up here right now.
We'll resume tomorrow. Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.
Thank you.<eos> He's never stayed more than a day or two with me, but this... this little mystery seems to have caught his attention.<eos> That is a pretty piece of chaining.<eos> Effective ligand.<eos> Can I ask where you got it?
In the neighborhood I'm from, we say,<eos> "All the government is someone else's government." I want to build a rione...<eos> a neighborhood for our kind.<eos> I want to use this city.<eos> I want to take it and make it ours.
That's a lesson you only have to learn once.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I need to deploy your specialized computing skills, can-do attitude, the magic of your tech nerdistry.<eos> No one's ever said I have a can-do attitude before.<eos> That's because you hide it behind a superior, dismissive, and pessimistic mask, but I see past all that.
Raya.<eos> I need you to hack into Raya and get me an account on there.<eos> I can't do... do that.<eos> - Of course you can. - I mean, maybe I could, but that site's encrypted with a 128-bit Blowfish cipher.<eos> And no brute-force attack has been extensive enough to crack it.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm involved in my own.<eos> And I would have mentioned it last night, but, you know, she has so much to lose, and I...<eos> Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...
It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?<eos> We recovered this from the body.<eos> It's Richard's.<eos> I gave it to him.
I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.<eos> Well, we have another question from 8-year-old Mari.<eos> Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?<eos> No, we're gonna keep it up here.<eos> We're gonna study it where it's safe.
I use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into Boat A.<eos> I close the hatch.<eos> I press the button to give me full manual control.<eos> And if I can hold the stick, I can override the flight path.<eos> And if I hold it long enough, I can avoid reentry.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.<eos> The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home.
Ah, the food is tremendous.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?<eos> - Word as bond?<eos> Uh, I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it, eh.
It sure sounds like you're boring in bed.<eos> - But, Mrs. Hansen... - Time for a screwdriver!<eos> Oh dear. Give me a hand, will you?<eos> As for your women... Men don't understand it's all about the clitoris.<eos> Most can't even find it. And not only my late Poul, but all my lovers.
Oh dear. Give me a hand, will you?<eos> As for your women... Men don't understand it's all about the clitoris.<eos> Most can't even find it. And not only my late Poul, but all my lovers.<eos> Couldn't find it.<eos> Searched for it like it was the Higgs Boson in Switzerland.
Go, Dev! Run faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> My photo.<eos> My photo with Matteo Godardes.<eos> You idiot! Why didn't you send it to me?
I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?<eos> No.<eos> We'll never find it!
He's going to give up.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> I sure as heck would.<eos> There's a new picture at the Strand.<eos> Oh, no. I saw it three times.
- You?<eos> Good behaviour?<eos> - Get any bigger, I'll be needing longer arms.<eos> Daddy's won a cup for his boxing.<eos> Go on, Mickey, take it.
Well, let me put it this way, Justine...<eos> This is off the record, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> Now, my grandmother had a big, bossy goat.<eos> We used to call it King Goat because no matter what you were doing on the farm, he was always sticking his nose into things and shoving himself about and always trying to get in on the action.
Seems he's got three different accountants working for him.<eos> One thing I am sure of,<eos> Mayor Richards is not short of a bob or two.<eos> Yes, well, keep at it, Dwayne.<eos> JP? Well, sir, I got the file on Mayor Richards' beach hotel proposal from the Planning Office and I've been going through it.
Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.
I don't want it.<eos> I lost my son here.<eos> Fitz got shot here.<eos> My marriage died here.<eos> - I don't want it!
Mellie, listen to me...<eos> I am done running for President!<eos> Well, I'm not!<eos> They stole my phone, right out of my purse.<eos> - I want it back.
I am done running for President!<eos> Well, I'm not!<eos> They stole my phone, right out of my purse.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - No one stole it, Mrs. Vargas.
Someone sent you a finger.<eos> - Are you sure that it's.....<eos> - Archer Dunhill's, yes.<eos> The prints were a match.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent it or why?
Alison?<eos> Hi, it's Julie, we spoke on the phone.<eos> Right, hi.<eos> I was worried you wouldn't make it before closing.<eos> Okay, so here's your scanner just point it at the bar code of the item that you want and voila, it goes on your registry.
Guys, I have to keep the phone.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?
It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...
You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...<eos> No, I put it in my purse.
No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...<eos> No, I put it in my purse.<eos> He's not gonna find it.
Wait, do you hear that?<eos> It's like a hum and then a bunch of clicks.<eos> Yeah, trust me that thing makes all kinds of noise.<eos> I know, I just, I can't even tell if it's mechanical or electrical.<eos> I can't break through a firewall and hack into it.
Yeah, I thought-I thought that's what you said.<eos> Look, we've tried this a million times.<eos> When has it ever worked?<eos> It only has to work once.<eos> Hanna's gonna drop it off, so let's see who shows up to get it.
Tonight, and she gave me the Lost Woods.<eos> - She gave you a motel?<eos> - Yeah, Ali and me.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I'm supposed to mortgage it to pay for the lawyers that we're gonna need.
And I don't even know why.<eos> I just... I just can't.<eos> Yeah, that's bullshit.<eos> That voice that says you can't.<eos> Every time you hear that voice, I want you to tell it to fuck off.
I never done that.<eos> Look, I paddle out to the buoy, I collect the gear - and I hold onto it.<eos> That's all.<eos> - Yet her prints are here.<eos> She found it, but she wasn't gonna say anything.
And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, mom.<eos> Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
Good, thank you.<eos> You know, Sara... you and I have... a checkered past.<eos> But I am evermore a boring guy now, and... mellowed by life, trust me.<eos> If you have something you want to tell me about Michael, I'd sure love to hear it.<eos> When your call came in and Kishida processed it... well, let's just say there are certain keywords that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.
Well, whoever hacked your phone used your thumbprint, so, unless you're missing a thumb, that's you.<eos> I don't know what you're messed up in, but I'd watch your back...<eos> When you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with her partner.<eos> What?<eos> They tracked me down using my cell phone, so I brought it to Jep's to try and figure out
Don't fall for it.<eos> And don't do anything without talking to me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To buy a gun so that I can use it on Connor.
Have you anything to say before we start?<eos> Facilis descensus Averno.<eos> "The descent into Hell is easy."<eos> I'm glad you believe in our sacred Clave motto.<eos> Alec and I use it to remind each other we can't be broken.
You're very welcome.<eos> I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my bartender friend swears by this IPA.<eos> Oh, well, I'm not much of a drinker, period, but I'll take your word for it.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You hate it.
No, she's too young.<eos> But powerful beyond her years.<eos> By raising Madzie myself, I'll finally have a warlock that's unconditionally loyal.<eos> Do you like your new home, sweetheart?<eos> I found it just for you.
Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it. It's mine.
Oh, says the girl who was willing to die for the downworld, what, yesterday?<eos> She's right, Jace.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I'm not gonna touch the sword.<eos> I'll just get to it before it's activated, and bring the mortal instrument back to the clave, where it belongs.
Portal me to the institute.<eos> Clary, we can't.<eos> Now!<eos> Looks like he's already tapping the energy supply.<eos> We need to get to that power core and shut it down.
Impossible.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> You kill Clary, Valentine still has the damn sword.<eos> Over time, no doubt, he'll find a way to activate it.
- I can't.<eos> - Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.
- No. D-Do not say that.<eos> - We-we will get you help.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Make this city yours or you burn it to the ground.
So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> How'd Chase get you here?<eos> A plane.<eos> You think you can find your way back to it?
- I love you.<eos> Hey, Ma. You guys settled in all right?<eos> Yeah. It's so great now that you have the guest house.<eos> I'll have to come more often.<eos> Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.
Now, let's get to work.<eos> All right.<eos> Councilwoman, thank you very much for meeting with me.<eos> Well, from what I hear, you've been making the rounds.<eos> But as someone without a lot of political capital, you're certainly making an interesting choice as to how to spend it.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
Ahem. Ok.<eos> All right. Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Mayor, all due respect, your head's bleeding, and our concussion protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.<eos> Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm suspending it.
What do you got?<eos> When my Sonic cry hit vigilante, it knocked off a small piece of his visor.<eos> Looks like it's lined with some kind of circuitry.<eos> Well, that means, it's manufactured.<eos> Maybe I can link it back to where he bought it from.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
As you wish.<eos> This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts into accounts that Gregor controls. Yes.<eos> We know this, to spread among Bratva captains.<eos> It also contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> Open it.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?<eos> You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.<eos> Full throttle.<eos> What do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
Luckily, I got a chance to see the file they're working on.<eos> Orekhovo-zuyevo.<eos> It is a--a shipyard in Moscow.<eos> Then we go to the shipyard.<eos> We stop Kovar from retrieving it.
- Death by elevator.<eos> - This doesn't feel like Chase.<eos> No. At first, I thought maybe Chase was trying to tie up loose ends, but I couldn't find any connections between them.<eos> He had his Argus security key still on him.<eos> Why enter the elevator if not to take it?
The problem.<eos> After Damien Darhk took my security implant last year, I instituted new protocols to prevent any sensitive Argus information or location from being accessed by a single person.<eos> Access now requires two of these security keys.<eos> But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.<eos> You found it on him.
What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I... I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.<eos> Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it and pulls it down, and it burns her hand real bad...
I hate to ask this, but how much air do they have left down there?<eos> Well, if they don't exert themselves, 5, maybe 6 hours.<eos> Ok. We're here.<eos> Now what?<eos> The mainframe has a built-in cellular chip, but our rewire didn't generate enough kilowatts to jump-start it.
- No.<eos> No. I don't think that will work.<eos> Wait, wait. You said the hatch was titanium, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
One of my last happy memories.<eos> And I'm guessing, this not one of them.<eos> I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.<eos> I didn't save our city.<eos> I failed it.
Cyclotrizane emissions trace came back.<eos> Computer's been working on a probable loca...tion.<eos> What is it?<eos> Nice!<eos> What made you decide to put it back on?
Yeah.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Yes! Ha ha!<eos> I love the cake.<eos> Where did you get it?
On its own.<eos> What can you tell me about that?<eos> The flower is unfolding.<eos> It's becoming.<eos> How can we stop it?
The flower is unfolding.<eos> It's becoming.<eos> How can we stop it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Why would you want to stop it?
It's not a bio-toxin, or some genetic toolkit. It's alien.<eos> You still want to destroy our sample?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> Miller wanted to destroy it, too, you know.
He wants to control it.<eos> Fred's trying to protect the Belt.<eos> Or so he claims.<eos> It's too dangerous to leave our sample out there anymore.<eos> We have to destroy it.
Make sure you tell them that.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Fixing the Martian flag.<eos> You're defacing it, Picasso.
What happened on that station?<eos> It wasn't a biohazard emergency.<eos> Someone was testing a weapon.<eos> Miller: Julie uncovered a plan to unleash this thing on Eros.<eos> She tried to stop it, she got infected.
We celebrate the birth of St John, and traditionally, locally, it's a time when we welcome newcomers into the community.<eos> Back in the day, people laid tables outside their houses and all were invited.<eos> We, of course, will be eating in the dining room.<eos> You're asking us to a Christian feast?<eos> Think of it more as a knees-up.
It's a coffee pot.<eos> Is that not coffee in there?<eos> Oh, is there not coffee?<eos> Actually, Ders, don't you mean flat Dr. Pepper pot?<eos> Because we put flat Dr. Pepper in a coffee pot and switched it.
I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.
I'm sorry to throw you into the deep end of the pool like this, but I need to know what we're up against.<eos> You mean beyond a secret society that controls all of Gotham.<eos> Well, if they could isolate the virus they could transform it into any number of compounds that could be released on a large scale into the city.<eos> All they'd need is a sample of her blood.<eos> Well, they ain't getting it from the source.
The shipment that came into dock 9C.<eos> Yes.<eos> It still needs to be tested, which means that you still have enough time to keep them from unleashing it citywide.<eos> But, of course, if they discover that their lab has been compromised...<eos> He's right, they might unleash it right away.
My enemies took everything from me.<eos> Tried to murder me.<eos> You help me get my revenge, and when I take back my throne, I will give you every resource you need to free yourself from this icy prison.<eos> Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours outside the cold without my suit.<eos> And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a Wayne Enterprises black site ever since you escaped Indian Hill.
I guess he wasn't meant to be.<eos> You crossed paths with Nygma recently.<eos> Any idea what this secret is he's talking about?<eos> No, I have no clue.<eos> My guess is he just made it up.
We just busted that dude five minutes ago.<eos> There's more.<eos> What is this doing in here?<eos> It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.<eos> He must have moved it.
- Won't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange,<eos> - it's gone.<eos> - Maybe Lucius took it.
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.<eos> Why would she be drawn to a man with so much darkness?<eos> Such an appetite for violence?<eos> Unless something inside her... liked it.<eos> Craved it.
I left him a way out.<eos> You hear that, Jim?<eos> I left you an escape hatch.<eos> Have you found it yet?<eos> You should've found it by now.
- I can't.<eos> - Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.
DDo not say that.<eos> - Wewe will get you help.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Make this city yours... or you burn it to the ground.
You got this, Wallace!<eos> I don't know why you even ask him.<eos> What did Wells do with me?<eos> His plan was, more methodically constructed than John Doe's in "Seven."<eos> And he had a bit more time to work it out by, give or take, 15 years.
Antibiotics won't work.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Nothing's not an option.<eos> Okay, what do you do when a banana ripens too quickly?<eos> - Put it in the freezer.
- Everybody brace yourselves!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.
I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.<eos> You took my home away from me, and now I will take it back!
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.<eos> No, not everything.<eos> We still have a piece of that Stone.<eos> Not for long.<eos> And once I have it, you and everyone you love will perish.
- It's gone?<eos> - If Savitar gets ahold of the stone...<eos> He'll escape for sure.<eos> You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace.<eos> You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force by yourself.
Wally.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> I know what my hell is.<eos> I've already seen it in the future.
Come on.<eos> Gentle, gentle.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yup.<eos> The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,<eos> - grab it for us, would you, please?
I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.
I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.
That's what mercy gets you.<eos> This must be where Waller kept her suicide squad.<eos> I think this is it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cisco, we found it.
It's ready.<eos> You didn't have that the last time, - so we have the upper hand now. - Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> You guys figure out what your plan is.<eos> I can't be here to know any of it.
Why didn't it work?<eos> I spent an eternity in a trap just like that.<eos> You think I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again?<eos> The philosopher's stone.<eos> It's made of calcified Speed Force energy, and you gave it to me.
Seline murdered my friend.<eos> I mean to figure out how to get payback.<eos> And since our only weapon is currently traveling through Paris...<eos> - You mean the tuning fork? - Actually, it'sitctually called the staff of Arcadius.<eos> Cade's enemies forged it in the fire
- Any other useless demands?<eos> I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.
I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.<eos> And I need your help to find it.
Besides, we know Sybil's field trip was headed near Mystic Falls.<eos> We're going in the right direction.<eos> All because she wants a bell.<eos> I've never heard of anything so insane.<eos> Says the guy who threw it off the bridge. I mean, what were you thinking, anyway?
You know? One person steals from him, everyone else thinks they can, too.<eos> All right.<eos> But then who has the package?<eos> How... how did you find me?<eos> I'm sorry I took it.
I used to steal cars.<eos> It's not fun if you don't drive 'em really, really fast.<eos> Anyway, I know where some black market ZX3 is locked up:<eos> a chop shop in NoHo.<eos> Problem is, I'm not sure I can get the owner to hand it over.
Give it to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It was in her purse.<eos> Look, you gave it to me, remember?
Black bill, he's...<eos> Us. Come again?<eos> Growing up, my father'd tell me stories about a monster.<eos> Lived under our house and made our family rich.<eos> All we had to do was... Was feed it.
How is that possible?<eos> Crowley, I guess. And now he's dead.<eos> Well, that's what Hess said.<eos> But Crowley's a freakin' cockroach.<eos> I'll believe he's gone when I see the body and burn it.
Wait.<eos> In an...actual rat?<eos> Wasn't too bad, really.<eos> Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it.
Thanks a lot.<eos> What do you think, Miller?<eos> Do you think her attacker sent that text?<eos> Well, it doesn't make sense.<eos> Why send it now?
Listen, I was wondering, erm... if I popped over, maybe in the next half hour, would that be all right?<eos> I just need to borrow the old laptop.<eos> What for?<eos> Oh, it's got some files on it I need for school.<eos> I'll get it back to you later tonight.
- Leah, seriously...<eos> - Dad, please!<eos> Please, I really need you not to behave weirdly right now.<eos> This is my spare locker key.<eos> If mum's computer is in there at the end of the school day, I can take it home, put it back and I don't have to tell anyone.
- PowerPoints of what?<eos> You know, various things.<eos> Osmosis, reproductive systems, the cellular life of plants...<eos> Right, well, we'll have the computer now, thanks.<eos> We'll examine it for our enquiries.
What did you expect to get from him?<eos> I just needed...<eos> I needed to hear Joe say it.<eos> You know, confess properly, like he never would in court.<eos> I tried to record him on my phone, so I could give it to the police, but he took it off me.
- Then why are you taking him?<eos> - It's gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?
Right, come on.<eos> Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.<eos> That bag wasn't there.<eos> You want us to believe you see a suspicious bag inside one of your sheds, pick it up, leaving your fingerprints and DNA.
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon.<eos> - Incredible!<eos> - Astounding!<eos> Stephano used this double-barrel syringe to inject the venom into Uncle Monty, to simulate the double puncture marks of a snake.<eos> Then he disassembled it to hide the evidence.
Smart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But unnecessary.<eos> I rescinded the order.<eos> Told David to destroy it before anybody could see it.
Hi...<eos> Hello.<eos> Um, yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> My laptop was stolen, and I can see it.
I don't know what the fuck that is.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.<eos> I just want it back.
We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.<eos> I just want it back.<eos> There's no questions...<eos> So, can you get it?
Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot.<eos> I... I left my wallet on the night stand at the hotel.<eos> I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do.<eos> Just call someone and have them run it over.
- Can you talk?<eos> I can.<eos> Thanks for getting my phone back to me, though I wish you'd done it in person.<eos> Didn't think that'd be too smart.<eos> Anybody at the station see you with it?
Okay, it was.<eos> It's just not anymore.<eos> I don't feel like having a birthday, so I'm skipping it.<eos> Oh. Well, I got you a gift.<eos> Should I return it?
Oh. Well, I got you a gift.<eos> Should I return it?<eos> No, no, you don't have to return it.<eos> That was very thoughtful of you.<eos> I'll return it.
Oh, someone's here with a cake for you, Dr. Reid.<eos> They're very insistent.<eos> Well, tell them I'm in surgery, and I don't want it.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> Why don't you share it with the other nurses?
- Thank you.<eos> - ... outside this room.<eos> Thank you for understanding.<eos> Your phone, sir?<eos> I left it in the car.
And where did you hide it?<eos> I mean, the sound's pretty clear, so it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?<eos> Tucked under a space blanket.<eos> Out of sight. Wow.<eos> So there's no chance I would see it.
Can you tell us where the nearest source is right now?<eos> Jimmy, do you have something in your pocket?<eos> Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.<eos> My cellphone.<eos> From this distance, you should feel it, and you don't, do you?
Hold on.<eos> Uh, repeat after me...<eos> Uh, "For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today<eos> "and have it on the air tomorrow."<eos> For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today and have it on air tomorrow.
What is that noise?<eos> It sounds like a saw cutting through bone.<eos> Yep.<eos> You get used to it. I...<eos> I don't even hear it anymore!
I loved Margaret.<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> It's just that sexuality is fluid, and sometimes my fluids go towards men.<eos> Our family-man angle took a hit.<eos> On the plus side, the airline found my bag and they're shipping it here, so we're gonna build on that luggage news and get some positive momentum going.
And for no more of our soldiers to die from this drug.<eos> Ingersol Pharmaceuticals has to be stopped, Dan.<eos> Dan?<eos> Do you know the red box trail in Shenandoah State Park?<eos> I can find it.
Not until I get my daughter back.<eos> Even then, I...<eos> The only way I'm gonna get my daughter back is if I return that laptop untouched.<eos> Where is it, by the way?<eos> They better not be trying to hack into it.
Get me an address.<eos> 26 tivoli college park.<eos> Hi.<eos> Got your rug.<eos> Where do you want it?
The Register could really use a Lois Lane type like you.<eos> I think I know something that can help with the Blossom investigation.<eos> People are saying Cheryl heard a gunshot?<eos> That's what she's claiming, yes.<eos> I heard it, too.
Make some room, outcasts.<eos> I'm having deja vu.<eos> Yeah, senior year, we're here, watching Candyman.<eos> God, I hated that movie.<eos> - You picked it.
Kevin called me. And he said his dad found a gun, the gun that killed Jason, in a lockbox in FP's closet.<eos> But Betty, we searched FP's trailer.<eos> We looked through that closet.<eos> And there was no lockbox.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Juggy, we screwed up. We all did.<eos> Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.<eos> Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.<eos> That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Veronica, wait.<eos> You and Archie...<eos> Getting closer?<eos> Maybe, why do you ask?<eos> Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy out the SoDale contract, but Fred is still on the fence about it.
I'm tired.<eos> Later, bro.<eos> You were right.<eos> Check it out.<eos> It's like Gunn was clawing at the opening to keep from getting taken through it.
Because we already indicted someone else.<eos> You didn't happen to find Danny's phone in his apartment, did you?<eos> It wasn't logged into Evidence.<eos> I mean, there might be something on his phone that's not on his computer.<eos> He probably dropped it when he was attacked, and we don't know where that was.
- Tell the truth!<eos> Order!<eos> Well, that's the cell phone.<eos> It's already marked "People's 23."<eos> Perhaps we should look at it.
We need that footage.<eos> There's nothing on the cloud.<eos> There was a laptop at the scene.<eos> Kind of burned up, but there could be footage on it.<eos> We had our hands on it at the cabin, But unfortunately, the feds nabbed it from us.
- Don't you dare.<eos> That is what I am doing, Olivia...<eos> My job.<eos> I am protecting this office.<eos> No, you're destroying it.
Yes. Now you can see how she inspires.<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Your Zelda has a voice.<eos> Really?<eos> Hell, I could see publishing it in its own right.
Some of it...<eos> Certainly not worth squabbling over.<eos> Two wordsmiths under one roof.<eos> - What could be better?<eos> - My point is we both stand to benefit far more financially is I were to use that diary than if you were to publish it under your own name.
Well, you were right.<eos> Just like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, you don't think my novel will stand the test of time?<eos> Well, I couldn't say.<eos> I haven't read it.
The pork processing place out in Duarte?<eos> Oh, you got to check that out.<eos> But you said "the big client."<eos> That's the one... that's the one that has the weird name that's... it's hard to pronounce.<eos> How do you, how do you say it?
Roxy, talk to me. How's she doing?<eos> Not so hot, Dr. Reid.<eos> She's lost a lot of blood.<eos> Okay, keep it coming with the O neg, and give me as much volume as possible.<eos> We're very excited about the new surgical robot that we got from St. Vic's, and you'll be happy to know that I got it at a good price.
- Previously on Beyond...<eos> - While you were in your coma, your mind traveled to another world.<eos> - This is where we met.<eos> - They call it The Realm.
Any connection with Oxford?<eos> Brief spell as vicar of Saint Mary's ten years ago.<eos> Saint Mary's?<eos> Barry Finch was a choirboy there, until his voice went.<eos> Looking at the mark on Finch's body, If you were to rotate it, it could be a cross, couldn't it?
And I put it to him... that your little one was the next best thing.<eos> He knows I asked you.<eos> And he knows you said no.<eos> Well, as I said, I'm saying yes now.<eos> You can take it -- as soon as it's born.
It's Ivy's.<eos> Reggie's going to be staying with us for a couple of days, just till he gets himself sorted.<eos> Hm.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Erm, Reggie, why don't you take your plant through to the spare room and find a nice bright spot for it?
One baby!<eos> Meet your little girl.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I longed for this baby, Patrick.<eos> Longed for it, prayed for it.
Tom, please, p-put down the gun.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just...<eos> Why?<eos> So you can pick it up and shoot me?
Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.<eos> You'd better get started.<eos> And careful of the paper mites.<eos> They like flesh as well.<eos> We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
Golden roses, indeed.<eos> Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.<eos> The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.<eos> Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.<eos> So you just let them take it?
The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.<eos> Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.<eos> So you just let them take it?<eos> For now.<eos> They won't be able to hold it.
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?<eos> How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.
How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.<eos> What did he call it?
Ah, stranger things have happened.<eos> Like what?<eos> The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.<eos> - The current harvest?<eos> - We have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the Reach.
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.<eos> They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.<eos> We must devise a way to raise their spirits.<eos> Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.<eos> My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
Cersei's on her list of names.<eos> Who else is on your list?<eos> Most of them are dead already.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Littlefinger gave it to me.
I meant what I said.<eos> I'm not here to put men in chains.<eos> If that becomes an option, many will take it.<eos> I gave them a choice.<eos> They made it.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.<eos> But you are back.<eos> And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
Aye.<eos> You did.<eos> Funny old life.<eos> Alright then.<eos> - Where did she get it?
Killer knew his way around a blade.<eos> Hit this kid's bleeders.<eos> You must know the move... Two cuts across the neck down the shoulder.<eos> Serious move, brother.<eos> Ever try it for real?
Mamacita.<eos> - I like him for it.<eos> - No doubt.<eos> Think he still has the weapon?<eos> If he does, he bleached it.
C'mere.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look for the brightest object in the sky above the moon.<eos> Oh, yeah, I see it.
At the interview they asked me if I could be any type of animal, what kind of animal would I be?<eos> How is that relevant for frozen yogurt?<eos> Are you wearing Tom's aftershave?<eos> Oh, I guess so.<eos> I just found it in the medicine cabinet.
You don't remember me?<eos> I'm your old student.<eos> Marius.<eos> Yeah, that... you told me that was the first trick you learned.<eos> Now I get halfway through a gag and can't finish it.
No more birthday parties. No more cake.<eos> Well...<eos> Right?<eos> No, my 11th birthday party, I did... I got cake.<eos> I just didn't get to eat it.
Sometimes you have to try to forget things, like my cousin Taylor, all right?<eos> The guy's always puttin' me down, making me feel like shit.<eos> Then he'd play it off, like he was just teasing or something, but no, he's an asshole.<eos> There was one time we were at this fair, all right?<eos> I go into the porta potty, and Taylor comes and he... he pushes it over...
The, uh, airport cops are hauling ass towards us.<eos> It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me. One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.<eos> Were you?<eos> I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond.<eos> I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down. There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home.
Memory can be very faulty, Noah. We all know that.<eos> I was there, and you weren't.<eos> Wasn't I?<eos> I don't know where that stuff came from.<eos> I didn't write it.
Vanessa says Jake's been out every night since election night.<eos> If we can figure out where he was going, maybe we can start to try to put the pieces together.<eos> The day Jenny was killed, I picked up the signal of a satellite phone near her cabin.<eos> She's around here somewhere.<eos> She actually bought a satellite phone, and she's using it.
I didn't pay Tom Larsen.<eos> - It was my...<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait for what?<eos> Your phone, give it to me.
I'm not thinking about it.<eos> You are.<eos> Don't lie, Red.<eos> I know the look.<eos> I've seen it on many, many faces.
She has a phone.<eos> I gave her one just in case.<eos> You can track it down, triangulate her signal.<eos> We can find Huck. We can bring him home.<eos> Her cell stopped sending signal hours ago which mean could mean she turned it off, but it could also mean it's damaged.
Think about it.<eos> We'll submit it again.<eos> Olivia, there wouldn't be any point.<eos> This bill, with this language...<eos> We've dressed it up a hundred different ways, and no one's biting.
- just like everybody else.<eos> - Come on. What could the two of you possibly disagree on?<eos> You know what we should show him?<eos> Our wedding album.<eos> Hon, can you go and grab it?
Is that my robe?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He said it feels like money.<eos> Just wash it when you're done.
You should have shopped Black Friday.<eos> Isn't that when all the best deals are done?<eos> That's what I keep telling him.<eos> So listen, your request for surveillance on the suspects in the Meadows caper...<eos> I can't do it.
My daughter has a way to save us.<eos> It's a device that my brother invented to keep humans safe while radiating the atmosphere with Kryptonite.<eos> It would've made the planet uninhabitable for both of you.<eos> Well, lucky my cousin put him in jail before he could make it work.<eos> And lucky for you, I found it.
No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.<eos> I just gave Supergirl the remote.<eos> Only she can turn it on.
You can't understand how wonderful it is.<eos>  I do.<eos> It's summer to me.<eos> Has been my whole life.<eos>  But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.
Well, I guess I'm not as tough as I thought.<eos> I barely made it to the lobby.<eos> Do you remember that day...<eos> I was walking you home from school, and it was garbage day, and we found this old TV on the side of the road?<eos> Yeah, and you tried to get me to smash it.
No, it's so Delaware.<eos> - And, yeah, of course.<eos> - Denise!<eos> Jane, this piece was your idea.<eos> I didn't even wanna do it.
I must say I'm just blown away that you were able to raise so much money so quickly.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'm gonna go buy a Splett shirt.<eos> Uh, sweatshirt.<eos> Yeah, that's what we call it in my family.
- I want to make a deal.<eos> No, guys, she... she's not sane.<eos> One small consolation is the bitch is with The Beast right now and I can't really see that going her way.<eos> Word as bond.<eos> I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it.
They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.<eos> Where's my cell phone?<eos> I have to call him.<eos> I haven't called him.<eos> Uh, I traded it.
Fred saw what the Protomolecule did to Eros.<eos> He wants to control it.<eos> It's too dangerous to leave our sample out there anymore.<eos> That is too important to destroy right now.<eos> We have to destroy it.
Even a friendly one, afraid that if we disobey, we will have our air cut off, our water rationed, be spaced, or be herded into chambers to be used like animals.<eos> This is the way it has been until now.<eos> No more.<eos> I have stolen your secret, Fred Johnson.<eos> And I am giving it to the Belt.

Hardly anything is evil, but most things are hungry.<eos> Hunger looks very like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery.<eos> Or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?<eos> So what is it and what was it doing on Earth?<eos> Well, there were scorch marks on the concrete where we found it.
When she realised her cousin was gravely ill, as a result of the insulin that you gave her, she called the night bell for assistance, only nobody came.<eos> Why?<eos> Why didn't you respond, Doctor?<eos> Was it because you and Nurse MacMahon had other more pressing things on your mind?<eos> It was because Clodagh switched it off.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Look forward to meeting you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fetched you a rabbit, Grandma.<eos> Oh, put it in the kitchen.
It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.<eos> It surfaced in the late 19th century when people started moving to big cities and living on top of each other in these massive apartment buildings, where night after night after night they had this shared experience where the tenants would hear their neighbors, like,<eos> by the thousands, come home after work, sit down, take off one shoe, drop it on the floor, right?
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be sure to set up the cameras, so you have a view<eos> - of the whole room. - Got it.<eos> And the only way you're gonna be able to hear us is with this earbud, but don't put it in until you're in the room.
It's natural, made from pine sap, but still pretty toxic.<eos> How long would it take to make another batch?<eos> Don't need to, I'll just bring the turpentine to you.<eos> It's not harmful to pregnant women, is it?<eos> Not unless I drink it.
This skull thing tried to grab me and pull me into wherever it was.<eos> And it almost killed you.<eos> I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.
Look what David is holding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot.<eos> He had a staff too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't promoted.<eos> Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that's bothering me.<eos> It was completely cracked up, as if it had been put back together by a lot of different pieces, and not one of all of these texts references anything like that.<eos> Yeah, something bothers me about it too.<eos> I mean, if it's as all-powerful as it's supposed to be and belonged to all the people it supposedly belonged to...<eos> Then how did this Zerstoerer guy get his grubby mitts on it?
Question... once it's ready, how do we get it on Zerstoerer?<eos> What about dipping bullets in it, like we did with the Siegbarste, remember?<eos> We shot him with that poison, and it worked.<eos> - I still have the gun.<eos> - Maybe we should bring it.
Since 'ee did bestow the cottage as a dwelling', not a meetin' house.<eos> I couldn't care less what you use it for as long as you don't stir up unrest in the village.<eos> We've had enough in recent years.<eos> We're looking for a little peace.<eos> In the Lord shall ye find it!
Wait there.<eos> - I've nothing to give you.<eos> - You gave me this.<eos> It's the most precious gift I've ever received.<eos> You never take it off.
What do Miss Morwenna say?<eos> I don't believe she's overly keen, but Mama said it's a great match, so I expect she'll come around soon enough.<eos> You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.<eos> No, Master Geoffrey, 'tis enough to have had your friendship.<eos> You can open it later if you'd rather.

No, I th-I thought angels couldn't die.<eos> - He's dead.<eos> - All right.<eos> Anyway, you guys were right.<eos> You said word would get out about Genesis and the bad men would want it for themselves.
But I wasn't that mad, you know?<eos> He was always throwing up and falling off of things.<eos> I wasn't that mad 'cause... he wore a suit and tie.<eos> I don't know where it came from.<eos> Lord knows I never saw it again after, but, um... that day... he wore a suit and tie... for me.
Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms.<eos> I'm not taking it.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - Just listen to me.<eos> When I was on trial, I said that I was given a gift and I threw it away.
My ex-husband installed it.<eos> It was one of the startups that he was investing in.<eos> Do you know your OffKey security user name and password?<eos> Yes. It's... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God.<eos> Tom changed it every seven days.
Come on.<eos> You said I had the right to remain silent.<eos> Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> No. But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table. Open it up, please, right now.
Get out of here, ya freaks.<eos> You don't know what you're missing out on.<eos> That suit was so formfitting.<eos> Be bloody hard to get out off, I'd imagine, huh?<eos> Unless he never takes it off.
It's like you can't tickle yourself, can you?<eos> You need someone else to do it or it doesn't work, someone outside your own nervous system.<eos> - Is this going somewhere, Toni?<eos> - Yeah, sorry.<eos> OK, so I'm with this girl, she's gorgeous, and she's inspecting my dick, she's twirling it around, she's flicking it back and forth, and so I slip my hand up her leg, and, er, I get to her panties,
- What's there to say?<eos> He's a liar.<eos> There are other things.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.
I'm very worried.<eos> - All right, where's your child?<eos> - No, no, it's a baby.<eos> OK, where's your baby?<eos> I can't... I can't remember where I've left it.
Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.<eos> Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.<eos> And the baby?<eos> She lost it?<eos> - Did they find it?
We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...<eos> half an hour ago.<eos> Then I ate it.
I am... ill-equipped to be a king.<eos> I am no better equipped to teach one.<eos> Being an adult is recognizing your responsibilities.<eos> A bunch of my students went and conquered another world.<eos> They more, like, gave it to us.
We weren't her friends, remember?<eos> We owe it to her... because we weren't her friends.<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We're magicians.<eos> Let's build it ourselves.
Drivers getting angry at sharing the road with his bike?<eos> I-I remember a few days ago, I think it was last wednesday.<eos> Yeah, it was last wednesday.<eos> Will said he felt like this car was following him.<eos> He said he saw it a few times...
- We're looking for Quinn.<eos> Why? What happened?<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> Somebody disabled her phone and we can't trace it.
All right, man, look.<eos> The... the lady dropped her key.<eos> - Her key?<eos> - That's right, man, her key.<eos> And I... and I went after her to give it back.
- Ping his phone.<eos> The number he gave me is out of service, but I got an address off his license.<eos> 3942 Wyoming Street.<eos> Get a warrant.<eos> Let's hit it.
I fear he does not merit the trust His Majesty places in him.<eos> Sire.<eos> Do you know the best way to subdue a wild horse?<eos> The whip, Sire?<eos> Put it to pasture with a tame one.
The refrigerator is broken.<eos> The ice cream is melting.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Is it because it's warm?<eos> Fine, I'll call the repairman, and he'll come here and fix it posthaste.
We could all take a page from his book.<eos> That yogurt is expired.<eos> See?<eos> This could've killed me.<eos> Now I can give it to Erlich.
There is something lodged in the rectum.<eos> What is that, a gun?<eos> He says he has no idea how the gun got up there.Nt.<eos> All right, what are our options?<eos> It's not gonna be easy getting it out.
We'll have to put the procedure on hold.<eos> Why?<eos> Our patient just confessed to a crime.<eos> That means the gun is considered evidence.<eos> And since his father convinced him to withdraw consent, We'll have to secure a warrant to remove it.
Thank you, both.<eos> State's attorneys secured the warrant.<eos> We're a go.<eos> I don't believe that story rey's telling about the gun, Do you?<eos> About smuggling it into jail?
Not at all, we're just... We're just doing a visualization exercise.<eos> Again. Close your eyes again, ariel.<eos> And...<eos> Do you see your shield?<eos> Okay. Now keep describing it to me.
I'd say so.<eos> Most likely uti. It's common in paraplegics.<eos> Been down that road a few times.<eos> Life with a catheter, right?<eos> We made to need to replace it.
Good luck?<eos> Ethan, are you kidding?<eos> Nat, I've met combat vets who have been paralyzed.<eos> The feelings of inferiority can be overwhelming.<eos> If you told them a bottle of snake oil. Might help them walk again, They'd drink it every time.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son.<eos> They need to operate on him immediately.<eos> But it was promised to us!<eos> We've been waiting for it.<eos> Plus that man would want Dustin to have it.
Vijay, don't do this.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - He's not safe with her.<eos> - Jemma...<eos> Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Um, I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Won't be long before they find the other guys we ICE'd.<eos> What's the situation?<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.
What's the situation?<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.<eos> But the bad news...<eos> There's a squad of heavily armed mercs guarding it.
Probably a lot more than she's paying you.<eos> If you're making me an offer, get on with it.<eos> Looks like we got two choices here.<eos> Either I crush this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or...<eos> Or we could kill you and take it.
I don't know.<eos> Uh... This code is advanced.<eos> It's like fifth-generation syntax.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Every time I keep trying to alter it, it kicks me right back to the ...
We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> That was the whole point in giving it to him.<eos> Well, we need to get it back and destroy it.<eos> - If you'd given it to me ...
Though, to be honest, I'm starting to feel some tension, sexual and otherwise, so I was actually thinking about taking a shot, but I'm afraid it could go south.<eos> - You Americans, you talk too much.<eos> - It's our greatest flaw.<eos> Our unit has been made aware that an item was found on the premises.<eos> We have been sent to retrieve it.
You're in danger.<eos> I have so many memories of snow.<eos> My first time ice-skating on my neighbor's pond.<eos> A month stationed near the French Alps.<eos> But the truth is... this is the first time I've seen it.
See?<eos> Good as new.<eos> - And stronger, it seems.<eos> - I know what you did.<eos> You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine.
Got to be contraband.<eos> They busted my neighbor for a laptop last night.<eos> - The drone... it's in my bag.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna take it back myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
Daddy!<eos> She's just a kid!<eos> Let her go!<eos> No!<eos> The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it.
You have my word.<eos> Excellent. I am eager to put a knife through agent coulson's throat.<eos> And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D.... We have located the two agents threatening the framework.<eos> They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.<eos> Once we get a lock-on, my men have orders to shoot it down.
- ... lifted?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We have located the two agents threatening the Framework.<eos> They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.<eos> Once we get a lock on it, my men have orders to shoot it down.
My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.<eos> So do what you want to this body.<eos> My plan is in motion.<eos> And nothing can stop it now.
Slow down.<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
It's started again with Paul.<eos> The Adam hating?<eos> He doesn't want to kill him any more, which I'm seeing as progress, but...<eos> It's just cos the baby's getting closer.<eos> Maybe Paul is worried about how he's going to feel when he sees it.
The Adam hating?<eos> He doesn't want to kill him any more, which I'm seeing as progress, but...<eos> It's just cos the baby's getting closer.<eos> Maybe Paul is worried about how he's going to feel when he sees it.<eos> He'll love it.
Most of the time.<eos> He could be arrogant, especially with a beer inside him, and, of course, he was a City fan, so...<eos> Yes, I liked him.<eos> We talked... .. about you, about the baby.<eos> He was looking forward to it.
Right, what do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> Like, who else was involved.<eos> All right, just take the gun out my face.<eos> I've got bleach and I will use it in your fucking eyes!
- Hey.<eos> - Oh, I'm glad to see you. - Yeah.<eos> - I gotta get this bag off.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can't take it.
No, not that I've noticed.<eos> - It'd be too early for any of that.<eos> Is the Putnam's cake ready?<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> I just need to wrap it up.
It's not going to be easy without your husband.<eos> Why don't you worry about your own husband?<eos> They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner.
What are you talking about?<eos> We had him guarantee to pay you what he promised and to hire you over there at the end of the quarter.<eos> - 'Cause I don't just want you to set that hearing,<eos> Look, it's up to you.<eos> You take the job and the money and you get me in or you stay on a sinking ship and wait for them to figure out that you're the one who sank it.
Because I didn't fly all the way down here to strong-arm that woman.<eos> And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.<eos> You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.
There's something clipped onto his rib.<eos> Good lord!<eos> There's wire attached.<eos> It runs underneath the skin.<eos> Follow it.
To ensure life and death remain separate.<eos> But if he crosses that bridge...<eos> He won't!<eos> And why not?<eos> Because I'm gonna destroy it.
It's all here. Um...<eos> Oxy, Percocet, speed, pregnancy tests.<eos> What's the ketamine for?<eos> Some of the guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies.<eos> But the girls use it, too.
Figure it out.<eos> What...<eos> What's in the package?<eos> I just know it's important.<eos> And don't open it either.
I'll come in a minute.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Where is the fan?<eos> - Right, I'm coming over.<eos> We'll find it.
I can't be expected to sit in this heat without a fan.<eos> And once there, I believe that you recovered the knife.<eos> And at the same time, you were still making a fuss, saying that you couldn't find what it was you were looking for.<eos> Where is the fan?<eos> Which then gave you, Judith, an excuse to go and help her - to find it.
- Not a thing.<eos> I'm sorry you had to reup.<eos> I know how much you hate being one of the good guys.<eos> I highly doubt those were the good guys.<eos> I finally got some dynamite and didn't even get to use it.
- It helps block out the smell.<eos> Try not to drop fag ash on my instruments tray, DI Bradfield.<eos> From the hypostasis and rigor examined on the body at the scene, I'd estimate she was killed between 6PM and midnight on Sunday the 13th of May.<eos> Cause of death, strangulation?<eos> The knot on the bra was tied so tight, I had to cut it.

Even when you disappeared, we carried on because that's what you wanted.<eos> No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.<eos> Now, my patience is wearing thin.<eos> Where's the spear fragment?<eos> In the same place you left it.
Ugh, pity.<eos> Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor, I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?<eos> As long as I live, you will never have it.
Dude, I can't...<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> All right.<eos> If there's a flaw in your suit that means the suit is faulty.<eos> Which means I have to go fix it.
No.<eos> - No?<eos> Why no?<eos> The White Martians infiltrated the reactor in the basement.<eos> And I need you to shut it down before the whole thing overloads.
They saved me, so I could save Henshaw.<eos> They forced me to keep him alive, to enhance him.<eos> Physically turn him into the monster he was beneath.<eos> It is strange seeing you in Henshaw's skin.<eos> I hope I've put it to good use.
Uh, okay, try toggling the switch next to the control yoke and that should put you back in manual control and then I can take it from there.<eos> - Two minutes.<eos> - Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down.
- Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I can slow it down.
- She's his insurance.<eos> - All right, people, let's get to work!<eos> Winn, any luck with Alex's subdermal tracker?<eos> No, it's been offline since 10:00 last night.<eos> Whoever took her must have found some way to power it down.
If my mother had given me pep talks like you, imagine the things I could've done.<eos> I'm happy to have mused you.<eos> But trust me, it isn't always easy being the parent we aspire to be.<eos> Shall we test it again?<eos> Let me just plug in the algorithm and fire it up.
What are you...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Thousands of Daxamites survived the destruction of our planet.<eos> They just needed a way to get here.<eos> Turn it off!
We both know that Winslow is not capable of keeping his mouth shut.<eos> It's my boyfriend and my best friend.<eos> Maybe the President and Alex are right.<eos> Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone.<eos> But all I think about is the fact that two people I love are trapped on that ship and if we destroy it...
- Time is wasting.<eos> - You said you have a plan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When Henshaw was at the Fortress of Solitude...<eos> Breaking in, stealing a deadly virus, and using it to kill aliens in this very bar.
It was easy.<eos> Do you know anything about audiovisual equipment?<eos> I can't get it to play.<eos> I know it works.<eos> I've played it before.
- I'm not going anywhere.<eos> - You'll do as I say.<eos> Temporal signature.<eos> Titan?<eos> We found it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please.<eos> Governors, we are running out of time.<eos> The fact that you are here at this emergency meeting on such short notice tells the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am.<eos> Terror is unacceptable.<eos> I do not accept it.
The greasy pole?<eos> Throwing things into little hoops?<eos> The hammer?<eos> I'm not entirely sure what that is -- but presumably you just need a hammer.<eos> And then you throw it.
I am more concerned about the style of the day than the actual events.<eos> For instance, I wish we had a starting pistol.<eos> The very thing!<eos> Why have you got that?<eos> Oh, I carry it all the time.
The very thing!<eos> Why have you got that?<eos> Oh, I carry it all the time.<eos> Careful with it, though, sir.<eos> Point it towards the ground when you're firing it.
Initially, I was very excited by him, but I'm getting rather bored of him now.<eos> His endless jazz and earnestness.<eos> Yes, jazz can be rather testing, can't it?<eos> Oh, I love jazz.<eos> Testing in a good way. I love it, too.
Maybe we should change them after we dump him?<eos> Yeah! Let's wear bedsheet togas and trip again.<eos> Mmm, yeah!<eos> Oh, yeah. And maybe we'll find the gun that way.<eos> 'Cause we'll go, like, full circle and remember where we put it.
But you ain't gotta worry about him.<eos> Kanan dead.<eos> I wouldn't have left a fucking gun at Truth... You know that!<eos> I told you, Angie's framing me!<eos> It doesn't matter who put it there.
Kanan dead.<eos> I wouldn't have left a fucking gun at Truth... You know that!<eos> I told you, Angie's framing me!<eos> It doesn't matter who put it there.<eos> What matters is that they found it.
The young star is best known for her work in the Waterfall series, and her Golden Globenominated portrayal of a teen prostitute in Wendy Sanborn's Bridgeland.<eos> The images come as a surprise to fans who see James as an American sweetheart.<eos> The actress could not be reached for comment.<eos> Back to you, Karen.<eos> Daryll got a guy, big shot at ACA, to read my script, but they said to send it over as a PDF, so what is it?
My golden Lab sits there all day, barking at clouds.<eos> He eats cat shit like it's tapas.<eos> Look, Paul, they have DNA, they have witnesses.<eos> It doesn't feel right, though.<eos> SOCO said the body was barely in the ground, not very deep, and yet no-one found it that whole time?
- Julius, don't be rude.<eos> - There are no more potatoes.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Newton's second law of motion.<eos> You all know it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics, I need you to more than "know" it.
- There are no more potatoes.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Newton's second law of motion.<eos> You all know it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics, I need you to more than "know" it.<eos> I need you to be able to see it.
To me for favours.<eos> It's not like that at all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> So the paris receiver picks up the berlin signal. And transmits it to everybody within range.
Your father-in-law is working on a top secret project.<eos> Called operation marigold. How do you know this?<eos> We broke into his briefcase at your party.<eos> We think that operation marigold is a new, bigger oil refinery. In poland capable of pushing oil production. Through the roof and guaranteeing a nazi victory.<eos> Franz, I need you to help me find it.
Thank you, Papa, she's so beautiful.<eos> She makes such lovely colors.<eos> It's called refraction.<eos> All the colors are there, inside the light.<eos> The glass just pulls it apart so we can see.
Don't look.<eos> You believed it would be 1,000 times stronger than uranium.<eos> This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even pure.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> What shall we call it, my love?
Yeah, I drove.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I need your keys.<eos> Where's your motorcycle?<eos> I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm pregnant, so I sold it.
Right.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> It's got an auto-defrost, ice-maker right here.<eos> Each one of these shelves can hold a gallon of liquid.<eos> Can I get it today?
I'm sorry.<eos> Hamid.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> Have you got your phone?<eos> No, I left it in my car.
Thanks for meeting me.<eos> Have you got your phone?<eos> No, I left it in my car.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't want the spooks using it as a microphone.
'How did you get into the school? '<eos> 'The caretaker gave me the key.'<eos> 'The caretaker? '<eos> 'Yeah, Kevin Russell.'<eos> 'He just gave it to you? '
Did "home" have to include throwing yourself in front of Matthew Wild?<eos> I fell in love.<eos> Love?<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> You saw your meal ticket and you grabbed it.
But what about the boys?<eos> You can't have everything, Albert.<eos> You have your kite with you?<eos> Yes, papa.<eos> Good, I'll come and fly it with you very soon.
You asked him how it went with MJ?<eos> How does this prove you're being framed?<eos> Angela, when I looked in the drawer, that phone wasn't there.<eos> The mole planted the phone, and I think the mole killed Greg.<eos> Or Greg could have brought the phone home with him and put it in the drawer before he died.
Is there any chance you could come?<eos> I wouldn't wanna get taken advantage of, you know, especially with the fuzziness.<eos> I'll say to you what I say to all of my clients.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> When you hear a noise, just accept it, and then let it drift away.
St. Patrick gave me this phone.<eos> It came from a Lobos contact,<eos> Hugo Sanchez.<eos> What?<eos> How the fuck did he get it, Angela?
It was Mike.<eos> He was working with Hugo Sanchez for Lobos.<eos> He's the mole, he killed Greg, and planted the phone to cover his tracks.<eos> You can't prove that.<eos> Maybe Greg hid it in his own apartment because he was the mole. Yeah, right.
He hid it after he wiped off his own prints.<eos> And then he shot himself to cover it up.<eos> And then his motherfucking ghost hid the murder weapon at Truth.<eos> We can't introduce the phone anyway.<eos> Where'd St. Patrick get it, Angela?
Piper, honey, is that you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> My child is trapped in a prison riot.<eos> One shows up for those sorts of things.<eos> Please tell me you're not leading it.
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be like this.<eos> There is a way out of the darkness.<eos> I can show it to you.
Perhaps he has an opinion on the matter.<eos> Ha, ha, ha, very amusing.<eos> Albert, the uncertainty principle works, it functions.<eos> And it allows us to make use of the quantum world.<eos> The goal of scientific pursuit should not be merely to make use of the world around us, it should be to understand it, fundamentally.
Albert, Albert, watch out!<eos> Just watch where you're going, please.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Why should either of us?<eos> According to you, if that automobile was a particle, but we didn't see it, it wouldn't have been there at all.
Just do the move.<eos> We are. We are.<eos> We're just motivating it with backstory.<eos> There is a law...<eos> There is a law, and you broke it.
Took you long enough.<eos> So show us the goods.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, that's bad.<eos> How'd you get it in your mouth?
♪ Beat, bam ratatata tatatatata ♪<eos> Whipped that up trying to get anybody to dance at our cottage soirees, but it came on a bit strong.<eos> Shit.<eos> There's no way we can pick this lock.<eos> Maybe we can brute-force it.
Look deep into nature.<eos> Then you will understand everything better.<eos> Helen.<eos> You are a blessing.<eos> His brain... you want to, what, slice it up and gaze at it under a microscope?
Helen.<eos> You are a blessing.<eos> His brain... you want to, what, slice it up and gaze at it under a microscope?<eos> What's the alternative?<eos> Cast it into a furnace?
You don't show up for your assignments, you can't be in the lottery, and when the time comes, we'll collect the names, and we draw.<eos> Good?<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> Now, that radiation shield is ready.<eos> Who's gonna help me put it in place?
We will get through this.<eos> On your feet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're bringing you home.<eos> Your ship is shelter from Praimfaya, so I intend to take it.
Can't see anything.<eos> I tried warning them there was something out there.<eos> They wouldn't listen.<eos> What was it?<eos> My dog ran to the mist, and, something killed it.
Looks empty.<eos> Someone want to make a run for it?<eos> Whatever killed him could still be in there?<eos> The electronics store has a drone with a camera.<eos> Dad and I looked at it last time we were there.
Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> Skaikru made me murder my entire family.<eos> We're bringing you home.<eos> Your ship is shelter from praimfaya, so I intend to take it.
To pass messages.<eos> And you didn't tell us?<eos> I had no idea what they were planning.<eos> Because of a code?<eos> You couldn't use your giant brain to crack it?
Oh. Sorry.<eos> I'm not familiar with it.<eos> Thanks for coming at such short notice.<eos> There's this, um, film clip.<eos> I've seen it.
Hello, Tara.<eos> It's Fran Coughlan.<eos> He's gone.<eos> And there's a new film.<eos> Somebody e-mailed it to Connor.
Guff is your thing.<eos> Fine.<eos> Guff.<eos> You see, there's the law, Ray.<eos> And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
We'd better get going.<eos> Lovely place.<eos> I have a gift.<eos> It's like a needle in a haystack.<eos> When did you last see it?
Your father's driver dropped this off for you.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - For you, Bryan, anything.<eos> That coffee is terrible.<eos> How do you drink it?
Honda took ten years to develop that car.<eos> And?<eos> Ten years is an enormous amount of time to do a car.<eos> You can't criticise something because people spent too long on it.<eos> People aren't gonna say "I'm not gonna look round Cologne cathedral." They took 600 years to build it!"
Or can it?<eos> First of all, we have to remove this rather ungainly body.<eos> You can't do that with a modern car because the body is the chassis.<eos> It's the skeleton.<eos> If you take it away, you're left with nothing more than a collection of unjoined-up parts.
And now we must move on, because it is time to set the satnav for destination chat, as we head down Conversation Street.<eos> - That hurt?<eos> - It hurt.<eos> - It did? But not as much as the wine bottle last week.<eos> Now, Mercedes, they've come up with this plan, or this idea, where you can rent your car out when you're not using it.
Coconut-milk latte with a caramel shot, please.<eos> - OK, a coconut-milk latte with a caramel...<eos> - What is it for?<eos> - Pointless.<eos> The thing is, you can't... you can't even use launch control on a race track, because you can only engage it for three or four seconds before it cuts out. And because you don't know when the lights are gonna go green, you don't know when your three seconds start, do you?
And I saved your life back in that station.<eos> We're even.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Man...<eos> I give you the gun, I have your word you'll give it back to me the second this is over.
Patch it through to the mess.<eos> Yes, Two.<eos> Raza, this is Lieutenant John Anders of the Galactic Authority.<eos> How did you acquire our comm signature?<eos> I got it from a friend of yours.
Time.<eos> That's very funny.<eos> That wasn't a joke.<eos> [THE ANDROID] I've spent the last 48 hours analyzing the Blink Drive and am still no closer to a solution.<eos> I don't know why it self-initiated or how to repair it.
Hey.<eos> Hope you don't mind. I kind of helped myself.<eos> Party's pretty boring.<eos> That controller's broken.<eos> Yeah, I fixed it.
Good.<eos> Now let's disconnect it.<eos> --After all that?<eos> [TWO] We can't trust Brophey to not try the recall again.<eos> From now on, we only use it as last resort.
She's not lying.<eos> The Android and Five have been trying to fix it ever since we took it back.<eos> Your scientists are to blame for this.<eos> Drive's useless now.<eos> So then give it to me.
The Android and Five have been trying to fix it ever since we took it back.<eos> Your scientists are to blame for this.<eos> Drive's useless now.<eos> So then give it to me.<eos> Maybe we should just destroy it.
Wait.<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> Hey!<eos> That's far enough!<eos> Come any closer, and I'll throw it in!
What the hell's that?<eos> Hey!<eos> That's far enough!<eos> Come any closer, and I'll throw it in!<eos> You don't want to destroy it any more than we do.
- We?<eos> - Me and my ship.<eos> You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.<eos> Well, what about that explosion?<eos> If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
Negative.<eos> We're cut off from the shuttle.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> We need to get to the station's reactor. It's supplying power to the anomaly...<eos> We need to shut it down.
- and the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> What are you reading, Mrs. Raven?<eos> The journal of one of the first priests here.<eos> I found it in your office.
- Bellamy.<eos> - What? Truck's not here.<eos> How the hell do you know?<eos> Because everyone does what's best for their own people.<eos> It was my men who took it.
I can die a forgotten coward, or I can live to be celebrated and remembered.<eos> Before that regent even touched his sword, I slit his throat.<eos> Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.

- Uh, for a moment, but, you know, once he wrote the first check, he got that high that you can only get from truly serving.<eos> The joy in exercising what you have to give.<eos> - Where's Jeremiah now?<eos> - That's another story for another time.<eos> Here, now, I want you to keep an eye on your peers, identify their individual potential, and... and, uh, you know, help them see it.

We're talking millions of dollars.<eos>  Fear.<eos> That's what I'm hearing.<eos> The key is not to, you know, excise the fear, but you channel it.<eos> Use it.
- You hungry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I actually kind of like this show.<eos> I hope there's another one.<eos> My dad used to make me watch it and I hated it then, but now I kind of think it's funny.
Honestly, it's a miracle we're alive.<eos> So... no gifts?<eos> Let's get to the dessert bar so we can see the work they did.<eos> Also so people don't think we're customers here.<eos> I'm excited to see it too, and now that Randy and I are really over, I promise to give the dessert bar my full 5%.
There isn't.<eos> Aluminum.<eos> That's what it tastes like, anyway.<eos> Fear in the back of my throat.<eos> You know, most people, they try to move away from fear, try to organize it out of their lives as soon as they're able. Me? I cultivate it.

I'm trying to give you comfort.<eos> Maybe I could've done it different.<eos> I don't know, but you could've done this a different way, too.<eos> So, Ms. Minchak, how should we proceed?<eos> My goal is to do oppo before they do oppo, so if there is a potential October surprise, we drop it in February during the fucking Super Bowl.
Richard is thinking.<eos> He understands.<eos> We need a female hero that we can wash away this warlord crap with.<eos> And why don't you have your phone right now?<eos> I... didn't bring it.
- It needs to be watered twice daily.<eos> - We have no water here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh. Oh, well, that's fine.<eos> - We can just put it with the recycling.
The deal's off.<eos> But my speech!<eos> I...<eos> Colonel Al-Saleh felt that you could've been a bit more enthusiastic.<eos> What do I have to do, pull out my clit and cut it off in front of everyone to get anything done in this world?
- Shit.<eos> Mike, that diary is all you're good for.<eos> The diary should've lost you.<eos> Every detail of every day in the White House was in that diary.<eos> Where do you think you might've left it?
- I think it's a little elitist.<eos> - I know!<eos> - But not in a good way. - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, let's get rid of it. - Oh.<eos> But make a mental note of exactly what this pattern is 'cause maybe we'll rent it for my birthday.
God, Jesus!<eos> I can tell you that the diary is not in your ass crack because I have had a very good view of the strawberry fields for the last hour.<eos> Look, I lost my belt, okay?<eos> When I went through security at Dulles, I...<eos> I left it at security.
Of course, Gary.<eos> Hey, everybody eat!<eos> Danny, where the fuck were you?<eos> I've been trying to call you all night.<eos> A... it's Dan, and B... I don't have my phone because this morning's guest dropped it over the side of the Staten Island Ferry while pretending to be Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl."
- Amy, you promised!<eos> What? What, Mike?<eos> What have you and your 47 tangled chromosomes done?<eos> ! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I should've gotten a diary with a little lock on it, but I didn't wanna lock myself out.
June 20.<eos> After several days of Olga has not returned.<eos> His new body feels weird for me.<eos> If photogravure body was stored, his soul will be safe ..<eos> I hid it in an old attic where no one can find.
Where all the strigoi live?<eos> What about it?<eos> I saw a tanker truck parked out back today under heavy strigoi guard.<eos> They hooked up to the building's plumbing,<eos> - they filled it full of blood.
It's the doctor.<eos> Neil sent me.<eos> Put the gun away or I'm leaving right now.<eos> What about you?<eos> I keep it 'til I know this place is safe.
I'm about to go viral.<eos> The ball!<eos> Did you get the footy?<eos> No, I don't have my phone!<eos> I left it in the car!
Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Whoa. Dude.<eos> Oh, that's not my phone.<eos> I found it in these pants, so.
I'm assisting detective Babineaux with a murder investigation.<eos> An anonymous witness sent me snapchats with photos they took of possible suspects.<eos> As soon as I open the images, they disappear.<eos> You could've saved us both a lot of time if you'd just screen-grabbed the images.<eos> When I want your advice, I'll beat it out of you.
- Yeah, go on.<eos> - What colour was the festival wristband?<eos> - Blue, wasn't it?<eos> - Aye, blue.<eos> That means she got it in advance.
- Aye, blue.<eos> That means she got it in advance.<eos> It's the VIP one.<eos> So we can't assume she went to that festival at all.<eos> It just means that she was given it by someone in with the band.
Let's go.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> First, we gotta take out that sentinel.<eos> I'll take care of it.
From Sandstorm?<eos> I thought you said they went dark before Jane showed up.<eos> They did.<eos> But before that, they sent me coded messages through this marquee.<eos> I still check it every morning.
Made Icarus's wings, right?<eos> Stop looking at me like that when I know things.<eos> Pretentious college kids and lithium.<eos> That does not add up.<eos> Maybe they're mixing it with Jaeger and doing shots?
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air as a beloved visionary instead of... lurking, nameless and thankless in the shadows, like some digital thug!<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> Gord... I'm so sorry... that you feel that way.<eos> But I didn't steal anything from you.<eos> Yeah, we developed some of that code together, but then I begged you to move to Silicon Valley with me to finish it.
Are you happy now, Mom and Dad, huh?<eos> - Why don't you take that piece of paper...<eos> - Rich!<eos> Rich!<eos> ...and roll it up real tight and shove it up your...
Hey, Cap, what happened to that diesel fuel you promised?<eos> Fuel's right there.<eos> Much as you want.<eos> The silo, right?<eos> Could munchers have opened it?
Oh.<eos> Um, did you, um, did you check the coffee table?<eos> Yeah, it was... it was on the dresser.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, I'm glad you found it.
Sam...<eos> I'm sorry, but, God... come on, Joe.<eos> A baby is not just gonna fix us.<eos> That is a newborn baby.<eos> You need to get it to a hospital.
We do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I like to think that maybe one day, you'll be an old man like me, talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him how you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer...<eos> - Which one's yours?<eos> - Um and turned it into something resembling lemonade.
Thank you.<eos> - No?<eos> No.<eos> Let's watch it, okay?<eos> I like to think that maybe one day, you'll be an old man like me, talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him how you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer and turned it into something resembling lemonade.
- Princess Bride?<eos> - You want what?<eos> Kevin, seriously, you were terrified by that movie.<eos> That's when I was nine.<eos> Now that I'm gonna be ten, I love it.
Just grabbing a quick bite.<eos> Up ahead is the annex. That's where we have yoga, drumming classes, cooking classes, mindful eating workshops.<eos> And over here, is the horse's stable.<eos> So, where's the gym?<eos> Did, like, did I miss it or...?
So... thanks.<eos> For being a dick.<eos> I needed it.<eos> Like I said, your voice was annoying my horses.<eos> That's why I grabbed it.
- It's your moment.<eos> - You did it.<eos> You got your dream job.<eos> Lauren wants coffee before the board presentation.<eos> Oh, it's in the kitchen, where she can make it herself.
It just clicked for me what is going wrong with your ideas.<eos> You're pitching what you think I want to hear.<eos> - W-well...<eos> - You're a new voice.<eos> I want to hear it.
Ma'am, if we may, we're taking your mobile phone in evidence.<eos> - You can't do that without an authority...<eos> - Jodie.<eos> It's a police-issue device, not my own personal property.<eos> They're at liberty to examine it without authority.
DS Arnott.<eos> Where was your wife on the night of the 17th through to the morning of the 18th of March?<eos> - HE CLEARS THROAT Right.<eos> Presumably you are aware of the law regarding the compellability of a spouse?<eos> Normally the spouse is the one corroborating the alibi, - not undermining it.
The map also shows the location of Hana Reznikova's abduction.<eos> Seems like your man wasn't in the right place at the right time.<eos> Just because the phone was there doesn't mean Farmer was.<eos> And there are no witnesses to Farmer loitering near his grandmother's nursing home for an hour and 45 minutes.<eos> He left it there the whole time?
Those items were trophies.<eos> I took the view that Michael Farmer took special care of them, keeping them in a safe place, keeping them clean, and for that reason I discounted the carpet fibre profile.<eos> There was also a boot print relating to a person unknown.<eos> There was nothing that connected the boot print to the personal items.<eos> Like the carpet fibres, on the balance of evidence I discounted it, in favour of the compelling evidence against Michael Farmer.
OK.<eos> A thorough search of the flat failed to recover Tim Ifield's mobile phone and laptop computer.<eos> So we can assume that the killer stole the phone and the laptop.<eos> Is there a track on the phone?<eos> The last recorded position was Tim's flat, so whoever took it was smart enough to switch it off.
I knew that you had to be with someone.<eos> You followed me?<eos> I didn't intend to.<eos> But you left your phone at home when you said that you were going to work.<eos> So I picked it up and I tried to catch you.
Hey!<eos> What?<eos> No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.
The one from this morning?<eos> No.<eos> No, another one.<eos> I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.
No.<eos> No, another one.<eos> I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.<eos> I don't need to read it.
No, another one.<eos> I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.<eos> I don't need to read it.<eos> I'll make it.

That... I actually like wrestling.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know, it's like I'm back in my body... and it doesn't belong to Randy... or Mark.<eos> And, I don't know, I'm, like, using it for me and... I feel like a goddamn superhero.
Yeah, um...<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> I wanna know your secret.<eos> - What do you...<eos> - I can smell it.
David.<eos> Wake up.<eos> He's not inside his memories, his subconscious.<eos> I looked.<eos> Wherever his mind is, I can't find it.
It's your fault.<eos> I told you the Witness has been hunting us.<eos> Do not shoot!<eos> Stand down!<eos> This anger... use it.
Turns out, I was writing about the future in the past tense...<eos> #PrimaryProblems.<eos> What's your point, Ms. Goines?<eos> The Witness also kept a diary.<eos> Seen it with my own eyes in Monkey Mansion.
Way ahead of you, Jonesy.<eos> Sit back and enjoy the tale of... the Word of the Witness...<eos> A combo platter of history and prophecy, a fruit smoothie of will, was, and woulda-coulda-shoulda.<eos> Everything you always wanted to know about the Witness, but didn't know how to ask.<eos> When the Army of the 12 Monkeys fled Germany, they couldn't leave their manifesto behind, but were afraid to move it through official channels.
Lights would flicker... we'd get that not-so-fresh feeling.<eos> - Ooh! - Ms. Markridge?<eos> I'm sorry, but you've purchased a great deal more than we anticipated.<eos> You've exceeded your credit limit.<eos> Okay, then raise it.
What you said back there.<eos> - At the cemetery.<eos> - I said what he needed to hear.<eos> The happiest moment of my life... is the day I found out I was gonna be a father... being with you there, in that house.<eos> I still see it. The house.
You are a man of great honor.<eos> The thing is, I am a woman of great curiosity.<eos> So I just have to know what you got in there.<eos> He'll never get that open.<eos> I ordered it special from OfficeMax, and it's got a state-of-the-art locking system. Well, well, well.
Suicide?<eos> Nope.<eos> There's a piece broken off the dryer, and there's a chipped tile, here.<eos> Small piece of the hair dryer, breaks off the tile, landed here.<eos> Someone threw it in.
There's a piece broken off the dryer, and there's a chipped tile, here.<eos> Small piece of the hair dryer, breaks off the tile, landed here.<eos> Someone threw it in.<eos> Probably from around here.<eos> I saw it...
I saw it...<eos> And I got it, what's your point?<eos> - The point is it's garbage!<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> We found it in the trash.
Well, when I left Tim's house...<eos> But that's not what we need to talk about.<eos> What we need to talk about this.<eos> This baseball.<eos> We found it in the trash.
Not even a good counterfeit of the signature.<eos> But you know that, don't you?<eos> That's why you killed Yvonne.<eos> Yvonne owes you back rent to the tune of $1,000, so she pawns your baseball.<eos> She replaces it with this one, hoping you wouldn't notice.
There's still a dose left!<eos> Where?<eos> What are we waiting for?<eos> A few weeks ago, I gave a syringe to major, just in case.<eos> He never used it.
We are under attack, but our enemy didn't come from the skies.<eos> Our enemy was already here.<eos> The RAPs only needed one resource in order to maintain control, and we surrendered it to them, without a fight.
Someone's at the door.<eos> All right.<eos> I want you to load the shotgun.<eos> Take a shell.<eos> Holding the brass end, push it into the loading flap until you hear a click.
I told him to keep quiet, That it's important morale is maintained on a day like this.<eos> I'll need your gun.<eos> What? !<eos> Keep your holster closed.<eos> And no one will know it's missing. Just give it to me.
You don't have to kill all 12 warriors.<eos> I just have to kill the last one.<eos> Octavia kom skaikru is victorious.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it.
one champion per clan, one death instead of thousands.<eos> Then whoever wins gets the bunker.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We'll share it.
- All right. Slow down.<eos> Breathing's important, too.<eos> What's the plan for oxygen?<eos> Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker, I'm guessing... make that praying... There's an oxygenator there.<eos> We take it with us. You hook it up.
It should be you or Clarke or...<eos> O., stop.<eos> Neither of us could've done what you did, and it wasn't just winning a fight.<eos> You gave people hope when there was none.<eos> You're... you're Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and giving it back to the human race.
I don't know, but he said it was urgent.<eos> Is this about the deposition?<eos> Uh, no, actually, this is about a different nightmare scenario.<eos> I've been running diagnostics on the timer chip you recovered from Arkani's factory, and it is far more impressive than anything we've seen from the NMB or any extremist group for that matter.<eos> In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because... we did make it.
Both true believers willing to die for what we love.<eos> Farook, we may have something.<eos> There's an entry for someone only under the letter "L."<eos> The number's on the list we have for possible Mossad operatives.<eos> - Call it.
I will put it somewhere safe.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One other thing...<eos> My spare key to the cottage.<eos> With all the press lurking around, I'd sooner not leave it under a flowerpot.
Me and my sister.<eos> Our mother used to draw them in every year, until... ..she didn't.<eos> Well, don't just stand there like lemmings.<eos> Look at the diorama.<eos> Study it.
Every time I look, the baby's eating sand.<eos> I turn around, sand.<eos> Where does this sand come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, I let them eat it.
Get on the table.<eos> Where are we on finding Roman?<eos> I'm using Patterson's system to autodial Roman's cell phone every 15 seconds.<eos> - But he hasn't picked up.<eos> - But we're tracking it?
He's been dark for a very long time.<eos> Nas doesn't even know his identity.<eos> - But he gave her his phone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Nas and the team at the NSA have been trying to unlock it, but nobody's been able to get past that home screen.
Actually, I don't want to get into it.<eos> We're in it.<eos> You're on Bailey's side on this.<eos> Richard, you're going to have a lovely dinner tonight.<eos> Don't ruin it.
I was right here, so...<eos> No, no, no. Nice work, Warren.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> Can you see the source of the bleeding?<eos> Uh, yes, yes, I see it.
No, what?<eos> When?<eos> I don't understand, I just...<eos> Many on Wall Street are asking, is Henry Rindell the new Madoff?<eos> Earlier today, the FBI shuttered the invitation-only investment fund, calling it a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme, whose collapse has decimated the accounts of many of the nation's liberal elites.
But doesn't your method result in false confessions?<eos> Very few.<eos> In fact, hasn't your method been banned by police in Canada and England?<eos> I wouldn't call it banned.<eos> They've chosen not to use it.
And it says, "Cam and get it!"<eos> Oh, so that's not a mistake?<eos> We spent extra cash to get that custom made.<eos> Came to me in a dream.<eos> Put it on, buddy.
Okay, this is bad.<eos> My dad does not like to be pork teased.<eos> Well, maybe we can get a replacement pig.<eos> Do you think your concierge thing could help out?<eos> But I just got it today, and... and the card says, "For Mitch stuff."
Three centimeters by one.<eos> You're doing fine, Yusuf.<eos> Can you move the camera closer?<eos> Roger.<eos> Can you ask the dentist to suture it up and close the hole?
You should know, you're handling our contracts.<eos> We were handling them.<eos> There seems to be a holdup this year.<eos> Try this bread.<eos> They bake it every morning.
That's why the interest in canning fruit?<eos> It's programed to take on characteristics of hobbyists sites.<eos> - Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.
It's programed to take on characteristics of hobbyists sites.<eos> - Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.
- Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.<eos> - It's pretending to be me.<eos> - So just ignore it.
So you just fucked us over.<eos> Under British law, the sale of these eggs is invalid.<eos> What difference does that make, Your Honor?<eos> You've already ruled on the ownership of the embryo.<eos> For the express purpose of taking it to England for this procedure, which they have now been forbidden from doing.
I like mysteries.<eos> Could you find out how this list might come back to hurt this firm?<eos> - Are we sure it will?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Kresteva worked too hard to get it.
I wasn't.<eos> He asked me to step out of the car so he could search it.<eos> Then he handcuffs me and says I'm under arrest for possession of heroin.<eos> Were you in possession of heroin?<eos> No, he planted it.
You don't look fine.<eos> It's time for you to tag out.<eos> Wake up Snow and get some bloody sleep.<eos> I said I'm fine!<eos> And If I wanted advice, I doubt I'd take it from a pirate.
Because I was young, woefully foolish and...<eos> Unarmed?<eos> You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...
So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...<eos> I just wanted you to tell him what you told me, before I make a mess.<eos> What mess are you going to...<eos> That's where it's been this whole time?<eos> Put it somewhere I could keep an eye on it.
I mean, Dad set a trap for me, but Mum was the one who made sure that I fell into it.<eos> She was the one that made sure that I felt... that I... that I felt things that I don't want to feel anymore.<eos> That, right there, that what you stopped yourself from feeling, that's exactly what you need to feel.<eos> What, the anger?<eos> I feel it.
Mom!<eos> That's enough!<eos> I'm not broken. The sword must be.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, then we'll fix it.
A clue to what?<eos> Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?<eos> And you really think that this is the Flaming Sword?<eos> It's so not flaming.<eos> That's because only you, my Lightbringer, can ignite it.
Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete.<eos> Dad supposedly destroyed the Flaming Sword after the rebellion.<eos> So, are you saying he just broke it into two pieces?
I know.<eos> I've been looking forward to a formal "heyya."<eos> - No, I see you're still working on the phone.<eos> I knew Chet well.<eos> Perhaps I could borrow it, maybe try some combinations?
And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.
- Brother...<eos> - That Father's favorite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.<eos> Look down.<eos> Is that the key around your neck or are you just happy to see me?<eos> He entrusted it... to you, brother.
- I know.<eos> And she doesn't care who she hurts anymore.<eos> I'll go check on Linda.<eos> You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.<eos> But, Luci, don't you dare promise her that piece, because I won't give it to her.
No lie.<eos> Detectives S and P didn't lie.<eos> Detectives S and P no lie.<eos> - Sergeant, please tell me this malfunctioning copier isn't gonna sink our precinct.<eos> - I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen just shows a cartoon turtle sobbing.
- I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen just shows a cartoon turtle sobbing.<eos> - Perhaps it's a paper jam.<eos> - And what about when the little sushi roll comes out and cuts the turtle's head off?<eos> - Toner issue.<eos> - Why? Anyway, I started taking it apart, but it's been a slow process for some reason.
We have a Charles situation.<eos> - Well, how stuck are you, Boyle?<eos> - Completely.<eos> My tail seems to have gotten knotted around a sprinkler.<eos> I think I can pull it.
Here we go.<eos> Hey, everything okay here?<eos> Deep forehead lac.<eos> It's bleeding pretty bad.<eos> We should try and close it if we can.
That could have been you in that seat with no seat belt.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> Okay? I'm just fine.<eos> And so are you.<eos> So, if you have the choice to avoid the plane crash, do you take it?
You're a surgeon.<eos> You're needed in the operating room.<eos> What, you think Wilson and... and Edwards stood back and waited for a chance to shine?<eos> No.<eos> - They took it.
You have. You... You taught me how...<eos> You taught me how to take my past and find my path.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think I found it.
- All over.<eos> - Did you prep the lidocaine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Inject it around the wound.
That's the liver.<eos> - Get the retractors.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, I got the retractors.<eos> Get ready to pull it out of the liver.
The sword Emma shattered when he last faced her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why does he think that... that killing Emma with this blade will make him the Savior?<eos> He's not the first one to think wielding that sword would make him a hero.<eos> We have to find him before he gets his hands on it, before he goes after Emma again.
The water's not deep.<eos> We can wade through it.<eos> What is it?<eos> You brought the dagger?<eos> I couldn't leave it behind.
Why?<eos> There is something happening to magic.<eos> The wellspring in Fillory.<eos> - The current is sputtering.<eos> - And they're trying to fix it.
- Is that rip?<eos> Get him out of there!<eos> - As soon as one of you explains what in tarnation is going on.<eos> - We're here for your fragment of the spear of destiny.<eos> See, there's a legion of villains who are hunting anyone who is trying to protect it.
- 17 minutes.<eos> - All right, we got 17 minutes to figure out what's going on before the whole world is watching.<eos> - Yeah, you're not wrong there.<eos> Gideon, pull up "Apollo 13's" original flight pattern.<eos> We need to find it first.
Please don't tell me you used the Spear of Destiny as a back scratcher.<eos> Who said anything about my back?<eos> Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated, in the wrong hands, this divine artifact can be<eos> - put to truly horrific use.<eos> - Yeah. Which is why I called this meeting, to figure out how to keep it out the Legion's hands.
The status of the machine, Doctor?<eos> Please tell Mr. Thawne I'm working as fast as I can.<eos> I've powered up the reactor.<eos> I just need to make a few adjustments to the core.<eos> Did you already turn it on?
I am not the only one who did not see it.<eos> I know.<eos> Think about your family.<eos> You will move forward.<eos> You have not seen it for a long time.
Because I begin to understand how they work.<eos> We use what works.<eos> Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, did not he?<eos> The exact same.<eos> Do not ever put it on, it's a pity.
Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, did not he?<eos> The exact same.<eos> Do not ever put it on, it's a pity.<eos> It comes from looting, like the rest.<eos> Put it on when you work for it.
Yes?<eos> I am Guillaume.<eos> This phone was used last night to call Nadia El Mansour.<eos> Triangulation has allowed us to find it.
Yes.<eos> And those instructions were not Debailly who gave them.<eos> No, it only lasted a few seconds.<eos> Time to say, I imagine:<eos> "Guillaume Debailly asks you to buy a card phone... and turn it on just in a precise moment. "
It could run, jump, and update his Facebook.<eos> Death, where is thy sting?<eos> So...<eos> Back to the TARDIS?<eos> Yeah, can you turn it off?
Can you fry those ones, too?<eos> Possibly, but we have another problem.<eos> Opening the airlock was only the station's plan A.<eos> Plan B: filtering out all the oxygen.<eos> So, they can sell it back to us?
You don't know anything, do you?<eos> You just stand around making speeches and waving a TV aerial about.<eos> Shall I tell you what's in there?<eos> No.<eos> It's called the Eater Of Light, and we held it back.
It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here,<eos> Drive it back through the gate.
So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here,<eos> Drive it back through the gate.<eos> But how do we keep it there?
Here we go.<eos> It's starting.<eos> Tell Reddington.<eos> See if he can find who did it.<eos> That person has the list-- or knows where to find it.
Margot and Sasha are leaving the country under aliases--<eos> Eva Taylor and Lily Hum. Aram, can you--<eos> - Tracking them as we speak.<eos> - Look, what about the list?<eos> Emma took it.
I-It seems to me that Carol Anne tears apart everyone who gets on the stand.<eos> - Now, there's a cool lawyer. - Mm.<eos> People's feelings are starting to get hurt, so let's stop with the "cool" talk.<eos> Carol Anne has spent 28 days tearing apart your character.<eos> Summer's the only person who can build it back up.
Last month, we found out Margaret has a missing cellphone that someone's been trying to access.<eos> I know what you're thinking... ghost phone.<eos> However, Josh thinks the killer might have it.<eos> Dwayne, I need you to find this phone.<eos> So I've been calling it daily.
Go into the right-hand wardrobe.<eos> No, not the left one!<eos> Do NOT go in the left!<eos> Right, inside, you'll see a grey safe.<eos> I need you to open it.
I need you to help me bust this bastard.<eos> What'd you have in mind?<eos> He's got this cabin, right?<eos> He's got a shed in the back.<eos> Can you check it out for me?
Oh, and I found your diary.<eos> Very entertaining.<eos> Where did you find...?<eos> It were under your pillow.<eos> You really should keep it better hidden.
♪ Richie Queenan Show on the radio<eos> ♪ It's the talk of all the town!<eos> ♪<eos> 'His teddy bear.<eos> I grabbed hold of it, 'pressed it over his mouth.
Yes.<eos> I asked them to make your drink.<eos> Shall I bring it in?<eos> You don't need to apologise, Grace.<eos> But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it'll find a home.
I asked them to make your drink.<eos> Shall I bring it in?<eos> You don't need to apologise, Grace.<eos> But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it'll find a home.<eos> I've put it outside.
I am completely lost.<eos> The Droxidians are crossing the galaxy destroying everything in their path.<eos> In this story, the humans find the symbol and arm themselves, ready to defend Earth.<eos> We need to do the same!<eos> That's why I wanted everyone to see it.
Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> But first, I'd like to take confession, with your permission, of course.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> The medallion's in the wall.<eos> And I have five minutes to find it.
What was that noise?<eos> Noise?<eos> One minute.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> How are you going to get it out of here?
Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> 'If you want to ever see them alive again, ' I suggest you do as I say.<eos> Get me that medallion.<eos> I suggest stealing it from Flambeau's body once he's been hanged.
Geordie?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - You're needed.<eos> So why is our friend Lawrence so utterly obsessed with sex?<eos> Because he views it as a discovery, as an exploration of ourselves, of our inner darkest desires.
- Yeah. She still has a little scar.<eos> He said he didn't see me before he swung, but my brother always was a sore loser.<eos> - Renee played shortstop. - Thing is, I was really close to my brother and my dad.<eos> I always sort of had to be one of the guys.<eos> I tried playing softball but hated it.
We need to develop crops that can withstand almost anything.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> Well, we, uh... we take the strongest wheat plants from around the world, we cross-breed them, then we get the most destructive pests we can find, test the new plants, and breed again.<eos> And we're... we're making a lot of progress, and we're close to developing the strongest strain of wheat the world's ever known.<eos> And you... When you have it...

When you have it...<eos> Well, I mean, I-I work for a company, and they sell it.
Josh, what am I gonna do about this parking ticket?<eos> Did you know this was issued the day Margaret died?<eos> Yeah, she had the car that day.<eos> Whoa. Looks like we got a ghost ticket on our hands.<eos> Or she... got it before she died.
We had to.<eos> To protect you and our family.<eos> And when you were ready we told you.<eos> Can't you just see him there, writing in his diary every night, making his little observations about everyone, his parishioners, us...<eos> He should've kept it locked in a goddamn safe.
Sister... you ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> Flynn's the only thing standing in their way.<eos> But it's not enough.<eos> I can't risk them getting the Mothership.<eos> So I'm gonna destroy it.
Look... I chose to partner with you. That...<eos> That says something.<eos> You didn't want me.<eos> You wanted the patent.<eos> If I had just given it to you, you would've walked out that door and never looked back.
- So if we find the right fountain...?<eos> - We can walk right in.<eos> I heard a couple librarians whispering about it.<eos> The poison room fountain has a stack of books for a statue.<eos> If we split up, we could probably find it within a matter of weeks.
- Because as visitors to my previous work, you make for an excellent focus group for my new world.<eos> It's something I've been building.<eos> Testing a few things out.<eos> It's more of a pocket world, really.<eos> I call it Cuba.
So am I.<eos> It's my job to keep the premises secure.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I think I left the work order in my truck.<eos> Why don't you go get it then?
We got to get the lights back on.<eos> Come on, let's...<eos> Ryan, stop, stop.<eos> My gun.<eos> I think someone took it.
I got to go check on him.<eos> But I promise you guys it won't take long.<eos> Save me a piece.<eos> Hey, and, Raims, put back the spare key.<eos> I didn't take it!
He thinks you're keeping a woman captive.<eos> I feel like I'm in a bad dream.<eos> Nonsense, you've done an excellent job of keeping your wits about you.<eos> Ditching your phone, for instance.<eos> I told you, I lost it.

- Enger.<eos> - It's Rachel.<eos> Something's come up on my end.<eos> I need to know what you found, Detective.<eos> Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.
I write him letters in soft pencil on one side of cartridge paper, so he can draw on the other.<eos> Well, you should take this one.<eos> It's only a study.<eos> He must have sold the finished portrait.<eos> I call it Man In An Orange Shirt, but it's you, isn't it?
So, something important, you said.<eos> Um, from the letting agents.<eos> They're not going ahead with the cottage.<eos> Says it's too much work to be done to be lettable.<eos> So, I want to give you that cottage now, rather than you have it later.
Just in case this guy keeps causing trouble.<eos> You just spot something?<eos> It's a link to an online Photobucket.<eos> Schmitt's phone was never recovered.<eos> Presumably the killer took it along with his wallet.
It is a virus, but not one she's ever seen before.<eos> Well, now we've got its mug shot, someone's gonna know what it is.<eos> She thought it was very suspicious that it was both UV and chlorine-resistant.<eos> She cannot rule out that it was a natural mutation, but said that it was far more likely that our suspect was lab-engineered.<eos> So someone crafted it specifically to survive the city's gauntlet of water safeguards?
If someone had told me a year ago that I'd be venting to my wife, while preparing to do battle on behalf of my mythical kingdom... I'd have done a lot more drugs.<eos> I have something that might help.<eos> Great, depending on what your definition of help is.<eos> I know I haven't always given you reason to trust me.<eos> My grandpa forged this sword for a High King who vanished without ever claiming it.

The fairies can bring back the Wellspring?<eos> They can. And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> The fairies want a baby?<eos> They aren't gonna eat it, are they?
Terribly sorry.<eos> [sighs] Struck out looking for a god-murder spell.<eos> It can't be that no one in all of history ever--<eos> Well, apparently, no one ever wrote it down.<eos> Look, if a way exists, I'm finding it.
So, you're walking down the street when suddenly Jack-O-Lantern hits you with a flaming ball of fire...<eos> Citizens of Charm City!<eos> Who likes crime brulée?<eos> But thanks to our new indestructible cell phone case, your phone is perfectly fine.<eos> As long as you don't drop it directly on the screen.
Try and break it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> Okay, we still haven't figured out waterproofing.<eos> Can I see your phone?<eos> Are you gonna drop it in a beer?
The reason we were late was because of that damn<eos> Hands Across America that you made me do.<eos> Hands was '86, and you thanked me afterwards because you got to hold hands with someone that was holding hands with Willie Nelson.<eos> What the hell was that whole thing about, anyway?<eos> Hand somebody a sandwich in San Francisco and you pass it on down the line till some bum gets ahold of it in Boston? Hunger, yeah.
I fail to see how any marriage can be happy.<eos> If the terms are satisfactory, the union productive... For some, heaven.<eos> Others, a prison with no escape.<eos> There is always means of escape.<eos> It is merely a case of finding it.
Father gave me this knife.<eos> I want it.<eos> I will kill Lagertha with it.<eos> I will kill Lagertha with Father's knife!<eos> Well, you can't have it.
And I can give you that legal right.<eos> I will give you legal claim to the kingdom of East Anglia.<eos> It's a large kingdom.<eos> Because I am king, no one can question that claim.<eos> And it seems that... You have enough men to enforce it until it holds.
- No, but when I walked in...<eos> - Did you identify yourself as a police officer?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Did you show him your badge?<eos> I would have, but I couldn't find it at that particular time, but I did find it later, so we're good on it.
See how basic this knot is?<eos> I love these thermal goggles.<eos> Amy, listen to me very carefully.<eos> If you and Jake are thinking of trying, you are ovulating like crazy right now.<eos> You take that helmet off before I knock it off.
- Guys, we have a problem.<eos> - What is it?<eos> A truck just blew through three red lights heading west down 57th, headed straight for the federal building.<eos> On it.<eos> Got eyes on it.
I think he was.<eos> Because the day after Goldberg's murder, he came home in a taxi.<eos> Now, he's a salesman, he travels for a living.<eos> So why didn't he take his own car?<eos> Because he was driving Goldberg's car and he was going to sell it on.

I'm Tom Tucker with the latest on the hijacking crisis.<eos> As you can see, I've taken off my blazer to show the severity of the situation.<eos> We understand the plane has been found by satellite.<eos> It's apparently veered off its flight plan and is headed for Las Vegas.<eos> The government, fearing the worst, is considering shooting it down.
After his passing, the Jedi kept the saber in their temple. That was, until members of House Vizsla snuck in and liberated it.<eos> They used the saber to unify the people and strike down those who would oppose them.<eos> One time, they ruled all of Mandalore wielding this blade.<eos> This saber is an important symbol to that house and respected by the other clans.<eos> I imagine Sabine was excited to recover it.

Faster.<eos> You're making it easy on me.<eos> Ready position.<eos> The blade feels lighter.<eos> You're connecting with it.
I wanna pay for a sandwich with a $10 Ellen Degeneres.<eos> - Maybe you hurt Veronica's feelings without meaning to?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - I planned the perfect breakup. We got dinner at a mid-range restaurant... Nice enough to show I care, but not so nice she thought a proposal was coming.<eos> I even got her a classy breakup present, plus a gift receipt, in case she wanted to exchange it.
Lucy, will you please check my handcuffs and make sure they're tried securely behind my back?<eos> Yup, they're... they're locked.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, as this beautiful lady has just confirmed, my hands are tied securely behind my back.<eos> I will now step into this trunk.<eos> My brother Dash will then lock it shut.
- Are you scared?<eos> - Yeah. It's becoming a daily thing with me.<eos> My little boy... he's eight.<eos> He has this jack-in-the-box.<eos> And every time he cranks it, it pops out, and he laughs like it's the very first time.
They want our biologies.<eos> You think the baby healed in, like, hours?<eos> Yes.<eos> Like Sarah, I make miracle babies.<eos> The doctor wants to cut it from my belly.
The thing is, the Monks have got some kind of scrambler, so no-one can trace the broadcasts.<eos> Lucky, then, that I have got this!<eos> It traces the source of the signal and gives a map coordinate.<eos> Cool!<eos> Where'd you get it?
Well, gosh, one of your fancy friends upstairs should know.<eos> Come on, Sarge, you're my homegirl.<eos> You know that!<eos> Title III is for a wire tap.<eos> What you want is a search warrant, and since a judge needs to sign it, you better proof it first.
In fact, everything is going to go through the roof, because I'm going to blow up the lab.<eos> We just need some kind of a trigger, first.<eos> But what are you going to blow it up with?<eos> The bacteria is making ethanol!<eos> The greenhouse and the lab are full of it!
We are still up 40 bucks, and all from selling stuff that nobody is gonna miss.<eos> High five.<eos> Ugh! What happened to the flat iron?<eos> ! Who cares?<eos> Your mom doesn't use it.
The Snowflake Society.<eos> Because we're unique and we're so cool, we're cold.<eos> You know, Snowflake, every day after school, I go to my favorite spot and help myself to a salted caramel macchiato.<eos> Ooh. Do you know the grass patch behind the shop building?<eos> Yeah, I know it well.
Right?<eos> And?<eos> What did it say?<eos> No-one knows.<eos> Everyone who worked on the translation, and everyone who subsequently read it is now dead.
The European Organization For Nuclear Research.<eos> The largest particle physics laboratory on this planet.<eos> Why? Because four hours ago, someone, that priest presumably, e-mailed them a copy of the Veritas translation from this computer.<eos> Remember what he said.<eos> He said, "I sent it."
That's not true!<eos> What about this picture with chupacabra?<eos> - Photoshop.<eos> - This treasure chest?<eos> Probably bought it at an auction.
What the...<eos> Shit is radioactive.<eos> Your majesties, welcome to Loria.<eos> You kidnapped our castle?<eos> I'll put it back, as soon as you come around to my offer.
You comin'?<eos> So, how long have you been sick, Jack?<eos> The red lesion behind your right ear, it's a marker for basal cell carcinoma.<eos> Skin cancer.<eos> Doesn't look like you've been treating it, either.
I need to be able to reach you 24/7.<eos> Also, our new product is finally ready.<eos> This has been soaking for 20 days.<eos> That's twice as long as Ravi's recipe calls for.<eos> I need you to take it for a trial run.
Ladies' man.<eos> Right on.<eos> I need to know how long the visions last.<eos> And how soon they start, post-ingestion.<eos> That's, uh, after you eat it.
That's where we found this one.<eos> Alone, wandering around.<eos> Pretty out of it.<eos> Figured you'd have tranquilizers.<eos> We need something to mellow out this freak without killing it.
I'm thinking about getting one.<eos> I really have to get back to work.<eos> That wasn't a request.<eos> Sweet.<eos> I told my brother he could store it here while he's in Iraq.
Did you tell Jon about the rape before you were married?<eos> No, I was ashamed, but when I did tell him about what Stan Kendricks did to me, he changed.<eos> He put triple locks on all the doors.<eos> He insisted on driving me to work every day and picking me up.<eos> He bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my purse.
He put triple locks on all the doors.<eos> He insisted on driving me to work every day and picking me up.<eos> He bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my purse.<eos> - Did you? - No.<eos> I hid it in my closet.
- Morning, Sir.<eos> Sarge.<eos> So, in the novel, this is where Iris jumped from, right?<eos> It's become a bit of a tourist destination.<eos> You've all read it, I suppose?
It's become a bit of a tourist destination.<eos> You've all read it, I suppose?<eos> Of course, Sir.<eos> It's required reading at school.<eos> I can't imagine anyone growing up on this island having not read it.
I'd also like to pop into the library before it closes, get a copy of The Flame Tree to read, but if anyone fancies a beer after I've done that...<eos> Chief is buying.<eos> That's very good of you, Chief.<eos> Yes, well, I'd like to pick your brains about Sylvie's novel.<eos> As you've all read it.
What's going on?<eos> Didn't she go to see you on Thursday, to interview you?<eos> She did.<eos> She was working late every night on a new chapter of her thesis.<eos> If we read it together, in the place where you wrote it...
Hey, Mousy.<eos> Where you off to?<eos> - I'm busy, Daddy.<eos> - Hey, what about lunch?<eos> You can just wrap it up and put it in the fridge for now.
You're a smart guy.<eos> Okay?<eos> Why don't you be smart now.<eos> Put that thing down so nobody gets hurt.<eos> Drop it!
Not really.<eos> I mean, he had a share in it.<eos> But Charlie moved away about 20 years ago.<eos> Our parents owned the place originally.<eos> We took it over from them.
When we got on, I noticed the car behind us.<eos> Was being loaded with oil drums.<eos> Oil?<eos> If we could start a fire...<eos> They'd have to stop. And put it out or they'd risk blowing up the train.
No, there's still some places to go.<eos> Duke.<eos> How'd we do?<eos> I got most of what you wanted.<eos> Except for your wallet, I couldn't find it.
Valerie's adored by the residents.<eos> Me, not so much.<eos> Does she have an office or a desk or something we can look at?<eos> A locker.<eos> I'll open it for you.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Gently.<eos> That is DI Bacchus.<eos> DS Coles.<eos> What were the men doing when they found the body?<eos> We used to dump our waste down there, but a German company wants to buy us and they're very hot on health and safety, so we're cleaning it up.
She didn't have an alibi and we have a witness who heard them arguing.<eos> The knife was outside?<eos> Aye, over here.<eos> About here.<eos> So, either the killer threw it outside, thinking it wouldn't be found, or Alistair died here.
Now, after Jerome went to get some beers -- during the 15 minutes in which he was killed -- where were you all?<eos> In the bar.<eos> No-one left?<eos> It's not a big room, Inspector.<eos> We'd have noticed if someone left it.
Well, sir.<eos> He is 30 years old.<eos> Owns a garage down by the harbour.<eos> Family business.<eos> Took it over from his father.
But as we know all four suspects remained there in between Jerome being killed and us arriving -- so, where did the gun vanish?<eos> Where's the one place that never gets checked at a crime scene?<eos> A police car.<eos> Archer hid the gun in our engine?<eos> Exactly -- and then ripped his overalls - when he came to collect it later that day.
- No, we don't.<eos> That gun could be anywhere by now.<eos> Dwayne, JP, I want you to tail Archer Browne.<eos> - We're on it Chief.<eos> - He's hidden it somewhere.
You then seized your moment as we were out by Jerome's body to stash the gun in the police jeep, knowing it would be the last place where we would look for the gun.<eos> That's why we found you loitering by the clubhouse that morning.<eos> You later planned your moment to retrieve the gun, and as you did you planted some material from Archer's overalls, leaving the bonnet ajar to make sure we'd find it.<eos> And having done all that, the final nail in Archer's coffin -- you planted the gun in Archer's flat<eos> I mean, as it was, Archer came across it first and panicked, tried to get rid of it, but because you'd primed us to think he was our man, we were already there waiting to catch him in the act.
In a way, I envy you, Emily.<eos> Your father is a poor, so it doesn't matter if you have his respect.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> You could learn a lot from my dad.<eos> He had a flower shop, and through thick and thin, he kept it open.
There's a truck carrying radioactive material that's gone missing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Should Seth and I prepare a statement?<eos> -Where are we saying the truck is?<eos> -When are we gonna find it?
The senator's feeling the heat, from where?<eos> Why don't you come in later. We can talk about it then.<eos> No, no, no. Wait a minute.<eos> Danny... I'm counting on his vote.<eos> - Well, you can count it out. - No.
- Does it?<eos> Athena can see into the heart of a person.<eos> Well, in that spirit I'd like to make myself useful.<eos> I happen to have a soap recipe, - that's excellent for the complexion. - Oh, wonderful!<eos> - I'd like to be the first to try it.
Proving that he handled the TNT.<eos> So we can close the case on the murder of Muriel Bruce.<eos> Sisters, please!<eos> Remain calm!<eos> Our oasis has been invaded, but we will regain it.
Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader; they're sending a prototype for you to beta test.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.<eos> Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.<eos> Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
Beg, if that's what it takes.<eos> That's very French of you, Catherine.<eos> And so English of you not to.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> I've made my bed, and I'll lie in it.
So you were right.<eos> He was killed in the hold and his body moved on deck later on.<eos> You look like you've been busy.<eos> I'm afraid my evening wasn't quite as romantic as yours.<eos> I spent it going through the victim's financial records.
'There was a bag full of it.'<eos> Cash.<eos> A lot of cash.<eos> Do you know what happened to this bag of money?<eos> - Only we never found it.
Cash.<eos> A lot of cash.<eos> Do you know what happened to this bag of money?<eos> - Only we never found it.<eos> - No, I never saw it again.
Check out the X-ray.<eos> What's that in his stomach?<eos> Based on my analysis, looks to me like a computer thumb drive.<eos> There was no corrosion from digestive agents.<eos> The ME is sure he ingested it right before he died.
Mary Graziano. U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Division.<eos> I haven't heard the words "writ of replevin"<eos> since law school. What's this all about?<eos> You have classified material that belongs to the United States government.<eos> We want it back.
Zombies put a bug behind the dash.<eos> They know everywhere we go and everything we say.<eos> Did you get rid of it?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> We're gonna use it against them.
I told you they'd find out.<eos> What is this?<eos> OK, I can explain.<eos> The gun belongs to me, although it was my father's, originally, from the Second World War.<eos> I took it into the office years ago, you know, to impress the lads.
The gun belongs to me, although it was my father's, originally, from the Second World War.<eos> I took it into the office years ago, you know, to impress the lads.<eos> It's been in the drawer of my desk ever since.<eos> Was it kept under lock and key?<eos> So anyone could have taken it?
- I was not.<eos> Although, pretty sure my ribs are broken, and I think I'm wearing a pillowcase I cut holes in - as a shirt.<eos> - We have to think.<eos> Does anyone remember having the laptop?<eos> - Wait, we all left the room and went somewhere and I didn't want to leave the computer behind with so many strangers, so I took it!
How sure are we this is our guy?<eos> Mrs. Durning said that's who she saw when she left the house right before her husband's heart attack.<eos> She also remembered he was carrying a briefcase.<eos> Good bet it contained a hypodermic needle and whatever tools he needed to break into the Durning home.<eos> Local PD are circulating the sketch, but we're gonna take it over to the morgue in Paramus personally, see if anyone there saw this guy make contact with the M.E. who missed the murder.
Hey, you're home early.<eos> You'll never believe it.<eos> Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.<eos> Wow.<eos> He finally used it.
That's not even a math symbol.<eos> That's just Charlie Brown's hair.<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> This club was so great.<eos> How could they turn it into a bookstore?
Dude, that environmental film we watched was a mind-blower; I'm serious when I say I feel bad for people who haven't seen it.
Some sort of drop. I've never seen him actually use it.<eos> I just know that he gives it to her twice a week.<eos> Who did he get the poison from?<eos> Brooklyn: He never said.<eos> But I can tell you where he keeps it.
- Who was he?<eos> - A child.<eos> A beautiful child.<eos> A unique genome.<eos> We tried to unlock it, but... it was early days.
He's my deepest regret.<eos> For the record, I was not the scientist conducting the trails.<eos> But I did synthesise the gene.<eos> You synthesised it?<eos> And put it in the LEDA genome.
We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.<eos> We'll find it.
- You didn't?<eos> - No!<eos> - But you used this phone.<eos> Yes.<eos> They will trace it.
Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.<eos> Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble.<eos> Can you prove any of this?<eos> I have a draft of the agreement at my office.<eos> We both signed it.
Why would Thawne use the Spear of Destiny to shrink you?<eos> Uh, I don't believe he did.<eos> I'm assuming that he used Dr. Palmer's exosuit.<eos> Oh. Well then, he must still have it in his lab.<eos> We gotta steal it back and then we can unshrink the ship.
But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Okay, where to now?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> I never exactly saw my exosuit here.<eos> I just figured, where else would Thawne hide it?
That's impossible.<eos> I keep my gun locked in a safe in the bedroom.<eos> Bedroom's that way?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I put it there myself.
This demon was brought forth from a vessel.<eos> Should it return, it could be contained, kept alive.<eos> Why, so it can con more people into shitty deals?<eos> No, to save the person who got the shittiest deal of them all.<eos> We catch this demon, Wynonna, and we use it to save Deputy Marshall Dolls.
Hey.<eos> Thought you had already, uh, thought you'd already gone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Came back for Agent Zigman's badge.<eos> Bailey left it on her desk for me.
Now, the address, please.<eos> If I tell you, - I'm a dead man.<eos> - No one will ever find out.<eos> Scout's honor.<eos> On the other hand, if you don't give it to me...
- He's a partner.<eos> It's not an ideal situation.<eos> You know, I'd be happy...<eos> to show you my left hook.<eos> Well, I'd love to try it on for size.
I thought I was gonna miss my gun and my badge, chasing bad guys, but I don't.<eos> Not even a little.<eos> Is that your tooth?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you come over here and hold it for me?
How do you know it was just one?<eos> Pop, I remember every rip I ever got, and the worst one was in that file.<eos> And you think I'd know where it is?<eos> Well, I'm asking my father, who was commissioner at the time I got the rip.<eos> If you're implying that I tried to bury it, son...
Dylan, this cart goes to 63rd and 6th as soon as the C-4 is loaded.<eos> But we got a problem with the propane.<eos> I'm gonna need to switch it out.
What's wrong?<eos> Freeze!<eos> You were saying something about "better late than never"?<eos> I forgot about the FBI's physical-fitness requirements.<eos> You may have gotten your badge back, but you still have to work for it.
Priors for unlawful restraint, aggravated battery, assaulting a police... you get the idea.<eos> Mm.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna head back upstairs.<eos> - That's probably a good idea. - Uh-huh.<eos> You spit on that floor again, you're gonna be licking it back up, trust me. [door closes]
- Mission accomplished, Mr. Azoulay.<eos> And he is rerouting his private jet...<eos> - He has a private jet?<eos> - He has a private jet?<eos> Yes, he has a private jet, and he is rerouting it to Van Nuys just in case I can meet him this morning.
Each of those cities are on high alert for riots due to active or imminent protests.<eos> I got an FBI "all agents" call.<eos> Well, what does that tell you?<eos> The Collaborators are planning for a riot in one of those cities.<eos> Or planning to create it.
Have you ever worked with a courier by the name of Lelantos?<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I mainly deal with Ethan or Ed.<eos> How about this symbol, hmm?<eos> - Have you ever seen it before?
We offer full body scans, psychological work-ups and personalized meal plans.<eos> That sounds very good.<eos> Well, a lot of patients rebel when I tell them they have to give up poisons like beer and sweets, but they always thank me in the end.<eos> I can't help but notice your scar.<eos> May I ask how you got it?
He sounds like a sociopath.<eos> We don't know, his mother never had him tested.<eos> You're talking about me.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
Just do your laundry!<eos> Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner. Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.<eos> Hey, what's for dinner?<eos> Meatloaf. Oh, cool.<eos> Stuart made it. Oh, cool.
I got a call that Bernie's great-aunt, Trixie, died. And?<eos> And I forgot to give her the message. That's terrible. The terrible part is, ever since then,<eos> Howard!<eos> Let me finish-- and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie's purse.<eos> The notebook isn't in the bathroom. I can't find it, either. How can he not remember a day?
You don't have to stop, just slow down, I'll jump out.<eos> Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!<eos> How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?<eos> I hurt myself juggling.<eos> Where did you get it?
Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!<eos> How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?<eos> I hurt myself juggling.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> Howard said I could borrow it,
I'm on a unicycle.<eos> All right, well, have fun.<eos> Wait, I need help getting down.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here.
Too late for that.<eos> Even if it comes with my resignation?<eos> To be kept in your safe, postdated several months, enough time for you to secure your confirmation.<eos> - Why now?<eos> - Because I want to see if you'll take it, if you actually want this country to survive, or if you're just looking to burn it all down.
Not without some buffalo tranquilizers.<eos> Don't put my pants on the fire!<eos> Calm down, sis.<eos> Of course, we own the house.<eos> Mom and Dad left it to all of us.
I've just been promised a new way to break the curse.<eos> Sold my soul to Black Badge to get it, but might mean not having to kill everyone in sight.<eos> Wait, so we could all be free?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I could stay here and protect it.
Why am I here, Detective?<eos> There's just a couple things that aren't adding up.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Is this about the epinephrine?<eos> Well, you stole it. Is that right?
She gets her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective!<eos> I would do anything.<eos> Michelle, she would have known about the epinephrine, too, right?<eos> Yeah, it came from our ambulance.<eos> She ever have any reason to handle it?
I would do anything.<eos> Michelle, she would have known about the epinephrine, too, right?<eos> Yeah, it came from our ambulance.<eos> She ever have any reason to handle it?<eos> Yeah, she gave it to me to give to Sharyn.
Please.<eos> Dolls, please.<eos> There's another way.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> You can find it.
We're done.<eos> She stays here until this is over.<eos> One way or another.<eos> I got you the sample.<eos> Now analyze it.
- I want a girl.<eos> - Predictable.<eos> - That girl has the demon inside her...<eos> - Shoot her.<eos> - which will spread like a virus if we don't destroy it.
Not hard to do once we've obtained the password.<eos> Okay, so, Rebecca's old-school.<eos> Her computer's closer to a Commodore than a MacBook, which means she'll have a rudimentary password.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> The bad news is, we can't hack it remotely, so we'll have to use good, old-fashioned human intelligence instead.
Owen, that goes for you, too.<eos> Maintain position.<eos> Alex, he's right.<eos> Owen, we need her comm.<eos> The cops can't find it.
I wasn't fighting for skaikru today.<eos> I thought I was fighting for myself, but I now know that's not true, either.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it equally because we are equal.
I know this just isn't a case anymore.<eos> This is personal for all of us.<eos> We have to start looking after ourselves and each other.<eos> Otherwise, we don't stand a chance against them.<eos> So I booked an appointment for you tonight to see Dr. Sun, so, please, don't miss it.
Yeah, but there is less of a chance and it's worth the risk.<eos> We've got to stop playing defense if we want to get ahead of them.<eos> All right, but we have to take major precautions.<eos> I want you to get Tasha a false ID with rock-solid backstopping... and some way to be able to call out.<eos> I'll get you a burner phone, but you're gonna have to smuggle it in.
Patterson, what have you got for us?<eos> Actually, this is Stuart, one of the lab techs.<eos> Where's Patterson, Stuart?<eos> She had to step away, but there was an alert that you should know about.<eos> Agent Zapata's cell was turned back on briefly just long enough for us to trace it.
Look, it's gonna take some time, but I think he'll come around.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I cut my finger.<eos> Well, go run it under some cold water.
I don't get you.<eos> You don't trust anyone.<eos> But after everything that's happened, you still trust her?<eos> There's gotta be a phone down here.<eos> Let's find it.
Look, it might be a long shot, but I'm sending an app to your phone now, I just reprogrammed it.<eos> It might be able to detect the beacon.<eos> _<eos> All right, I got my phone in my hand.<eos> Okay, open it and scan the space like you're waving a metal detector.
If you don't find it within the next two minutes, that glider will pass fail-safe.<eos> - I found it.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> - Destroy it!<eos> - Shepherd swallowed it.
Terry, baby, talk to me.<eos> Where the hell is Moo Moo?<eos> I think Terry has a child named Moo Moo, and we forgot to pick her up. It's not a baby, Jake.<eos> It's Cagney's blankie.<eos> She calls it that because it has a little cow head.
Why is Amy's hair like that?<eos> - Oh, she obsessively braids her hair when she's nervous, and she's super nervous 'cause she's taking the sergeant's exam today.<eos> - But Amy loves tests.<eos> - Not this one.<eos> - It's always been her plan to be the youngest captain in the history of the NYPD, but if she doesn't pass this exam, she's gonna have to wait another three years to take it again, and that'll disrupt her entire life calendar.
- I was really proud of you.<eos> - Yes, and... - Hold onto your crazy-ass hair... Because I'm about to prove to you that you have nothing to worry about.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Practice test.<eos> You ace it, you relax, you nail the real one, you become a sergeant, you make grateful love to me for 14 hours straight.
Time to go... smoke in secret.<eos> And as I'm shame-smoking, I'm seeing...<eos> The library.<eos> - Captain, did you throw away my sombrero restaurant?<eos> - Oh, I might have knocked it in the bin by accident.
- He's real clumsy.<eos> If the wrong person saw that tape, they might get the wrong idea.<eos> You know, I saw the tape, and it was shocking how clumsy that guy actually was.<eos> - Right?<eos> - And the funny thing is, I meant to save the file, but I deleted it by accident.
Y-You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn't even tell us?<eos> Sounds like you get it.<eos> Well, why would you do that?<eos> You guys completed phase one, we'll take it from here.<eos> Where did you move it?
Bear claw, good choice, Rebecca.<eos> That's right, I learned your name.<eos> I learned everybody's names.<eos> Emily... I've been thinking.<eos> Even though you lost the match and the office is mine to do with whatever I want, I'm going to give it to you anyway.
Welcome to our home.<eos> None of this would exist if it wasn't for him.<eos> We were cursed...<eos> Bound to guard a magical portal.<eos> The Samurai was able to defeat us, but instead of using it to fulfill his quest... he freed us.
Made it tan."<eos> They shouldn't even make tan cars. It's mean to make them.<eos> You look over, you see a guy in a tan car with dents all over it and a garbage bag for a window.<eos> What is holding up his suicide?<eos> -[audience laughing] -What is delaying it?
Don't ask me that shit.<eos> I don't know who Achilles' mother." Don't yell out if you know.<eos> "It's Campampetes." Nobody cares what you know. [audience laughing]<eos> She had a question about Achilles, it was interesting.<eos> I'll tell it to you.
But she held him by the heel.<eos> That's the important detail.<eos> Held him by the heel, which is an awkward way to hold a baby.<eos> By the heel.<eos> Try holding a baby by the heel and dipping it in a river.
If somebody was like, "We have a guy here, he has the best dick.<eos> The best dick ever.<eos> His dick has been soaking in olive oil since he was five years old. [audience laughing]<eos> We've been feeding him nothing but butter and penises his whole life.<eos> He has the best dick, and you can suck it right now."
We've been feeding him nothing but butter and penises his whole life.<eos> He has the best dick, and you can suck it right now."<eos> "Well, let me see it.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> Can you take it out?
Can you take it out?<eos> Oh, shit. That's beautiful. Oh, my God.<eos> That's my favorite thing now.<eos> Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.<eos> Bring it closer.
Oh, shit. That's beautiful. Oh, my God.<eos> That's my favorite thing now.<eos> Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.<eos> Bring it closer.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do, but bring it closer, please."
That's my favorite thing now.<eos> Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.<eos> Bring it closer.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do, but bring it closer, please."<eos> I think, at that point, you put it in your mouth, right?
- Oh, whoopy-doo(! )<eos> Do a bit of juicing.<eos> - I'll tell you what needs juicing, John - life.<eos> - Eh?<eos> You need to squeeze every last drop out of it.
The Zombie Titular.<eos> I'm not a Goddamn...<eos> I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again...
I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again...<eos> I don't...<eos> whoever hit me took it.
- Oh, uh... just, well... uh... - This is your purse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But this is my DNA test.<eos> You said it hadn't arrived yet.<eos> Well, have you... have you opened it?
- Edwin Earp!<eos> Edwin Earp!<eos> - Of course it's an Earp.<eos> So you know the combination.<eos> Unlock it.
- Not that loose.<eos> - The briefcase!<eos> It belongs to the Earps.<eos> Well, I guess we're about to have a whole lot of killing.<eos> Put it on the table.
You know, the only altar this boy bows to is the bar stool on hockey Saturday.<eos> Where's yours?<eos> In the house of my enemy.<eos> In a place of worship.<eos> And you will lead me to the seal that opens it.
Who's blaming who can be sorted out later.<eos> Bit of a time crunch here. Oh, yeah.<eos> We will talk about it, Wynonna.<eos> The venom should be in her glands.<eos> To get it out, you'll need this.
- Or maybe I do, I don't know, I just didn't think that through.<eos> Oh, my God. Is that my phone?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Are you holding my... what are you doing with my phone?<eos> You left it in the bathroom.
Oh, John, darling, my tooth's hurting something rotten.<eos> - Can you have it out?<eos> - Annie, I'm just in the middle of something, - can you come back tonight?<eos> - No, I've got customers tonight.<eos> - Can't you smash it out now?
X takes care of its own.<eos> You got to be kidding.<eos> We failed.<eos> Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it's headed right for us.<eos> I'm gonna have to take it out kamikaze style.
- Does not look good at all.<eos> - Yeah, what does it look like?<eos> Looks like your dick is trapped between two slats of wood.<eos> Okay, I just... Fuck, I can't reach it.<eos> I just need you to get down there and just pop it out.
We read the coroner's report.<eos> It's all in there before those other guys switched it.<eos> Yeah, and I recorded the whole thing on my cell phone.<eos> - Where's the cell phone?<eos> - They destroyed it.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
where he unlocked the dark forces of their union.<eos> But what they didn't account for was the sword.<eos> Merlin stole his staff.<eos> He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower.<eos> The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
this sword.<eos> Only you can prevent this.<eos> He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.
I don't like snakes.<eos> No one likes snakes.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> You will feel it for a few hours.
Well, just look at the facts.<eos> Take it out of your hands.<eos> Why do you think it can't work as a country song?<eos> - It can.<eos> As a... as a country... Take your finger outta your ear. Put it back up your ass.
Don't have the other.<eos> Running around, trying to be somebody.<eos> Snatching at life.<eos> I got some uranium!<eos> I bought it off my mom.
Masterful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?
It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man.<eos> We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series. Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.
Murphy.<eos> You've got hidden talents, man.<eos> "Then it happens.<eos> "All I did was put a pint of Export in front of Begbie.<eos> "He takes one fucking gulp out o' it.
Keep as close to the ocean floor as you can.<eos> Sharks attack from below, so if you keep to the floor, you should be fine.<eos> This button inflates your BCD.<eos> Use it to go up.<eos> This button deflates it.
You still have time.<eos> Charles, the world is not the same as it was.<eos> We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.<eos> And where we're going, Eden... it doesn't exist.<eos> Her nurse got it from a comic book.
We're home.<eos> Hi, Julia.<eos> No!<eos> Go to sleep!<eos> Well, maybe it's because the restraining order is up and I can't renew it.
Diarmuid, listen to me.<eos> You must go. You must leave.<eos> Now!<eos> I can not leave, not without the rock, not without you.<eos> I hope the Lord will forgive me, but I threw it from the cart.
Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.<eos> It is worth letting him do this.<eos> Is your friend quite mad?<eos> No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.<eos> Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
Dr Watson.<eos> -I love his blog.<eos> Don't you?<eos> -His blog?<eos> -Don't you read it?
-All of them guilty.<eos> -Sherlock.<eos> (STAMMERS) And what do you call that one, John?<eos> Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.<eos> Yeah, I called it "Murder at the zoo."
Sherlock, you okay?<eos> -Watch him. He's got a knife.<eos> -Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel.<eos> You picked it up from that table.
I saw you take it.<eos> I certainly did not!<eos> Look behind his back!<eos> -Look. (LAUGHS)<eos> -I saw you take it!
This is an experiment.<eos> There will be rigour.<eos> Sherlock, pick up the gun.<eos> It's your turn next.<eos> When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- You.<eos> - How so?<eos> - If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands?<eos> Would waste valuable time.<eos> Probably just take it.
And it gets even worse.<eos> Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co, made this announcement.<eos> Teddy, roll the clip.<eos> And we are on schedule... to release the most adorable puppy ever.<eos> We're gonna launch it at the pet convention in Las Vegas!
What about this little plant?<eos> Can I smash it with a rock?<eos> No, Gef.<eos> It's too adorable to kill.<eos> Take it to the tailor.
You can do anything you want.<eos> I'm gonna make some weird shit.<eos> But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.<eos> Only we can remake the universe.<eos> Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos... and lead it to where it needs to go.
But to do so, we need video from inside the lab, footage of the horrible atrocities being committed against the animals.<eos> And there's a problem.<eos> The security is impenetrable.<eos> But there is a way.<eos> Although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your consent.
I sent you one.<eos> Tell it to your wife, Darren.<eos> Hey, Phil.<eos> I gave Dougie your coffee. I'm sorry.<eos> He really wanted it.
I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are, and that ass...<eos> Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I heard you've been kneading it all day.
Let's go.<eos> Get up!<eos> Why would Rand wanna buy this pier?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Ward said to buy it.
Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.<eos> Why is Rand so determined to keep the pier all to itself?<eos> Look, another group of people forced us to purchase it.
I've been alive long enough to watch the world change in many ways.<eos> But this change now, it feels significant.<eos> The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> The man with unbreakable skin.<eos> And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.
I was not born a homeless beggar.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Most people usually keep moving.<eos> I need information... about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.
That looks like the tattoo on your chest.<eos> How are you connected to these people?<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's a sacred symbol from K'un-Lun.<eos> Gao's giving them the finger by putting it on her poison.
In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> Bakuto.<eos> There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.
- We need to get you stitched up.<eos> - Airport?<eos> We're going home, Danny.<eos> No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.
He really died.<eos> Let's make a list of things that you are never allowed to say again, starting with that.<eos> Now, if you still have the tablet, I could... I could get it analyzed.<eos> Maybe prove that the documents were forged.<eos> I gave it to Harold.
Fuck.<eos> You got eyes on him?<eos> I think I got a shot.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going for it, man.
She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.<eos> It's a miracle... the fact that this park even exists.<eos> The fact that this city hasn't torn it down to put up high-rises.
- You punched first.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.
- How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.<eos> - You what?<eos> He earned it.
How are you?<eos> You, uh...<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait a second, Dee.<eos> - I've got an idea! - What?<eos> If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here. You said you couldn't rip through it.<eos> No, I can't. But Sherman can chew through it!
- Yeah, you should say...<eos> - you should lead with that. - I'm screwing up the pitch.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.<eos> We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts who wanted to take the power and essence of a crow and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink - that we invented, thus Fight Milk. - Yeah.<eos> I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it. - Are you kidding me, dude?
Well, I'm very happy to do so.<eos> I do have a few questions.<eos> - Fire away. - Yup.<eos> - Of course, yeah.<eos> Now, the ticket in question, uh, who purchased it?
- Totally lost. That means she bought it with my money!<eos> So, technically, that ticket is mine!<eos> Okay, okay, okay. Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.<eos> Miss Reynolds bought the ticket with Mr. Reynolds' money.<eos> But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.
I am.<eos> I'm not the god of war, Diana.<eos> I am the God of truth.<eos> Mankind Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.
There is not much we can do if that's who I think it is.<eos> But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!
If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news. It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.<eos> Who could forget him, huh?<eos> Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.<eos> Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.<eos> So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You love me.<eos> And you are not gonna shoot me.<eos> You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will just take it from a dead girl.
Well, now he is returned.<eos> And Delaney's will leaves him everything.<eos> Including Nootka.<eos> Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet?<eos> Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?
I flagged him down at St Pancras.<eos> I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide.<eos> They call it "laughing gas".
I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide.<eos> They call it "laughing gas".<eos> I provide it for entertainment at society parties.
Or it could burn.<eos> - Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.
- Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.<eos> Less chance the river might bring it back.
To the heath!<eos> He won't let us shift it.<eos> James.<eos> The powder that we moved last night was ready to be moved.<eos> That's why we moved it.
I didn't know it was a gun!<eos> He could have killed himself!<eos> He could have killed all of us!<eos> It was by my feet, russ.<eos> I moved it to get it out of the way.
Showed up in the mail the other day.<eos> We haven't used a key like this in over 20 years.<eos> Room 315.<eos> I'm pretty sure that this is the key to Agent Cooper's old room.<eos> I thought Harry would like to have it as a memento.
North 39.5752. West 71.2857.<eos> That's here in Rosewood.<eos> 492 Hart Street.<eos> Wait, Toby, isn't that your house, the one you built?<eos> I never found out who bought it.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.<eos> Do you know how they function?<eos> Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.<eos> But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.
Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Well, whatever's inside this cage is shielded from any outside electrical current.<eos> So the Ghost Rider won't be able to use lightning to escape.<eos> We put a lightning rod on the roof and connected it to that conduit cable.
We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.<eos> Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
Excellent question.<eos> For the crime of murdering the Mistress of the eastern wood... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz...<eos> I commit you to d...<eos> This sword.<eos> I knew the man who carried it.
And we celebrate the day that I vanquished that terror from our land.<eos> But when the two moons become one, the beast forever will return, and it will be worse than ever before.<eos> And it will obliterate everything in its wake.<eos> But if you build us weapons, with our expert knowledge, your technological prowess...<eos> We can... We will defeat it.
I know it's a lot. I know.<eos> Just focus on one thing.<eos> Focus on the dove.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you hear it?
Kill glinda.<eos> - Did you even think I could, or did you just send me there because you thought I'd never come back?<eos> - I sent you there to save oz.<eos> Because I swore to protect this world!<eos> And I will protect it!
What do you hear?<eos> Rain. - Rain. It was raining.<eos> Can you hear the rain?<eos> Do you hear it?<eos> Find it.
I was just confused.<eos> Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.<eos> Allow me to explain.<eos> I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser... and it accidentally came undone.<eos> And rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way.
The goal is to crush the brain inside the skull, and quick, before the pain can travel from outside the brain to the inside, so the brain never knows the brain is crushing.<eos> To give a good death is art.<eos> But nowadays, they have this bolt gun.<eos> You know?<eos> Put it on the forehead.
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
- That briefcase stays shut.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I fucking say. He just wants to confuse us.<eos> He's pissed off about it and wants to get at me.<eos> Open it, we look inside, then we won't suspect you.
- They don't want us infecting anyone.<eos> - Why isn't it on the TV?<eos> - It's a cover-up.<eos> That's why they invented the fire!<eos> They brought it to Spain, and it spread.
- Give it to me!<eos> - No!<eos> - Give it to me!<eos> - The battery!<eos> Give it to me!
- The battery!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Why now, when it's no use?<eos> Give me the phone, I know who to call.<eos> - Don't touch it!
Let's see what you do, because he's getting ideas.<eos> Right, "Beard Boy"?<eos> We have to get the gun.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> - We have to get it.
Where's my seed money?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - I don't have...<eos> - Speak up, I can't hear you.<eos> - I don't have it.
- Need a ride?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> I got my bike.<eos> - Just throw it in the trunk.
It's three miles of torture.<eos> What part of that is fun?<eos> Calling it fun is Orwellian.<eos> And why do you care if I miss it?<eos> Who else is gonna call it Orwellian?
- "What if I can't hum on key?<eos> What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears?"<eos> Is everyone reading that stupid magazine?<eos> I'm kind of addicted to it.<eos> -You never read it?
Bye.<eos> Um, hey, Helmet.<eos> Yeah, I know, I just got your text.<eos> Well, I... I don't know... I just called.<eos> Actually, I can just come by and pick it up.
I'm running errands today anyway.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I could have mailed it.
It took hours.<eos> And then... when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it.<eos> It was a bag of gold.<eos> All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.
You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."<eos> Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.<eos> Oh, I think you do.<eos> Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum...<eos> Shoney's. or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
W-where are you?<eos> On my work bench, Morty.<eos> Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?<eos> Flip the pickle over.<eos> What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
Your belt was in his bed.<eos> I lost that belt.<eos> Weeks ago.<eos> Where?<eos> If I knew that, Ingrid, I wouldn't have lost it.
Let's not make it any harder than it has to be.<eos> Erling Munk.<eos> Dmitri Podnikov?<eos> He's the Mayor of Vukobejina.<eos> If it's an official call, you must hand it back to me.
You should never have come.<eos> You should have stayed away.<eos> Someone took it. Just now.<eos> You don't know what this is, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> WHO TOOK IT?
Are you making fun of me?<eos> No.<eos> The liver separates the narcotic from the toxins.<eos> It connects all the victims:<eos> Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith drank it and Bianca was killed where they took it.
Me, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, my baby lost another baby tooth.<eos> - I put it under my pillow.
Between the blades.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ooh, higher.<eos> I'm gonna miss this cast.<eos> Yet you never asked to sign it.
That's always a classic.<eos> - Boo. - No need to ask for a bigger family since everybody seems to be marrying each other.<eos> I always wanted a little brother, by the way, dude.<eos> Or I could...<eos> I could give it away.
That's right.<eos> That's not the...<eos> Son, read my lips.<eos> You're in a shit storm, and we're the ones holding out the umbrella.<eos> You gonna take it?
At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.<eos> Come on, learn. It'll be fun.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We had a compact or whatever the fuck you called it.
He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself.<eos> No.<eos> - Ask for it.
- Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?
What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?<eos> One of you guys.<eos> I don't know how you people work.<eos> I'll need to see it.
No. No "but."<eos> No anything. I didn't do it.<eos> After you pressured me, for old times' sake,<eos> I did exactly what I'm supposed to do.<eos> I filled out a contact report and I sent it up the chain.
I-I thought I explained that?<eos> This led to an incident which Mr. Quinn held<eos> Franny and her nanny hostage for several hours.<eos> I described it in detail in my report.<eos> I've read it.
There were some irregularities during his interview.<eos> Evasiveness.<eos> - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his resume.<eos> How did he explain it?
The deal is broken.<eos> We are pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> - You know that's not true.<eos> - Saul has many qualities, the most admirable of which is his optimism.<eos> Some might call it a stubborn refusal to see what's exactly in front of his eyes.
Take care of yourself.<eos> I always do.<eos> I work here.<eos> I'm required to have a local access writ now. The INTERPOL Orange Writ of Coaction. Well, we prepared the Orange Writ.<eos> We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.
- Please, Laurie.<eos> It's in your best interest if you're not involved.<eos> You know, whatever you have to say to us, you can say to her.<eos> No one seems to care that I just witnessed a murder.<eos> - The man who perpetrated it just assaulted me.
And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and PuttPutt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I... I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.
That's nothing.<eos> I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.
Really?<eos> I mean, I didn't say anything because it was your money that bought it.<eos> Well, you should've said something.<eos> - It was our house.<eos> - You loved it.
Excellent.<eos> Now your penis, please, sir.<eos> - My what?<eos> - Your penis.<eos> Place it on the other scanner, please, sir.
Did you move back to Mapleton?<eos> No.<eos> Still in Jarden.<eos> In our house.<eos> Anyone still call it Miracle?
In a world full of orphans, they still had each other.<eos> And I was a ghost.<eos> I was a ghost who had no place there.<eos> And that, Kevin, is when I changed my mind.<eos> The physicists who sent me through told me the first person to use the machine was the guy who invented it.
That took a long time, too.<eos> But I found him and I asked him to make another machine because he already knew how.<eos> And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.
So, from there, the list got very short very quickly.<eos> Max fucked us.<eos> If it wasn't for her, we likely take Nassau whole, fleet intact, no prisoners in the fort, no fight between you and I.<eos> Instead, here we are.<eos> Now, one would think we could go a long way towards soothing all that chaos out there, and the anger driving it... if we could draw everyone together to see justice done to the one responsible for all of it.
Thanks for helping me move into Sesame Street, Mr. Frumpus.<eos> Boy, those boxes were heavy.<eos> But now that we're done, we can go get ice cream.<eos> - I want chocolate.<eos> - And you'll get it.
And then do you remember what I said right before that?<eos> Do you, Titus?<eos> I said, "I want chocolate."<eos> And then what did you say, Titus?<eos> Y-you'll get it?
Pat him down.<eos> Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm.<eos> I said pat him down.<eos> Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?<eos> His gun, get it and kick it over here.
I won't accept your resignation.<eos> It's true you should have told me... but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.<eos> As much as I appreciate your loyalty, I can't let you do this.<eos> If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage.<eos> Who knows? Maybe even turn it into an advantage.
Carter's two minutes out.<eos> I've got eyes on sight.<eos> Mullins asked me to pull up a cell phone conversation for Eric Carter's wife.<eos> But I can't find it.<eos> That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.
I'm trying to help.<eos> When all you've done since we hooked back up is the opposite.<eos> I never wanted the terrorists to get the list.<eos> There was an easy way to do that, Ben.<eos> Not steal it from me in the first place.
Yeah, there should be an extra port, for injections.<eos> There is.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> You need to pull the syringe all the way back, so the thing's full of air.<eos> Then inject it into the port.
Don't.<eos> Put your hands behind your head and move over there.<eos> Hands above your head now.<eos> You have a gun around your waist.<eos> Put it on the floor and slide it over to me, slowly.
That's unbelievable.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do believe I have that game ball in my office.<eos> Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.<eos> Let me see if I can find it.
Of course I love her.<eos> I let you try it your way!<eos> I did trust you.<eos> But I'm through wagering with her life now.<eos> If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us.
Your plan failed.<eos> We're moving on to my plan.<eos> Go get it. Bring it up here right now.
We'll resume tomorrow. Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.
Thank you.<eos> He's never stayed more than a day or two with me, but this... this little mystery seems to have caught his attention.<eos> That is a pretty piece of chaining.<eos> Effective ligand.<eos> Can I ask where you got it?
In the neighborhood I'm from, we say,<eos> "All the government is someone else's government." I want to build a rione...<eos> a neighborhood for our kind.<eos> I want to use this city.<eos> I want to take it and make it ours.
That's a lesson you only have to learn once.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I need to deploy your specialized computing skills, can-do attitude, the magic of your tech nerdistry.<eos> No one's ever said I have a can-do attitude before.<eos> That's because you hide it behind a superior, dismissive, and pessimistic mask, but I see past all that.
Raya.<eos> I need you to hack into Raya and get me an account on there.<eos> I can't do... do that.<eos> - Of course you can. - I mean, maybe I could, but that site's encrypted with a 128-bit Blowfish cipher.<eos> And no brute-force attack has been extensive enough to crack it.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm involved in my own.<eos> And I would have mentioned it last night, but, you know, she has so much to lose, and I...<eos> Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...
It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?<eos> We recovered this from the body.<eos> It's Richard's.<eos> I gave it to him.
I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.<eos> Well, we have another question from 8-year-old Mari.<eos> Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?<eos> No, we're gonna keep it up here.<eos> We're gonna study it where it's safe.
I use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into Boat A.<eos> I close the hatch.<eos> I press the button to give me full manual control.<eos> And if I can hold the stick, I can override the flight path.<eos> And if I hold it long enough, I can avoid reentry.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.<eos> The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home.
Ah, the food is tremendous.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?<eos> - Word as bond?<eos> Uh, I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it, eh.
It sure sounds like you're boring in bed.<eos> - But, Mrs. Hansen... - Time for a screwdriver!<eos> Oh dear. Give me a hand, will you?<eos> As for your women... Men don't understand it's all about the clitoris.<eos> Most can't even find it. And not only my late Poul, but all my lovers.
Oh dear. Give me a hand, will you?<eos> As for your women... Men don't understand it's all about the clitoris.<eos> Most can't even find it. And not only my late Poul, but all my lovers.<eos> Couldn't find it.<eos> Searched for it like it was the Higgs Boson in Switzerland.
Go, Dev! Run faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> My photo.<eos> My photo with Matteo Godardes.<eos> You idiot! Why didn't you send it to me?
I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?<eos> No.<eos> We'll never find it!
He's going to give up.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> I sure as heck would.<eos> There's a new picture at the Strand.<eos> Oh, no. I saw it three times.
- You?<eos> Good behaviour?<eos> - Get any bigger, I'll be needing longer arms.<eos> Daddy's won a cup for his boxing.<eos> Go on, Mickey, take it.
Well, let me put it this way, Justine...<eos> This is off the record, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> Now, my grandmother had a big, bossy goat.<eos> We used to call it King Goat because no matter what you were doing on the farm, he was always sticking his nose into things and shoving himself about and always trying to get in on the action.
Seems he's got three different accountants working for him.<eos> One thing I am sure of,<eos> Mayor Richards is not short of a bob or two.<eos> Yes, well, keep at it, Dwayne.<eos> JP? Well, sir, I got the file on Mayor Richards' beach hotel proposal from the Planning Office and I've been going through it.
Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.
I don't want it.<eos> I lost my son here.<eos> Fitz got shot here.<eos> My marriage died here.<eos> - I don't want it!
Mellie, listen to me...<eos> I am done running for President!<eos> Well, I'm not!<eos> They stole my phone, right out of my purse.<eos> - I want it back.
I am done running for President!<eos> Well, I'm not!<eos> They stole my phone, right out of my purse.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - No one stole it, Mrs. Vargas.
Someone sent you a finger.<eos> - Are you sure that it's.....<eos> - Archer Dunhill's, yes.<eos> The prints were a match.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent it or why?
Alison?<eos> Hi, it's Julie, we spoke on the phone.<eos> Right, hi.<eos> I was worried you wouldn't make it before closing.<eos> Okay, so here's your scanner just point it at the bar code of the item that you want and voila, it goes on your registry.
Guys, I have to keep the phone.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?
It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...
You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...<eos> No, I put it in my purse.
No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it...<eos> No, I put it in my purse.<eos> He's not gonna find it.
Wait, do you hear that?<eos> It's like a hum and then a bunch of clicks.<eos> Yeah, trust me that thing makes all kinds of noise.<eos> I know, I just, I can't even tell if it's mechanical or electrical.<eos> I can't break through a firewall and hack into it.
Yeah, I thought-I thought that's what you said.<eos> Look, we've tried this a million times.<eos> When has it ever worked?<eos> It only has to work once.<eos> Hanna's gonna drop it off, so let's see who shows up to get it.
Tonight, and she gave me the Lost Woods.<eos> - She gave you a motel?<eos> - Yeah, Ali and me.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I'm supposed to mortgage it to pay for the lawyers that we're gonna need.
And I don't even know why.<eos> I just... I just can't.<eos> Yeah, that's bullshit.<eos> That voice that says you can't.<eos> Every time you hear that voice, I want you to tell it to fuck off.
I never done that.<eos> Look, I paddle out to the buoy, I collect the gear - and I hold onto it.<eos> That's all.<eos> - Yet her prints are here.<eos> She found it, but she wasn't gonna say anything.
And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, mom.<eos> Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
Good, thank you.<eos> You know, Sara... you and I have... a checkered past.<eos> But I am evermore a boring guy now, and... mellowed by life, trust me.<eos> If you have something you want to tell me about Michael, I'd sure love to hear it.<eos> When your call came in and Kishida processed it... well, let's just say there are certain keywords that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.
Well, whoever hacked your phone used your thumbprint, so, unless you're missing a thumb, that's you.<eos> I don't know what you're messed up in, but I'd watch your back...<eos> When you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with her partner.<eos> What?<eos> They tracked me down using my cell phone, so I brought it to Jep's to try and figure out
Don't fall for it.<eos> And don't do anything without talking to me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To buy a gun so that I can use it on Connor.
Have you anything to say before we start?<eos> Facilis descensus Averno.<eos> "The descent into Hell is easy."<eos> I'm glad you believe in our sacred Clave motto.<eos> Alec and I use it to remind each other we can't be broken.
You're very welcome.<eos> I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my bartender friend swears by this IPA.<eos> Oh, well, I'm not much of a drinker, period, but I'll take your word for it.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You hate it.
No, she's too young.<eos> But powerful beyond her years.<eos> By raising Madzie myself, I'll finally have a warlock that's unconditionally loyal.<eos> Do you like your new home, sweetheart?<eos> I found it just for you.
Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it. It's mine.
Oh, says the girl who was willing to die for the downworld, what, yesterday?<eos> She's right, Jace.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I'm not gonna touch the sword.<eos> I'll just get to it before it's activated, and bring the mortal instrument back to the clave, where it belongs.
Portal me to the institute.<eos> Clary, we can't.<eos> Now!<eos> Looks like he's already tapping the energy supply.<eos> We need to get to that power core and shut it down.
Impossible.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> You kill Clary, Valentine still has the damn sword.<eos> Over time, no doubt, he'll find a way to activate it.
- I can't.<eos> - Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.
- No. D-Do not say that.<eos> - We-we will get you help.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Make this city yours or you burn it to the ground.
So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> How'd Chase get you here?<eos> A plane.<eos> You think you can find your way back to it?
- I love you.<eos> Hey, Ma. You guys settled in all right?<eos> Yeah. It's so great now that you have the guest house.<eos> I'll have to come more often.<eos> Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.
Now, let's get to work.<eos> All right.<eos> Councilwoman, thank you very much for meeting with me.<eos> Well, from what I hear, you've been making the rounds.<eos> But as someone without a lot of political capital, you're certainly making an interesting choice as to how to spend it.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
Ahem. Ok.<eos> All right. Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Mayor, all due respect, your head's bleeding, and our concussion protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.<eos> Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm suspending it.
What do you got?<eos> When my Sonic cry hit vigilante, it knocked off a small piece of his visor.<eos> Looks like it's lined with some kind of circuitry.<eos> Well, that means, it's manufactured.<eos> Maybe I can link it back to where he bought it from.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
As you wish.<eos> This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts into accounts that Gregor controls. Yes.<eos> We know this, to spread among Bratva captains.<eos> It also contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> Open it.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?<eos> You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.<eos> Full throttle.<eos> What do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
Luckily, I got a chance to see the file they're working on.<eos> Orekhovo-zuyevo.<eos> It is a--a shipyard in Moscow.<eos> Then we go to the shipyard.<eos> We stop Kovar from retrieving it.
- Death by elevator.<eos> - This doesn't feel like Chase.<eos> No. At first, I thought maybe Chase was trying to tie up loose ends, but I couldn't find any connections between them.<eos> He had his Argus security key still on him.<eos> Why enter the elevator if not to take it?
The problem.<eos> After Damien Darhk took my security implant last year, I instituted new protocols to prevent any sensitive Argus information or location from being accessed by a single person.<eos> Access now requires two of these security keys.<eos> But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.<eos> You found it on him.
What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I... I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.<eos> Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it and pulls it down, and it burns her hand real bad...
I hate to ask this, but how much air do they have left down there?<eos> Well, if they don't exert themselves, 5, maybe 6 hours.<eos> Ok. We're here.<eos> Now what?<eos> The mainframe has a built-in cellular chip, but our rewire didn't generate enough kilowatts to jump-start it.
- No.<eos> No. I don't think that will work.<eos> Wait, wait. You said the hatch was titanium, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
One of my last happy memories.<eos> And I'm guessing, this not one of them.<eos> I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.<eos> I didn't save our city.<eos> I failed it.
Cyclotrizane emissions trace came back.<eos> Computer's been working on a probable loca...tion.<eos> What is it?<eos> Nice!<eos> What made you decide to put it back on?
Yeah.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Yes! Ha ha!<eos> I love the cake.<eos> Where did you get it?
On its own.<eos> What can you tell me about that?<eos> The flower is unfolding.<eos> It's becoming.<eos> How can we stop it?
The flower is unfolding.<eos> It's becoming.<eos> How can we stop it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Why would you want to stop it?
It's not a bio-toxin, or some genetic toolkit. It's alien.<eos> You still want to destroy our sample?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> Miller wanted to destroy it, too, you know.
He wants to control it.<eos> Fred's trying to protect the Belt.<eos> Or so he claims.<eos> It's too dangerous to leave our sample out there anymore.<eos> We have to destroy it.
Make sure you tell them that.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Fixing the Martian flag.<eos> You're defacing it, Picasso.
What happened on that station?<eos> It wasn't a biohazard emergency.<eos> Someone was testing a weapon.<eos> Miller: Julie uncovered a plan to unleash this thing on Eros.<eos> She tried to stop it, she got infected.
We celebrate the birth of St John, and traditionally, locally, it's a time when we welcome newcomers into the community.<eos> Back in the day, people laid tables outside their houses and all were invited.<eos> We, of course, will be eating in the dining room.<eos> You're asking us to a Christian feast?<eos> Think of it more as a knees-up.
It's a coffee pot.<eos> Is that not coffee in there?<eos> Oh, is there not coffee?<eos> Actually, Ders, don't you mean flat Dr. Pepper pot?<eos> Because we put flat Dr. Pepper in a coffee pot and switched it.
I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.
I'm sorry to throw you into the deep end of the pool like this, but I need to know what we're up against.<eos> You mean beyond a secret society that controls all of Gotham.<eos> Well, if they could isolate the virus they could transform it into any number of compounds that could be released on a large scale into the city.<eos> All they'd need is a sample of her blood.<eos> Well, they ain't getting it from the source.
The shipment that came into dock 9C.<eos> Yes.<eos> It still needs to be tested, which means that you still have enough time to keep them from unleashing it citywide.<eos> But, of course, if they discover that their lab has been compromised...<eos> He's right, they might unleash it right away.
My enemies took everything from me.<eos> Tried to murder me.<eos> You help me get my revenge, and when I take back my throne, I will give you every resource you need to free yourself from this icy prison.<eos> Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours outside the cold without my suit.<eos> And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a Wayne Enterprises black site ever since you escaped Indian Hill.
I guess he wasn't meant to be.<eos> You crossed paths with Nygma recently.<eos> Any idea what this secret is he's talking about?<eos> No, I have no clue.<eos> My guess is he just made it up.
We just busted that dude five minutes ago.<eos> There's more.<eos> What is this doing in here?<eos> It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.<eos> He must have moved it.
- Won't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange,<eos> - it's gone.<eos> - Maybe Lucius took it.
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.<eos> Why would she be drawn to a man with so much darkness?<eos> Such an appetite for violence?<eos> Unless something inside her... liked it.<eos> Craved it.
I left him a way out.<eos> You hear that, Jim?<eos> I left you an escape hatch.<eos> Have you found it yet?<eos> You should've found it by now.
- I can't.<eos> - Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.
DDo not say that.<eos> - Wewe will get you help.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Make this city yours... or you burn it to the ground.
You got this, Wallace!<eos> I don't know why you even ask him.<eos> What did Wells do with me?<eos> His plan was, more methodically constructed than John Doe's in "Seven."<eos> And he had a bit more time to work it out by, give or take, 15 years.
Antibiotics won't work.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Nothing's not an option.<eos> Okay, what do you do when a banana ripens too quickly?<eos> - Put it in the freezer.
- Everybody brace yourselves!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.
I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.<eos> You took my home away from me, and now I will take it back!
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.<eos> No, not everything.<eos> We still have a piece of that Stone.<eos> Not for long.<eos> And once I have it, you and everyone you love will perish.
- It's gone?<eos> - If Savitar gets ahold of the stone...<eos> He'll escape for sure.<eos> You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace.<eos> You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force by yourself.
Wally.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> I know what my hell is.<eos> I've already seen it in the future.
Come on.<eos> Gentle, gentle.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yup.<eos> The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,<eos> - grab it for us, would you, please?
I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.
I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.
That's what mercy gets you.<eos> This must be where Waller kept her suicide squad.<eos> I think this is it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cisco, we found it.
It's ready.<eos> You didn't have that the last time, - so we have the upper hand now. - Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> You guys figure out what your plan is.<eos> I can't be here to know any of it.
Why didn't it work?<eos> I spent an eternity in a trap just like that.<eos> You think I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again?<eos> The philosopher's stone.<eos> It's made of calcified Speed Force energy, and you gave it to me.
Seline murdered my friend.<eos> I mean to figure out how to get payback.<eos> And since our only weapon is currently traveling through Paris...<eos> - You mean the tuning fork? - Actually, it'sitctually called the staff of Arcadius.<eos> Cade's enemies forged it in the fire
- Any other useless demands?<eos> I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.
I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.<eos> And I need your help to find it.
Besides, we know Sybil's field trip was headed near Mystic Falls.<eos> We're going in the right direction.<eos> All because she wants a bell.<eos> I've never heard of anything so insane.<eos> Says the guy who threw it off the bridge. I mean, what were you thinking, anyway?
You know? One person steals from him, everyone else thinks they can, too.<eos> All right.<eos> But then who has the package?<eos> How... how did you find me?<eos> I'm sorry I took it.
I used to steal cars.<eos> It's not fun if you don't drive 'em really, really fast.<eos> Anyway, I know where some black market ZX3 is locked up:<eos> a chop shop in NoHo.<eos> Problem is, I'm not sure I can get the owner to hand it over.
Give it to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It was in her purse.<eos> Look, you gave it to me, remember?
Black bill, he's...<eos> Us. Come again?<eos> Growing up, my father'd tell me stories about a monster.<eos> Lived under our house and made our family rich.<eos> All we had to do was... Was feed it.
How is that possible?<eos> Crowley, I guess. And now he's dead.<eos> Well, that's what Hess said.<eos> But Crowley's a freakin' cockroach.<eos> I'll believe he's gone when I see the body and burn it.
Wait.<eos> In an...actual rat?<eos> Wasn't too bad, really.<eos> Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it.
Thanks a lot.<eos> What do you think, Miller?<eos> Do you think her attacker sent that text?<eos> Well, it doesn't make sense.<eos> Why send it now?
Listen, I was wondering, erm... if I popped over, maybe in the next half hour, would that be all right?<eos> I just need to borrow the old laptop.<eos> What for?<eos> Oh, it's got some files on it I need for school.<eos> I'll get it back to you later tonight.
- Leah, seriously...<eos> - Dad, please!<eos> Please, I really need you not to behave weirdly right now.<eos> This is my spare locker key.<eos> If mum's computer is in there at the end of the school day, I can take it home, put it back and I don't have to tell anyone.
- PowerPoints of what?<eos> You know, various things.<eos> Osmosis, reproductive systems, the cellular life of plants...<eos> Right, well, we'll have the computer now, thanks.<eos> We'll examine it for our enquiries.
What did you expect to get from him?<eos> I just needed...<eos> I needed to hear Joe say it.<eos> You know, confess properly, like he never would in court.<eos> I tried to record him on my phone, so I could give it to the police, but he took it off me.
- Then why are you taking him?<eos> - It's gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?
Right, come on.<eos> Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.<eos> That bag wasn't there.<eos> You want us to believe you see a suspicious bag inside one of your sheds, pick it up, leaving your fingerprints and DNA.
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon.<eos> - Incredible!<eos> - Astounding!<eos> Stephano used this double-barrel syringe to inject the venom into Uncle Monty, to simulate the double puncture marks of a snake.<eos> Then he disassembled it to hide the evidence.
Smart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But unnecessary.<eos> I rescinded the order.<eos> Told David to destroy it before anybody could see it.
Hi...<eos> Hello.<eos> Um, yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> My laptop was stolen, and I can see it.
I don't know what the fuck that is.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.<eos> I just want it back.
We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.<eos> I just want it back.<eos> There's no questions...<eos> So, can you get it?
Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot.<eos> I... I left my wallet on the night stand at the hotel.<eos> I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do.<eos> Just call someone and have them run it over.
- Can you talk?<eos> I can.<eos> Thanks for getting my phone back to me, though I wish you'd done it in person.<eos> Didn't think that'd be too smart.<eos> Anybody at the station see you with it?
Okay, it was.<eos> It's just not anymore.<eos> I don't feel like having a birthday, so I'm skipping it.<eos> Oh. Well, I got you a gift.<eos> Should I return it?
Oh. Well, I got you a gift.<eos> Should I return it?<eos> No, no, you don't have to return it.<eos> That was very thoughtful of you.<eos> I'll return it.
Oh, someone's here with a cake for you, Dr. Reid.<eos> They're very insistent.<eos> Well, tell them I'm in surgery, and I don't want it.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> Why don't you share it with the other nurses?
- Thank you.<eos> - ... outside this room.<eos> Thank you for understanding.<eos> Your phone, sir?<eos> I left it in the car.
And where did you hide it?<eos> I mean, the sound's pretty clear, so it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?<eos> Tucked under a space blanket.<eos> Out of sight. Wow.<eos> So there's no chance I would see it.
Can you tell us where the nearest source is right now?<eos> Jimmy, do you have something in your pocket?<eos> Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.<eos> My cellphone.<eos> From this distance, you should feel it, and you don't, do you?
Hold on.<eos> Uh, repeat after me...<eos> Uh, "For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today<eos> "and have it on the air tomorrow."<eos> For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today and have it on air tomorrow.
What is that noise?<eos> It sounds like a saw cutting through bone.<eos> Yep.<eos> You get used to it. I...<eos> I don't even hear it anymore!
I loved Margaret.<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> It's just that sexuality is fluid, and sometimes my fluids go towards men.<eos> Our family-man angle took a hit.<eos> On the plus side, the airline found my bag and they're shipping it here, so we're gonna build on that luggage news and get some positive momentum going.
And for no more of our soldiers to die from this drug.<eos> Ingersol Pharmaceuticals has to be stopped, Dan.<eos> Dan?<eos> Do you know the red box trail in Shenandoah State Park?<eos> I can find it.
Not until I get my daughter back.<eos> Even then, I...<eos> The only way I'm gonna get my daughter back is if I return that laptop untouched.<eos> Where is it, by the way?<eos> They better not be trying to hack into it.
Get me an address.<eos> 26 tivoli college park.<eos> Hi.<eos> Got your rug.<eos> Where do you want it?
The Register could really use a Lois Lane type like you.<eos> I think I know something that can help with the Blossom investigation.<eos> People are saying Cheryl heard a gunshot?<eos> That's what she's claiming, yes.<eos> I heard it, too.
Make some room, outcasts.<eos> I'm having deja vu.<eos> Yeah, senior year, we're here, watching Candyman.<eos> God, I hated that movie.<eos> - You picked it.
Kevin called me. And he said his dad found a gun, the gun that killed Jason, in a lockbox in FP's closet.<eos> But Betty, we searched FP's trailer.<eos> We looked through that closet.<eos> And there was no lockbox.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Juggy, we screwed up. We all did.<eos> Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.<eos> Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.<eos> That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Veronica, wait.<eos> You and Archie...<eos> Getting closer?<eos> Maybe, why do you ask?<eos> Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy out the SoDale contract, but Fred is still on the fence about it.
I'm tired.<eos> Later, bro.<eos> You were right.<eos> Check it out.<eos> It's like Gunn was clawing at the opening to keep from getting taken through it.
Because we already indicted someone else.<eos> You didn't happen to find Danny's phone in his apartment, did you?<eos> It wasn't logged into Evidence.<eos> I mean, there might be something on his phone that's not on his computer.<eos> He probably dropped it when he was attacked, and we don't know where that was.
- Tell the truth!<eos> Order!<eos> Well, that's the cell phone.<eos> It's already marked "People's 23."<eos> Perhaps we should look at it.
We need that footage.<eos> There's nothing on the cloud.<eos> There was a laptop at the scene.<eos> Kind of burned up, but there could be footage on it.<eos> We had our hands on it at the cabin, But unfortunately, the feds nabbed it from us.
- Don't you dare.<eos> That is what I am doing, Olivia...<eos> My job.<eos> I am protecting this office.<eos> No, you're destroying it.
Yes. Now you can see how she inspires.<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Your Zelda has a voice.<eos> Really?<eos> Hell, I could see publishing it in its own right.
Some of it...<eos> Certainly not worth squabbling over.<eos> Two wordsmiths under one roof.<eos> - What could be better?<eos> - My point is we both stand to benefit far more financially is I were to use that diary than if you were to publish it under your own name.
Well, you were right.<eos> Just like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, you don't think my novel will stand the test of time?<eos> Well, I couldn't say.<eos> I haven't read it.
The pork processing place out in Duarte?<eos> Oh, you got to check that out.<eos> But you said "the big client."<eos> That's the one... that's the one that has the weird name that's... it's hard to pronounce.<eos> How do you, how do you say it?
Roxy, talk to me. How's she doing?<eos> Not so hot, Dr. Reid.<eos> She's lost a lot of blood.<eos> Okay, keep it coming with the O neg, and give me as much volume as possible.<eos> We're very excited about the new surgical robot that we got from St. Vic's, and you'll be happy to know that I got it at a good price.
- Previously on Beyond...<eos> - While you were in your coma, your mind traveled to another world.<eos> - This is where we met.<eos> - They call it The Realm.
Any connection with Oxford?<eos> Brief spell as vicar of Saint Mary's ten years ago.<eos> Saint Mary's?<eos> Barry Finch was a choirboy there, until his voice went.<eos> Looking at the mark on Finch's body, If you were to rotate it, it could be a cross, couldn't it?
And I put it to him... that your little one was the next best thing.<eos> He knows I asked you.<eos> And he knows you said no.<eos> Well, as I said, I'm saying yes now.<eos> You can take it -- as soon as it's born.
It's Ivy's.<eos> Reggie's going to be staying with us for a couple of days, just till he gets himself sorted.<eos> Hm.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Erm, Reggie, why don't you take your plant through to the spare room and find a nice bright spot for it?
One baby!<eos> Meet your little girl.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I longed for this baby, Patrick.<eos> Longed for it, prayed for it.
Tom, please, p-put down the gun.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just...<eos> Why?<eos> So you can pick it up and shoot me?
Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.<eos> You'd better get started.<eos> And careful of the paper mites.<eos> They like flesh as well.<eos> We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
Golden roses, indeed.<eos> Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.<eos> The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.<eos> Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.<eos> So you just let them take it?
The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.<eos> Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.<eos> So you just let them take it?<eos> For now.<eos> They won't be able to hold it.
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?<eos> How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.
How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.<eos> What did he call it?
Ah, stranger things have happened.<eos> Like what?<eos> The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.<eos> - The current harvest?<eos> - We have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the Reach.
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.<eos> They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.<eos> We must devise a way to raise their spirits.<eos> Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.<eos> My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
Cersei's on her list of names.<eos> Who else is on your list?<eos> Most of them are dead already.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Littlefinger gave it to me.
I meant what I said.<eos> I'm not here to put men in chains.<eos> If that becomes an option, many will take it.<eos> I gave them a choice.<eos> They made it.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.<eos> But you are back.<eos> And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
Aye.<eos> You did.<eos> Funny old life.<eos> Alright then.<eos> - Where did she get it?
Killer knew his way around a blade.<eos> Hit this kid's bleeders.<eos> You must know the move... Two cuts across the neck down the shoulder.<eos> Serious move, brother.<eos> Ever try it for real?
Mamacita.<eos> - I like him for it.<eos> - No doubt.<eos> Think he still has the weapon?<eos> If he does, he bleached it.
C'mere.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look for the brightest object in the sky above the moon.<eos> Oh, yeah, I see it.
At the interview they asked me if I could be any type of animal, what kind of animal would I be?<eos> How is that relevant for frozen yogurt?<eos> Are you wearing Tom's aftershave?<eos> Oh, I guess so.<eos> I just found it in the medicine cabinet.
You don't remember me?<eos> I'm your old student.<eos> Marius.<eos> Yeah, that... you told me that was the first trick you learned.<eos> Now I get halfway through a gag and can't finish it.
No more birthday parties. No more cake.<eos> Well...<eos> Right?<eos> No, my 11th birthday party, I did... I got cake.<eos> I just didn't get to eat it.
Sometimes you have to try to forget things, like my cousin Taylor, all right?<eos> The guy's always puttin' me down, making me feel like shit.<eos> Then he'd play it off, like he was just teasing or something, but no, he's an asshole.<eos> There was one time we were at this fair, all right?<eos> I go into the porta potty, and Taylor comes and he... he pushes it over...
The, uh, airport cops are hauling ass towards us.<eos> It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me. One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.<eos> Were you?<eos> I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond.<eos> I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down. There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home.
Memory can be very faulty, Noah. We all know that.<eos> I was there, and you weren't.<eos> Wasn't I?<eos> I don't know where that stuff came from.<eos> I didn't write it.
Vanessa says Jake's been out every night since election night.<eos> If we can figure out where he was going, maybe we can start to try to put the pieces together.<eos> The day Jenny was killed, I picked up the signal of a satellite phone near her cabin.<eos> She's around here somewhere.<eos> She actually bought a satellite phone, and she's using it.
I didn't pay Tom Larsen.<eos> - It was my...<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait for what?<eos> Your phone, give it to me.
I'm not thinking about it.<eos> You are.<eos> Don't lie, Red.<eos> I know the look.<eos> I've seen it on many, many faces.
She has a phone.<eos> I gave her one just in case.<eos> You can track it down, triangulate her signal.<eos> We can find Huck. We can bring him home.<eos> Her cell stopped sending signal hours ago which mean could mean she turned it off, but it could also mean it's damaged.
Think about it.<eos> We'll submit it again.<eos> Olivia, there wouldn't be any point.<eos> This bill, with this language...<eos> We've dressed it up a hundred different ways, and no one's biting.
- just like everybody else.<eos> - Come on. What could the two of you possibly disagree on?<eos> You know what we should show him?<eos> Our wedding album.<eos> Hon, can you go and grab it?
Is that my robe?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He said it feels like money.<eos> Just wash it when you're done.
You should have shopped Black Friday.<eos> Isn't that when all the best deals are done?<eos> That's what I keep telling him.<eos> So listen, your request for surveillance on the suspects in the Meadows caper...<eos> I can't do it.
My daughter has a way to save us.<eos> It's a device that my brother invented to keep humans safe while radiating the atmosphere with Kryptonite.<eos> It would've made the planet uninhabitable for both of you.<eos> Well, lucky my cousin put him in jail before he could make it work.<eos> And lucky for you, I found it.
No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.<eos> I just gave Supergirl the remote.<eos> Only she can turn it on.
You can't understand how wonderful it is.<eos>  I do.<eos> It's summer to me.<eos> Has been my whole life.<eos>  But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.
Well, I guess I'm not as tough as I thought.<eos> I barely made it to the lobby.<eos> Do you remember that day...<eos> I was walking you home from school, and it was garbage day, and we found this old TV on the side of the road?<eos> Yeah, and you tried to get me to smash it.
No, it's so Delaware.<eos> - And, yeah, of course.<eos> - Denise!<eos> Jane, this piece was your idea.<eos> I didn't even wanna do it.
I must say I'm just blown away that you were able to raise so much money so quickly.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'm gonna go buy a Splett shirt.<eos> Uh, sweatshirt.<eos> Yeah, that's what we call it in my family.
- I want to make a deal.<eos> No, guys, she... she's not sane.<eos> One small consolation is the bitch is with The Beast right now and I can't really see that going her way.<eos> Word as bond.<eos> I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it.
They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.<eos> Where's my cell phone?<eos> I have to call him.<eos> I haven't called him.<eos> Uh, I traded it.
Fred saw what the Protomolecule did to Eros.<eos> He wants to control it.<eos> It's too dangerous to leave our sample out there anymore.<eos> That is too important to destroy right now.<eos> We have to destroy it.
Even a friendly one, afraid that if we disobey, we will have our air cut off, our water rationed, be spaced, or be herded into chambers to be used like animals.<eos> This is the way it has been until now.<eos> No more.<eos> I have stolen your secret, Fred Johnson.<eos> And I am giving it to the Belt.

Hardly anything is evil, but most things are hungry.<eos> Hunger looks very like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery.<eos> Or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?<eos> So what is it and what was it doing on Earth?<eos> Well, there were scorch marks on the concrete where we found it.
When she realised her cousin was gravely ill, as a result of the insulin that you gave her, she called the night bell for assistance, only nobody came.<eos> Why?<eos> Why didn't you respond, Doctor?<eos> Was it because you and Nurse MacMahon had other more pressing things on your mind?<eos> It was because Clodagh switched it off.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Look forward to meeting you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fetched you a rabbit, Grandma.<eos> Oh, put it in the kitchen.
It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.<eos> It surfaced in the late 19th century when people started moving to big cities and living on top of each other in these massive apartment buildings, where night after night after night they had this shared experience where the tenants would hear their neighbors, like,<eos> by the thousands, come home after work, sit down, take off one shoe, drop it on the floor, right?
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be sure to set up the cameras, so you have a view<eos> - of the whole room. - Got it.<eos> And the only way you're gonna be able to hear us is with this earbud, but don't put it in until you're in the room.
It's natural, made from pine sap, but still pretty toxic.<eos> How long would it take to make another batch?<eos> Don't need to, I'll just bring the turpentine to you.<eos> It's not harmful to pregnant women, is it?<eos> Not unless I drink it.
This skull thing tried to grab me and pull me into wherever it was.<eos> And it almost killed you.<eos> I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.
Look what David is holding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot.<eos> He had a staff too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't promoted.<eos> Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that's bothering me.<eos> It was completely cracked up, as if it had been put back together by a lot of different pieces, and not one of all of these texts references anything like that.<eos> Yeah, something bothers me about it too.<eos> I mean, if it's as all-powerful as it's supposed to be and belonged to all the people it supposedly belonged to...<eos> Then how did this Zerstoerer guy get his grubby mitts on it?
Question... once it's ready, how do we get it on Zerstoerer?<eos> What about dipping bullets in it, like we did with the Siegbarste, remember?<eos> We shot him with that poison, and it worked.<eos> - I still have the gun.<eos> - Maybe we should bring it.
Since 'ee did bestow the cottage as a dwelling', not a meetin' house.<eos> I couldn't care less what you use it for as long as you don't stir up unrest in the village.<eos> We've had enough in recent years.<eos> We're looking for a little peace.<eos> In the Lord shall ye find it!
Wait there.<eos> - I've nothing to give you.<eos> - You gave me this.<eos> It's the most precious gift I've ever received.<eos> You never take it off.
What do Miss Morwenna say?<eos> I don't believe she's overly keen, but Mama said it's a great match, so I expect she'll come around soon enough.<eos> You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.<eos> No, Master Geoffrey, 'tis enough to have had your friendship.<eos> You can open it later if you'd rather.

No, I th-I thought angels couldn't die.<eos> - He's dead.<eos> - All right.<eos> Anyway, you guys were right.<eos> You said word would get out about Genesis and the bad men would want it for themselves.
But I wasn't that mad, you know?<eos> He was always throwing up and falling off of things.<eos> I wasn't that mad 'cause... he wore a suit and tie.<eos> I don't know where it came from.<eos> Lord knows I never saw it again after, but, um... that day... he wore a suit and tie... for me.
Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms.<eos> I'm not taking it.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - Just listen to me.<eos> When I was on trial, I said that I was given a gift and I threw it away.
My ex-husband installed it.<eos> It was one of the startups that he was investing in.<eos> Do you know your OffKey security user name and password?<eos> Yes. It's... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God.<eos> Tom changed it every seven days.
Come on.<eos> You said I had the right to remain silent.<eos> Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> No. But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table. Open it up, please, right now.
Get out of here, ya freaks.<eos> You don't know what you're missing out on.<eos> That suit was so formfitting.<eos> Be bloody hard to get out off, I'd imagine, huh?<eos> Unless he never takes it off.
It's like you can't tickle yourself, can you?<eos> You need someone else to do it or it doesn't work, someone outside your own nervous system.<eos> - Is this going somewhere, Toni?<eos> - Yeah, sorry.<eos> OK, so I'm with this girl, she's gorgeous, and she's inspecting my dick, she's twirling it around, she's flicking it back and forth, and so I slip my hand up her leg, and, er, I get to her panties,
- What's there to say?<eos> He's a liar.<eos> There are other things.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.
I'm very worried.<eos> - All right, where's your child?<eos> - No, no, it's a baby.<eos> OK, where's your baby?<eos> I can't... I can't remember where I've left it.
Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.<eos> Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.<eos> And the baby?<eos> She lost it?<eos> - Did they find it?
We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...<eos> half an hour ago.<eos> Then I ate it.
I am... ill-equipped to be a king.<eos> I am no better equipped to teach one.<eos> Being an adult is recognizing your responsibilities.<eos> A bunch of my students went and conquered another world.<eos> They more, like, gave it to us.
We weren't her friends, remember?<eos> We owe it to her... because we weren't her friends.<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We're magicians.<eos> Let's build it ourselves.
Drivers getting angry at sharing the road with his bike?<eos> I-I remember a few days ago, I think it was last wednesday.<eos> Yeah, it was last wednesday.<eos> Will said he felt like this car was following him.<eos> He said he saw it a few times...
- We're looking for Quinn.<eos> Why? What happened?<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> Somebody disabled her phone and we can't trace it.
All right, man, look.<eos> The... the lady dropped her key.<eos> - Her key?<eos> - That's right, man, her key.<eos> And I... and I went after her to give it back.
- Ping his phone.<eos> The number he gave me is out of service, but I got an address off his license.<eos> 3942 Wyoming Street.<eos> Get a warrant.<eos> Let's hit it.
I fear he does not merit the trust His Majesty places in him.<eos> Sire.<eos> Do you know the best way to subdue a wild horse?<eos> The whip, Sire?<eos> Put it to pasture with a tame one.
The refrigerator is broken.<eos> The ice cream is melting.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Is it because it's warm?<eos> Fine, I'll call the repairman, and he'll come here and fix it posthaste.
We could all take a page from his book.<eos> That yogurt is expired.<eos> See?<eos> This could've killed me.<eos> Now I can give it to Erlich.
There is something lodged in the rectum.<eos> What is that, a gun?<eos> He says he has no idea how the gun got up there.Nt.<eos> All right, what are our options?<eos> It's not gonna be easy getting it out.
We'll have to put the procedure on hold.<eos> Why?<eos> Our patient just confessed to a crime.<eos> That means the gun is considered evidence.<eos> And since his father convinced him to withdraw consent, We'll have to secure a warrant to remove it.
Thank you, both.<eos> State's attorneys secured the warrant.<eos> We're a go.<eos> I don't believe that story rey's telling about the gun, Do you?<eos> About smuggling it into jail?
Not at all, we're just... We're just doing a visualization exercise.<eos> Again. Close your eyes again, ariel.<eos> And...<eos> Do you see your shield?<eos> Okay. Now keep describing it to me.
I'd say so.<eos> Most likely uti. It's common in paraplegics.<eos> Been down that road a few times.<eos> Life with a catheter, right?<eos> We made to need to replace it.
Good luck?<eos> Ethan, are you kidding?<eos> Nat, I've met combat vets who have been paralyzed.<eos> The feelings of inferiority can be overwhelming.<eos> If you told them a bottle of snake oil. Might help them walk again, They'd drink it every time.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son.<eos> They need to operate on him immediately.<eos> But it was promised to us!<eos> We've been waiting for it.<eos> Plus that man would want Dustin to have it.
Vijay, don't do this.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - He's not safe with her.<eos> - Jemma...<eos> Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Um, I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Won't be long before they find the other guys we ICE'd.<eos> What's the situation?<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.
What's the situation?<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.<eos> But the bad news...<eos> There's a squad of heavily armed mercs guarding it.
Probably a lot more than she's paying you.<eos> If you're making me an offer, get on with it.<eos> Looks like we got two choices here.<eos> Either I crush this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or...<eos> Or we could kill you and take it.
I don't know.<eos> Uh... This code is advanced.<eos> It's like fifth-generation syntax.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Every time I keep trying to alter it, it kicks me right back to the ...
We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> That was the whole point in giving it to him.<eos> Well, we need to get it back and destroy it.<eos> - If you'd given it to me ...
Though, to be honest, I'm starting to feel some tension, sexual and otherwise, so I was actually thinking about taking a shot, but I'm afraid it could go south.<eos> - You Americans, you talk too much.<eos> - It's our greatest flaw.<eos> Our unit has been made aware that an item was found on the premises.<eos> We have been sent to retrieve it.
You're in danger.<eos> I have so many memories of snow.<eos> My first time ice-skating on my neighbor's pond.<eos> A month stationed near the French Alps.<eos> But the truth is... this is the first time I've seen it.
See?<eos> Good as new.<eos> - And stronger, it seems.<eos> - I know what you did.<eos> You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine.
Got to be contraband.<eos> They busted my neighbor for a laptop last night.<eos> - The drone... it's in my bag.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna take it back myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
Daddy!<eos> She's just a kid!<eos> Let her go!<eos> No!<eos> The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it.
You have my word.<eos> Excellent. I am eager to put a knife through agent coulson's throat.<eos> And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D.... We have located the two agents threatening the framework.<eos> They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.<eos> Once we get a lock-on, my men have orders to shoot it down.
- ... lifted?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We have located the two agents threatening the Framework.<eos> They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.<eos> Once we get a lock on it, my men have orders to shoot it down.
My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.<eos> So do what you want to this body.<eos> My plan is in motion.<eos> And nothing can stop it now.
Slow down.<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
It's started again with Paul.<eos> The Adam hating?<eos> He doesn't want to kill him any more, which I'm seeing as progress, but...<eos> It's just cos the baby's getting closer.<eos> Maybe Paul is worried about how he's going to feel when he sees it.
The Adam hating?<eos> He doesn't want to kill him any more, which I'm seeing as progress, but...<eos> It's just cos the baby's getting closer.<eos> Maybe Paul is worried about how he's going to feel when he sees it.<eos> He'll love it.
Most of the time.<eos> He could be arrogant, especially with a beer inside him, and, of course, he was a City fan, so...<eos> Yes, I liked him.<eos> We talked... .. about you, about the baby.<eos> He was looking forward to it.
Right, what do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> Like, who else was involved.<eos> All right, just take the gun out my face.<eos> I've got bleach and I will use it in your fucking eyes!
- Hey.<eos> - Oh, I'm glad to see you. - Yeah.<eos> - I gotta get this bag off.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can't take it.
No, not that I've noticed.<eos> - It'd be too early for any of that.<eos> Is the Putnam's cake ready?<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> I just need to wrap it up.
It's not going to be easy without your husband.<eos> Why don't you worry about your own husband?<eos> They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner.
What are you talking about?<eos> We had him guarantee to pay you what he promised and to hire you over there at the end of the quarter.<eos> - 'Cause I don't just want you to set that hearing,<eos> Look, it's up to you.<eos> You take the job and the money and you get me in or you stay on a sinking ship and wait for them to figure out that you're the one who sank it.
Because I didn't fly all the way down here to strong-arm that woman.<eos> And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.<eos> You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.
There's something clipped onto his rib.<eos> Good lord!<eos> There's wire attached.<eos> It runs underneath the skin.<eos> Follow it.
To ensure life and death remain separate.<eos> But if he crosses that bridge...<eos> He won't!<eos> And why not?<eos> Because I'm gonna destroy it.
It's all here. Um...<eos> Oxy, Percocet, speed, pregnancy tests.<eos> What's the ketamine for?<eos> Some of the guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies.<eos> But the girls use it, too.
Figure it out.<eos> What...<eos> What's in the package?<eos> I just know it's important.<eos> And don't open it either.
I'll come in a minute.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Where is the fan?<eos> - Right, I'm coming over.<eos> We'll find it.
I can't be expected to sit in this heat without a fan.<eos> And once there, I believe that you recovered the knife.<eos> And at the same time, you were still making a fuss, saying that you couldn't find what it was you were looking for.<eos> Where is the fan?<eos> Which then gave you, Judith, an excuse to go and help her - to find it.
- Not a thing.<eos> I'm sorry you had to reup.<eos> I know how much you hate being one of the good guys.<eos> I highly doubt those were the good guys.<eos> I finally got some dynamite and didn't even get to use it.
- It helps block out the smell.<eos> Try not to drop fag ash on my instruments tray, DI Bradfield.<eos> From the hypostasis and rigor examined on the body at the scene, I'd estimate she was killed between 6PM and midnight on Sunday the 13th of May.<eos> Cause of death, strangulation?<eos> The knot on the bra was tied so tight, I had to cut it.

Even when you disappeared, we carried on because that's what you wanted.<eos> No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.<eos> Now, my patience is wearing thin.<eos> Where's the spear fragment?<eos> In the same place you left it.
Ugh, pity.<eos> Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor, I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?<eos> As long as I live, you will never have it.
Dude, I can't...<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> All right.<eos> If there's a flaw in your suit that means the suit is faulty.<eos> Which means I have to go fix it.
No.<eos> - No?<eos> Why no?<eos> The White Martians infiltrated the reactor in the basement.<eos> And I need you to shut it down before the whole thing overloads.
They saved me, so I could save Henshaw.<eos> They forced me to keep him alive, to enhance him.<eos> Physically turn him into the monster he was beneath.<eos> It is strange seeing you in Henshaw's skin.<eos> I hope I've put it to good use.
Uh, okay, try toggling the switch next to the control yoke and that should put you back in manual control and then I can take it from there.<eos> - Two minutes.<eos> - Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down.
- Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I can slow it down.
- She's his insurance.<eos> - All right, people, let's get to work!<eos> Winn, any luck with Alex's subdermal tracker?<eos> No, it's been offline since 10:00 last night.<eos> Whoever took her must have found some way to power it down.
If my mother had given me pep talks like you, imagine the things I could've done.<eos> I'm happy to have mused you.<eos> But trust me, it isn't always easy being the parent we aspire to be.<eos> Shall we test it again?<eos> Let me just plug in the algorithm and fire it up.
What are you...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Thousands of Daxamites survived the destruction of our planet.<eos> They just needed a way to get here.<eos> Turn it off!
We both know that Winslow is not capable of keeping his mouth shut.<eos> It's my boyfriend and my best friend.<eos> Maybe the President and Alex are right.<eos> Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone.<eos> But all I think about is the fact that two people I love are trapped on that ship and if we destroy it...
- Time is wasting.<eos> - You said you have a plan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When Henshaw was at the Fortress of Solitude...<eos> Breaking in, stealing a deadly virus, and using it to kill aliens in this very bar.
It was easy.<eos> Do you know anything about audiovisual equipment?<eos> I can't get it to play.<eos> I know it works.<eos> I've played it before.
- I'm not going anywhere.<eos> - You'll do as I say.<eos> Temporal signature.<eos> Titan?<eos> We found it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please.<eos> Governors, we are running out of time.<eos> The fact that you are here at this emergency meeting on such short notice tells the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am.<eos> Terror is unacceptable.<eos> I do not accept it.
The greasy pole?<eos> Throwing things into little hoops?<eos> The hammer?<eos> I'm not entirely sure what that is -- but presumably you just need a hammer.<eos> And then you throw it.
I am more concerned about the style of the day than the actual events.<eos> For instance, I wish we had a starting pistol.<eos> The very thing!<eos> Why have you got that?<eos> Oh, I carry it all the time.
The very thing!<eos> Why have you got that?<eos> Oh, I carry it all the time.<eos> Careful with it, though, sir.<eos> Point it towards the ground when you're firing it.
Initially, I was very excited by him, but I'm getting rather bored of him now.<eos> His endless jazz and earnestness.<eos> Yes, jazz can be rather testing, can't it?<eos> Oh, I love jazz.<eos> Testing in a good way. I love it, too.
Maybe we should change them after we dump him?<eos> Yeah! Let's wear bedsheet togas and trip again.<eos> Mmm, yeah!<eos> Oh, yeah. And maybe we'll find the gun that way.<eos> 'Cause we'll go, like, full circle and remember where we put it.
But you ain't gotta worry about him.<eos> Kanan dead.<eos> I wouldn't have left a fucking gun at Truth... You know that!<eos> I told you, Angie's framing me!<eos> It doesn't matter who put it there.
Kanan dead.<eos> I wouldn't have left a fucking gun at Truth... You know that!<eos> I told you, Angie's framing me!<eos> It doesn't matter who put it there.<eos> What matters is that they found it.
That's right, you were on a boat.<eos> A refugee boat.<eos> It was sunk by terrorists.<eos> Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged, we couldn't save it.
Oh, Sam, you're breaking hearts left and right.<eos> Am I breaking yours, Mr. Daimler?<eos> What?<eos> Your heart.<eos> Am I breaking it?
When you close your eyes... do you dream of me?<eos> I don't dream at all.<eos> No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.<eos> I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.
- What?<eos> That's insane.<eos> Do you want to put the stone in the dagger and stab him with it?<eos> The dagger will allow Seth to enter his body.<eos> And then we obliterate it.
Ritchie, please!<eos> Stop while there's still time to save your soul.<eos> Says the man who skates away from everything.<eos> Since you got me infected,<eos> I've looked all around the world for a cure and I've finally found it.
It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.<eos> Think of the one place you've always wanted to see.<eos> Now find it in your mind's eye.
Apparently.<eos> Uh...<eos> Guys, you know, look, you try to be a nice guy, right?<eos> And treat everyone with respect, but you don't get it.<eos> You don't get it back in return.
I just wanna know if it's true.<eos> If what is true?<eos> I don't know who she's talking about!<eos> Where's your ring, Julia?<eos> How come you haven't been wearing it?
I don't know who she's talking about!<eos> Where's your ring, Julia?<eos> How come you haven't been wearing it?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I took it off to take a bath the other day and I thought I knew where I placed it.
Nowhere.<eos> I took it off to take a bath the other day and I thought I knew where I placed it.<eos> But...<eos> It's gotta be in the house, though.<eos> So, I've been looking for it.
Tell them your darkest secret.<eos> Because, if you tell them, and they decide they rather not know...<eos> You can't take it back.<eos> You can't unsay it.<eos> Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.
I know exactly where Jack Rabbit's Palace is.<eos> My dad, when I was a little kid, he took me to this place.<eos> It was near where our station used to be.<eos> It was our make-believe world, you know, where we made up stories.<eos> I was the one who named it Jack Rabbit's Palace.
I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.
'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.<eos> Back in the monastery, Brother Kuo would... harvest plums every summer to make wine.<eos> He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.
All the questionable shit we've done in the name of Rand...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.<eos> This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?
I was just a kid.<eos> "Child touched by fire." Isn't that how it goes?<eos> And now that child has grown up.<eos> And guilt is such an uncomfortable feeling, isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.
Ask for guidance.<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> That kinda thing.<eos> So the architect discovers a structure underneath his building.<eos> And whatever it is, it's bad enough that he dies trying to blow it up.

So the architect discovers a structure underneath his building.<eos> And whatever it is, it's bad enough that he dies trying to blow it up.<eos> Right, he wanted to destroy it.<eos> But he didn't want to blow it up.<eos> I think he wanted to collapse it down.
I mean, this is my life now. Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> Well, I should go.<eos> Hey, um... could you just help me with my necklace?<eos> I can never seem to get it off.
- They do this every year.<eos> - Well yeah.<eos> Birthday.<eos> My arrival in the world isn't something I feel like celebrating.<eos> Well, I feel like celebrating it.
I love you.<eos> Well done, big brother.<eos> Ring!<eos> Show me the ring.<eos> We're gonna choose it together.
Because.<eos> You want to stay safe in this place.<eos> You have to be able to see in the dark.<eos> Enjoy the sea, kiddo.<eos> We found it near the body.
Come on, now.<eos> Move, move!<eos> Get on there, quick. Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> Leave it!
You are jealous of the little Scotsman.<eos> No, Your Highness.<eos> Improve on the little Scotsman.<eos> A charge of negligence would be action against the Company.<eos> And Strange would be able to accommodate it or allocate blame as he chooses.
Beverly?<eos> Do you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Hawk.<eos> Electricity is humming.<eos> You hear it in the mountains and rivers.
Han, that's how the duck is prepared.<eos> It's not actually from Peking.<eos> Okay, you don't know that for sure, Spencer.<eos> Yes, I do because Peking is now Beijing.<eos> Well, then they should call it Beijing duck.
The car is here.<eos> Well, you're gonna send us a ton of photos, right?<eos> And don't forget to take pictures of all of your hotel rooms before you mess it up with all your stuff.<eos> There's this new group chat app that we should all be on.<eos> I'll text it to you.
I'll talk. - Right.<eos> Copy.<eos> Thanks, Bernie.<eos> Let's assume this is happening.<eos> I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
I wasn't noticeable.<eos> Not like you.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because that was my past.<eos> Because I took my past and I obliterated it.
Thank you.<eos> Next.<eos> So sorry.<eos> Can you take your seat?<eos> This lady is sitting in it.
- I found it lying around.<eos> - And he didn't say anything.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Yeah, how come?<eos> I just picked it up.
It's distributed on campus.<eos> Teachers were discussing this poem in class when they should have been getting help for the kid that wrote it.<eos> Okay, to be fair, this was published anonymously.<eos> Did anyone try to find out who wrote it?<eos> Or ask whoever it is that put it in there?
MR. PORTER:<eos> Hey, Ryan, thanks for coming in.<eos> I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?<eos> Someone slipped it into my locker last year.
I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?<eos> Someone slipped it into my locker last year.<eos> - Hmm. - Yeah, I thought it was well-written.<eos> So you didn't actually find it on campus.
Mother, I love you.<eos> Those are no longer just words.<eos> I want to hold you.<eos> I want to run in a stream.<eos> I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, - but really eat it. - What the fuck?
Worthless gew-gaws and baubles and tourist trinkets.<eos> It's horrible, cheap, foolish, ugly shit.<eos> - You try and sell shit.<eos> - I sell shit, yeah.<eos> And they will not buy it?
A-and thank you.<eos> May we?<eos> Could we have some privacy, please?<eos> I'm sure you can guess why I'm here.<eos> My deposition... you want to know why I didn't go through with it.
Hello?<eos> I need you to pull up that photo you sent me.<eos> What?<eos> The photo that you took of Evie.<eos> I need you to pull it up on your phone.
- Yes.<eos> - Is it here in this building?<eos> No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?
Do you know who I am?<eos> You're part of Long John Silver's resistance.<eos> I am Long John Silver.<eos> The resistance in the interior...<eos> I built it.
(cell phone beeps)<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> A picture of us from the party last night.<eos> Someone posted it on Chat Bandit.
Though I use that word cautiously in this post-Homo sensorium relativity of realities.<eos> What's E-Death?<eos> Supposedly something cooked up by the NSA and CIA...<eos> It's a redaction protocol.<eos> They use it when someone's been renditioned or black-sited and they want zero accountability.
Why don't you go walk the perimeter?<eos> Word out of Washington is that Rhoades' misconduct is being investigated.<eos> You somehow put that in motion?<eos> Look, when an enemy's down on the field, you got to finish him.<eos> If this investigation hurts him, we got to take it the rest of the way.
- Mr. President.<eos> - It's all right, Officer.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> May I have your scope?<eos> Scope on your gun. I promise I'll give it back.
Good question.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.
No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's see if he lives before you go thanking me too much.<eos> Looks like someone forgot to do laundry.<eos> You wanna move it to the side for me, cowboy?
Like a bird.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I don't hate my chair.<eos> I love it.<eos> For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.
Control, this is Station.<eos> Station for Control.<eos> The specimen's location is unknown.<eos> It is to be considered hostile and deadly.<eos> Our intent is to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol.
The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts, with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space.<eos> My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewall, so, please, honor them for giving everything to this cause.<eos> Mars life-forms should be considered hostile.<eos> Do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capabilities.<eos> Now, we did not learn how to restrain or eliminate it, but if this creature ever reaches Earth, use every available resource to destroy it, or you will risk all human life.
I guess the expensive doesn't like Virginia.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> This is a problem.<eos> You'll have to fix that wheel.<eos> We're gonna have to find it first.
Sorry!<eos> No, sorry. Sorry nothing.<eos> Let's go to the police.<eos> Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data.
Hello.<eos> Hello, you.<eos> - A ring.<eos> - An engagement ring.<eos> I bought it for both of us, from my savings.
What does that mean?<eos> I got a single word. That's it.<eos> Just, my benefactors I.D.'d themselves by a single word.<eos> Outis.<eos> I looked it up.
- What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too old-fashioned.<eos> - I've never really liked it. - So, change it.<eos> I can't just change it.
- I'm fine.<eos> - A pathologist with a weak stomach.<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> - What?<eos> Well, they were told to preserve the scene, not swarm all over it!
Oh, I can't believe you did all of this in three days.<eos> Am I reading this right -- did you get the rehearing moved up? Yeah.<eos> Those are three possible dates, pending your and Kevin's schedule.<eos> The soonest I could get is the 4th.<eos> You moved it up almost three weeks.
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
My God.<eos> Oliver, I told you... Nate's on it.<eos> Okay, but if he doesn't find him, I have another idea.<eos> Kiddie porn.<eos> I read that the Russians put it on their enemies' computers.
These people trusted you, Jimmy.<eos> Do you have any idea how much time I had to put in listening to their insipid ramblings about their sciatica or which grandchild disappoints them the most?<eos> Damn right they trust me.<eos> I worked my ass off earning their trust.<eos> Then you betrayed it.
See, you were trained to see Downworlders as your allies and that I'm your worst enemy.<eos> But I'm not asking you to do this for me.<eos> I'm asking for humanity.<eos> The answer's no.<eos> He just doesn't get it, does he?
You have to keep Clary away from that sword.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She's with Magnus.<eos> Luke and I are coming for it now.<eos> Just get to the power core. Shut it down.
For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?<eos> I've only seen it one time, and that was from a distance.
I think it was less than 48 hours later, organized a campaign to kick me out.<eos> Well, how was I supposed to know it wasn't a meth lab?<eos> You are... a force of nature.<eos> And, Sharon, there hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't woken up grateful for you, for your heart, and your wit, and your beauty, and your compassion.<eos> And Stef, I know I should've asked for your blessing before I popped the question, but I am... asking for it now.
I am the Green Arrow.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Really sorry about this, Sergeant. You're not here to secure the trigger.<eos> You're stealing it.<eos> Want to read your confession before you sign it?
Walker was headed for the hangar.<eos> Odds are that's where the nuke is.<eos> Felicity!<eos> Why the ruse?<eos> Why sell a nuclear weapon once when I can steal it back and sell it to another rebel sucker?
He's got tech that prevents a camera from capturing his image?<eos> Like those scarves that celebrities use to frustrate paparazzi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But here's the thing, if he's using a piece of tech...<eos> We can reverse engineer it.
The Rocinante and James Holden have gone silent.<eos> Along with Fred Johnson, and the Martian government.<eos> So we will just have to be insightful on our own.<eos> Where are we on the impact site mission?<eos> We've commandeered a civilian survey vessel and are refitting it with our best sensors and probes.
What is it to you?<eos> She didn't die in the Blitz.<eos> She transgressed.<eos> Crimes so heinous... ..that her name was struck from the family Bible.<eos> I can't quite make it out.
Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.<eos> "Legends of the Long Night."<eos> The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
Would I could give you some of mine.<eos> You've got gold?<eos> Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.
Iris, your mom, she left something behind.<eos> She left a brave, wonderful son and the woman that I love.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't know what the future holds, none of us do.<eos> I know that we will face it together.
You'll always have a home here, H.R.<eos> Listen, I know there's no coffee on your Earth 'cause of the whole Blight thing or whatever, but this... this is just an absurd amount of coffee you're bringing back to your Earth.<eos> That can't be legal.<eos> I mean, I won't tell if you won't.<eos> You know, for someone so fixated on enforcing the law, you sure seem oddly at ease about breaking it.
Nothing unusual.<eos> There must be a heightened point of necrosis somewhere.<eos> Look!<eos> We have less than 50 minutes before this corpse disintegrates into ash like the last one.<eos> - We need to find it now.
I... yeah, I...<eos> I don't... it was spontaneous.<eos> I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.<eos> Yo. There's a three-alarm fire in the Raab building.<eos> Fire department is evacuating it now.
But you have to live a little while longer.<eos> Long enough to see Iris die.<eos> The blade didn't hit your organs, but it did shatter your clavicle.<eos> Hang in there, man, hang in there.<eos> - We have to take it out.
But it's okay.<eos> You've got this.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Heart rate's increasing.<eos> Okay, I think I've got it.
Heart rate's increasing.<eos> Okay, I think I've got it.<eos> Great, pull it out.<eos> I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.<eos> Then turn it.
Sorry, Castiel.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> There's always a cure, and we will find it.
Now... I know... that a few dangerous reptiles can make you skeptical of the entire species.<eos> But, if you give them a chance... and you get to know them well enough to tell the dangerous from the good...<eos> I promise you... no harm will come to you in the Reptile Room.<eos> There is a type of situation which occurs all too often in the story of the Baudelaire orphans, called dramatic irony.<eos> Simply put, dramatic irony is when a person makes a remark, and someone who hears it knows something, which makes the remark have a different, usually unpleasant, meaning.
Can we talk about your disease for a moment?<eos> I'd like everybody here to be on the same page about it.<eos> Of course.<eos> It is sometimes referred to as EHS, electromagnetic hypersensitivity.<eos> I describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.
A significant fraction of the value of the New Mexico portion, but without paying for the rights themselves.<eos> So a kind of a payoff.<eos> Then you don't get hit with the taxes.<eos> You think you can make that fly?<eos> If someone came to me with this offer... I'd sure as hell take it.
I guess.<eos> How's the case going?<eos> You think he did it?<eos> Between you and me... he's kind of a kook.<eos> This is my first murder case, so as long as I just get it to trial, then it's good for my career.
Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove out to Sweetwater River for an early morning boat ride.<eos> Are you scared, Jason?<eos> The next thing we know happened for sure is that Dilton Doiley, who was leading Riverdale's Boy Scout Troop on a bird watching expedition, came upon Cheryl by the river's edge.<eos> Jason...<eos> Riverdale Police dragged Sweetwater River for Jason's body, but never found it.
You are only going to make things worse.<eos> The last time I saw Jason,<eos> I was wearing this dress.<eos> I know it's impossible.<eos> But I swear, when I put it on, it...
- God bless.<eos> - Wearing what?<eos> The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.
- Wearing what?<eos> The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.<eos> But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you.
The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.<eos> But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you.<eos> Or she'll likely come and snip it off your finger!
He... He proposed to me with that ring.<eos> So how does your mother have it?<eos> I...<eos> Hands off, Gollum.<eos> The only way your mom could have that ring is if she or your dad got it from Jason, and he wouldn't have given it up.
Nana Blossom's ring...<eos> It's not in my jewelry box, it's not with Polly.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It wasn't my fault, it was Polly's.<eos> She lunged at me, trying to get it, I didn't know what to do.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.<eos> Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.<eos> Tried to escape.<eos> And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.<eos> Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
Actually, Hiram and I have talked, and we'd like to buy you out.<eos> Fred.<eos> I've dragged you into a situation that you never wanted to be a part of.<eos> Make me an offer in writing.<eos> I'll consider it.
What do you think?<eos> Now, Zelda, where would you wear at thing like that?<eos> Well, that's the fun.<eos> you put the gown on, and then you're practically obligated to find an occasion worthy of the thing.<eos> Shall I try it on?
Josh?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The Garfinkel ring.<eos> But how did you... ?<eos> You told me you pawned it, so I went to the pawn shop on East Cameron...
Uh, see?<eos> It's a priceless family heirloom.<eos> He didn't buy you a ring?<eos> Yeah, he did buy it for me; he bought it back from the pawn shop that I sold it to, which is so sweet, 'cause he knew how much it meant to me.<eos> Well, I mean, if it meant that much to you, you probably wouldn't have pawned it.
Thank you so much.<eos> Just as soon as you say my name.<eos> What?<eos> Just say my name, you know.<eos> Pronounce it correctly.

No!<eos> That is some hippie dippy bull-crap right there.<eos> - What?<eos> - The paperweight.<eos> My father-in-law gave it to me for Christmas.
'But, no matter what science sought, our challenge remained the same -- 'to accept what it meant to be human.<eos> 'To embrace our strengths, our weaknesses, our dreams.'<eos> Walk, don't run.<eos> Another letter from Hong Kong.<eos> Don't you think you should open it?
Once we've seen the notes, we'll know what she knows, and then we can work out the best way to help.<eos> All right.<eos> How's your father?<eos> Pats, what did the letter say?<eos> I haven't had the chance to read it.
Pats, what did the letter say?<eos> I haven't had the chance to read it.<eos> - Then read it now.<eos> - I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Besides, if I ignore it, then it might all go away.
Kiddies need somewhere to play, and now they've demolished the reservoir there's proper grass there and a little hut where they sell ice creams.<eos> I remember Tom saying something about it.<eos> Isn't there going to be a grand opening?<eos> Well, an opening.<eos> The Mayor's on his holidays, so I wouldn't call it grand.
I feel stupid asking but when I ask the nurses, it's like it wouldn't do me any good to know.<eos> And it does do me good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> They say my milk will come in tomorrow.<eos> Then they'll have to dry it up using Epsom salts.
Sometimes the heart desires such very simple things.<eos> The heart holds within it all that is most precious, all that we must protect.<eos> Ready... steady...<eos> But it is also braver and bolder, more resilient than we realise.<eos> If we wound it, it will heal.
No, no.<eos> You're busy.<eos> Mending your dress.<eos> It's not a dress, it's my uniform.<eos> And I'm not mending it, I'm letting it out at the seams.
‐ We have to see what The Light asks!<eos> ‐ Doc!<eos> There is no fucking Light!<eos> We mark this sacred site, the place of Steve's transformation.<eos> We humbly thank The Light for making him one with it.
Ohh! It's so good to see you.<eos> ‐ Happy Birthday, Dad.<eos> ‐ Thanks, kid.<eos> Shall we?<eos> When Steve finished the word to us, When Steve finished the word to us, he was exhausted, be‐‐because to write the message was to live it.
Rita, you both deserve better.<eos> He fell for a fantasy.<eos> A cheap blonde on the make.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> Redemption is real, if you truly seek it.
What do they mean?<eos> They're the symbol of evil.<eos> Even in the Garden of Eden, evil lurks.<eos> After the fall, sinful man wraps his arms around evil.<eos> He embraces it.
One is my client Chayton Dockery.<eos> Audrey took his cash collateral.<eos> And when he comes for it tomorrow, let's just say, if she's lucky, she goes to prison and all of her assets will be seized and the sale of the house will be cancelled.<eos> Well, then she's dead, and you'll be dealing with Dockery.<eos> Now, if I were to get the money and put it in the safe, everything will be fine when Audrey opens it up for Dockery tomorrow.
More cauliflower, anyone?<eos> It's roasted in coconut oil.<eos> Hey, Sparky, your queen is dead, remember? Not anymore.<eos> I brought her back.<eos> I use it on everything.
He did that on his own.<eos> He chose being a celebrity over making a difference, over me.<eos> He's a politician, Liv.<eos> He needs the attention, validation.<eos> He wasn't getting it from you, so he went on TV to get it from America.
My Olivia would have marched through that door and shoved that petition down your throat.<eos> That's my Olivia!<eos> But she's not here anymore.<eos> So I'm here instead.<eos> It's me marching through that door, me shoving that petition down your throat, me demanding you sign it.
Charlie.<eos> Is this about something else?<eos> Do you think this is personal?<eos> Is it?<eos> Alex, you asked me for my medical opinion, and I gave it.
Now.<eos> All satellite maps of the island are blurred, but... Susan's compound is... down here.<eos> Boathouse... here.<eos> And the village is up here somewhere.<eos> They call it "Revival", but that's all I know.
How could you let that woman deceive you?<eos> I taught you to be a scientist.<eos> To question everything.<eos> No, what you taught me was to doubt myself.<eos> To look for validation elsewhere, so much that I was willing to take it from the first mentor that offered it to me.
In addition to the bombs that have already went off, these cellphone shells are an indication that there's at least 20 explosive devices planted somewhere around the city.<eos> - But where?<eos> - Doesn't Cristian's target, combined with what we know about the first bomb, indicate the pattern?<eos> There was blood on the radio and under it, meaning it was meant to be collected as evidence.<eos> If we had booked it, that radio would have ended up in one of our evidence lockers. It should've been brought here, where we would have kept it until we tried the murderer.
Well, don't wait up.<eos> Are you completely sure about that?<eos> You haven't seen this radio at your dad's before?<eos> Never.<eos> I don't know if he just bought it or what.
Large.<eos> Hey, do you know how they remove a cancerous testicle?<eos> No.<eos> A lot of people think that they just slice one off, right?<eos> What they really do is they make an incision just a little bit further up, and they go in and they grab the testicle, and they pull it out of the scrotum and out through the body.
Would you come with me?<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> God, yes.<eos> - I love this place, don't you?<eos> - Hate it. - Why?
Well, that's put my mind at rest.<eos> I suppose Morse told you.<eos> I asked him not to say anything.<eos> He gave me his word.<eos> He kept it.
They're coming in here.<eos> I don't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> Now move out of my way.<eos> There's a fugitive in that building.<eos> Take it down!
I can't explain anything that's been going on.<eos> I keep thinking I need to be carrying that stick.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - No.<eos> But it's like... you get used to carrying your weapon, and when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing - a piece of yourself.
What mirror?<eos> The hand mirror we used to show you when you changed into Renard.<eos> It was on the floor next to her, covered in blood.<eos> She obviously fell in it, but I don't know why it would be on the floor - unless she was looking at herself.<eos> - Well, she must've picked it up.
And you're just telling us this now?<eos> Well, it was the day we were going to the Gorge, and we didn't want to ruin your party.<eos> Do you have any idea what... it is or what the face means?<eos> Only that Eve said it looked like what was happening when she was in the Death Grip.<eos> Well... maybe she saw it again in the mirror last night.
Not as long as you help us.<eos> So how long have you had this mirror?<eos> Forever.<eos> It was my mom's.<eos> I remember my dad brought it here to the shop for me to play with when my mom was in the hospital.
Arrest him!<eos> - Where do you think you're going?<eos> - Away.<eos> You saw what that thing was.<eos> You think you can arrest it?
Maybe I did, but the truth is, I'm not ready either.<eos> What do you say we both act as interim managing partners?<eos> I'd be honored.<eos> It seems to me, the first order of business is, what are we gonna do about the name of the firm?<eos> I don't know about you, but... I think we should keep it exactly the same.
We don't give out that kind of money.<eos> a hell of a lot more than that.<eos> - And if I agree to this, you'll be right back here tomorrow, asking for more.<eos> - Look, I'm telling you, I can get her to agree to this.<eos> - And I am telling you, you've had your offer. That's all your gonna get, and if you don't take it right now, we're going to trial, and I am gonna wipe the floor with this kid.
- I'd say that's not possible, because she didn't.<eos> - Well, you've got documents, and I have one too.<eos> This is a copy of a certified letter from my client to the remaining tenants three weeks ago, stating that construction will begin, giving fair warning to the occupants.<eos> - Your honor, my client's never seen that.<eos> - Well, she might not have seen it, but she got it.

- Northern Virginia.<eos> And the Muslim dies.<eos> Call the bomb squad, he dies.<eos> We've got eyes on the building.<eos> He leaves it, he dies.
You are gonna have to think up a new tactic pretty soon, Because any day now, that "let's ask chief howard".<eos> Is just gonna be a thing of the past.<eos> Well, while we are still in the present...<eos> If major crimes insists on special treatment,<eos> Of course, you will get it.
- No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm so sorry, but I gotta put you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold... For your own good.<eos> What?<eos> Seventy-two hours?<eos> You wanted my attention, and now you have it.
No, no, please, look again.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No.<eos> Wh... You'll need a dc.<eos> If there's a room available, I can do it now.
A few years ago, He realized that rock faces weren't enough.<eos> He loved his life.<eos> It's not over.<eos> But his heart will fail again, won't it?<eos> If it does, I'll restart it.
She hasn't.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Five minutes ago, her heart wasn't beating.<eos> April... no.<eos> She wasn't trying to deliver it.
Fair point.<eos> Look, we're a team now, and I have a saying ... a tea...<eos> I read the motivational poster in the bathroom.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, um, the team trust has been eroded for both of us, but I'm hoping we can earn it back ... tackle problems together within the administrative structure and start ...
- You still make my favorite breakfast.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's because you don't eat breakfast if I'm not there to cook it.<eos> I thought you were gonna sell this place.<eos> I had a couple of offers, but I decided to take it off the market.
I'm trying to help people, Mack.<eos> I know you're not a bad person, Fitz, but this... gear has been used for some really bad things.<eos> You've got to think about the implications of what you create.<eos> Electricity is used to execute criminals.<eos> Does that mean we also shouldn't use it to power our hospitals?
Wrongs have been committed.<eos> Now we make them right ...<eos> together.<eos> You know, if Radcliffe is operating out of this facility, there may be some Framework hardware there.<eos> If I could tap into that directly, then... maybe I could find the key to shutting it down for good.
We'll change the world.<eos> Fitz, this is wrong.<eos> This... this is crimesagainst-humanity wrong.<eos> These are Inhumans.<eos> You've been a great asset, Skye, but unless I ask for your opinion... don't give it.
Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> That blue soap everyone uses?<eos> Hydra loads it up with chemicals.
I didn't think Fitz was capable of doing something like that.<eos> My dear.<eos> Depending on the circumstances, anyone is capable of anything.<eos> Just look around.<eos> Please tell me that you built a back door to this place and that aida hasn't destroyed it.
I could've changed my life that day.<eos> But it seemed like too much responsibility.<eos> I didn't want to shoulder it.<eos> But now I think maybe I should have.<eos> Well, when I got that offer, i took it.
You don't wait for a response before entering the boss's office?<eos> Partner, Mr. Anderson.<eos> Junior partner, Spencer.<eos> Hey, what do you think of all this NFL expansion talk?<eos> Well, I think it's a big opportunity for anybody to get their hands into it.
Stay there.<eos> I'm getting you a bag.<eos> Dog shit!<eos> - I ain't cleaning that up!<eos> - Scoop it! Scoop it now!
Well, Louis, Jessica isn't here, but I am.<eos> - Thank you, Harvey.<eos> - Don't thank me yet.<eos> You asked for a vote.<eos> You got it.
And we're not open to shit, because we were here first.<eos> Listen to me. I am trying to keep my cool.<eos> We don't care if you keep your cool or not.<eos> Because we've got you, and there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> So you can take your offer and shove it in a drawer along with that sorry excuse for a digital secretary, because neither one of them is ever gonna see the light of day.
Katrina, being a partner here will mean as much as it always has.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> I hope you came here to tell me you got everything straightened out.<eos> I came here to tell you that the deal's off the table.<eos> What? Name partner means something, and I can't just give it away to make a statement.
It's just in case. Okay?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Do you know how to use it?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> I know how to load it.
Yeah, a little.<eos> I know how to load it.<eos> Look, we need to be ready, all right, June?<eos> It's just in case.<eos> Then show me how to load it.
Lords knows, I have no desire to delay your release, so I've convinced Mikey here to tell the warden he fell down the stairs.<eos> So what?<eos> Ought to tell your dog to be more careful who he bites.<eos> Trust... that is so important to me, Clifford.<eos> Now, I've invested too much in this job to allow anything to derail it.
What is it?<eos> This gray spot here looks like an abscess caused by the bacteria from your STI.<eos> Does that mean I can't have babies?<eos> No, no, it's just a blockage right now.<eos> We can drain it and clear the tube with a minor procedure.
Well, Georgie, it's... it's been a pleasure.<eos> You can deliver this love letter yourself.<eos> This is no love letter.<eos> It's a battle strategy.<eos> I wanted to ensure my men would receive it in the event of my death.
Raymond.<eos> Just forget about history for once, all right?<eos> We're in the Age of Legend.<eos> Well, remember as Santayana once said.<eos> "Those who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat it."
Auxiliary power activated.<eos> He's gone!<eos> Lock-down mode initiated.<eos> Why are you putting us in lock-down?<eos> The only way to catch that thing is to trap it in here.
What is it?<eos> Okay, so I hacked into L-Corp CCTV to get a copy of the raw video footage of Lena taking the Kryptonite. It looks like somebody already hacked into this system a couple of days ago.<eos> I know this code.<eos> This is the same code the real Hank Henshaw used the day he broke into L-Corp to take the isotope.<eos> Okay, okay, if the video was corrupted by Henshaw's cyborg signature, then I can reverse that signature and decrypt it and separate the raw video file from the corrupted one.
Then we can strike.<eos> Marcus knows where his mom is, but he's gotta take us to her.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let him out of here.<eos> Mon-El's mother created some sort of device with Lena Luthor.<eos> She could set it off at any moment.
But I am going to see this through. I would do anything to get justice for Greg.<eos> Anything?<eos> Then you should clear his name and finally admit to being the mole.<eos> I won't confess to something I didn't do.<eos> You're talking about justice, but you won't do what it takes to get it?
Area equals C-squared Sine-A Sine-B over two-Sine-C.<eos> What is the differential equation?<eos> Herr Einstein, are you still too busy contemplating the secrets of the cosmos to solve this equation?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I-I've already solved it.
Solovine.<eos> I tell you what. I'll pay anyway, provided you submit to a change of venue.<eos> The previous occupant has done a garish rococo treatment, so I will spend a good chunk of my father's money scraping the fairy tale out of the place.<eos> Here's the wine.<eos> Now, where are the women to pour it over?
Like, not at all, so...<eos> Then... this morning, I watched Josh hide the ring<eos> - in our underwear drawer.<eos> - You saw the ring?<eos> Yeah, he actually didn't even check to see if I was in the room, he just, like, took it out, and I was right there, um, and then when he saw me he said, "Lucy, hey.
Remove your shirt.<eos> Hold the butter in your hand.<eos> Not the tray...<eos> The butter.<eos> Take it in your hand.
40 minutes, until the crime scene techs arrived.<eos> After being alone for 40 minutes you then oversaw the tech team as they collected Mr. St. Patrick's fingerprints and DNA?<eos> I did, as Special Agent in Charge.<eos> You also personally discovered the murder weapon at Truth nightclub?<eos> I collected it, and there were three other agents in that office with me.
Wait a minute.<eos> You know what, um... you guys stay right here. I'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing about the security at this school? I'm glad you're here.<eos> Actually, Mrs. St. Patrick...<eos> The paparazzi took pictures of Raina and put it in the "Post."
Your charges were dismissed because your ex-lover, AUSA Angela Valdes, fell on her sword and exposed her team for prosecutorial misconduct.<eos> Well actually, Olivia, AUSA Valdes found a piece of evidence proving my innocence, um, a piece of evidence that her team purposefully and, uh, apparently, uh, withheld, knowing that it would ruin their case against me.<eos> Tasha, I'm sure seeing AUSA Valdes on a regular basis must have been a painful reminder of your husband's affair.<eos> Why aren't you wearing your wedding ring?<eos> The truth is, I had to sell it in order to pay for our incredibly talented defense team.
Do you know what it means?<eos> What if your mom went away one day and there were no more finger sandwiches?<eos> What if the sky went dark and all the crops died?<eos> Would you know which plants were safe to eat and which ones will make you vomit till you're dead?<eos> Could you kill an animal and clean it without cutting the intestines?
We should really go to medical.<eos> Yeah, we go out there, they're all gonna kill us.<eos> The fun thing about wolfsbane is, it works from the outside in.<eos> Most people feel a little tingle in the fingertips first, as the smallest nerves are paralyzed.<eos> Then, it makes its way, ever so slowly, to your heart, closing around it like an icy fist.
This place can be so ugly that it's depressing.<eos> Well, if you want to make art so bad, why don't you do it out here?<eos> - Don't be a dick.<eos> - No, seriously.<eos> We got to make this place nice and fix it up.
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked."<eos> Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.<eos> You see, this is the thing about female prisoners.<eos> Men understand violence.<eos> They respect it.
You want money?<eos> I've had to move into some hovel on the edge of the village.<eos> It just isn't me, darling.<eos> My finances are tied up in this place.<eos> Then sell it!
I want to send a letter to the Kaiser confirming my devotion The best minds of German science, and I earnestly request you to sign it.<eos> Stand up for the defense of the homeland in the hour of need.<eos> Doctor Rathenau.<eos> Some all amuse themselves with a crazy thought, That scientists are instructed to unravel the riddles of the universe.<eos> And do not look for a new way to destroy it.
Like him.<eos> You know, just without all the holes.<eos> Can we see the photo?<eos> Sorry.<eos> My bro took it to the grave.
It was keyhole surgery in this hospital.<eos> -I was with him.<eos> -Oh, were you with him?<eos> Tara, that consent form is probably here.<eos> -Do you want me to get it?
You have a strong compliance department.<eos> I was hoping that you might put on an internal investigation.<eos> Make it look like you're responding to my pressure.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because, after a year or so, when your investigation is over, my office signs off on it.
I hoped that she would stand against her husband, and be loyal to her own House, York,<eos> but she likes King Henry more than I imagined that she could, and is obedient to him.<eos> My-Lady- the-King's-Mother?<eos> Her sole complaint with Henry would seem to be within the marriage bed,<eos> as she grumbles that his manhood rarely rises to occasion and even when it does, he tries to thrust it into the wrong...
And, before that, the lab of Dr. Alfonso Rezov.<eos> He was a friend of a cousin of a client, some sorta scientist, who needed help funding his various tech ventures, so tabor...<eos> So he took a bunch of his stuff as collateral.<eos> What do you know about the device?<eos> We took it from his lab while he was out so not much.
We need to find the others.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've been sending a modulated beam of tachyons into the rift.<eos> If it really is a connection between here and wherever they went, they should be able to detect it.
Uh, yes and no.<eos> When her stasis pod died, I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.<eos> Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.<eos> It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.<eos> So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.<eos> So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?<eos> Not at first.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I kept it on a separate storage device.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?<eos> Not at first.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I kept it on a separate storage device.<eos> And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
You know, Eddie wanted us to own something... Something that was just ours.<eos> I'm gonna try to take a second mortgage out on the house.<eos> It won't be everything that we need, but it could show a sign of good faith while we ask others to sacrifice.<eos> - What about this place?<eos> - We try to keep it.
You were right about that thing on Ganymede, ma'am.<eos> It was a weapons test.<eos> Me and my team and your marines too, we were caught in the middle.<eos> That test nearly triggered a system-wide war.<eos> The weapon's up for sale and Mars wants it.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper, Martian Marine Corps.<eos> I am requesting political asylum on Earth.<eos> You were right about that thing on Ganymede.<eos> It was a weapons test.<eos> The weapon's up for sale and Mars wants it.
Sweaty but ready.<eos> All right, can y'all folks lock up?<eos> I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.<eos> My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.<eos> I got to talk to him about removing it.
Well, unless, of course, it's Hoda and Kathie Lee over the last glass of chardonnay.<eos> That's RuPaul!<eos> From RuPaul's Drag Race!<eos> We love your show.<eos> We used to watch it through our neighbor Jeff's window.
This strange things they had done.<eos> Many believe it can protect the deceased, They are kept by the family.<eos> Soul in the picture was still there.<eos> And here it is ...<eos> I want you to try it.
White man who wrote your book left it all out, didn't he?<eos> - No.<eos> Doc acknowledged that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution.<eos> He didn't, but the...<eos> The Light did, and then The Light gave him the message, and he wrote it down.
- It should be bitter.<eos> - Someone must've stolen the medicine from your bag to poison the beer.<eos> Who can access your supply?<eos> In the surgery, only Annie and me.<eos> And the last time I took it out of my bag was when I went to your house to treat your dog.
Do you have anything that says "Grand Reopening"?<eos> I want to be naughty.<eos> But I get cold.<eos> I found your shoelace section, but where is the underwear?<eos> That is underwear, and you're holding it backwards.
Thanks for your help.<eos> Unless there's something wrong with the girl, unless it's the girl that the mist wouldn't touch.<eos> I didn't ask for your opinion.<eos> Too bad.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
Well, as a patient, that is your right.<eos> I will let the nursing staff know that you would like to consult with another surgeon.<eos> Have a namaste.<eos> Billy, the schedule is set.<eos> Yes, but you can un-set it.
He got me into Daedalus.<eos> The guy who wants to colonize the moon?<eos> Oh, he's more than just the moon guy.<eos> His software, RileyShare, was practically the birth of digital music distribution.<eos> Sold it for billions.
Wait, who's that guy?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> I got eyes on a shady-looking dude headed straight for the exit.<eos> Follow him, but don't engage.<eos> - We're on our way. - If you want the heart of a lion, you must first be willing to consume it.
And moving forward to our health section, we have a fantastic article about the best way to broach uncomfortable concerns with your gynecologist.<eos> I'd like to flag a concern about the word "punani."<eos> The article specifically says "Don't call it your punani."<eos> Understood, but in the past, we've been criticized by a small but very vocal Indian group who believes that the word has been unfairly misappropriated.<eos> I'd rather swap it out and avoid any kind of backlash.
Anyway, thanks, Steve.<eos> And, Kate, you better get home and get some kip.<eos> Look, wait, sir.<eos> Jackie's disappearance -- this was our case and it remains unsolved.<eos> We've got every right to reopen it.
But... All right?<eos> Here's the "but." He puts the wrong date in the machine, and he goes back in time instead to the 1950s, where she's just a horny teenager, and she spends the rest of the movie<eos> just trying to fuck him instead of his dad. Lookit, I've seen that movie.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I haven't made it.
And we are in the amniotic cavity.<eos> Okay, now we're in the abdomen of the acardiac twin.<eos> And coagulating intra-abdominal vessels.<eos> What happens to the tumor baby thing?<eos> You just suck it out or something?
- The memories.<eos> - The memories... exactly!<eos> Every time David sees this thing, or... or realizes it's there... this creature makes him forget.<eos> It rewrites his memory.<eos> Is that why we couldn't see it?
I'm a lot of things, kiddo.<eos> Brainiac mental patient, CEO/corporate terrorist, future-psychic gypsy pirate, but I ain't no squatter, bro.<eos> Okay?<eos> I own this place now.<eos> Took me forever to find it.
Okay?<eos> I own this place now.<eos> Took me forever to find it.<eos> It's complete shite.<eos> Why do you want it?
He had knowledge, opportunity, motive.<eos> He's protecting his brain business.<eos> Or Don E.<eos> He knew I had the cure.<eos> He was looking to sell it for big money to some high roller at the club.
Sure.<eos> So, that letter...<eos> - What?<eos> - The letter.<eos> When did you get it?
Pacification.<eos> I can see why my superiors required my presence here. Your camp is impressive.<eos> It's well hidden.<eos> And very well fortified.<eos> Even if you were to get out of here alive, you'll never find it again.
He died?<eos> He built this place with Cary 30 years ago.<eos> Before the Divisions.<eos> Before anyone knew ‭how fast the world would change.<eos> They built it, ‭and they went looking for people like you to fill it.
Or you can carry on. Torturing me, but you'd be no further ahead.<eos> In this game, you're only as good as your strongest asset.<eos> I can be that asset.<eos> My superiors didn't approve that arrangement.<eos> From the brigadefuhrer; why would they approve it from me?
What I found was a fallout shelter, built to sustain thousands.<eos> Salvation lies within.<eos> The radiation doesn't care if you're Trikru or Azgeda.<eos> Azgeda will never see the inside.<eos> What if we share it?
But seeing that there's no commander to rule us...<eos> War it is.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know you have the flame.<eos> I know Octavia gave it to you.
You really should try Ginny's Cheeseburger Chowder.<eos> The ground chuck and spices, the melted cheese.<eos> I highly recommend it for the inaugural balls.<eos> If you think you can maintain your immunity agreement by blackmailing the President-elect for allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Alexander Kirk, you're not as smart as everyone says you are.<eos> Marlin, your boss made a campaign promise to me, and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
I'm guessing the R stands for Raymond?<eos> I've never seen that letter before in my life.<eos> That is true.<eos> It came first thing this morning.<eos> I opened it, I read it and then I threw it away.
I got into one of the Sandstorm operative's phones.<eos> Okay, this guy right here, the one Roman "forked"... he texted Borden and 15 others late last night.<eos> But the message... it just looks like spam.<eos> It's in some kind of code.<eos> I tried running it against Patterson's system, but I got nowhere.
- Why?<eos> - No clue.<eos> DeLuca.<eos> DeLuca, wait!<eos> So, you called a meeting, and they ignored it?
Just stop it!<eos> You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery,"<eos> but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.
- Yeah. So, if I may, I would love to take you up on your offer, after all, and stay at your place, enjoy some good company, and get a good night's sleep.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Uh, t-tonight?<eos> If the offer hasn't expired.<eos> Yeah. Well, I mean, I have a date now, but I can cancel it.
- The topcoat, I know.<eos> - Want some water? - Mm.<eos> Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.
Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.
I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.<eos> He'd want you to have it, too.
We are dealing with people who are coming at us for the smallest infraction.<eos> So, how do we defend ourselves?<eos> Mere puffery.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I haven't used it since law school, but, hey.
Are you okay?<eos> Ma'am, this is an active crime scene.<eos> Oh, it's okay. I work in an office.<eos> Where's Rutger's firearm?<eos> For safety, I removed Detective Hiss' weapon and placed it in my back pocket.
Lucifer didn't tell you.<eos> We're all going back to Heaven.<eos> She's been acting very odd recently, on edge.<eos> This obsession with getting home is a bit much, don't you think?<eos> That's because only you, my Lightbringer, can ignite it.
Sweet.<eos> Guy was a straight up tool.<eos> This place looks familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> You cleaned it two months ago.
Yeah, and then they got married.<eos> Then they got pregnant, and then the kid has a tumor in her heart.<eos> I thought you had a TMR.<eos> Yeah, I thought you had a ventral hernia repair.<eos> I did, and I pushed it.
You want to hold that for me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Got a bunch of Band-Aids and a defibrillator and no splint, so I can shock you, but I can't splint your wrist.<eos> So probably gonna have to reset it, and then wrap it tight, and there's no good pain meds in here so this will hurt. Okay?
We searched it this afternoon.<eos> Trust me, I looked like a crazy person.<eos> Except to the Deacon.<eos> He knows I know.<eos> Okay, so, uh... so what do you think made him move it?
!<eos> There's a creature called a Grendel.<eos> He raided our village, carried our family and friends off into the darkness.<eos> I'm afraid my monster-slaying days are over.<eos> I made a promise to my son, and I intend to keep it.
Oh, my...<eos> - What? Do it.<eos> You have wards.<eos> The thing, it got to her.<eos> Just get it out of me, Kady.
The reason why Snart and I got on so well was we trusted one another.<eos> We were friends.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.
Coming through! Coming through!<eos> According to this map, Jesus' blood is somewhere over there.<eos> The spear is sensing the blood.<eos> We won't last five minutes out there.<eos> It's not too late to use it.
It was like I was a motel bedspread.<eos> You have got to get new photos, and if you can't relax with him, then you got to use somebody else.<eos> No.<eos> I can't fire Felix.<eos> I'm trying to erase my guilt, not add to it.
Mr. Weckler, you confessed to the murder of Roxanne Greer.<eos> And you were caught blackmailing TV personality Johnny frost.<eos> As long as you retain that memory card, a key piece of evidence, the potential for blackmail remains.<eos> Ms. Charles has offered a fair plea deal, James.<eos> I'm urging you to take it.
Exactly.<eos> This is all because of you.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> I've given you a bright future.<eos> I can take it away just as easily.
The show either has to evolve, or die.<eos> Fine!<eos> Then it should die!<eos> And without me, the BBC is going to die!<eos> And you're the one that killed it.
- I missed you!<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Come here!<eos> Your resignation letter.<eos> You were never going to send it.
Have you been busy today, father?<eos> Never too busy to help someone in need.<eos> Gabriel gave me all this equipment before he left.<eos> To make the reports for the next few months.<eos> He showed me how to use it, but...
Well, I'm sure you'll have lots of choices.<eos> So, listen, I need to tell you something.<eos> I have been offered a job with the World Council of Churches in Buenos Aires, running their interfaith mission.<eos> Buenos Aires?<eos> The offer just came out of the blue, and we're going to take it.
When people go to the grocery store, they tend to buy their favorite brands, right?<eos> It doesn't matter if they're in their own neighborhood or if on the other side of the country.<eos> People buy what they know.<eos> So you're saying our accomplice likes soy milk?<eos> Not just soy milk, this brand of soy milk. I saw her use it.
He's the defense lawyer she's up against in the Pulaski case.<eos> Well, Chantal's assistant admitted that Roy sweet-talked her into telling him when and where you were both meeting.<eos> Then, Gulbenkian flooded her office with paperwork so Chantal would be a no-show.<eos> It was a set-up.<eos> Chantal's probably the only female ADA up to speed on the case and qualified to run it.
- Overruled.<eos> But, Ms. Keane, I suggest you get to your point and some calamine lotion.<eos> Mr. Henderson, you claim to be an honest man, but in truth, your whole life has been a lie.<eos> Your name is not even Larry Henderson.<eos> Your birth name is Harrison Weeks, and you changed it after your mother mysteriously died when you were a boy, isn't that true?
I was wondering what would happen if I connected the sequence with Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.<eos> All right.<eos> That is a second year spell.<eos> I... I read ahead.<eos> More than that, you... you understood the theory behind the spell, and-- and you reshaped it.
Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You have far too much to do here.<eos> I had a vision, okay?<eos> A way that I can maybe help Julia.<eos> [sighs] I can't ignore it.
"My heart aches every hour we are apart.<eos> "When will we ever be together?"<eos> Something is wrong?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Your expression. I can't read it.
The sink's fine.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Ring went down the drain, got caught in the garbage disposal.<eos> I went to get it, but I got it, so...<eos> Well, what if you had lost it?
I'm listening.<eos> Ring went down the drain, got caught in the garbage disposal.<eos> I went to get it, but I got it, so...<eos> Well, what if you had lost it?<eos> I would have torn my trailer apart looking for it.
Ring went down the drain, got caught in the garbage disposal.<eos> I went to get it, but I got it, so...<eos> Well, what if you had lost it?<eos> I would have torn my trailer apart looking for it.<eos> But hypothetically... if you did lose it, what would happen?
"But it was the Father who sent his envoy, the serpent, to tempt his children and lead them astray."<eos> I haven't been to church in a while, but that doesn't sound familiar.<eos> That's because it doesn't exist.<eos> There is no Genesis 3:25, but this morning, one of my systems picked up the phrase "Genesis 3:25"<eos> over some chatter, and I was able to track it to a man named Jared Wisnewski.
- Was it... Positive?<eos> - No.<eos> It was real bad.<eos> - I made this saddle out of your sister.<eos> And now I'm going to put it on your back.
Are you all right?<eos> No!<eos> I'm at Dyad, Cos, what about you?<eos> What about your cure?<eos> Rachel administered it to me herself.
She's your family, she needs to know.<eos> I've been sick for a long time now, Sarah.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Cosima's working on a treatment, right now, she... she's testing it on herself.
- About 12 Monks there.<eos> Well, you have to admit, that's ever so clever.<eos> You see? Another way they hang on to power is to create a myth that they're here in greater numbers than they really are.<eos> The beam is stronger here, isn't it?<eos> I can almost hear it.
Sorry, what do you mean, it's his real name?<eos> Nobody knows the Doctor's real name.<eos> I do, because I grew up with him, and his real name is Doctor Who.<eos> Bill, she's just trying to wind you up.<eos> Chose it himself, you know, trying to sound mysterious.
Every second of it.<eos> Oh, the way you burn. Like a sun.<eos> Like a whole screaming world on fire.<eos> I remember that feeling, and I always will.<eos> And I will always miss it.
Does he have the box?<eos> I mean, what if this actually works?<eos> Yes, but be warned, he wants to try to reason with her.<eos> She was working on some sort of reversal spell.<eos> He thinks he can somehow finish it.
Eh? Okay...<eos> Well, my Egyptian Arabic is a little rusty.<eos> No, you'll... you'll be fine.<eos> Just whatever you do, don't let the mirror shatter.<eos> I've already enchanted it.
And... what would it mean?<eos> It means... that we loved each other for a while.<eos> How's...<eos> How's your shoulder?<eos> They said I'll only ever really feel it in the cold.
Oh, I have never been to the Baptiste estate before, Dwayne.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Yes, to think this is where the book actually takes place, you know, it really brings it to life, don't you think?<eos> Oh, yes, JP.<eos> I'm seeing it very much in a new light now.
- Oh, yes?<eos> Something interesting on Esther's laptop.<eos> A video file, recorded on Thursday.<eos> 'Lizzie, can you remember this poem?<eos> 'If we read it together, in the place where you wrote it, 'it might help you remember...'
We could use a few days.<eos> Germany, here we come.<eos> Estella taught me a new word.<eos> "Aw-veed-is-zanie." It means good-bye.<eos> You can use it.
- This place is deserted.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - Deserted don't mean safe.<eos> - Wait till we clear it.<eos> I'm about to clear it.
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch.<eos> I'm a lecturer, not a critic!<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> You're undeserving, just like the others.<eos> Yeah, you've looked after Elliot's heart well enough... but I'd like it back now, please.
Bye.<eos> So Martha's leaving the island?<eos> It's such a shame, sir.<eos> Yes, it's all rather disappointing.<eos> Nonetheless, a murder has been committed and we have a duty to solve it.
Anyway, he blew his brains out.<eos> Hey, sir, are you sure that your friend specifically killed himself because you didn't encourage him to pursue his dreams?<eos> That's...<eos> Uh, yes. In fact, he wrote a long letter, telling me it was all my fault.<eos> - I carry it with me wherever I go.
If I was my own man I'd tell him to consider what side he's on and play happy families.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You investigated the original case.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think we should shut it down, sir.
A few months before Alistair died there was an accident -- a fire at the plant.<eos> Guess who did the internal review?<eos> Tommy Norton.<eos> First thing he did as General Manager.<eos> Alistair signed it off.
Remember that.<eos> Sir?<eos> I've been looking over the Liddell inquiry.<eos> Speaking to Inspector Bacchus.<eos> We need to wrap it up.
And I sometimes wonder why you're still single.<eos> - Fair enough.<eos> - Yeah, we got married in turnout gear.<eos> So the ring needs to be a thing.<eos> I know what you're thinking, and whipped cream will not be a part of it.
To Casey and Dawson!<eos> - All right!<eos> Mmm. Oh, my God!<eos> - This is amazing.<eos> Aren't I supposed to smash it in your face or something?
- SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.<eos> - Do you read the paper, Sean?<eos> Billy got a byline on that three days ago.<eos> Declaration of war?<eos> Underwood was so evangelical, but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.
The next House vote is the day after tomorrow.<eos> The natives are restless, outraged, just plain scared, actually.<eos> They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.<eos> Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.<eos> See if you can connect Underwood to it.
Where is this intelligence coming from?<eos> Well, it's all there in the briefing.<eos> But if we know this is going to happen, well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?<eos> Francis held on to your resignation letter.<eos> And he wants to tear it up.
Or is it for some personal gain?<eos> Perhaps to try to fill the small hole in your soul that you sold off a long time ago?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> This is my opening statement, and I will give it in full.
Some of us like to cook, others would rather dust.<eos> Perhaps you'll join the soap makers.<eos> - You make soap? - Hm!<eos> Lovely soap.<eos> The great debate is whether to sell it on the outside.
Right.<eos> So, two chromosomes combine, then, a baby forms.<eos> I hope to fertilize an egg with two female chromosomes, ensuring a female baby.<eos> - All I need to do...<eos> - Is isolate a chromosome, find a suitable egg, fertilize it, and then re-implant it in a human womb, hoping that a normal gestation ensues.
He'd move heaven and earth to make it better.<eos> That's his job, isn't it?<eos> To make sure you're happy, at any cost?<eos> You're doing the face.<eos> Dad calls it your faraway face.
School, first job, driver's licence, voting register, first bank account.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I don't seem to have had your appraisal back from the Inspector.<eos> Er, er, no, we haven't done it yet, sir.
What happened?<eos> They went into a sleeping curse so I could save you.<eos> Emma...<eos> I was thinking.<eos> There might be another way to break it, but it's risky.
The video in question was recorded by an active duty sailor.<eos> It's property of the Navy.<eos> Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-council have the necessary security clearance to watch this video, much less possess it.<eos> We can't put the rain back in the sky.<eos> We didn't have any inkling of its contents before we watched it.
I got to say I did not see that coming.<eos> Chalk one up for the underdogs.<eos> Good news. The writ was denied.<eos> The video is in.<eos> Except you're not going to use it.
We think he shot the guy to death.<eos> In a warehouse that they co-own.<eos> Watson texted me from the scene.<eos> Police have been searching for hours, still can't find a murder weapon.<eos> We don't find it, a jury might actually believe the story he's peddling about "some black guy" killing the partner then fleeing.
Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it.<eos> Not yet, but they will.<eos> Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.
Agent Keen?<eos> Tell Reddington he's on his own.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Smoll's body's just been flagged by the CDC.<eos> They've rerouted it to a level 4 bio-containment lab.
Whatever happened, it went viral.<eos> Look at the number of viewers.<eos> 30,000 people have seen this?<eos> Only no one knows the guy's real name or where he was in New York when this happened.<eos> If he's dead, there's a murder scene out there, and no way to find it.
This is straight up homicide.<eos> It's ours.<eos> We've got people coming home from all over for the game.<eos> If this news gets out, it'll be pandemonium.<eos> Just examine the scene, then scrub it.
And he's looking for you too.<eos> So where are we with this murder-for-hire case, Sergeant?<eos> Donald Clark, yeah, well, we're just keeping him on the hook for now until we can shed some more light on who actually killed his daughter.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Well, we traced the murder weapon back to the guy who bought it.
I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession...<eos> I didn't actually hear it.
Maybe three seconds.<eos> So in a crowded room, after you'd been drinking and popping pills with music pumping and lights pulsating, you were really able to see and identify a ring on the finger of a stranger?<eos> I saw it.<eos> And his face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
And then you come and you give me a hard time.<eos> - I'm not giving you a hard time.<eos> - You know what? You say to me,<eos> "Riggs, you have to find happiness.<eos> I need... you need to have it."
I know these are not people who care who they hurt for a story.<eos> I know the press has been cruel to you, but it's not the right path.<eos> Is that your role in this, Nimah, poking holes in everyone else's theories without pitching any of your own?<eos> Not having a solution doesn't mean she's wrong.<eos> You still don't have it.
Hmm, I could have done this mission by myself.<eos> Controller, the rebel droid is attempting to access the network.<eos> Perfect.<eos> This means I can now extract the location of the rebel base from its memory.<eos> Capture it.
You sent Nimah to jail?<eos> I didn't want her to go, but we felt that it's safer for me like this.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want nothing to do with it.<eos> I barely got this assignment, and I'm not about to lose it because you can't play by the rules.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Kathy used to wear a crucifix?<eos> She did, her mum gave it to her.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> Did you find it in her things?
♪ Now she'll dream of could-have-beens ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, evil may be powerful ♪<eos> ♪ But wicked always... ♪<eos> Wait.<eos> Why just revel in her demise, when I can use it to my advantage?
I needed the creature's body.<eos> Living, dead,<eos> I don't give a shit. Because until we collect every last supernatural entity that you let in the Triangle, I am stuck in this "living anus" of a town.<eos> Willa's the Earp who let the riffraff in.<eos> I was the one who bitchslapped the tentacle, slid back across the line, and sliced it like deli meat.

Well, you don't, which means you're very good at your job, and so am I.<eos> I'm a media consultant with a very deep client list.<eos> Including a major pharma company that would currently love to squash a fledgling competitor...<eos> PhioGen.<eos> A false story about the negative side effects of PhioGen's new epilepsy drug could kill it before it even gets to the market.
I was trying to be less impetuous.<eos> Well, I'm a good soldier.<eos> I follow my orders.<eos> You needed time.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
Look, I know Dad talked to you, and I'm sure everyone's talked to you by now, but when are you going to admit you're wasting your talent?<eos> I'm not wasting anything.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know, a lot of people make it in patrol, but very few could solve a murder.<eos> I didn't solve it.
She was a human being.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where did she get some goo?<eos> Come.<eos> OK, so I found this compound that shocks the nervous system, right? It makes the demon think it's in a dying body, and then it abandons it.
And yes, that includes you three, or rather... four.<eos> Or is that what you want?<eos> Dolls?<eos> He's right.<eos> The spell's irreversible if the caster dies without lifting it.
A sweet little old woman, whom we affectionately called "Oldie."<eos> Oldie was the closest thing we ever had to a mom.<eos> So that ring is very special to us.<eos> - Aw.<eos> - When we left the orphanage, we hid it... inside a big oak tree in these woods, promising each other that the first one of us to find true love, would be able to give that special someone the ring.
Seven years now.<eos> Met him at that same gun range.<eos> Why do you hate me?<eos> Stuart, what is up with the system?<eos> An OS update came out. I installed it on half the computers last night.
- Well, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Alas, we are not cowabunga people.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> - Once again, I am so sorry about your tire.<eos> Just accidentally slashed it with my knife.
- in under a minute? - Yes, I've seen it happen.<eos> - Lucky.<eos> - So why don't you both come back tomorrow and we can start working this together?<eos> And, who knows, if you find the guy, I got an open spot on my squad. Maybe one of you could fill it.<eos> - Or maybe one of us could fill it.
Man, I gotta warn Trexler Dutch wants to kill him.<eos> Mainly because Trexler hasn't paid me for my work yet, but... also because... say what you will about der robotik ubermenschen.<eos> Sure can punch good.<eos> I'm sorry, darlin', but you're gonna have to repeat that.<eos> I said, "I had a little towel, "but I lost it walking here, so I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle."
Whaaat?<eos> Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.<eos> The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.<eos> Same with an egg.<eos> Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole.
- Do I know you, friend?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> Now, you tie that ring to this thread.<eos> And once I have it, I will throw you down a rope.
Hey! Wynonna, your condition.<eos> That's not what this is about.<eos> Give me the ring.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I was destined to have it.
That means that anything that has to do with the curse is mine.<eos> That ring included.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - I know so.<eos> Then come and get it.
I never broke.<eos> Never told her a thing.<eos> Why do you think I chose you to hold the ring?<eos> Yeah. It's safe and sound in my coffee cup at the station.<eos> You hid it where now?
He just died! I need Mike to drop that case.<eos> You telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> It's one pro Bono.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
Okay, I see your point.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I have another case that requires some procedure to be catalogued, and I put it aside especially for you.<eos> But Stephanie, I want your word that you won't pawn it off on Jason.
Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> About what?<eos> About the fact that I'm pissed off.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she handed it off.
It's one pro bono.<eos> He just took it.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> I gave him my word.<eos> And you once gave your word to me and went back on it and I let it go.
Actually, I do mind.<eos> Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm speaking to you.<eos> It doesn't matter what year you are.<eos> I'm head of the associates.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
- I don't know, Harvey.<eos> I don't have time to track your former secretary's every damn move.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you? I'll tell you what's wrong with me.<eos> Masterson Construction's pissed about this prison case.<eos> You handed it off like they asked.
Is it true, what happened in court today?<eos> - Yes, but it's only a setback.<eos> - Setback?<eos> They said they threw out the whole case. No. They didn't throw it out.<eos> They just threw us off of it.
- Setback?<eos> They said they threw out the whole case. No. They didn't throw it out.<eos> They just threw us off of it.<eos> What the hell's the difference?<eos> The difference is it's a good case, and somebody else can still take it. - We just have to...
From what?<eos> Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.<eos> Like dormammu.<eos> Where did you learn that name?<eos> I just read it in the book of cagliostro.
Breaking the laws of nature.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, don't stop now.<eos> When the sanctum's restored, they'll attack it again.<eos> We've got to defend it.
We look good.<eos> What is that?<eos> Looks like one of those things that makes cotton candy.<eos> It's a PKE meter.<eos> There's a ghost anywhere around here, this baby's gonna find it.
-Yeah.<eos> -Yeah, I've seen a ghost.<eos> -You, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you be able to describe it to us?
-So it's hard to put the cat back in.<eos> -It's not impossible.<eos> -But that's why they have that saying.<eos> -It's a nonsense saying.<eos> If the cat is outta the bag, you can't put it back in!
We're wonderin' about you.<eos> Tell me about yourself. Come on, now.<eos> I came back to...<eos> Years ago, I made a promise.<eos> I broke it.
Tell me about yourself. Come on, now.<eos> I came back to...<eos> Years ago, I made a promise.<eos> I broke it.<eos> I broke it 1,000 times.
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.<eos> And where is this witch?<eos> In my pocket.<eos> Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.<eos> Some say the witch has a secret buried heart, and whoever finds it can control the witch.
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer... and there were all these new experimental drugs from Germany.<eos> Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm memorizing the details of her face.<eos> Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
That your children have no use for you.<eos> You wish only to be with your husband.<eos> And yet, I'm not burying you today.<eos> There comes a time in man's search for meaning, when one realizes that there are no answers.<eos> And when you come to that horrible, unavoidable realization, you accept it or you kill yourself.
Clock's ticking, we gotta get out of here.<eos> Stand by for a broadcast from the United States government.<eos> I understand that many people around the world... are tuning into this channel on their shortwave radios.<eos> To you out there and here at home... make no mistake, this is humanity's last stand.<eos> What we do in the next 12 minutes... will either define the human race or finish it.
Get out there!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Now, where's Mike?<eos> I demand retribution!<eos> You're gonna get it, Mike.
I told myself that spending $100 on a trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time to an event that I thought was silly in the first place, was...<eos> - Wasteful.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But Vera Wang made this black, strapless classic.<eos> It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.
- I can't.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Come on. Come on. Come with us.<eos> Damn wheel's busted.<eos> I can't fix it!
The weapon is their language.<eos> They gave it all to us.<eos> Do you understand what that means?<eos> So we can learn Heptapod, if we survive.<eos> If you learn it, when you really learn it, you begin to perceive time the way that they do.
How it looks? All right.<eos> It has fallen.<eos> Let's put it on my neck.<eos> Should we make a necklace of daisies?<eos> What if I put it in your head?
- Really?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> It's been put in a trust.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means no one can sell it.
You'll always be my brother.<eos> Everything I own is yours. No!<eos> Everyt... I'll never have your name.<eos> And every time my name is spoken, it will be spoken alongside stories of my grandfather.<eos> Until I earn it back.
Well...<eos> In the Fabonan culture this surrendal weapon... Is an offer of truth.<eos> How did they come by it?<eos> They told me, they acquired it long time ago.<eos> So they stole it, then!
He needs a distribution system.<eos> Circulating area, right?<eos> Ay, sir.<eos> There's a atmospheric regulator core.<eos> Lieutenant, contact Yorktown... Make sure they shut it down before it finds Krall.
Kapow!<eos> Lose the scarf.<eos> The scarf?<eos> Why?<eos> If you're going to wear a dress like that, Clark, you have to wear it with confidence.
Wars can end.<eos> People can be different.<eos> That's the secret.<eos> We all can change.<eos> You just have to take the empty space and turn it into gold.
I'm gonna go up there and come back with some answers about the A/C and the food and the Wi-Fi.<eos> And at least some semblance of a timeline.<eos> Wow, Alan, where's all this bluster coming from?<eos> I don't know, Rachel.<eos> But I promise to utilize it to everyone's advantage.
Slow it down. Tranquilize it!<eos> - Hey! Stop. - Shoot it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop! You're killing him!<eos> Scrape it up.
Banning.<eos> That all they got?<eos> Kind Of looks like it.<eos> Lieutenant, this could be the missing link to Barkawi.<eos> I'll get it to Box Command right away.
Really?<eos> Anything?<eos> Anything that can be cured if mixed by the right apothecary.<eos> The apothecary wanted the yew tree very badly.<eos> But in order to harvest these things, he would have to cut it down.
Is that the, uh, Citizen?<eos> Come here. Let me see it.<eos> Fifty-eight to fifty-six.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I respect their decision... but in all conscience, I can't be the one to carry it out.
What are you doing?<eos> Escaping!<eos> The heart!<eos> Forget it!<eos> You'll never get it back!
So, this is gonna be a standard "blue-dye" procedure, blue dye being...<eos> I know what a "blue-dye" is.<eos> Tonight, you will receive a telephone call at exactly 2307. Repeat the time, Wing Commander.<eos> 2307, sir.<eos> You will take the call and you will write down a message somewhere your wife can read it.
And I'm... And I'm so sorry.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Did you send it?<eos> The message!<eos> Did you send it?
Look, if I caught this trail, others will, too.<eos> Okay, you gotta get your shit in order. Just listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The entire case rests on this.<eos> We have a case here, and we're gonna win it.
Mia, you're closing Friday.<eos> I can't close on Friday.<eos> I have an audition,<eos> - remember? - Do I look like I care?<eos> We schedule it.
No bed, lung ventilation equipment stolen, X-rays and clinical record also disappeared.<eos> As if there hadn't been such patient in our facility.<eos> I've read this in the report, you tell me something I don't know.<eos> When we were X-raying her spinal cord, we found an external object in her stomach.<eos> We conducted a gastroscopy and extracted it from there.
I'm sorry.<eos> Not he, she.<eos> Yes, I suppose.<eos> Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.<eos> I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.
It cannot be true, Holmes. - It cannot.<eos> - No, it can't.<eos> It's called Pepper's Ghost.<eos> A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.<eos> Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.
There's something else.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I wished I were dead.<eos> And if I'd kept my eyes shut, I could have almost touched the edges of oblivion.<eos> But I'd made a promise and had to keep it.
No.<eos> You have had an extraordinary adventure, Claire.<eos> Extraordinary.<eos> One that few people could even imagine.<eos> Treasure it.
Like he's here.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here, and I'm not going away.<eos> You're a hard one to get rid of, that's for sure.<eos> I'm stubborn, just like my husband.<eos> Now... let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.
You're having some differences of opinion.<eos> We're deadlocked.<eos> No you're not.<eos> I don't like that word.<eos> I'm not going to let you use it.
It was a homicide.<eos> - Don't pull this bullshit on me.<eos> I allow Cincinnati PD to fully partake in my investigations, but at the end of the day, don't make the mistake.<eos> That money says federal reserve now.<eos> Well, you didn't do a very good job of reserving it.
Unfortunately, for them.<eos> You're going to want to see this for yourself.<eos> So what are you going to do now?<eos> This place used to be the jewel of the Belt.<eos> I wish I could've seen it in its heyday.
Yes, so, I don't have the time anymore.<eos> Well, this isn't that surprising, right?<eos> Yes, not really.<eos> And what do I do with the piano now?<eos> I bought it just for you.
Tomorrow, clean slate.<eos> End of all of this shit.<eos> So can I just ask you, and I want you to be frank 'cause I really do respect you.<eos> I mean, do you think people can change?<eos> I mean, like, if your behavior's one way, that you can, like, alter it?
Carl Mørck.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> I have a new case for Department Q.<eos> It's a message in a bottle.<eos> You might be the only ones who can solve it.
And...<eos> And no one would enjoy seeing you triumph here more than I, obviously.<eos> But this place is just... it's so big, you know.<eos> It's nearly a thousand, three thousand people.<eos> Well, Lily Pons's voice filled it. She's just a little bird.
Unfortunately, that was the implication.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> Another day and baby would've been seriously dehydrated.<eos> I'm sorry, Sister, but you have such influence.<eos> Please take care how you use it.
You know you can stay here for as long as you want.<eos> I didn't ask to take up the investigation.<eos> I just followed orders.<eos> The investigation is not closed yet.<eos> You started it and you have to end it.
Couldn't leave this place lookin' so bad.<eos> That was the thing about Pops.<eos> He had a lot of pride in detail.<eos> Like that gold leaf window with the Pop's Barber Shop logo?<eos> [chuckles] I polished it every day.
You need to get my daddy's ring back.<eos> You remember what he was like before he got strung out?<eos> Eddie's a good dude deep down.<eos> To me, what's left of him is that ring.<eos> The only reason why he didn't pawn it is because I took it away from him.
[breathing heavily]<eos> So that's why you became a cop?<eos> I apply foot to ass, and match lead for lead.<eos> I put murderers in handcuffs.<eos> I don't just seek justice, I stalk it.
But his real son... was Carl Lucas.<eos> But... here's the crazy thing.<eos> Nobody said nothing.<eos> And Carl and I... we grew up best friends, but... there was all this tension.<eos> You could just feel it like a draft coming in from under a door.
My name is Nathan.<eos> And you can't stop someone who can stop time.<eos> Time travel-- it's a bitch.<eos> The future we're standing in exists only because the H.E.L.E. happened.<eos> The moment you go back and stop it, all of this-- all of us-- will cease to exist.
Never forget that.<eos> My ancient Druid's a little rusty.<eos> Maybe you can fill me in.<eos> "When the Ellcrys comes to the end of its days, "a flower will bloom "that will bear a single seed.<eos> "A member of the Chosen "must carry that seed to Safehold "and immerse it in the Bloodfire.
Oh, Teddy.<eos> You're a low-down son of a bitch.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we both believe the same thing.<eos> No matter how dirty the business, do it well.
Is that OK?<eos> Ahh, yeah, of course.<eos> Eh, what happened to your coat?<eos> I left it in Chloe's car yesterday.<eos> She hasn't dropped it off, has she?
It moves slowly for it's size.<eos> It can trample through Tokyo in 3 hours.<eos> The city is dense and brittle.<eos> We're looking at enormous damage.<eos> We must exterminate it now!
It's legal in the State of Massachusetts.<eos> If you have a grower's permit.<eos> Do you have yours handy, Charlie?<eos> No, I ... look, I got a friend.<eos> He was gonna get it to me.
What bad lu...<eos> I've never heard of that before.<eos> Yeah, I'm not aware of that superstition, either.<eos> Yeah, it's bad luck.<eos> You have to let your mother try it on first.
Sneaky, Ma.<eos> - I like that.<eos> Rizzoli.<eos> - Isles.<eos> - Give it to me.
- I've got something!<eos> - Hang on a second.<eos> Contact.<eos> We've got another device.<eos> Don't move until he's flagged it.
I would never hurt any of you guys.<eos> This gun's for me.<eos> No, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> Things will get better.<eos> You should just toss it out the window.
But why ask?<eos> There's no legal purpose for it.<eos> But Mr. Cochran and the defense have a purpose for entering this area, and that purpose is to inflame the passions of the jury and ask them to pick sides.<eos> The-the "N" word is a dirty, filthy word, Your Honor.<eos> It is so prejudicial and inflammatory that the use of it in any situation will evoke an emotional response from any African-American.
My lord.<eos> My lord.<eos> My friends, the hour has come.<eos> Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children.<eos> But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came.
I need your word.<eos> If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.<eos> You have my word.<eos> You have until nightfall.<eos> You gave it to me for a purpose.
Never forget that.<eos> My ancient Druid's a little rusty.<eos> Maybe you can fill me in.<eos> "When the Ellcrys comes to the end of its days, "a flower will bloom "that will bear a single seed.<eos> "A member of the Chosen "must carry that seed to Safehold "and immerse it in the Bloodfire.
A greater purpose.<eos> Yeah, and if you're wrong?<eos> The events leading us to this moment have been unfurling for centuries.<eos> Wil lies here because he has yet to reconcile who he is with who the Stones already know him to be.<eos> You ran the Gauntlet trying to find your place in life and yet destiny had already found it for you.
Kael Pindanon would not dare harm the son of King Eventine.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because there is still honor within these walls.<eos> This letter bears my seal.<eos> I need you to deliver it to bring back the support I need to win over the Council.
This is my best chance to gain the Council's trust.<eos> They need to see me as a leader.<eos> Diana, please.<eos> You're the only one I can count on.<eos> Take it to Slanter.
(grunting)<eos> (groaning)<eos> All right, where's the seed?<eos> I tried to tell you earlier...<eos> Oh, please don't say you dropped it.
It's me, Wil.<eos> I'm the seed.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to become the Ellcrys.<eos> That's how we save it.
- You can't stop me.<eos> - I bloody can and I will.<eos> You're too young to have a death on your conscience, Master Bruce.<eos> I know how your parents deserve justice.<eos> I know you're not gonna stop till you find it.
Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?
The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?<eos> Go.<eos> I'm strong enough to use it if I need to.
I didn't do this. Somebody set me up.<eos> blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> Captain, listen to me.<eos> Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.
Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.<eos> Your fingerprints were on it.<eos> At Union Station, I used a crowbar to open up the locker.<eos> Somebody must have picked it up.
Revenge.<eos> Remorse.<eos> Ah, remorse.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> I feel it. A lot.
I was there.<eos> Remember?<eos> When you first caught the Wayne case.<eos> I know what it means to you.<eos> You think that if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past.
Move everything you can to the facility upstate.<eos> Then destroy any evidence of Indian Hill.<eos> By destroy, you mean...<eos> You have an explosive device.<eos> Use it.
- What?<eos> He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing it.<eos> Because he's a genius.<eos> - He's writing the word "case" over and over again.<eos> Oh, now he's spelling it with a K.
There's no time to waste.<eos> This case is urgent.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.
That said, you're wrong.<eos> He's right.<eos> The safest place for this isn't behind walls or guarded with guns.<eos> The safest place lives outside the realm of anyone's awareness.<eos> If the English can't find it, they can't take it.
Maybe it doesn't count yet.<eos> Got to go.<eos> Lip?<eos> We're, uh, almost ready to start.<eos> When the priest asks for the ring, you just hand it to me, okay?
All these houses, all these estates, so much land, plantations, forests...<eos> Surely it's wrong that one man should own so much?<eos> Well, you know, Count Bezukhov, the saying is that we don't own our earthly possessions, we merely curate them for our heirs, for the generations to come.<eos> Looked at that way, it's an honour and a duty.<eos> Yes, but I'd like to share this wealth, not simply hoard it for my children.
I am so sorry that I'm late.<eos> There's a car parked in the principal's space.<eos> Dr. Brown was principal of several very high achieving schools in Philadelphia.<eos> Oh, look at you being so nice.<eos> And who's this sitting in my chair, keeping it warm for me like a gentleman?
Jonah Hill will finally win that Oscar.<eos> I want you to put a baby in me so I can fight for the right to legally abort it!<eos> Can I help you, Officer?<eos> I know I wasn't speeding.<eos> As a rule, I like to take the speed limit, divide it in half, and add five.
Any children?<eos> First and last.<eos> So there's no mention of Cairo on your professional CV.<eos> I checked.<eos> Yeah. I took it off after I left.
- No.<eos> If there's one thing that Lyons told me that I completely believe it's that the cops can't do anything against a company like Armitage.<eos> Whatever their plan is, they clearly think it's working. They don't know that I'm onto them.<eos> That buys me time. No. Dude, even if we had 100 years, we'd never have access to what we need to try to figure out what they're doing.<eos> I lost my phone. I think I may have left it here this morning.
Well, he's just at a lunch meeting.<eos> I mean, he should be back soon.<eos> May I?<eos> Uh... I could call it for you.<eos> That's what I do with mine when I can't find it.
Why don't you take it easy for a couple weeks?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Listen, um...<eos> I've been meaning to give this to you.<eos> I've been carrying it around for a couple of days.
You should.<eos> Wow, you're a real F. Lee Bailey.<eos> I know my rights.<eos> I didn't have to steal that footage.<eos> That guy Orton... he didn't even have it no more.
No place I'd rather have you.<eos> Go get the boy.<eos> Building is not safe.<eos> That's why I gotta get in there.<eos> We have to shore it up.
We're not gonna arrest him?<eos> Well, no, I mean, yes.<eos> He confessed.<eos> Of course we're gonna arrest him.<eos> But you know any good lawyer could get that confession thrown out, but now that we know where the murder weapon is, all we have to do is go get it, get the prints off it, we got an airtight case.
Are you okay?<eos> I'm so sorry, señor.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - Your coat.<eos> - Yeah, just leave it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Bet you never thought you'd see me again.<eos> I need a summary judgment hearing with Michaelis for Bray v. O'Connell, and I'm hoping for Thursday at 10:00, before he...<eos> Don't have it.
Well, that's a sad thought.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> Banking law... needs to be exciting.<eos> It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.<eos> Really wake it up.
Well, earlier, ‭you said that he was here.<eos> Now you're saying that he wasn't here.<eos> - Which is it? ‭<eos> Yeah, well, when that guy showed me the picture,<eos> I thought, "Maybe," but now that I'm seeing it again, uh...
You are a convict in need of someone to keep your things clean, your movement restricted, and your door shut.<eos> As such, you're the first daughter of privilege I have been able to serve while speaking my mind openly.<eos> I would have thought my story is well told by now, but I come from no privilege.<eos> Don't you?<eos> My understanding is that your father built a criminal enterprise and you inherited it.
No. "Lost it" as in I had it in a sack and I put it down, and when I came back to pick it up, it weren't where I put it.<eos> Lost.<eos> - Would you like me to...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The crew has entrusted the captain and I to watch over the prize gold and to protect it in all our interests, yeah?
You cannot truly believe that is possible.<eos> You know as well as I do that so long as that gold is sitting in the belly of that fort, we are doubly exposed.<eos> Losing the fort guarantees the loss of the gold.<eos> Excuse me. What are you suggesting?<eos> That we exchange it.
We just need to find it.<eos> Pass word to the commodore. Resistance within the fort has been defeated.<eos> The fort wall already breached, there was little chance to resist.<eos> And the gold?<eos> What will I say was the effect of the blast on our efforts to retrieve it?
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas, English will be not it.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> It's done.<eos> So, one of two outcomes will result.<eos> Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Do it.<eos> And make ready the launches.<eos> I'll lead the shore party as soon as we arrive.<eos> That fucking chair.<eos> To gain it, it demands you win partners, call them friends, make them promises.
You've been through something, but it's going to be okay, I promise.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> My son's house and a bridge.<eos> There used to be a mirror right here.<eos> Why did you take it down?
I liked staying here because it made me feel safe.<eos> But I see now that it's just because I was so comfortable living in heartbreak.<eos> I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> It's harder to kill you when I'm sitting in the same room as you.<eos> Easier to carve your heart out of your chest and eat it when you're just a monster in my mind.
Please, come in.<eos> Celia, so good to see you, too.<eos> Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> LeAnn called me a little while ago. Said she couldn't make it.<eos> Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn to have this meeting set up because I have a radical proposal, and I wanted to make it in person.
I know, but...<eos> UK Remicon's our number one competitor in the European market and if for some reason they were to be put out of the way, that could be very advantageous to us.<eos> I just wouldn't want to think that we were doing anything...<eos> Illegal?<eos> Well... you signed a confidentiality agreement when you did that business with Greenfern, and you broke it.
He's on the board, Archer.<eos> One word from him, and A.J. is in.<eos> Yeah, but-- Yeah, but shut up!<eos> This is your daughter's future, you dickhead!<eos> So you are gonna take his case, and you are gonna solve it, and A.J. is going to school here and then grow up to be a titan of industry or an astronaut or some other shit!
- Ooh! - He's handsome!<eos> Ugh! Total jit-rag.<eos> Wearing that necklace to a crowded event seems like a pretty big risk.<eos> I know.<eos> Believe me, I tried to talk Ms. Deane out of wearing it, but...
Aha! But his CPU is working perfectly!<eos> - And he witnessed everything!<eos> Copley?<eos> - Yep, yep, yep!<eos> Please rewind to Milkly's heinous murder and play it back for us.
I did retrieve some personal items from it, though, that might help us track him down.<eos> Well, that sounds like a good investigative plan.<eos> The first thing we need to do, though... check out of this motel.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a village that was being tormented by a man-eating lizard-dragon.<eos> The local constable did everything to try to kill this creature, but nothing could stop it.
Uh, we have special authorization. - That's what everyone says.<eos> - No.<eos> We'll just need the room for a few minutes... to do research.<eos> Yeah, that's what everyone says.<eos> You know, I've never seen a patient receive so much attention... especially one who's so unworthy of it.
We don't have a flat.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Yep, your left tire's flat. It sure is.<eos> Must have bust it when you were shoving us off the road.
It's gonna be bad if I don't go.<eos> Imma be right back.<eos> Go to the bathroom.<eos> Hi, you have the wrong menu.<eos> I'm just gonna take it.
We're not having this conversation.<eos> Oh, yeah, we are.<eos> Somehow you people knew about this murder, and you sat on it.<eos> We made the appropriate phone calls.<eos> It's not our fault it took you two days to follow up on it.
She identify herself?<eos> I only have her first name...<eos> Annette... and I have a phone number.<eos> The thing is, Keisha, I've been over that murder book a hundred times.<eos> I could recite it to you verbatim.
Before we waive extradition...<eos> What?<eos> You're not fighting it?<eos> Well, what would be the point?<eos> You got the murder weapon and you tied it to my client.
What?<eos> You're not fighting it?<eos> Well, what would be the point?<eos> You got the murder weapon and you tied it to my client.<eos> How it got there and who put it there is a matter for another day.
When we're good to go, we'll give you a call.<eos> Maybe we find something helps us both out.<eos> All we wanted.<eos> A little cooperation.<eos> You got it.
The surviving officer's cooperating.<eos> She's given a statement.<eos> She has?<eos> According to her,<eos> Nash planned your husband's murder, and she and his accomplices carried it out.
I think she's the coolest teacher and the prettiest.<eos> I love Miss Yutka, too. But I hate Mr. Istvan.<eos> Did you have a choir at your old school?<eos> No, just the music class.<eos> I've been doing it for a year, and love it.
Put that down, that's my...<eos> Hey, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?<eos> Excuse my language, Miss Mimi.<eos> I got the equipment all lined up.<eos> Sergeant Pete's bringing it over.
Hey.<eos> My mom said she talked to Will.<eos> If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.<eos> That means that she's trapped... in that place.<eos> We have to find it again.
- Yeah.<eos> Well, he had something of mine.<eos> A little gold dish, about this big.<eos> Not valuable, just... sentimental.<eos> But I want it back.
A little gold dish, about this big.<eos> Not valuable, just... sentimental.<eos> But I want it back.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You find it, you return it to me.
So what?<eos> You want to go down that road again?<eos> I saw the future.<eos> The future of this company.<eos> I fucking heard it.
That's a mistake.<eos> A conspicuous buy like that in the news?<eos> He goes from a billionaire that you can pull for to just another rich asshole.<eos> If he turns the populous against him, he gives his edge to you.<eos> I passed word that, uh, he shouldn't buy it.
Oh, Christ, Carla.<eos> I totally forgot.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Um, listen, some... - some things came up, so... - So nothing.<eos> This space is exactly what you've been looking for and they've got someone ready to snap it up if you don't act fast.
Congratulations.<eos> You were the opener of all news bulletins.<eos> - Any news?<eos> - Emergency meeting at 5.<eos> Move it to 3:30.
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.<eos> He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit.<eos> He wanted the real thing.<eos> He wanted to create consciousness.<eos> He imagined it as a pyramid.
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some-- some threat to me.<eos> I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.<eos> My sister probably picked you for the same reason.<eos> I earned my place.<eos> Nobody handed it to me.
It's the human beings who confuse me.<eos> This building isn't in any survey of the park.<eos> That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys.<eos> They're programmed to ignore this place.<eos> They literally couldn't see it if they were staring right at it.
Aren't you a little late to the party?<eos> It may be too late.<eos> There was an archaeologist, Carl Bugenhagen, who visited Thorn's father 25 years ago.<eos> Bugenhagen wrote the Vatican saying that he and Thorn believed the young boy to be the Beast from Revelation.<eos> That letter sat in the Vatican archives until I found it.
Wouldn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Just to have him gone!<eos> You know, is... is... Is that not our responsibility?<eos> You know, when we...<eos> When we encounter evil, shouldn't we destroy it?
Meredith:<eos> Look, maybe we have a shortcut.<eos> This is dinosaur tech.<eos> Can't you do some cool conversion upgrade, smart-girl thing?<eos> I can, but, we need time and we're short on it.
You're my lawyer, right?<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> You want to know if I was on that roof?<eos> Oh, I already know.<eos> The office windows don't open, and Kate's body was too close to the building for you to look out and see it.
Go out, win a race with a Jesus-loving homophobic homosexual or a racist billionaire.<eos> Then we can talk about a career in TV.<eos> - How's Zitzilla looking?<eos> - Angry.<eos> You been picking at it?
I'm not picking up any respect.<eos> But you're getting the declining?<eos> Do you know what Candi Caruso's real name is?<eos> It's Candice.<eos> And she changed it to Candi with an I.
He said you're becoming a man he respects.<eos> My dad said that?<eos> Is she gonna be okay?<eos> They say she should be able to leave tomorrow.<eos> I've been carrying this ring ever since you took it off.
Or listener, as the case may be.<eos> Ethan Garvin.<eos> A sound analyst for ShotSeeker, an acoustic surveillance system that uses microphones mounted across the city to pinpoint the location of a gunshot, and can do it to within 50 feet.<eos> I see you've done your homework, Professor.<eos> More fun doing it than grading it.
The miniature machine clone is on this laptop.<eos> You know, for a man with such serious concerns about the proliferation of artificial super intelligence, you sure do love to build new ones.<eos> I can connect this Machine laptop to the Samaritan laptop via this central computer, which will function as a forum for their virtual engagement.<eos> Or a Roman Colosseum for an unlimited series of virtual battles.<eos> If Samaritan has a fatal flaw, we'll know it soon enough.
Bet that photo shows Kent Turner doping his horse.<eos> A reasonable speculation.<eos> It would cost him the victory.<eos> And his business.<eos> I told you I deleted it.
Then who was it?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Karen?<eos> The picture was a mistake.<eos> I deleted it just like you asked.
You're listening to Mysterious Transmissions on AM 520 WKCP.<eos> This is Max.<eos> I don't know who's still listening, but let me apologize for the last couple hours of dead air.<eos> We had some technical difficulties, to say the least.<eos> I made a promise to someone, but after some serious thought, I have to break it.
Well, for your information, they're free.<eos> Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Mom says you butcher that word.<eos> Not when I say it to you.
No headwinds.<eos> Just a few hours.<eos> Put your hands to the right.<eos> There's a window there.<eos> Pull it.
That you profit from it.<eos> And did it heal them?<eos> All the money?<eos> It's given his family a security that they've never known.<eos> But more importantly, the process of telling this story has somehow exorcised it.
I did.<eos> What's it like up there?<eos> The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.
The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.<eos> It's in the bathroom.<eos> You gotta bring it down for me.
Elbow.<eos> We were locked in a strange race with our captor.<eos> Right above us, Hap was learning each movement on his own.<eos> The question became, what would happen if we got the fifth movement?<eos> Could we keep it away from Hap long enough to make our escape?
I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.<eos> Don't.<eos> And I know we're both worried about the same thing.<eos> Will we ever find the fifth movement?<eos> One of us will get it.
They sing.<eos> That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.<eos> We will get it.
That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.<eos> We will get it.<eos> We will get it.
- $50,000?<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm gonna make her delete the picture.<eos> Nancy.<eos> - She could put it online.
Nancy.<eos> - She could put it online.<eos> - Nance, drop it.<eos> Abel, it's her face.<eos> She could put it online for... for everyone to see.
That's enough haikus for today.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Come and give me a hand.<eos> Well, it's like this, and then you put it in this bag.
Jorge. Nuria, does your dad use another name at work?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why? I came in to bring him my resumé.<eos> You can't go in without telling him!<eos> I'll just leave it at reception.
I don't know.<eos> Why? I came in to bring him my resumé.<eos> You can't go in without telling him!<eos> I'll just leave it at reception.<eos> Fine, leave it and go.
No...<eos> Is this dish good?<eos> I don't know! I don't like prawns and coconut gives me heartburn, but...<eos> No buts, Jorge.<eos> I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
And you have to know that going to the interior to meet Declan Harp<eos> may cost you your life.<eos> On the house!<eos> Are you seeking salvation, my love?<eos> Because I'm the only one in here who can give it to you.
Sure, let it slide.<eos> That's just some dog shit.<eos> But those are three devious little words.<eos> You know, if... if I let your dog shit slide, then I have to be okay then I have to be okay with this whole plaza filling up with it, which it would before we know it.<eos> Oh, then it would be on our pant legs and our shoes, and we would track it into our homes, and then our homes would smell like shit, too.
It's not too deep.<eos> Everything's changing.<eos> Green to red.<eos> It starts here.<eos> This place... I've seen it.
Chief Sousa.<eos> New York wanted you to get this A.S.A.P.<eos> Thompson got us the isodyne search warrant.<eos> Want to kick that nest again?<eos> Let's stomp it to the ground.
Mum, we can't have you weeping all through the ceremony.<eos> Can I help crying when I'm happy?<eos> Where is my blasted handkerchief?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Let's get this dress off before I stain it.
Had a whole speech prepared, and none of my plans involved asking you to marry me with my hands in the couch because I lost the ring.<eos> Um, I can't find the ring.<eos> Oh, that's...why.<eos> That's why.<eos> Then, let's find it.
I wake up. ?<eos> I'm searching my pockets.<eos> It's gone.<eos> ? The ring is completely gone.<eos> I can't find it.
What about the gamma cannon?<eos> Still recharging.<eos> There is one other option, but it's not good.<eos> We could use the manual override.<eos> Well, then use it.
Meaning they'll get sucked inside.<eos> That's about the size of it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Nope.<eos> I built it... badly, as it turns out.
I mean, if I could play the occasional open mike...<eos> Not if you're scheduled to work.<eos> Standard application.<eos> Nothing special.<eos> We'll give you a minute to fill it out.
Right. Brilliant, captivating, mysterious.<eos> - All of the above.<eos> - Right.<eos> Why didn't you stay for the show?<eos> I've seen it before.
I might have done the same thing.<eos> No, you wouldn't have.<eos> You have always supported my dreams.<eos> I mean, you signed me to Edgehill, right?<eos> Listen, all you have to do is just sign this letter of consent the lawyers typed up, and then I can give it to the judge.
It was more than just an accident.<eos> We both know that.<eos> You can stop not talking now.<eos> The interview's over.<eos> Would've been nice if I hadn't had to do it on my own.
We were born in space.<eos> They told us the ground was uninhabitable, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed.<eos> Some of us have been broken by it, but most of us are still here, searching for other survivors from the Ark, trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness... a home.<eos> Our leaders believe that to survive, we need to make peace with the Grounders, but peace is a foreign concept here.<eos> I found it, John.
Resist, and you will be met by force.<eos> Fight, and you will be greeted by death.<eos> Today is a new beginning.<eos> Mark it down.<eos> Remember it just like the grounders will remember it.
That's basically ecstasy.<eos> No, it's the...<eos> Okay, maybe.<eos> But it... it's organic.<eos> They make it from...
Hi. Do you have any romantic comedy-themed merchandise?<eos> Preferably something with Winslet and Diaz?<eos> Uh... no, sorry.<eos> - This is very disappointing.<eos> - Yeah. I've had a depressing day and I just wanted to get something that would remind me that happiness can find you when you least expect it.
A lot of people came from a FEMA camp.<eos> Trailers came with them.<eos> How did people find out about this place?<eos> That's called Barrington House.<eos> The family that owned it gave it to the state in the '30s.

Each of them had a phone out.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> I fucking love when you do that.<eos> Your love is touching, but what I need right now is to find that original video.<eos> Find it, pay what we need, get it.
I got plenty of other cases to deal with.<eos> Now is this because you think my advice gives you less of a shot at winning?<eos> No.<eos> I need to protect my integrity.<eos> I need to run the case if I'm running it.
Hey. Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming down.<eos> I did it.<eos> Butch Probert. "The Pouch."<eos> Took an old Wells notice and doctored it.
Yeah.<eos> So why didn't you run here after you found the body?<eos> I thought they might be missing her in the pub.<eos> Or was it because you thought the body was too close to your granddad's land?<eos> Is that why you moved it?
Is that what I am?<eos> ♪♪♪ What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> ♪♪♪ This is how you manifest guilt.<eos> If you didn't have it, you wouldn't have lost the money, you wouldn't be punishing yourself.
He appeared to me.<eos> Here, in this room.<eos> He blessed me and made the sign of the cross.<eos> But he was silent,<eos> And his image faded almost as soon as i saw it.
- Coincidence, surely?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> But two incidents where both of the customers have come to harm, it could be something more.<eos> We're taking the baby food off the shelves in case there's glass in any of the others.<eos> But she's sure she got it from here, is she?
- You forgot?<eos> Oh, she forgot!<eos> Only, on one of those calls, Jamie left a voicemail.<eos> - I never received that.<eos> - Yes, you did, because yesterday you erased it.
Oh, she forgot!<eos> Only, on one of those calls, Jamie left a voicemail.<eos> - I never received that.<eos> - Yes, you did, because yesterday you erased it.<eos> But luckily we've managed to retrieve it from the server.
I'm in a bit of trouble.<eos> I could do with somewhere to stay.<eos> Just call me when you can.<eos> Now, Jamie left that voicemail at 8:32am Tuesday morning, the day he was killed.<eos> And according to the phone company, you played it at 8:36am.

What happened?<eos> Even John makes better tea than this.<eos> - Yes.. but"<eos> Something must be wrong with the milk.<eos> Who brought it?
You know, some people say that the sativa is a memory-erasing machine, Frankie.<eos> I know that's funny, Gar.<eos> I'm just not in a laughing mood right now.<eos> Hey, free beer to anyone who helps us bring the rest of the stuff in.<eos> Why the hell should we work for free beer when these hipster jackwipes are buying it for us just for treating 'em like shit?
That's how much she hated you.<eos> But I didn't care, because I saw something.<eos> I saw a future.<eos> Our future.<eos> We had a future until you started destroying it.
She's been talking to Jeremy again.<eos> Do you think I really wouldn't come back<eos> - because of you? - Yeah.<eos> This show is my kingdom.<eos> I'm gonna take it back.
False alarm.<eos> So, that's how you're gonna play it, huh?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Getting what you want... That's what the show's all about.<eos> You created it, remember?
Hey. Your body is not a commodity.<eos> You tell you what you do with you.<eos> Chet, first of all, my body is a commodity, okay?<eos> It's my living.<eos> Funny thing I plan on protecting it.
And your wallet, but it was nothing personal.<eos> What the hell is that man doing?<eos> He has no idea what the core is capable of.<eos> Relax.<eos> He's the one who invented it.
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not the sentimental type.<eos> No, but your partner, the physicist with the big brown eyes, is.<eos> Turn the core back online.<eos> You will turn it back on, or I will put a bullet in your friend's head.
It's Goggins, all right.<eos> He's had a tiger here.<eos> It's hardly big enough to house a dog in.<eos> Poor creature must have been driven half mad.<eos> He's come out to feed it and forgotten to latch the door properly.
That's my truth.<eos> And what if you never know what happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And I don't know what to do with that unknowing.<eos> Sounds like you got to accept it.
It's the same as most engineers around here.<eos> Well, we now require advanced extension courses through the University of Virginia.<eos> It's in the Employee Handbook.<eos> An addendum.<eos> Case you haven't read it
Yes.<eos> Describe him, the orderly.<eos> Nondescript.<eos> Look at his face now.<eos> Let your eyes move over it.
And thank God for Sean.<eos> He was the one who pushed me to get this loan.<eos> Aw, he's like Superman, except for the whole junkie thing.<eos> Does he know about Gus's ring?<eos> Well, he knows that it exists, but not that I'm pawning it.
- Don't you have an exam today?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I have some schnapps in the freezer.<eos> It's a Yamazaki.<eos> My boss gave it to me.
Oh, right.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> When you were working on me,<eos> Julian stole Stefan's body.<eos> I'm gonna go get it back.
The only danger here is the choice that you must make.<eos> You see, I'm not your enemy.<eos> It's true.<eos> I delivered you into this existence.<eos> I can just as easily pluck you out of it.
If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with...<eos> You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?
Traitor to my family,<eos> - thief of that which is mine.<eos> - Don't be dramatic.<eos> Like I said, I just wanted your attention.<eos> And seeing as you're here, I'd say I got it.
Guys.<eos> And every member of this police department is taking this case not just seriously but personally.<eos> 'Without going into detail that can harm the investigation'<eos> 'I can tell you that we are narrowing down' 'our list of suspects.'<eos> We're confident we know what the murder weapon was and we will find it.
Gather your things and leave here.<eos> Go in there and tell my mother the truth.<eos> If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.<eos> They may have found the weapon.<eos> And they were willing to kill me to get it back.
Is anybody in there?<eos> Hello?<eos> It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.<eos> Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.<eos> And whoever this was... they want to cover it up.
Genesis is almost ready.<eos> We're much too close to play games.<eos> Do you remember what I promised you?<eos> A new beginning.<eos> And you will have it.
Looks like she's kidnapped another celebrity couple--<eos> Allison Lee and Robert Joyce.<eos> "Allibert."<eos> Can you track the GPS on their phones?<eos> When I said I had their location, how do you think that I got it?
And hearing one.<eos> That Sonic device has been modified.<eos> My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?
My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?<eos> It should have only worked with Laurel.<eos> The crazy part is that this girl is using it at much higher decibels than Laurel ever did.
Get out of this town!<eos> "Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!
I may be close to the grave, but I'm still a woman.<eos> I can see love for a man in the face of another of my gender.<eos> I see him across the way, I hear him talk...<eos> My heart beats like I think everyone on the mountain can hear.<eos> I wanna tear it out of my chest for making me a fool.
She was sick and old.<eos> Ain't no mysteries to it.<eos> No, she took a bath.<eos> The water was still in the tub.<eos> But her towel was sittin' where I left it.
You know what I mean yeah, well, I don't care.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm the Bren'in.<eos> Foster, you don't demand trust.<eos> You earn it.
Bribe... we need money.<eos> Money won't be a problem.<eos> Here they're worthless.<eos> In 1944, their street value will be substantial.<eos> Trade it. Pawn it.
No telling what he could do.<eos> Why are you sending him back if you don't trust him?<eos> Because at the moment I'm lacking of a great many things, and options are among them.<eos> So, let me get this straight, you want me to place a classified ad in the paper?<eos> Do it every day, and we'll find it.
2044?<eos> Your country thanks you for your service, Shirley.<eos> So what's Jones' plan for getting us back without a tether?<eos> I have to place a classified ad in the paper, give her an exact time, specific location.<eos> She then reads it in 2044.
- There's a monster.<eos> The monster wants to destroy the world.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mommy will stop it.<eos> Shh. Mommy will kill it.
The monster wants to destroy the world.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mommy will stop it.<eos> Shh. Mommy will kill it.<eos> Mommy's gonna kill it.
What do you want from me, Aaron?<eos> I want you to understand.<eos> It doesn't have to be that way anymore.<eos> There's only one way to undo the clock, Cass.<eos> The Witness is destroying people like me, the ones that keep time from falling in on itself, but we can't hold it up forever.
Leonard.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You've had time to mull over our little tete-a-tete, I hope?<eos> - Cutting out the dead wood?<eos> - Replacing it with fine new foliage.
Anyway, we got Michael on money-laundering charges via his private-security company.<eos> - Had enough to put him away for 20 years.<eos> - So you offered him a deal?<eos> He'd witnessed Arthur's recreational murder of one Kevin Willkie - a wee rat himself.<eos> He'd had his hand in the till so Arthur took it off with a machete.
You overestimate my client's subtlety.<eos> I'm here because he sent me to deliver a message.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, I've got the message.<eos> You'll forgive me if I feel free to ignore it.
I don't think that would be a good idea.<eos> - Tosh?<eos> - 'Sir.'<eos> I've been on to Gallowgate.<eos> I requested more information - who authorised the upgrade, who implemented it, whether any other data was lost.
What are you doing here?<eos> Allie.<eos> You made me an accessory to murder.<eos> Dao gave me Shive's location.<eos> I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead.
I thought it was gonna be easier, but seeing him here...<eos> And I know you've forgiven him, but...<eos> I still...<eos> I'm just gonna need some more time.<eos> And I'm clearly not gonna get it.
- You're my partner.<eos> - I'm not working for Rhys.<eos> - He doesn't even know my name.<eos> - He knows your name.<eos> He just playfully chooses not to use it.
No way.<eos> Wendy Williams could totally beat up Connie Chung.<eos> Sure, sure, but, I mean, no one was talking about either of those people before you said that.<eos> I spoke to the Gordon Salt people, and they said we might have a valuable resource in our yard.<eos> And if we do, they'd like to pay us for the right to take it.
- Which is?<eos> - The Man Behind the Scenes.<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I suggested it myself.
dinner's from 5:00 to 6:00.<eos> You can make phone calls here.<eos> Phone use is restricted until administration allows access, and then there's a ten-minute time limit, and your calls will be monitored by a staff member.<eos> Now, after your initial consultation with Dr. Edwards, he's going to set up a daily therapy schedule for you.<eos> When you have free time, you can spend it in your room or here in the patient lounge, or outside in permitted areas.
Wally, don't make a mistake you're gonna regret the rest of your life.<eos> Go see your mom while you still can.<eos> No sign of tachyon activity.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> We've got to find them. It'll take a few minutes for the device to reach full power once it's activated, but when we find it, you're gonna have to get there fast.
She helped out at the primary school last year and even the headmaster started wetting the bed.<eos> I assume you've all heard about the fire at the brewery?<eos> Oh, terrible.<eos> And they have found a body!<eos> Have they identified it?
Because Geronimo's not a terrorist.<eos> He's some ad-guy up in the Green Zone.<eos> Snyder's trial was a farce.<eos> The only thing Geronimo ever led was a really smart street-art campaign.<eos> Some people down here rallied around the message, used it for violence.
Tschick, what are you doing?<eos> Tschick!<eos> Drive your name!<eos> My name?<eos> - So we can read it on Google Earth!
Just let that dry, and you'll be on your merry way.<eos> You know, not that I was expecting a, uh, parade or anything, but why is everyone so eager for me to go?<eos> Stefan Salvatore is not the problem.<eos> But if you are so determined to find foe amongst friends, then look no further than Marcel.<eos> After all, did he not steal Jackson's heart and deliver it to the very people bent on harming us?
Are you quite sure?<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> Finn must have come back when Davina resurrected me.<eos> The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line.<eos> Either it worked on him, or he found a way to hijack it.
The Strix are thinning out.<eos> It is back to Nola business as usual.<eos> I'm afraid our plans to vacate have been put on hold.<eos> Three of our upper-level circle are missing, including Fukuda, Bailey and Flynn.<eos> In the wake of Aya's death, you can understand our concern, though you don't seem to share it.
You never should've let me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Put it down.<eos> You want my heart?<eos> Then come and get it!
His heart became one with hers.<eos> Ask Davina.<eos> He's right.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't gonna work.<eos> I assume the grieving widow didn't just hand it over.
And the only way we're going to stop the bloodshed<eos> - is if we do something about it.<eos> - We?<eos> We're going to put this in the right place.<eos> We're going to set it off, and we're going to sever the Ancestors' connection to the world of the living.
Now, it's gonna take a little while, but if I can concentrate it in her heart, we can extract it with this... destroy it, and make sure we ain't got no more of these<eos> - unkillable monsters on our hands. - Good.<eos> In the meantime,<eos> I think I may have finally found a way to kill Lucien.<eos> Now, my mother once tried to end my siblings by reversing the Original vampire spell, and according to her grimoire, only the witch who cast the spell could undo it.
You see that family drama you so joyfully deride, does have its merits.<eos> You can kill me, but the prophecy still stands.<eos> You cannot outrun it.<eos> I've had about a thousand years too much from you.<eos> For a century, you lived with my name, and you never did quite recover from losing it, did you?
I mean, it's completely random, I never...<eos> Magnus Bane?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why? How do you know that name?<eos> I heard it from the vampire.
A four-karat, unheated Burmese ruby.<eos> And this necklace has special meaning to Magnus Bane as it was a gift from him to his then lover, Camille Belcourt.<eos> What, Camille and Magnus were lovers?<eos> Warlock gets around.<eos> Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.
Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.<eos> Now, the jewel is enchanted by a spell that alerts the wearer to the presence of demons.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Magnus has longed to reunite with this necklace.<eos> Offer it to him.
Do you think red's my color?<eos> Iz, with a body like yours, everything's your color.<eos> Good point.<eos> Damn, I make this necklace look so good.<eos> Will you take it off?
He's a teacher.<eos> Tutor, it would seem, to young Per Degaton himself.<eos> You say that like it's supposed to mean something.<eos> After the death of his father in five year's time,<eos> Per Degaton unleashes the Armageddon Virus, which decimates the world's population, leaving it ripe for conquest.
It came from the strangest of places.<eos> What kind of name is The Devil of Hell's Kitchen, anyway?<eos> I mean, really?<eos> I didn't ask for that name.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't see you running from it.
Are you sure?<eos> They lied to us.<eos> For years, they've been telling us how to act.<eos> That we have to uphold the Lightwood name.<eos> Well, they're the ones who tarnished it.
- Well...<eos> - Huh.<eos> - I get it.<eos> I wish you could see this place.<eos> I can, if you describe it to me.
Vous aviez pas d'affaire à vous montrer la face dans ma présentation !<eos> Le pôle Nord appartient au Canada !<eos> I see.<eos> Decomposition was indeed advanced.<eos> Coupled with the salt used to preserve it, the body became dry and shriveled.
- Perhaps you could help.<eos> He said Arthur was strangled to death.<eos> That can't be.<eos> He froze to death.<eos> Nuniq found his body four days later and returned it to the ship.
The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.<eos> The Oculus' existence is known only to the High Council, including its greatest secret:<eos> the Oculus not only gives us a window into time, but the ability to shape it as we see fit.
Professor's in the MedBay.<eos> Promises not to blow up while he's on board, which I thought was considerate.<eos> Yeah, the Professor's condition is the least of our worries, I'm afraid.<eos> Yeah, much to my chagrin, it turns out everything we've done, maybe even our whole lives, has been determined by the Time Masters.<eos> - The Time Masters have this thing called the Oculus, which allows them not only to gaze into the future, but to engineer it.
If Nick's covering for someone, that means the real murderer is still out there.<eos> Yes, plenty of murderers are out there, Detective.<eos> You heard the man.<eos> He deserves the punishment.<eos> At least he's getting it.
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?<eos> Why, by asking very nicely, of course.<eos> Something you should try sometime.<eos> This case has nothing to do with you.<eos> Why won't you leave it alone?
Who would want to set him up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Detective, we may have found the murder weapon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Test it for prints and DNA.
Confirm tactical sweep of the convention hall.<eos> What's happening at the convention hall?<eos> Today is the start of the National City Toy Convention, and for that I made you this special gun.<eos> You can take this with you right through the metal detectors and right past security.<eos> You can also take it on stage with you when Chester Dunholtz receives his award.
It'll be back.<eos> But...<eos> But it attacked the Senator...<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> I brought it to National City.
Why are you showing me this, man?<eos> It happened a long time ago, Emile.<eos> I thought you might need a refresher.<eos> Recognize that weapon?<eos> Recall when you last saw it?
Why don't you get down on the floor right here, Buddha, and we'll check on all of that.<eos> This isn't necessary, officer.<eos> You're really big, and I really can't shoot you.<eos> No work orders matching up to the plates on half these vehicles.<eos> I say we shut this place down and search it inch by inch.
Julio and Steph are bringing up the heroin, and Chief Howard is on his way.<eos> I've briefed everyone on how it's supposed to go.<eos> Thank you, Mike. We're almost ready.<eos> Buzz, if you would transfer that video of Sherry Hickman to the big monitor on Mike's desk<eos> - so our witness can clearly see it. - Will do.
Whatareyougonnado?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We've done as much bad as good here.<eos> - We've lost our place.<eos> - We earn it back by not fighting for Travis.
Mm, how about never?<eos> That's a growing possibility.<eos> - Hmm. Yes, I thought so.<eos> The spell is called a Scarlatti Web.<eos> We cannot break it.
We're one week out from the test, and I do not like the scores on this practice exam.<eos> 78% proficient in English and 76 in Math.<eos> Mmm. These are not winning scores.<eos> I've been growing my number one bush for a decade.<eos> And I do not intend to trim it.
Getting old is hard.<eos> He hasn't moved on.<eos> OK.<eos> What else did you get?<eos> Her dad opened the investigation and her mother closed it 2 days later.
You go or you don't.<eos> Lots of women cops have kids.<eos> - And?<eos> - That's it.<eos> If you were a man, you'd keep it.
- Why did you do it?<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> We didn't want to.<eos> Pascal and I had found the stronghold.<eos> We knew how to open it.
Three on this side of the Atlantic aligned against him and three Old World Ancients.<eos> - What the hell does that mean?<eos> - It's conceivable that he made some sort of accord with them, brought them over to the New World to finish the job.<eos> Carla, I have been given a new medication.<eos> - You might call it experimental. - What is it?
- What the hell does that mean?<eos> - It's conceivable that he made some sort of accord with them, brought them over to the New World to finish the job.<eos> Carla, I have been given a new medication.<eos> - You might call it experimental. - What is it?<eos> I need to look it up.
Yidu!<eos> Yidu!<eos> Give me some of that Chinese medicine.<eos> But don't you want to sleep?<eos> No, just give it to me.
Your Grace,<eos> I wish to commend you for everything you've done for me, and for Paris.<eos> And for me.<eos> I gave you my word.<eos> And I kept it.
Come here.<eos> Why did you look at me that way?<eos> Why should you pity me?<eos> I think you carry a terrible burden.<eos> And you carry it alone.
It's going back the way it was.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means "I don't want you to go."<eos> Why aren't you in the hospital?<eos> Knee was dislocated. They popped it back in, but we've got bigger problems.
My Aunt Helen was in there.<eos> I was afraid she would find it before I left.<eos> You should let your dad know you're okay so he doesn't worry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, um... here, uh, take a video of me, and we'll send it.
What's your first event?<eos> I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.<eos> It happened a month before the first killing.<eos> I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.<eos> All right. We'll call it event one.
But, Duval, Gracie's your kid.<eos> - It's your call.<eos> You know this place well enough to draw us a map?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know it very well.
Because you'll look out of place in a little bistro on the Saint-Sulpice... wearing this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Jean, it's beautiful.<eos> You're so generous.<eos> Let's put it on.
Didn't your girlfriend just break up with you?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Pretty sure she just did.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> Wait, so if that app gives you eyes and ears all over the city, then why don't you use it to find the next Ms. Right?
- Good friend?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs, and he has built a weapon that he believes we can use to neutralize, um, Killer Frost's powers.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> I'll take it.
Always give people the real story.<eos> Leo, the fact that Lommers is trying to shut you down means you're doing something right.<eos> They lied about it being bioterrorism, they lied about the number of bodies, they sure as hell are lying when they say everything's ok in here!<eos> You don't have to expose the location.<eos> The minute you post that it exists, cops will find it,
Dani, would you look at this heart-warming tableau.<eos> My heart's plenty warm.<eos> Leave me out of this.<eos> You know, maybe you two should talk.<eos> You have this precious time, and you spend it all in front of the old boob tube.
- Yeah. I'm a congressman.<eos> The second ticket is unclaimed if you're available.<eos> I'm married.<eos> I have the ring hiding under the gloves.<eos> - No, I saw it. - No.
The lady and I have a special date.<eos> Well, have fun, Miss Katie.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> What are you doing? (chuckles)<eos> Get your blanket and lay it out against the window.
I've assembled you all because I need your help.<eos> The future of the world is in peril because of Vandal Savage.<eos> You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.<eos> The Time Masters, they refuse to take action against Savage because he didn't pose a threat to the timeline.<eos> The Oculus not only gives us a window into time, - but the ability to shape it.
Thanks for coming.<eos> This is gonna be really quick.<eos> This is Abe, the notary.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> It's in a safety deposit box at the bank, which is closed right now, but I can grab it for you first thing tomorrow morning.
- Yes.<eos> A special courier from Paris just came in with a letter from Tom.<eos> - From Tom?<eos> - To me.<eos> Neil found it.
A special courier from Paris just came in with a letter from Tom.<eos> - From Tom?<eos> - To me.<eos> Neil found it.<eos> He sent it on.
He's planning an attack sometime in the next 24 hours.<eos> - How do they know?<eos> - We have to radio Sinclair!<eos> - Radio's destroyed.<eos> - Then we have to fix it!
_<eos> Faber knows about Camp X. He's planning an attack sometime in the next 24 hours.<eos> We have to radio Sinclair!<eos> Radio's destroyed.<eos> - Then we have to fix it!
I heard that.<eos> Porthos?<eos> I know that face.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> No, no, no, no, I know it too.
So you fled.<eos> We wanted to run for the border, but Bastien made us come back for the gold.<eos> He said it was our only way out.<eos> And now we've got nothing else to show for four bastard years of war!<eos> But you don't remember where you stashed it.
Yeah we remember.<eos> In the caves.<eos> But it'd gone!<eos> Whatever you do to me, they'll be back.<eos> They... Will not leave until they find it.
Move in!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Lower your weapon!<eos> - No, Porthos!<eos> - Lower it.
What? What thing?<eos> Have you ever seen "The Frighteners"?<eos> It's sort of like that, but scarier and faster and it's after you... after him.<eos> Yeah, it's been chasing me ever since I got here.<eos> Okay, so how do we stop it?
Ow! Oh! It's even worse than the last four, which I didn't think was possible.<eos> Is there carpet on the wall?<eos> It's got a lot of potential, doesn't it, Kate?<eos> This place is... Is definitely unique.<eos> If you like it, I could put in an application.
Yes, and the enzymes are still a bit more elevated than I'd like.<eos> I want to change one of your medications and increase your diuretic.<eos> So I can be in the bathroom even more?<eos> I know it's a hassle, but it's the best way to get rid of excess fluid.<eos> Remember, we can't reverse the damage to the liver, only slow it down, and you need to make sure that you're not doing any more damage.
- ‭Yeah.<eos> Oh, come here, babe.<eos> Come here, sweetie.<eos> I got you.<eos> So, um, I was thinking about what you said, about the offer, and... I decided to take you up on it...
I called her today, and I asked her to check and see if anything was, you know, available for sale near the beach for your original bistro idea, and check this out...<eos> Your original site is available.<eos> - Okay. - O...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I-I don't know. I guess the guy who bought it, he ran out of money or lost investors or something, so...
Kyle.<eos> I was just about to go for a jog when I saw you, and... I-I wanted to see if you got any of our mail.<eos> I'm expecting a letter.<eos> No.<eos> But if it shows up, you can take your shirt off again and come and get it.
That's a lovely necklace.<eos> You know, Evelyn has the exact same one.<eos> She does?<eos> Why do you have Evelyn's necklace?<eos> I stole it.
And he's right, we don't.<eos> - So, why are we having this conversation?<eos> - Say, what if we...<eos> We take this deal, Danny's case goes cold.<eos> No one will pursue it.
You can't see a thing.<eos> Look.<eos> The best you can do is get hold of a chair like this.<eos> You'll end up in one anyway.<eos> Steal it.
You're my father in law.<eos> Otherwise I'd tell you to fuck off.<eos> I agree completely.<eos> If you weren't my son in law I'd tell you to fuck off right now.<eos> If you want my respect, you've got to earn it.
Most likely other Nazis.<eos> Charles received a suspension as a lesson for his behavior and a failing grade on the paper.<eos> His shit-for-brains mother couldn't pass gas, let alone middle school.<eos> My grandson wrote an entire report here and you're gonna fail him for this?<eos> Hey, I read it.
We found this when we got here.<eos> Stabbed at least ten, twelve times.<eos> Haven't found a weapon yet.<eos> You wanted justice?<eos> Lowry's own people just gave it to you.
The proof is Nolan and the payments that you stopped.<eos> Okay, well there's no legal documents.<eos> Well, what about Robert's will?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?
I can offer you coffee, but don't ask for a cup.<eos> Your brother is gonna get the tar beat out of him.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I don't like what Aguirre's doing to the Rayburn name.<eos> He wants everybody to think of Danny when they hear it, not John.
- I followed you.<eos> Didn't think it was right for you to be on your own.<eos> Had my personal firearm in my duffel.<eos> I checked it when I came to Quantico.<eos> I figured I should check it out when I was leaving.
When she left the FBI, I thought it was none of my business.<eos> And now she's rushing in here, doing who knows what to our servers.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Hold the upgrade.<eos> Hold it, please.
- I don't know yet.<eos> I think whatever we decide... we all decide the same thing.<eos> It won't stay on.<eos> Maybe it's broken.<eos> Hit it.
But I didn't.<eos> You're going to have to trust me, John.<eos> - Trust you? ! - Yeah.<eos> You do realise...you could've killed me with that bloody drug?<eos> Where did you get it? The internet.
I did what no one else could do, Regina.<eos> I've brought you your revenge.<eos> Snow White's beating heart.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Crush it, and she dies at last.
You know...<eos> Daddy may have been wrong to ruin my revenge, but he was right about you.<eos> When are you going to get it in that thick head that I do everything for you?<eos> Especially the things you can't do... like Snow's heart.<eos> How long have you been trying to get it?
When are you going to get it in that thick head that I do everything for you?<eos> Especially the things you can't do... like Snow's heart.<eos> How long have you been trying to get it?<eos> Because it only took me a day.<eos> And it only took you an hour to lose it.
Let's talk about everything on our trip.<eos> While Henry's on one of those rides he wants to do 17 times in a row.<eos> Don used to drink soju, it's a Korean liquor.<eos> They're making fun of Don because he drink wine - with Korean food. - Oh.<eos> My brother drinks it with everything- scrambled eggs. - Oh. Ugh.
Oh, shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> No!<eos> Okay, it's a two person spell.<eos> Both must succeed to unlock it.
Looks like he's talking to someone.<eos> And I can bet who it is.<eos> Valentine.<eos> Well, that explains how he deactivated the Punishment rune, but it doesn't explain where he got the ring.<eos> You think someone smuggled it past the wards?
Do you love me?<eos> - Very much.<eos> - Then that is all that matters.<eos> Life is fleeting, Amelia.<eos> If happiness is within reach, seize it with both hands.
It's evidence, Mrs Cratchit.<eos> This piece of wood was removed from Jacob Marley's scalp.<eos> It came from the cosh that killed him.<eos> I've been looking for that weapon.<eos> And now I've found it.
Dr Enys.<eos> Dr Enys, I hear you're rather good at curing dogs.<eos> Did you notice Horace has a little spot on his ear?<eos> Has he?<eos> Perhaps Dr Enys might take a look at it after we've gone?
I didn't say it was Rebecca.<eos> What I am trying to say is that this little problem could actually be a blessing.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> If Senator Morra waits just a little bit between doses, just long enough for us to draw blood, we could use that clean blood, put it on a new, identical coat.<eos> I could swap it out with the real one.
Looks like it got damaged or something.<eos> Yeah. Or someone tampered with evidence by switching the coats.<eos> That doesn't seem likely.<eos> Boyle and I are gonna follow the chain of custody for the coat, see if we find anything hinky.<eos> NYPD had it first, then they passed it to us.
Of course not.<eos> That's quite a number.<eos> We wish we could say the same.<eos> Our new policy is this:<eos> When they come to us with a proposal, we immediately reject it.
I have to check with the Intelligence Director.<eos> No... in your service, Henri.<eos> Have you come to give me this person's name?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Could you write it down?
Please, I... I'm getting divorced.<eos> My ex wants it back.<eos> His grandma smuggled it out of Nazi Germany in her vagina, so it has sentimental value.<eos> Lots of people come to this shop to look at this ring. Well...<eos> Well, don't sell it. Can you just take what I have and and put it on hold?
That's fine, all right?<eos> But I just want you to remember, this is how you wanted to play it.<eos> I am not coming after your money.<eos> And the ring... is at a pawn shop.<eos> A-and if you can't wait till I can get the cash, then go buy it yourself and I'll just pay you back.
I didn't mean to imply there's something wrong with your friend Grant.<eos> Not everyone can be a superhero.<eos> Not everyone can be a nanny!<eos> Sorry.<eos> He's downstairs right now and he was supposed to be on a date and he cancelled it and you know what's really bugging me about that?
Richard, come on, man.<eos> She's fucking with you.<eos> Amaru told me the truth about this world. And the next.<eos> There is a place for people like us, Seth.<eos> I've seen it.
Thanks a lot, asshole!<eos> Now I'll never be on the team!<eos> Nice goin', Gonzalez.<eos> That little Betty there had a good future ahead of her...<eos> And you just ruined it.
- You know what, I don't wanna hear it.<eos> The only thing I wanna hear outta you are some fuckin' facts.<eos> Working on it.<eos> And now, to the situation unfolding in Shady Glen.<eos> Authorities are calling it a bath salts scare, and we're moving there now to get you the full story at 11:00.
Brasa's here, too.<eos> [on radio] But none of his warriors.<eos> Bet they got eyes and ears on us right now.<eos> Yeah, we should split up.<eos> Well, you wanted a reunion... you'll get it.
Where the hell did it go?<eos> SANTANICO: You brought that monster here, Richard.<eos> Yeah, except it called you out.<eos> Well, what's that matter now?<eos> Just tell me how to kill it.
No, but, he'll be watching, he'll be right there.<eos> Yeah, but, so we can get him.<eos> And then it's over.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> Send the bastard a message and hope he gets it.
We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.
To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.<eos> But the important thing is we sent it.
Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.<eos> But the important thing is we sent it.<eos> I'll get it to Downing Street right away.
It's clear that you really don't care about keeping this firm together.<eos> I resigned to keep this firm together.<eos> Well, it sure doesn't seem to be working out that way, does it?<eos> Great, I'll have my secretary set up a meeting for Monday.<eos> If that meeting's about your pro bono bullshit, cancel it.
If I go down because of my call, I can take it.<eos> If I go down because of yours, I can't.<eos> This isn't just your life.<eos> This is all of ours.<eos> Well, like I said, it's my call and I'm making it.
"We collectively come forward to swear "the following regarding Michael James Ross:<eos> "We never saw him.<eos> We never knew him.<eos> "We never heard of him.<eos> "And it makes us sick that he's taking the good name "of Harvard Law School and throwing it down the toilet.
Gloria Danner.<eos> Mrs. Danner, a number of years ago, your son Clifford was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison,<eos> - is that right? - Yes.<eos> For a crime he didn't commit.<eos> How do you know he didn't commit it if he was convicted of it?
Mike, they might not come back for days.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Harvey, but I can't leave here.<eos> It's okay, Harvey.<eos> Look,<eos> Mike, if we really don't have time, I don't want to waste it here.
Jack.<eos> I think you're forgetting about that folder you gave me, the one with the little legal indiscretion Daniel Hardman had on you.<eos> Let's not soft-pedal it, Jessica.<eos> It wasn't an indiscretion. It was a flat-out crime.<eos> And the problem with you using it is, you'll be announcing to the world yet another crime happened under your watch, and you did nothing to stop it.
- Where is the mirror?<eos> - It's over there.<eos> It is very nice, but it's about three zeros out of my budget.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I have to have it.
We had nothing to do with this.<eos> Elizabeth Keen was well hidden from the demons of her past until you went after her, until you told the world she was Masha Rostova.<eos> You put a target on her back and invited someone to take a shot.<eos> Do not try my patience, Laurel.<eos> On this topic, I have perilously little of it.
How bad did it go?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about, um...<eos> There was this... kid, back home, after the war, when everything was still torn up.<eos> He and his friends used to come after me when I used to go across town to get milk.<eos> You know, they'd take it from me and beat the crap out of me.
Some kind of a dungeon.<eos> You all set?<eos> You put the car seat in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You put it in right?
Black Sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.<eos> Cameron: That memory is inside my head.<eos> You're gonna go in and find it.
It's about a quarter mile from your cabin.<eos> The keys are still in it.<eos> What about my rifle?<eos> No.<eos> No sign of it.
Okay.<eos> Uh, I'll meet you in the lobby?<eos> Nice necklace, by the way.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> Someone special gave it to me.
- She used it to steal a witness immunity agreement from the files.<eos> And we're sure that it has something to do with her parents.<eos> Our friend Spy-ris here overheard her talking on the phone with her mom.<eos> Yeah, but an old witness immunity agreement's useless.<eos> Unless she's using it to set them up, get them here before calling the feds on them.
Alex.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> I helped build it.<eos> The nuke.<eos> You have to find it.
A .45 will do that to you.<eos> You got shot?<eos> Sounds like Booth and O'Connor may have left out some key details of the sting.<eos> Blown sting.<eos> Yeah, and he's the one that blew it.
Fakes.<eos> Just for show.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry, I never caught your name.<eos> My boss never uses it.
- Is that a camera?<eos> - Yeah. Paul spying on her.<eos> Actually, I think Beth was spying on Paul.<eos> When I was... her, I found surveillance equipment.<eos> She got it from Raj at the station.
- What he wants<eos> - is to rescue Rachel. - What can I say?<eos> She pierced this armoured heart.<eos> Shall we breakfast?<eos> The message from Rachel. I assume you can't trace it.
'Once he'd shot Sian, Griff positioned the towel' underneath the shower room door, half in the corridor, half in the shower room.<eos> He then moved the body onto the towel, wiped the gun for prints, 'and placed in into Sian's hand.<eos> 'He then scooped up the pillow, left the shower room, ' closing the shower room door behind him and pulling the towel.<eos> 'Which in turn pulled Sian's body flush against the door.'<eos> 'Back in the dorm room, Griff neatly folded her towel' and placed it back onto her bed before replacing the pillow.
Have one.<eos> This enclosure was built for the purpose of common recreation and study.<eos> I had it repurposed into a garden worthy of our splendor.<eos> I dare say it's my favorite place in the entire Kingdom.<eos> It pleases me that you've seen it with your own eyes before... choosing to leave us so suddenly.
I-I just...<eos> I just try to help.<eos> Maybe you got to do more.<eos> This, uh -- This was Abraham's.<eos> I found it here.
Instead, she found a weak link:<eos> a low-level marshal fell victim to a classic spearfishing campaign.<eos> Leaked the flight number and the U.S. marshal transporting the witness.<eos> What about the witness's name?<eos> I don't see it anywhere here.
I know, and I told him it couldn't happen again, but then he said it was no big deal.<eos> - That is a big deal! - Yeah.<eos> But...<eos> You look like the ultimate birthday bitch in that dress.<eos> - You have to wear it.
And why are you reading the Farmer Carl's Grocery Gazette?<eos> There are a lot of good deals on cookie batter in here, but what this is about is that you just leave your towels on the floor.<eos> What?<eos> Okay... it's about the fact that you went on a date with Lizzy.<eos> But seriously, who only has one towel and just leaves it on the floor?
Please!<eos> Even if you deliver me to the king and queen,<eos> They'll never pay!<eos> Look what they've done to this once proud kingdom.<eos> They plundered and destroyed it and ruined all of our lives!
What is he doing there with you?<eos> He hates you.<eos> Jake has come home.<eos> So should you.<eos> Then again, perhaps it is better to fight for the pleasure of ripping the beating heart of power from America's chest, to hold it in your bloody hands, than it is to never have entered the battle at all.
And they can't tell us anything for certain about the computer or - the printer that was used.<eos> - No fingerprints on the letter itself and only one set on the envelope - the Governor's.<eos> So, it was handed to Caroline by someone wearing gloves?<eos> Or someone in gloves left it in her handbag.<eos> A place they knew she'd find it.
While everyone was looking at Caroline, and after she was already dead, only then did you put a lethal dose of cyanide into her glass.<eos> Knowing that we would presume it was this cyanide that had poisoned her.<eos> But that wasn't your only stroke of genius, Ellery, was it?<eos> Because it was also what you wrote in this letter.<eos> You knew that when we opened it we would find apparent proof that Caroline's death was connected to Spinner's Rock, which it wasn't, I hasten to add.
- Insufficient cause for action.<eos> And my name gets dragged through the mud by some overpaid battle-axe.<eos> - What can I do, sir?<eos> - I'll get the lawyer back before five.<eos> You draft an apology, and personally deliver it.
Down here, the rules are a little more... flexible.<eos> I saw no reason to tempt you.<eos> The dilemma you are currently in is why.<eos> I'm not getting the pen for Cruella.<eos> I'm getting it for me.
Or if you just want to stay up here and be a teenager, that's... cool, too.<eos> Wait.<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> The Author's pen?<eos> I thought you destroyed it.
That wasn't me, Doc.<eos> That was some evil BS.<eos> After the murders, you created a complex delusion to justify your actions.<eos> It all hinged on an evil "Book."<eos> Ever since then, I've been trying to help you pinpoint that delusion, and destroy it.
I have a box of... of Russell Stover's if the spiders didn't get into 'em.<eos> Jared, is this about the fake users?<eos> You know?<eos> Two days ago, I wanted to look at user behavior to figure out what spurred the sudden uptick, and... well, I noticed something.<eos> Almost all of our new users were just uploading a single photo into a shared folder, and then the next day, they would take the photo out and then put it back in the day after that and that's it.
- She said she was tired. She was in distress, Andrew.<eos> I should have made her talk to me.<eos> All right, but when you did find that dress, you asked her about it.<eos> That was good. Well, my housekeeper, Pilar, found the dress in the trash on Tuesday.<eos> When Abby came home from school, I asked her why she'd thrown it away.
We need to control the CO2 concentrations.<eos> - Hyperventilating.<eos> - On it.<eos> We need to be packing.<eos> If we don't clip the source of the bleeding, no amount of packing is gonna stop it.
You're alive, oh.<eos> If you're wondering what you're hearing, it's me, Dr. Tobias M. Curtis, and I am talking to you because activity will help keep both of us warm-- me by working my jaw, and you by working your brain.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know I've called you cold and unfeeling, but this is ridiculous.<eos> But your heart is still warm, and you'll stay okay as long as we can keep it warm.
Yeah, but if I can reverse the generators, I can use the electrodes to pick up the sound waves and to hear through the ice.<eos> Footsteps and yells and any human sound would have to be Happy and Toby 'cause they're the only people around here.<eos> Precisely, so we need to get as close to them as possible.<eos> All right.<eos> We can slide it out on this to where we last saw Happy.
I'm so pissed at him, I'm gonna drink the last craft beer, even though it tastes like thick, soapy shampoo.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - No, give it to me.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Dude. Give it to me.
- What are you doing?<eos> - No, give it to me.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Dude. Give it to me.<eos> - I was gonna drink it.
Did it ever occur to you that Liam may have killed Kate to cover it up?<eos> I'm looking for her.<eos> Her name is Carly.<eos> How did you get that photo?<eos> Your wife sent it to me right before she died.
So this is a letter that I wrote to Josh our last day of camp.<eos> I was gonna give it to him and then he...<eos> You know, he broke up with me.<eos> So I was gonna mail it to him, then I decided not to.<eos> So I decided to burn it, but then I didn't do that, either.
So, while we're waiting for the sun to go down, I want to show you something.<eos> I was going through some old stuff the other day, and I randomly came across this old letter it's from our Camp Canyon Grove...<eos> Oh! Days, yeah.<eos> And I was like, "oh, my God, I have to show Josh this letter."<eos> So, do you, do you want me to read it?
While I endorse the cartel's candidacy for this crime, I don't think we should put all our eggs in one basket, so you assist the Captain.<eos> I'll enlist Detective Bell to commandeer the Omar Velez case...<eos> Because the person who killed him is probably the same one who put a bomb in his gut.<eos> So, this is where Omar Velez's body was discovered.<eos> Apparently, the jogger who found it almost tripped, it was so close to the path.
Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.<eos> Concerns that have been resolved through hours of conversation and reviewing the data.<eos> President Shwe got on board for a very good reason.<eos> If Conrad would call me back...<eos> President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.
The guy doesn't have a coat on.<eos> Says, he gave it to his kid, 'cause he couldn't afford a new one.<eos> Your dad takes off his own coat...<eos> It was vicuna, I remember.<eos> ...and he just gives it to the guy.
Apparently, they, uh, they had a verbal agreement.<eos> You mean the bet?<eos> A verbal agreement.<eos> And it is unorthodox, but it is binding.<eos> I mean, Mr. Quincannon had me look into it, and, well... well, sure enough, I mean, there are municipal statutes that go back to the 1800s, so...
That I'm a silly little girl whose head was turned by the first man who paid her any attention.<eos> Quite the opposite, cousin.<eos> I think you are the most remarkable woman that I know.<eos> All I am asking is that you stop - just for a second.<eos> Ignore your heart, because I've no doubt that you've given it to him.
I do it only because I care about you as I have always cared about you.<eos> I'm still the same Matthew.<eos> You once called me your North Star the one you trusted above all others.<eos> Trust me now.<eos> So, what will you do with the Havisham fortune once you get your grubby little hands on it?
Today, the villagers that live among the ruins of that Empire believe that Supay has returned to live amongst them.<eos> But this creature is no devil, it is an alien fugitive,<eos> the Manhunter.<eos> One we've been hunting for for so long.<eos> And we've finally found it.
Think they'll show?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Don't really care.<eos> Either way, I'm getting my jolts.<eos> You see, Cat, I'm still 50-50 if your heart's actually beating, but I'm gonna stop it anyway.
Do you keep a gun in the house?<eos> I have a gun.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a carry permit.<eos> But I keep it locked in the car.
It is not.<eos> Honestly, it's not so great.<eos> Bunch, I'm here to give you an out.<eos> We are here with a settlement offer.<eos> Great, we'd love to hear it.
The estate belongs to him.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - It's fine.<eos> He says he wants no part of it.<eos> But if you can't prove it's yours, we're no longer free to raise the money on it.
She sold it me... in return for taking her to Settle.<eos> She were going after her boy.<eos> He'd run away.<eos> It's in a shop there.<eos> I pawned it.
Disconnect from Arkadia.<eos> That would be unwise.<eos> The migration is still incomplete and the backpack is now compromised.<eos> Without Arkadia's mainframe, the mobile unit would be my sole power source.<eos> If they destroy it... I will be terminated.
This is what it must be like for Kim Kardashian to enter a room.<eos> All right, it's pretty simple.<eos> One picture.<eos> And don't worry if you get a boner.<eos> We'll crop it out.
Oskar?<eos> Wait.<eos> This... This internal investigation...<eos> There won't be one.<eos> I've managed to avert it.
Come on, Marvin. Can't we stop here for a second?<eos> Pumpkin<eos> My little pumpkin,<eos> I like to think about other girls sometimes, but the truth is if you ever left me,<eos> I'd tear my heart out and never put it back.
There's a baby out there with our name on it.<eos> Before you know it, we'll be up all hours of the night knee-deep in dirty diapers.<eos> Got a lot of leftover pacifiers from my rave days, so...<eos> You know what I'm looking forward to?<eos> Holding a baby in a rocking chair, hearing that little rumble in the diaper and knowing I don't have to change it.
I don't know anymore.<eos> Do you want me to talk?<eos> I was in love.<eos> He died.<eos> I found out he left me a message that he loved me, but I didn't get it.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]<eos> You churned ice cream?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did the kids like it?<eos> - They loved it.
Hey.<eos> Alex is gone.<eos> Dean, listen, I just found an old school map.<eos> Uh, there's a building that used to be the pool.<eos> They closed it down because it had asbestos.
Six years ago, you got a call from Will Gardener, on your voice mail, and I erased it.<eos> You were about to go on stage and stand beside Peter for his SA run, and I didn't want to hurt that.<eos> I listened to the message.<eos> Will said he loved you and would give up everything to be with you.<eos> And I erased it.
I'm from Iowa.<eos> I went to Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, and I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe in Governor Florrick.<eos> Look at Obama with health care.<eos> That was an unpleasant thing.<eos> - But he did it.
- I really want to apologize.<eos> - As do I.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I never should have been so aggressive in my critique.<eos> And I should not have asked for a critique if unprepared to hear it.
Well... it would be an honor.<eos> ♪ All we do is hide away<eos> Cassie?<eos> Mind if I call you Cassie?<eos> I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
Yes.<eos> I think before your first levee, we should probably try to find a throne that fits.<eos> It is hard to be dignified when your feet are six inches from the floor.<eos> You see, I don't understand why this place is called a house not a palace.<eos> Well, you can call it whatever you like, Ma'am.
I think if you examine this evidence, you could safely make a finding.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> This would be a good time for one of you to talk.<eos> Uh, first of all, all any of this, uh, shows is that a boat blew up.<eos> None of it unearths any new evidence of wrongdoing or confirms it.
Don't listen.<eos> But I got news for you, pal!<eos> It's not your blood that's thick, it's your head!<eos> Where'd you get that cookie?<eos> You know damn well where I got it.
Everyone thinks I should be a lawyer one day.<eos> Well, I mean, I...<eos> - I don't have money for one now, so...<eos> - You don't need one.<eos> All you have to do is fill out this petition for a pardon and submit it along with the letters of support from Ana and her parents.
I mean, no offense.<eos> I'm gonna take a little offense.<eos> Sorry, not for you.<eos> He's gotta make sure it's safe first.<eos> Uh, we've never used it on a previously cured subject.
Pull yourself together, next time I call to reschedule, make yourself available.<eos> And when you see Drake, tell him I'm looking for him.<eos> Ugh! Milk's gone bad.<eos> Did it?<eos> I just bought it yesterday.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> He's gone!<eos> Let's start in the garage!<eos> Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.
- The sub?<eos> Submarine!<eos> - The sub?<eos> The sub.<eos> Since sonic waves bounce off metal, we could modify the equipment and turn it into an ultrasound and in theory, that would let us see into the box.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> Uh, not for getting mad, but I... I walked away, and I should have stayed there and had it out with you right then and there. Okay, okay, so, is that what we're about to do right now?<eos> Are we just gonna have it out?<eos> N-No. No.<eos> You wrote a great apology. You drove across town. You slipped it under my door.
Just like your boss said, you don't have enough for a profile yet.<eos> Why are we back here?<eos> You've been here before, when you were 15 years old.<eos> If I visited this place when I was 15, I would remember that.<eos> Because you didn't visit it, you built it.
Yes.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I have eyes.<eos> And he said that he loved her, and I was worried about Alicia getting this voice mail in the middle of a campaign, so...<eos> I erased it.
- No judgment.<eos> - We saved your life.<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here.<eos> Uh, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast.
I'll try but you won't believe me.<eos> There can be no good without evil.<eos> But evil must first be confronted before it can be driven out.<eos> What I do is take the evil from those who come seeking salvation.<eos> Where do you take it?
Let me see it.<eos> The fuel is the weapon.<eos> Okay?<eos> The fuel's what does all the damage.<eos> You can't test it because you're not supposed to have it.
I make no judgment on the rights or wrongs of it, Bob.<eos> My investigation leaves me in no doubt as to the nature of Jacob Marley and I can only imagine the strain of trying to provide for a family at Christmas, under the weight of a loan you couldn't afford.<eos> No-one would blame a man for buckling under the burden of all that.<eos> When my Emily was expecting Martha, we were trying to get our own place, but we didn't have the money.<eos> So she pressed her mother's garnet necklace into my hand, watched me pawn it.
And I call her "Meemaw""<eos> because, well, just, well, look at her.<eos> It's interesting that<eos> Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don't.<eos> Oh, well, you know, now-now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.
Yes.<eos> Penny, did you know about this?<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> When did you get an engagement ring?<eos> My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
Those were Ted's last words.<eos> There's also this.<eos> Ted saying the exact same thing to Regan seconds earlier.<eos> Protect the innocent ones.<eos> But this time, just to make sure the message gets through, he hammers it home in Hunter clicks.
All right, get changed.<eos> Hunters have proved a formidable enemy.<eos> Is detention really an option?<eos> We have the element of surprise.<eos> We've chosen our location, we can surround it and control.
His sleeve rides up here.<eos> There's a mole on his right wrist, shaped like... Iceland.<eos> I'll ask someone to check the bikers we have in custody.<eos> I take it CSU is still processing the scene?<eos> I'd like to see it.
Detective Hagen.<eos> This is Detective Riba, your union delegate.<eos> We know you did it, Lisa.<eos> I confess, we were stumped for quite some time, trying to work out how you and Detective Dunning shot that video.<eos> Then we realized it was more a question of where you shot it.
But until I knew you, I didn't know you.<eos> Every lie I have ever told you has become true, every falsehood is undone, every promise remade.<eos> Because although it was never part of my plan, you have stolen my heart.<eos> And you have broken mine.<eos> Then give me the slightest glimmer of hope, and I will stay and I will repair it.
- Amelia, please, come with me.<eos> - No!<eos> I don't wish to change!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I must wear it until my heart has healed itself.
Please!<eos> Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.
Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.<eos> Well, what if they don't?<eos> They have dogs for that sort of thing, don't they?<eos> They'll sniff it out.
The only way that you could have had it was if you saw Alexander after the funeral.<eos> Put the matches away.<eos> I think death might be a release!<eos> Is this where it happened?<eos> Alexander's body was found in the workshop, but I don't think you were strong enough to have carried it far, so it must have happened nearby.
He pinches the family silverware for the buy-in.<eos> Oh, that fits.<eos> Rumour has it, he has light fingers.<eos> He steals the silver for gambling?<eos> ! He wins it back.
That address sound familiar to you?<eos> I'm drawing a blank.<eos> That's funny.<eos> A stash house in Little Village.<eos> We busted it five years ago.
Philosophy, democracy, my brother-in-law.<eos> So to all of you, I say welcome!<eos> As a rule, the food here is pretty ordinary.<eos> The wine is usually rather good.<eos> And I have made sure there is plenty of it.
Nor bathrooms.<eos> And I've sold off most of the good shooting and fishing.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> You're really not a salesman.<eos> In fact, the place is in such a state, I'd sooner make a gift of it.
- (tires screeching) - Good-bye.<eos> Oh, God, it's perfect.<eos> Thanks, man!<eos> (laughter)<eos> - If it feel loose or anything like that, it's not because I tried it on, okay?
What's wrong?<eos> You don't like it.<eos> No, um, fantastique.<eos> Where did you say this dish was from?<eos> I think I've had it somewhere before.
This isn't for you. I'm doing this for Amy.<eos> - Doing what for me?<eos> - Yeah, Karma, what's going on?<eos> Amy, please...<eos> I don't know what you're up to, but I'm on a date with Felix, and I don't want anyone ruining it.
Mason.<eos> He's almost three...<eos> Um... and it's... it's not open for discussion.<eos> I had sex with Zoey because I thought since you never said anything about my letter that you were over me.<eos> She's probably the one who took it out of my purse, you know.
Waiting for you... to go strike the sets.<eos> Well, what if we didn't?<eos> I... I just talked to Nick and he's gonna talk to his dad about letting us keep the show at the warehouse for, like, a real run.<eos> I mean, we could... we could like, charge admission.<eos> You know, I mean, there's been all this buzz, you know, from people who... who haven't seen it or... or want to see it again.
Then one year, rumor has it, the husband wakes up one Christmas morning, grabs a large kitchen knife, slices his wife's throat open, stabs his little kids to death, then slits his own wrists.<eos> Huh. No motive was ever determined.<eos> God.<eos> Cut to the 1960s.<eos> Woman named Mary Meghan Fisher decided to buy up the place, turned it into an old-school arcade... pinball machines, Skee-Ball, the likes.
Went right through her neck, clean.<eos> Killed her right on the spot.<eos> What in the f... are you telling me this for, man?<eos> Place remained dormant until 2000, when Ned Bosham bought up the joint under the name Fun Society Amusement LLC.<eos> Ned wanted to reopen it as a classic arcade.
The public records are in limbo.<eos> People down in county don't even want to touch the place.<eos> I'm siphoning electricity from the grid.<eos> As far as anyone's concerned, it don't exist.<eos> Now, on the market, this joint would run you about 5 grand a month, but since it's you, I'll give it to your guy for half.
No prints, no DNA.<eos> There's not even a speck of dust in this device.<eos> Is that the code that ran the video loop?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> We're just about to take it apart and see the magic.
Oh, cool!<eos> I hate this place!<eos> _<eos> There has to be a trick, right?<eos> We can't trick it into thinking we're powerful.
No, no!<eos> Kady...<eos> Julia, run, run.<eos> Kady, that was my hermit who healed your heart.<eos> And now, I'm going to taste it.
I guess you got to decide on whether or not you believe I'm your friend.<eos> Uh, hey, Les, I know you asked for us not to do this, but I know you've been a little down and I kind of wanted to get you a birthday gift.<eos> - I hope you like it.<eos> - You got me a candy necklace?<eos> I love it!
Looking for the necklace.<eos> What...?<eos> What necklace?<eos> The seahorse Danny gave me.<eos> Dad took it.
Why do you say that?<eos> Plus, obviously, you have something in your hand.<eos> We found the ring.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I was saving it for a special occasion.
We found the ring.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I was saving it for a special occasion.<eos> It's the closest thing I have to a family heirloom.<eos> I want you to have it,
What... what letter?<eos> - Brandon: Vogue, well...<eos> - It's perfect.<eos> I wrote you a letter and I put it in your bag.<eos> Well, I... I never got it.
The crown is so heavy and far too big for me.<eos> I thought it might slip down over my nose in the Abbey.<eos> Really, Ma'am?<eos> You looked so serene.<eos> My heart was beating so fast I thought the Archbishop would see it through my shift.
She should never have left you.<eos> I would never do such a thing.<eos> No.<eos> I believe when you give your heart it will be without hesitation.<eos> But you cannot give it to me.
No.<eos> I believe when you give your heart it will be without hesitation.<eos> But you cannot give it to me.<eos> I think you have it already.<eos> No, you must keep it intact for someone else.
Next Friday, Ma'am.<eos> - They are to be hanged, drawn and quartered?<eos> - That is the punishment for treason, Ma'am.<eos> I believe some bishops are organising a petition for clemency.<eos> Then I should like to sign it.
Marry and start a family your subjects can be proud of.<eos> When you give your heart, it will be without hesitation, but you cannot give it to me.
Just hurry up and produce a son so I may be a godfather, yeah.<eos> Make sure you look after my brother.<eos> You will miss him very much?<eos> I hope you have enjoyed your stay, sir.<eos> I will never forget it.
Let me guess.<eos> She, uh, gave you a spell.<eos> Yes.<eos> A return-to-love spell.<eos> All I had to do was chant it and...
Disappearing at odd hours, and then she couldn't look me in the eye.<eos> And then news of that gold coin heist broke, and I... I don't know.<eos> I knew.<eos> And I was the one who arrested her.<eos> So, did you ask for the ring back, or did you let her keep that so she could trade it for cigarettes in the prison yard?
I'm not buying any of it.<eos> You didn't break out of prison just because your old man was kicking the bucket.<eos> He has your share of the gold.<eos> When you found out he had a stroke, you panicked because you were worried that his new wife was gonna steal your gold.<eos> The thing I don't get is, why didn't you just have your partner on the outside get it for you?
- I'm going home.<eos> - I wouldn't.<eos> Because there's a 3D imaging radar device being flown in from Martinique in the morning.<eos> And when this storm has passed, they're going to send it up into the jungle.<eos> And if there is a body up there... .. they're going to find it.
You ruined mom's life.<eos> - Hmm. - Stop.<eos> I am now very happy I have all of you.<eos> But I just can't take care of another living creature.<eos> Then why'd you bring it home?
- Hmm. - Stop.<eos> I am now very happy I have all of you.<eos> But I just can't take care of another living creature.<eos> Then why'd you bring it home?<eos> I couldn't leave it in the street.
You were told multiple times the firm would have nothing - to do with this device.<eos> - I didn't take it to help broker a sale.<eos> It all happened in the moment.<eos> When they arrested him,<eos> Howell panicked and stashed it in my cubicle.
Well, you're eating a jelly doughnut in the middle of the afternoon, and eating is your coping mechanism, so...<eos> Or, yeah, maybe I'm just hungry.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Hey, speaking of being in denial, I really think you should read your father's file.<eos> Okay, have you read it?
Yes.<eos> Is there anything in it related to the case?<eos> No.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I'm not reading it.
Probably an undergraduate.<eos> Well, I talked to security.<eos> Kids who found the body used a friend's key card to get in, but nobody else opened the door since Friday.<eos> Look at this window.<eos> The, uh, rubber sealant's been peeled off, and someone threaded a wire through there and opened it.
It says here Patrick told authorities he got through the assault by focusing on sand."<eos> His attacker made him stare at an hourglass while the abuse went on.<eos> He was told that if he didn't cry until all the sand emptied out, he wouldn't be killed.<eos> So the trauma of the assault was fused with the image of an hourglass.<eos> And launched an obsession with time, so much so that he went on to build devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision.
- Did you already bind the 120s?<eos> - Yeah, this should do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> Cook you like barbecue chicken?<eos> - I traced it back.
A dozen.<eos> Because of your recklessness.<eos> Are you seriously trying to teach me lessons?<eos> I'm not teaching, I'm telling.<eos> I was the senior officer, I made a call, and you ignored it.
Capitalism.<eos> I never thought I'd say these words but... I'm having a horrible time at a strip club.<eos> Hey, Trent, can you stop twerking for a second?<eos> Stop twerking. and tell me where you pawned Candace's grandmother's ring?<eos> News flash, I never pawned it.

Felt like judging.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Totally didn't mean that at all.<eos> Anyway, um, Raf and I have this glider.<eos> We love it because it is so comfortable, especially if you're gonna be up long nights, feeding the baby...
- Hans. It's your country.<eos> I don't have the means to arrest him if and when the time comes.<eos> Come on, do you think that a German court will begrudge you a warrantless wiretap urgently needed - to stop a possible terrorist attack?<eos> - What attack would that be?<eos> Would you rather get ahead of it or find out after it happens?
They open up?<eos> A little, but nothing damning.<eos> They're acting like normal, lying, sexed-up teenagers.<eos> Buying lingerie.<eos> Well, can't buy it in Syria.
You never would have remembered about Oswald if it weren't for me, okay?<eos> This isn't just about you. It's about me too.<eos> I know from Al's file that Lee keeps his rifle at Ruth Paine's house.<eos> If he doesn't have the gun, he can't shoot Kennedy.<eos> We'll go get it.
To do something right.<eos> I don't understand what's happening. Are you... Are you trying to stop me?<eos> I don't want any of this to happen, not again.<eos> You don't want what to happen again, the assassination?<eos> That's why I'm here. I'm trying to stop it.

McGurk:<eos> Early July of 2010 we received a call that said that this piece of malware was discovered and could we take a look at it.<eos> When we first started the analysis, there was that "Oh, crap" moment, you know, where we sat there and said, this is something that's significant.<eos> It's impacting industrial control.<eos> It can disrupt it to the point where it could cause harm and not only damage to the equipment, but potentially harm or loss of life.
To this day, no one in the U.S. or Israeli governments has officially acknowledged the existence of the joint operation.<eos> I would never compromise ongoing operations in the field, but we should be able to talk about capability.<eos> We can talk about our... Bunker busters, why not our cyber weapons?<eos> I mean, the secrecy of the operation has been blown.<eos> Our friends in Israel took a weapon that we jointly developed, in part to keep Israel from doing something crazy, and then used it on their own in a way that blew the cover of the operation and could have led to war.

It's a hoard of around 200 rare antique silver coins.<eos> Sorry, do you mean, like, actual treasure?<eos> It's not quite the terminology we'd use, but, in layman's terms, yeah, treasure.<eos> And that's why you're here, to find the silver?<eos> Well, we already found it.
...when actually all there was was... silence.<eos> Tosh, where are you?<eos> You then left the bar to go and find Tosh's body at Newton's boat.<eos> Which is where things didn't play out quite as you'd intended.<eos> You see, your plan was to stumble upon the crime scene as you, Sam, had left it, Tosh's body on the floor and Newton asleep with the knife in his hand.
Marcus?<eos> Hey, I thought you guys would want to know Vincent Bader's body turned up.<eos> The M.E. is taking a look right now.<eos> The body was found wrapped in tarp and tied with rope.<eos> A couple spotted it off a path in Forest Park.
Not so much.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Everyone's saying how it was too dark to see anything.<eos> Too dark in a brightly lit diner?<eos> Well, they've been renting it out as pop-up nightclub sometimes.
- You're lying.<eos> - No.<eos> And here it is.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> We'll take it in together.
Thank you.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> We need to take a look at the AB-33 section, okay?<eos> The message is muddled.<eos> I wrote it, and I don't even know what it says.
- Norma, why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Because it's embarrassing.<eos> I was so excited when I first showed Norman this place.<eos> I had so many ideas on how to fix it.<eos> It's an amazing house, and I just kind of gave up on it, but... I feel like taking it on.
No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did you know that Norman had this letter?<eos> It's... it's meant for Emma.<eos> It's from her mom, and, uh, I found it here the other day.
In here.<eos> In... in Norman's room.<eos> That's a weird place for it to be.<eos> Well... Let me see it.<eos> Do you think that maybe she gave it to him when she stayed at the motel?
I didn't want to get in the middle of it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> But why did Norman have this letter?<eos> Oh, she tried to give it to me too.
Fine.<eos> But why did Norman have this letter?<eos> Oh, she tried to give it to me too.<eos> I wouldn't take it.<eos> I-I guess she gave it to Norman.
By the time she was rushed into hospital, the baby had stopped moving.<eos> The hemorrhaging got worse.<eos> Two hours later, the patient was dead.<eos> You handed me your resignation the next day.<eos> And you refused to accept it, because I'd been proven innocent.
Dody?<eos> How are you?<eos> Uh, you-you got my letter?<eos> It came this morning.<eos> I-I've read it through only a dozen times.
Is that ever a thing?<eos> - I don't know, eyebrows. Let's say I ate a meatball sub and some chocolate and a bunch of cheese.<eos> I'm gonna have a shit inside me like a rock.<eos> It's my right to eat some prunes, liquidate that shit and piss it out of my asshole.<eos> I don't have to pass it fucking solid.
Yeah, no, real crazy.<eos> When I think of impulse buys, I think of Altoids or a flashlight keychain.<eos> Well, I guess congratulations.<eos> Wait, what is that look on your face?<eos> I've never seen it before.
- You're funny.<eos> - It's good, right?<eos> - It's really good.<eos> - Told you you'd like this place.<eos> - I can't believe I never noticed it.
I'll be right back.<eos> Where you going?<eos> To get my keys.<eos> The case isn't being reassigned till tomorrow.<eos> That means we got tonight to solve it.
And what about the ones who didn't?<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your wedding ring.<eos> They never gave it to me.
Yeah.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> It's in my drawer.<eos> Are you gonna take it back?
- If it keeps going like this...<eos> - It's all a lot of upkeep.<eos> If she didn't want a ring on her finger, why does she care what I do with it?<eos> Because it's just sitting in that drawer like a loaded gun.<eos> And every time we have sex or a fight, he could just pull it out and point it at me.
Grey needs to chill 'cause it's not even her case.<eos> Shepherd could cut her some slack.<eos> It was her case.<eos> It was supposed to be my case.<eos> Do you think I should tell him to take it back?
It was her case.<eos> It was supposed to be my case.<eos> Do you think I should tell him to take it back?<eos> Jo, you already did.<eos> If you wanted it, you'd be wearing it.
'Cause that would be hell.<eos> [CHUCKLES] No offense, but your timing sucks.<eos> You know why I brought Jen here.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I want you to take that ring out of your pocket and kindly throw it out the window.
It was a long story.<eos> What's in this vault?<eos> Something that can't be let out.<eos> Gonna need you to be a little more specific.<eos> First you have to swear that you'll never open it.
Still a child.<eos> That surgeon, Enys, I reckon 'twas he I shoulda killed.<eos> Try to remember, Mark.<eos> Where did you go next?<eos> Just above the gunnies, bearing right, there's an old pick down there, I took it up, began to cast around.

I just needed time.<eos> And you're sure it had nothing to do with the destruction of a Mikkei research facility on Iriden 3?<eos> They were illegally conducting research into white hole technology, and it literally blew up in their faces.<eos> That's only the official version.<eos> Unofficially, there were rumors that the device was stolen from another corp and delivered by a third party in a ploy to test it and let Mikkei take the fall.
That's why.<eos> Yeah, he was screwing my little girl.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Last week, Brie came by, And while I cooked dinner, She took our dog for a walk and left her phone on the counter.<eos> It lit up with a text from Bobby, and I saw it.
Yes.<eos> Later.<eos> Okay, her note said for me to meet her here, which means I can be ambushed from here, here, or here.<eos> Also gives Alice an escape route through this tunnel, that access door, this steam vent.<eos> She picked this area. It's because she's familiar with it.
Sure.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> She's... she's wearing her wedding dress.<eos> Was that not discussed?<eos> Your father brought it by earlier.
This looks more like a squad room than a home.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Jane, you need a break.<eos> I mean, a home is a refuge... a place where you're supposed - to get away from your problems.<eos> - Till some psycho burns it down.
Yes, it did.<eos> Well, then why has he got a peanut butter granola bar?<eos> I mean... that can't be good for him, right?<eos> It's a postal barcode.<eos> - Why did he hide it there?
Well, then why has he got a peanut butter granola bar?<eos> I mean... that can't be good for him, right?<eos> It's a postal barcode.<eos> - Why did he hide it there?<eos> - Maybe it was the only way he could get it out without anyone noticing.
Yeah, the post office has this cool Mail Isolation and Tracking Program.<eos> It takes pictures of every piece of mail at its origin point.<eos> So if Miami has pictures of the package that's attached to this barcode, we can see who was supposed to receive it.<eos> Yes.<eos> How to get ahold of it, though?
I had just lost my wife.<eos> I-I couldn't lose my stepdaughter, too.<eos> Exactly what did you do?<eos> Clair and I came up with the story that Michelle fell down the stairs.<eos> I took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility and hid it.
I waited for her to... to come back home and, uh, we...<eos> She had called 9-1-1.<eos> And why hang on to the murder weapon?<eos> I-I didn't know what to do with it.<eos> Didn't have time to destroy it so I just hid it, figured that I'd deal with it later.
Wait a minute.<eos> This is the same model bike that our victim was riding.<eos> [Beep] And look what's below the seat.<eos> - Frankie: A water bottle mount.<eos> - If an explosive was in the bottle, someone could've planted it long before our victim even got on his bike.
You know, if you move back, I could help you with T.J.<eos> No smothering.<eos> I don't know, Ma.<eos> I'm just putting it out there.<eos> I mean, it's your decision, and I'll respect it.

After the search got called off, they stopped.<eos> My uncle...<eos> He did his best to... to try and help with the upkeep.<eos> But it was... it was like the life got sucked out of the place.<eos> The flowers died, the grass turned brown, and by the time they sold it, the whole yard was just weeds and dead leaves.

Look, and she's 10 miles away from the murder scene.<eos> When does she get off?<eos> She stays on there for a couple of hours, like she is in a dream.<eos> Why confess to a crime that she didn't commit?<eos> Maybe she was made to by the person who really did it.

I was simply looking for an item that I had lost track of.<eos> Years ago, I had brought an antique ring over from London.<eos> It was intended as a gift for the Countess of Morcar.<eos> I may be visiting the countess shortly, so I remembered the ring.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Yes, he has, on occasion.<eos> When he wants to keep something out of sight and mind.<eos> Me, for example.<eos> This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.
This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.<eos> I never had him pegged as the sentimental type.<eos> As it turns out, he isn't.<eos> He was just holding onto it in case he needed it.
I'm not responsible for her drug use, nor for any of the proclivities I may have inherited from her.<eos> On the other hand, I really am no fan of abdicating personal responsibility.<eos> Hence the repetition of the step.<eos> Are you going to give your father the ring?<eos> So that he can give it to some corrupt official who may have some specious information to sell?

Well, this one looks like it's been here forever, and this one looks like it's brand new.<eos> Is that important?<eos> It is if it means this one used to have a bomb strapped to it.<eos> Krasnov would not have risked assembling an explosive device in the back of a water truck.<eos> He would have prepared it and strapped it to the hand truck in advance.

I open it.<eos> I'm thinking it's that weird neighbor asking if his Burmese python is loose in my yard again.<eos> But, no, it's Cameron, and... she has this look on her face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
I'll tell you, I was surprised when our Air Force attaché told me he'd just received a landing clearance request - for the Director's plane.<eos> - I don't have a lot of time, Franzen.<eos> I have a letter for the Ambassador. - It's from the White House.<eos> - I'll deliver it.<eos> No, I will deliver it.
I've been doing Pilatskis.<eos> Like Pilates, only instead of rubber bands you do it with big airplane tires.<eos> Oh, mama, you're back to your shot-putting weight.<eos> Feel my thigh, eh?<eos> Squeeze it.
Sounds convenient.<eos> - Sounds like good business to me.<eos> - Cooper intentionally gave you businesswoman blue balls just to torture you.<eos> - It's rather cruel.<eos> - And I bought his favorite golf course last year and turned it into a landfill for medical waste.
I can't see another way to save this place.<eos> Well, then, we need to look harder, Detective.<eos> This is about more than me.<eos> I mean, do you know the history of sin in this place?<eos> It was a, an institution decades before I ran it.
Yeah, like you found that "artifact."<eos> Face it, Adam, your "Satan feather," is faker than my stepmom's Chinatown Fendi.<eos> It's real.<eos> It's a rock. Well, it's fossilized. A feather from Lucifer's wing.<eos> The seller excavated it from one of his crypts.
You could be my plus-one.<eos> How much is here?<eos> ‭$500.<eos> (exhales) That dress cost me four grand.<eos> Yeah, and I sold it for a thousand dollars.
You'd give me 80,000 for this place?<eos> I never thought it was worth that much.<eos> Do you remember our conversation yesterday?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> You said that you'd sell it to me.
I'm looking for your father.<eos> I haven't been able to track him down anywhere.<eos> He's travelling today.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I got this letter by courier, just a little while ago, and the man who delivered it to me said that he stood by and watched your father write it.
Clearly, there was no intentional wrongdoing here.<eos> Still, uh, we don't want this to happen to anyone else.<eos> That's why I think it would be best if we do an autopsy, so that we can get a full picture of exactly what happened.<eos> The body's already been released to the funeral home.<eos> We'd need your consent to get it back.
Conscious synthetics.<eos> Explain your anomalous behaviour.<eos> As I understand it, I feel.<eos> And then I need you to figure out how he got like this.<eos> - I'll need to take it apart.
Is it because of this dough that the guy got killed?<eos> We'll have to sweep the area.<eos> I'll call forensics.<eos> We found your tree.<eos> We went to the woods and found it.
8,000 euros.<eos> What happened in the woods?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you didn't make the tree up.<eos> You saw it.
They're everywhere.<eos> All four targets are converging on us, sir.<eos> We cannot turn back.<eos> This is my minefield.<eos> I designed it.
Lieutenant Martin told me you want to study Fine Arts,<eos> and you need a letter of recommendation.<eos> I have a mission.<eos> A mission?<eos> The one with the courage to carry it out will leave here with medals, I assure you.
I really shouldn't be here, Dad.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're my daughter.<eos> Whose office is in the chain of custody of the leaked video.<eos> Did you leak it?
♪ I think I love you. ♪<eos> What is this... karaoke night?<eos> ♪ This morning, I woke up with a feeling ♪ ♪ I didn't know how to deal with ♪<eos> ♪ And so I just decided to myself ♪<eos> ♪ I'd hide it to myself ♪
_ What did you do, Kenny? They're saying it's kids!<eos> That you've been looking at kids!<eos> And Lindsey saw it.<eos> There's a video of you.<eos> All of her friends have got it!
What are you talking about?<eos> You agreed to have your Mass implant put in.<eos> Set up.<eos> Every soldier does.<eos> We can't just embed it and feed you a dream.
You agreed to have your Mass implant put in.<eos> Set up.<eos> Every soldier does.<eos> We can't just embed it and feed you a dream.<eos> Your mind would reject it.
Set up.<eos> Every soldier does.<eos> We can't just embed it and feed you a dream.<eos> Your mind would reject it.<eos> You have to accept it.
- Nice greenhouse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.<eos> Colony Collapse Disorder.<eos> We still don't know what's behind it.
Why don't you just say it, Ross? "I'm going to Elizabeth."<eos> The letter was not from her.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Here...<eos> Read it if you wish.
There's also nothing to suggest he will.<eos> Dr. Latham.<eos> Um...<eos> I realize, like every doctor who teaches here, you have your own methods.<eos> But, I assume, if I have an opinion, you'd like to hear it.
This is my calling.<eos> Open it.<eos> Is this my resume?<eos> The minute you came in to interview as my assistant, I had an instinct about you.<eos> So I scribbled "reporter" on your resume, and I stuffed it right here in this drawer, and I hired you on the spot.
Marge, thank you for setting me straight.<eos> You're welcome. Okay, I want to open this show with someone being shot into a cannon.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> You're joking, right? Well, because, see, that's impossible.<eos> Gah! Oh. Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show, so I'm shutting it down.
Demons are... metaphors.<eos> Do you think I don't know that?<eos> Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to sit here and sound like this?<eos> But I am telling you, something is going on.<eos> There is a presence, and I feel it.
I'm glad that wasn't the case.<eos> So who didn't maintain radio properly?<eos> Was it you, Fenn?<eos> It was my fault, sir.<eos> I forgot to clean it before we headed out.
Got it.<eos> Hey, lock it down.<eos> Swagger, before you say another word, you and Fenn will insert tonight under the cover of darkness at a place of your choosing.<eos> You watch over me and Rahim when we go in.<eos> Any hostile action, you end it.
I'll be careful.<eos> How many secret hideouts do you have?<eos> It's a secret.<eos> You're such a shit.<eos> Baby, remember where this place is, but don't write it down.
My buddy has one of your cars.<eos> I... excuse me, a closed timelike what?<eos> Right.<eos> Say, this, is the fabric of space-time.<eos> Now, if you get a powerful enough gravitational field, you could actually bend it back on itself, creating a kind of loop that would allow you to cross over to an earlier point.
So...<eos> We will just have the check, please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I don't normally like risotto, but if you put it in a ball form, and-and deep fry it, I can eat, like, a thousand of them.
Did you tell anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I was too afraid.<eos> They said they'd kill me... that I'd never see my son, Ali, again...<eos> And that I would die a whore because they had video. They were gonna make it look like I was having fun, then send it to my family.
We have to leave by 8:30 at the latest.<eos> Do you really think I'd forget On the biggest day of my baby's life?<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> Will you hang the dress up in my closet?<eos> Actually, uh, do you mind if I wear it tonight?
Calm down.<eos> I have a few repairs to do on the house.<eos> Now that Fiona has dropped the ball...<eos> Okay.<eos> Someone's got to pick it up, and that someone is me.
Nope.<eos> Debbie?<eos> Brought you some hot cocoa.<eos> This is breast milk.<eos> Do you want me to walk it up?
I don't scare easy.<eos> I'm gonna shower.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Great TV.<eos> Who bought it?
Think about it.<eos> Great TV.<eos> Who bought it?<eos> You did, with your credit card, and then I called and returned it and canceled the order.<eos> Then you bought it again, so we kept it.
I'm not, I just don't want to sell.<eos> You got a lot of folks throwing 90 grand at you?<eos> It's not about the money.<eos> I-I mean, I-I fixed this place up myself.<eos> I could have jumped ship right after I bought it and I didn't.
Couple more weeks like this and you're cash.<eos> You're stressed cause of that Margo lady?<eos> Well, I'm thinking about her offer.<eos> What about Etta?<eos> Well, I didn't say I was taking it, but I'm-I'm trying to think of good reasons not to.
- Oh, you're gonna love this.<eos> - Show her.<eos> You stole a ring.<eos> So what?<eos> How we acquired it is beside the point.
- Hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> She used to own this space.<eos> Flipped it.
I have a savings account.<eos> You got a bank account?<eos> Been working for a year.<eos> This is all the money in your account, Mr. Gallagher.<eos> Are you sure you want to close it?
I want my reality back, and I want it back right Goddamn no...<eos> I am not the enemy.<eos> I-I just want to know what's going on.<eos> Please, will somebody tell me what's going on, Please.<eos> More than 100 years ago, a man named Zachariah Webb built a machine that broke and went to the future, where these tattooed wackos found it and used it to swap souls.
Patrick Spring rarely left anything of importance to chance.<eos> When Patrick had me track you down... he knew.<eos> He knew he was going to die.<eos> Do you know, I'm beginning to think he didn't hire me to prevent his murder at all.<eos> I think he hired me to solve it.
All part of the job.<eos> No, it absolutely wasn't.<eos> Unless you're talking about your job at my detective agency.<eos> The machine!<eos> I left it in the car!
I have the other machine!<eos> So that means you follow me now.<eos> So you are gonna go off and collect whoever you can, whoever hasn't run away.<eos> My men are bringing in the relevant parties.<eos> I will have the machine tonight, and I will have it at the temple, and you will meet me there.
Okay, no, you were supposed to, um, give me that letter of recommendation by today.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, the letter, the letter, the letter.<eos> Okay, can I get it to you tonight?
Right.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, the letter, the letter, the letter.<eos> Okay, can I get it to you tonight?<eos> At literally, like, 2:00 a.m.<eos> Can you submit it at 2:00 a.m.?
I don't know, I'm just kind of getting the feeling that maybe you don't...<eos> want to write the letter.<eos> Oh, my God, no.<eos> You're hurting my heart.<eos> Of course I want to write it.
Oh, my God, no.<eos> You're hurting my heart.<eos> Of course I want to write it.<eos> Ugh! But Xiao just got here and I don't want to be rude, because he's an 11-year-old child.<eos> But, Paula, I will write it, okay?
Why are all my friends in love with this girl?<eos> So she's still working on the recommendation?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> But I'm... It's okay.<eos> She's gonna get it to me tonight.
It's engraved, and it has this nice stone, and it's silver...<eos> Who would want something as useless as that?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I was trying to work out how to pretend I liked it.<eos> Maybe Flynn left it for you.
Except for Media Studies.<eos> It's going to be harder than that.<eos> So, are we all, like, mates, then?<eos> I'm sorry. About your heart.<eos> We'll get it back - promise.
Cadmus has given him a metal endoskeleton.<eos> Traces of the alloy had to end up on my hands when I hit him.<eos> I can analyze it at the Fortress of Solitude.<eos> Agent Schott, get Non and Astra's anti-kryptonite technology out of storage.<eos> See if you can improve upon it for our two friends here.
- Quickly!<eos> - The-the death of our mother!<eos> Well, birth is the last thing that a Quill does, right?<eos> She gives birth to her litter and dies.<eos> And then, her body... And then you eat it, don't you? - God!
I ordered the breakfast combo, and he stole some of my bacon.<eos> If you want any other details, the answer is suck a dick.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Remember that movie?<eos> I used to love it growing up.
I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> See?<eos> I mean, we were pretty strange, remember?<eos> We had our own imaginary kingdom.<eos> You and Eddie made it up.
Shit.<eos> Run!<eos> Katie!<eos> So... that show?<eos> Did you bring it up, or did Katie bring it up?
The Iron Hill murders.<eos> The one they never found was Eddie.<eos> You guys remember "Candle Cove?"<eos> That show used to give me the worst nightmares.<eos> Katie just saw it.
I know it´s probably inappropriate.<eos> Where was this?<eos> Fremont. 2014.<eos> We´d have that file here.<eos> You can´t take it with you, but we´d probably have a room you could sit with it.
I told you, she's sleeping.<eos> Eddie?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Are you back because of the show?<eos> Do you know who made it?
- Hell, no.<eos> - You're writing again?<eos> Well, I mean, yes and no.<eos> - That's fantastic.<eos> - It is fantastic, and it's exciting, and it's dark, and it's brave, and it's very sad, and-- and the space that I want to conduct it at is this emerging art space in Brooklyn.
But the difference now is you're not fighting this alone. Is that a line?<eos> Is that what?<eos> April...<eos> The heart itself must slip through a tear in space and time in order to beat.<eos> It's only a matter of tracking it properly.
There's a way, trust me.<eos> And I have been authorised to say that if you help us solve our little problem here we may well be able to help you solve yours. Mine?<eos> How would you like to get that little creature out of your head once and for all?<eos> How would you like your own free will back, to do with whatever you please?<eos> Rhanis hoped the anchor on the heart alone would be enough to keep it in this world. I know this, Kharrus!
To stop the other...<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Remember?<eos> What did you say about the government?<eos> That we need to burn it down.
Dope.<eos> And you won't tell anyone about the stuff, right?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, God, Jess.<eos> Look, if I didn't save this crap, the tide would have swept it away.
You're welcome.<eos> Ow! What's up your butt?<eos> You're a liar, Todd!<eos> That's Diane's ring!<eos> So why are you throwing it in the sand?
I have a hard time believing you've forgotten.<eos> You loved that dress.<eos> The last time I saw you wearing it was the night I was sent away from the palace the night father died.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I threw it out.
Ex.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Now he's someone else's problem.<eos> So, why is he chasing you?<eos> Well, I-I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it on the neck of J.P.'s new wife.
Now he's someone else's problem.<eos> So, why is he chasing you?<eos> Well, I-I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it on the neck of J.P.'s new wife.<eos> - Yeah. - Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.
- Yeah. - Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.
So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.<eos> It's mine.<eos> - I just took it back.
- No.<eos> If we take her to the hospital, they're gonna call the cops.<eos> The cops are gonna come along and think that I did this shit.<eos> Why would they think you did this?<eos> Maybe it's because I broke in here to get my necklace back after this knocked-out bitch yanked it off my neck yesterday in a bar fight that everybody saw.
What's it gonna take to keep that video off your show?<eos> An exclusive with Oscar by Friday.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> I won't wait for tomorrow's show. I'll put it online right next to a link to Ella's bio on your firm's website.
He asked me what I thought.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to him.<eos> I never would've thought Robert Zane's daughter would be so naive.<eos> Naive?<eos> I was actually starting to believe that you cared about this case, but the only thing that you care about is putting it to bed as quickly as possible.
This better not be a trap.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Welcome to Underground Seattle.<eos> When they built the new Seattle on top of the old old Seattle, they left all these catacombs underneath.<eos> It was a real cesspool of humanity till the Red Hand cleaned it out.
Jessica.<eos> Harvey.<eos> What's going on with Mike?<eos> I gave him Cahill's offer.<eos> And he's thinking about it?
You're goddamn right I am.<eos> Well, you better think about this move more than you thought about the last one.<eos> 'Cause it's not gonna end well for you.<eos> Far as I'm concerned, it's the same move.<eos> I made a promise and I'm not gonna break it.
- Donna!<eos> - Okay, listen to me.<eos> If you really want my help, I'm gonna give it to you.<eos> What's gonna happen is, sometime in the next 24 hours, a minor incident that would mean nothing to anybody else but you is gonna make you want to undo this fiasco.<eos> I want to undo it right now.
No, you like to bully, which is exactly why I never wanted to represent you in the first place.<eos> You only came to me because you needed me.<eos> You didn't care.<eos> You're right, Nathan, I didn't, but like you said, your word is your bond.<eos> This is a chance for you to keep it, and maybe now we can actually start off on the right foot.
Was this the kind of thing you're looking for?<eos> Oh, my God, it's perfect.<eos> Is it still available?<eos> - An offer went in this morning.<eos> - We have to beat it.
What happens is, we're already built back up by then, so instead of blaming me for the position Sutter has put you in,<eos> I suggest you go ahead and find yourself a way out of it.<eos> Rachel, what can I do for you?<eos> I was hoping you could do something for Leonard Bailey.<eos> I drafted a motion to reopen his case, but I need a current member of the Bar to file it.
- Jessica, the guy is guilty.<eos> - And you're his goddamn lawyer.<eos> And you took this case.<eos> And I never would have taken it if it wasn't to get Mike out.<eos> Well, you did take it.
Well, it looks like he was stalking her.<eos> We found a stash on his roof... women's jewelry, underwear.<eos> So it would be helpful if you could identify anything that... that may have belonged to Ashley.<eos> Did you find her engagement ring?<eos> Uh, no, we're looking for it now, though.
All right.<eos> Buchanan sure swooped in here fast.<eos> Guy's got a nose for the big cases.<eos> What did you find? Traces of blood on one of his shoes that could be Ashley's, and then, of course, there's the ring.<eos> And you're the one who found it.
Dispatch put it over the zone.<eos> We were first on the scene.<eos> Is ASA Stone around?<eos> The Ariel Kincaid murder.<eos> You remember it?
Subpoena's been drafted, signed off on, and dropped.<eos> So we should have it in a few hours.<eos> Yeah, well, we got one really big question to answer first.<eos> Tariq Bolad's identity was supposed to be sealed.<eos> Check into the grand jury, court reporters, ASA's office, whoever had access to his name or a motive to leak it, 'cause somebody figured it out.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Milo!<eos> No! You're [bleep] crazy!<eos> She is the queen of every hive.<eos> She is the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Well this is just a game to you, Amanda then why do you need to read a letter that I wrote to you 22 years ago?<eos> What is this...<eos> What could this possibly mean to you?<eos> You know, I don't know.<eos> I just wanted to read it.
And I felt a connection with her from the very first moment that I booked the audition.<eos> I am the queen of every hive.<eos> I am the shield over every head.<eos> I am the spear of battle!<eos> Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Sidney? Sidney, are you okay?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.<eos> I am the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
We have a drug that can help those bones heal faster.<eos> Now, our supply keeps running low, but we're about to...<eos> But you already have it, don't you?<eos> It's Yo-Yo.<eos> She's stealing it, and... you two have been in touch this whole time.
Lucy leaves a lot of crazy in her wake.<eos> If we're gonna track her down, we're gonna need that antidote.<eos> Fitz said that they were close.<eos> I don't want it close.<eos> I want it here.
We don't think that's what this is about.<eos> Do you know anything about a metal box?<eos> Something Rey might have gotten his hands on in the past week or so?<eos> He said the thing inside was worth a fortune.<eos> He was gonna auction it off, make enough money to move away from New York and Mara Tres forever.
We're looking into his ex.<eos> Well, unless she's over six foot tall and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother.<eos> That being said, I think I can identify the murder weapon.<eos> So can I.<eos> CSU bagged it 20 minutes ago.
Well, unless she's over six foot tall and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother.<eos> That being said, I think I can identify the murder weapon.<eos> So can I.<eos> CSU bagged it 20 minutes ago.<eos> The killer left it?
I know.<eos> And it was ten Tequila shots, but I... I get it. I know.<eos> And just for the record, um, this dress is fitting you in all the right places.<eos> This old thing?<eos> Uh-huh. I mean, i-i just threw it on.
I'm sorry, did I say girlfriend?<eos> I meant "Fiancée." And how do I know that?<eos> 'Cause she has the ring.<eos> His bitchy grandmother's diamond engagement ring... giant.<eos> And she wouldn't give it to me, because my hands are "Too masculine."
Being one with God.<eos> Seeing His face.<eos> I saw it once.<eos> At the moment of exorcism.<eos> I saw it, and it was so... loud.
Seeing His face.<eos> I saw it once.<eos> At the moment of exorcism.<eos> I saw it, and it was so... loud.<eos> I could hear it.
I'm sorry, Anthony.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> We had him.<eos> Seriously, what makes you think one of these kids shot video of the fight the other night?<eos> Because with kids nowadays, an event didn't even occur unless somebody recorded it on their phones.
The caller didn't actually find the body, sir.<eos> Why are we calling this a murder?<eos> There's evidence at the crime scene apparently.<eos> - "Crime scene"?<eos> - That's what she called it.
Alright.<eos> Assuming I killed this man, why would I call you?<eos> There were witnesses.<eos> You may have left evidence inside.<eos> Far safer for you to insert yourself directly into the investigation, possibly control it.
- (typewriter typing) - (man): Lab report!<eos> My God, that's a tremendous amount of blood.<eos> By the looks of it, Henry, I would say he slit her throat.<eos> They ever find her body?<eos> No, he likely dumped it in the river.
You won't.<eos> Because Joe Murphy is not dead.<eos> He saw me in the bar.<eos> He knew I was following him.<eos> So he decided to fake his murder and have me hang for it.
You made it look like I was planting evidence.<eos> I posed a question.<eos> My readers draw their own conclusions.<eos> They draw their conclusions based on what you write!<eos> The written word is a powerful thing, Ms. Cherry, and you used it to paint me as a gormless patsy, aiding in a police conspiracy headed by the vile and corrupt Detective Murdoch.
Found in the same trash can.<eos> Friends again, Constable?<eos> If you don't try that fake crying act anymore.<eos> That's it, without a doubt.<eos> So who stole it from the morgue?
She invited you over.<eos> She arranged it so you would handle the murder weapon.<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> - She stabbed the corpse to cover it in blood.<eos> And she planted it under your floorboards.
Oh, but we've done just that.<eos> You see, a doctor in New York City has had a very unusual theory.<eos> The particles from a copper alloy tin can leech into the tin's contents.<eos> You see, the same clever discovery that set you free is also the detail that will put you back behind bars.<eos> Who took it?
Once I get the bodies to the morgue, hopefully I can provide more specifics.<eos> Sir.<eos> The Rex Grey case...<eos> Doesn't that belong to station three?<eos> Crown prosecutor Daniels turned it over to me.
The fool!<eos> If he knew anything about birds he would have at least chosen One that could conceivably make it here.<eos> So you believe Mr. Newsome had the bird shipped From south America so he could discover it in Canada.<eos> Yes! And it likely died en route, Making him a bird killer, too.<eos> So he then stuffed the bird, placed it up a tree And discovered it anyway.
Two complaints for equal pay sounds pretty aware of gender bias.<eos> She only has 47 friends.<eos> I don't think she's gonna win Miss Congeniality on this jury.<eos> We don't need her to.<eos> She'll have an opinion and stick with it.
Small, quiet, we do our work and we go home, that's it.<eos> You own this place, right?<eos> Used to.<eos> Uh, banks own most of it, now.<eos> Beth and I bought it when we got married.
You own this place, right?<eos> Used to.<eos> Uh, banks own most of it, now.<eos> Beth and I bought it when we got married.<eos> Spent most of my inheritance on it, fixing the place up, and now, ten years later, everything's out of date again.
You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.<eos> This is some good stuff, Chris.<eos> I think it's ready to post.<eos> Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.<eos> I made my own video and posted it.
No, Mon-El, there's a time and a place for eating candy.<eos> Yeah, and it's this time and this place.<eos> No, this...<eos> This is your place of work.<eos> So when James gives you a task, you should be the one to complete it.
Yep, the fries are back!<eos> Fred, how do you do it?<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I found the old oil in a 50-gallon drum back in the alley.<eos> I didn't leave it there.
Fred, how do you do it?<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I found the old oil in a 50-gallon drum back in the alley.<eos> I didn't leave it there.<eos> I took it straight to the recycling center.
And vice versa.<eos> All right, so you know that Apep is trying to release pure evil.<eos> What you don't know is that we are in the midst of the ultimate battle between good and evil.<eos> Before the Library was created,<eos> Apep managed to release pure evil, but Judson and Charlene were able to banish it.
Before the Library was created,<eos> Apep managed to release pure evil, but Judson and Charlene were able to banish it.<eos> Now...<eos> Judson gone, Apep back,<eos> Charlene is the only one who knows how to stop it, and if we don't find her...
Then they drifted apart.<eos> She, like the devout Catholic that she is, decided to give birth to her son.<eos> After a few years and oppressed by the grim economic straits into which she had drifted, she decided to turn to Kurtwell for help.<eos> Which is how Kurtwell came to know him.<eos> But in the meanwhile, a veritable earthquake had devastated that man's personality and the rubble from it collapsed directly onto that young man.
Gay flag?<eos> No, a mallard!<eos> Where'd you get that cacao from?<eos> Clint gave me a couple grams before he left last night.<eos> I've been micro-dosing it all day.
No, a mallard!<eos> Where'd you get that cacao from?<eos> Clint gave me a couple grams before he left last night.<eos> I've been micro-dosing it all day.<eos> Why are you rubbing it on your gums?
It was back and bi's, right?<eos> Well, you should know, you set up my iCal.<eos> Hey, Max, did you get my text about tonight?<eos> No, we didn't get it, did we?<eos> Um, I think he just sent it to my phone since I'm the only one of us dating him.
I want to take a walk.<eos> What is happening?<eos> Let's go?<eos> Pour me some wine.<eos> I brought it here for a reason.
The Alamo didn't have anyone as smart as you.<eos> Figure it out. Make a way if you have to.<eos> We need to get the women and the children out.<eos> - Same with the letter. - Well, like I said before,<eos> - Travis didn't finish it.
Put your weapon down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Completely surrounded.<eos> And no other options.<eos> Put it down.
Put it down!<eos> Completely surrounded.<eos> And no other options.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down!
No!<eos> We are not sharing top-secret intel with a dark web hacker.<eos> - You already did.<eos> - I just showed him the photo.<eos> I didn't let him decipher it, but I think he knows how.
There's a political rally for immigration reform there today.<eos> Yeah, I heard about it on the news.<eos> Lots of politicians and VIPs in attendance.<eos> That could be the target for a potential attack.<eos> It's almost noon, no time to call it off.
Well, I accessed the city power grid's computers, and this electrical substation here has massive power drains.<eos> We're talking enough power to either stage Lollapalooza... Or recharge the Mothership. You're saying you've narrowed its location<eos> - to this neighborhood?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm saying I've narrowed it to this block.
One acre, a jewel.<eos> A single buildable acre.<eos> Like a flawless diamond set in a sea of emeralds.<eos> The real estate equivalent of a unicorn.<eos> I acquired it some years ago from a family who had held it in trust for over a century and a half.
It's over, Eddie.<eos> We did what we could.<eos> Let's take the win and move on, okay?<eos> I don't know where I have put her birth certificate.<eos> If you just give me a little time, I'm sure I'll find it.
But I created such a mess.<eos> I have no idea what to do now.<eos> Look, you created a monster here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So now you just have to kill it.
There is no other blood splatter.<eos> He has a strong alibi for the time of death.<eos> I know you don't think Rohan had anything to do with this, Lustigman, but everything points to it.<eos> ok, sir, but this past murder at Cardinal Park, it bothers me.<eos> I can't find any trace of the man who went down for it.
- There he is!<eos> - There he is! - Ah.<eos> Your application must have been... impressive.<eos> I wrote a great personal essay, okay?<eos> And Cruz here helped me bring it to tip-top shape.
Okay.<eos> Look, Otis, I hate to say this, man, but...<eos> I made it up.<eos> - What?<eos> - The email, the shortlist, I made it all up.
Uh, it was a long time ago.<eos> I have, um...<eos> I have this. (Sniffles)<eos> This necklace, this is his and, um, it's the only thing i have left of him.<eos> And at first, you know, i didn't want to wear it, I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't even look at it, but now it's... It's all I have and i-i can't take it off now, so... (Sniffles)
I promise.<eos> Kate, will you please help me out?<eos> No, I hate this dress!<eos> I know.<eos> I don't care that you hate it, though.
"The Today Show" already booked her.<eos> I've got a source... He heard that David Baxter, the U.S. solder captured in Afghanistan, was beheaded.<eos> Damn.<eos> There may be video tomorrow.<eos> I hope you're wrong, but if you're not, we'll edit it and put it on the air.

That's what this is about, protecting WCN's parent company?<eos> They own his music catalog.<eos> They're underwriting his current tour.<eos> The video is already out there.<eos> Other news outlets are gonna pick it up.
Great.<eos> Are we gonna open with the video Levi sent you?<eos> No.<eos> But that video's part of the story.<eos> Julia, I watched it. It's captivating.
So let me get this straight.<eos> Your show accused a man of murder, then you saw that man take his own life, and your first instinct is to make a spectacle out of his suicide.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I put up the video.<eos> It's your job to knock it down.
Rumplestiltskin has a child who's in great danger.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I came as soon as I sensed the fairy incantations being read.<eos> We have to stop him before he can use it to summon The Black Fairy.
- Scissors.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> Total hepatic vascular isolation.<eos> We're gonna completely stop the blood supply to the liver, find the source of the bleeding, and then we'll repair it.
Tea, beer?<eos> Beer would be good.<eos> I'll get some of Dean's craft beer, some good shit.<eos> No, I don't want to drink his craft beer.<eos> Oh, I bought it, it's fine.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> The home of Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and, of course, Lombard Street, the least straight street in the world.<eos> Lookin' at you, Lewis.<eos> Be on the lookout for Tony Bennett's heart, for legend has told he left it somewhere within city limits.
No, I'm not gonna practice on you.<eos> Wait, I think that I've come up with a way to keep my engagement secret.<eos> It involves me?<eos> Look, we've established, firmly, that I cannot be around this ring without completely spoiling it, okay?<eos> So, until I propose, will you hang on to it for me?
With that in mind, I'm going to go take the victim's personal effects up to Abby.<eos> Yes, I'd take them up myself, but she still thinks I'm sick, despite the fact that I have kept dry toast down for 24 hours.<eos> Did we miss something?<eos> The victim's necklace.<eos> I didn't notice it when I removed it, but... there's an inscription on the back.
Your mom is so ugly, when she goes to the zoo, she needs two tickets... one to get in and one to get out.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, they're saying that she's so ugly they think she's an animal.<eos> So she needs [chuckles] a ticket to get out of the zoo.<eos> So, you're saying if an animal had a ticket, the zoo would just let it out?
She was admitted an hour ago.<eos> Admitted for what?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> What is there to say?<eos> I gave you my opinion. You ignored it.
"An elephant," and then just given up right then, but they didn't.<eos> The Jews rode strong until the Greeks left Jerusalem.<eos> Yay, right?<eos> Except for when they went back to the temple to light the menorah and clean up, they found that the Greeks destroyed all of the oil except for one jug.<eos> That's only enough to light it for one night.
I'm playing the titular character of the film John Wick, which is my latest tribute to the film legacy of...<eos> Keanu Reeves.<eos> I've seen this one, and I-I like the attention to detail, with the wedding ring and everything.<eos> You are correct in noting that this wedding ring was worn by the character John Wick even after the untimely passing of his wife.<eos> However, I'm wearing it because I married Sabrina.
- Nothing yet.<eos> Want to take a closer look?<eos> Sure.<eos> You really think the perp ditched the murder weapon downstairs?<eos> Eh, 20 bucks says we find it in some bushes down the street.
You'll find the bodies in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Because I put them there.<eos> The prosecutor's last and final offer was 18 months.<eos> Next time, you slip it onto my finger, all of this will be behind us.
You've got the wrong guy.<eos> Cutting Cole's boss loose?<eos> For now.<eos> We're not liking him as much as we did an hour ago.<eos> He gave us an alibi, I'm gonna check it out.
It's the camel's nose in the tent, Watson.<eos> What?<eos> It's a slippery slope.<eos> I saw it during my time at Scotland Yard.<eos> The reason I refused to accept any official police credit is that once I allow it, there's no official line as to where it stops.
Just tell me why you're doing it.<eos> Why I'm doing what, Tandy?<eos> Trying to ruin this building, Lewis.<eos> Why in the hell would I even do that?<eos> It's eating you up that we moved into an office building, so now you want us all to hate it so we can move to wherever you choose.
I can't... remember.<eos> So that your child may be born again!<eos> Help me.<eos> Mother Bernadette!<eos> Four decades ago, it had Regan's body and it lost it.
I heard their problems, their little victories.<eos> I saw their children come home from the hospital...<eos> Elliot, David, Winnie.<eos> They were my family, these people.<eos> That place... how was I gonna fix it?
For many, it symbolised the final failure of the dream that politics could be used to build a new kind of world.<eos> What was going to emerge instead was a new system that had nothing to do with politics.<eos> A system whose aim was not to try and change things, but rather, to manage a post-political world.<eos> One of the first people to describe this dramatic change was a left-wing German political thinker called Ulrich Beck.<eos> Beck said that any politician who believed that they could take control of society, and drive it forward to build a better future, was now seen as dangerous.
But then someone in MI6 noticed that the detail the source was describing was identical to scenes in the 1996 movie The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.<eos> Really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.<eos> Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.<eos> What exactly does this stuff do?<eos> If the rocket renders it aerosol, it could take out the entire city of people. How?
We can see pictures of him in Durham...<eos> This evening... Here he is.<eos> ..Colonel Gaddafi has confirmed that Libya has, in the past, sought to develop weapons-of-mass-destruction capabilities.<eos> Libya has now declared its intention to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction completely.<eos> This decision by Colonel Gaddafi is a historic one, and a courageous one, and I applaud it.
- We've got two minutes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Damn it... the van's blown.<eos> We gotta find a new way out.<eos> But all my equipment's in there, I need to get it.
That's right.<eos> You are gonna draw up a brand new agreement for Donovan to sign.<eos> Hell, yeah, you're gonna have a courier bring it over to me right now.<eos> And, uh, listen closely, Marco,<eos> Donovan subsection H is a deal breaker, so, rip it out of the agreement and burn it.
As darkness falls, animals appear from seemingly nowhere.<eos> And, among them, inevitably, are hunters.<eos> One of the most voracious nocturnal predators is also one of the hardest to see.<eos> This mysterious creature hardly ever appears on the surface of the dunes.<eos> But there are signs on the sand that can give it away.
By carefully selecting grass blades, each trimmed to the correct length, he's creating something very special.<eos> He needs an even surface, and a centre-piece.<eos> The stage is set.<eos> His bachelor pad is sufficiently neat and tidy to attract a female.<eos> The problem is, can she see it?
This is huge!<eos> It's almost like a human footprint.<eos> You can see the front paw, the rear paw.<eos> We are now two weeks in and it's very frustrating.<eos> I've never actually been anywhere where the animals go after your equipment and destroy it, more than here.
Just reads like a lonely old lady looking for her long-lost love.<eos> No offense.<eos> Apparently that's exactly what my mother was.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> No. In fact, I'm shocked that she had the wherewithal to place it, considering the progression of her Alzheimer's.
Did you see?<eos> Yes, but the phones were only on for a minute.<eos> Most were in the building with the hostages, but there's one signal coming from 28 Liberty.<eos> Even after the phones shut off again, it stayed on.<eos> Our working theory is that it's some sort of receiver for their biological weapon, something that allows the terrorists to activate it remotely.
They're right outside.<eos> - They're gone.<eos> - Let's just assume we all make it to the end of this video game.<eos> How do we destroy a bio weapon without setting it off ourselves?<eos> It's really not like you can just unplug it.
You yourself said some are terrorists in hiding.<eos> I'm doing what you couldn't.<eos> I'm ending this.<eos> Those terrorists have a weapon pointed at the heart of the city.<eos> We have to take it out.
Finally, she... gets down on a knee there with me. Puts her hand on my cheek.<eos> A-and just says,<eos> "Yes."<eos> And she gives me a kiss that I will never forget.<eos> And then we look for the ring together and we find it.
You can't.<eos> - It's unique.<eos> - Unique?<eos> Unique how?<eos> 'Cause of who I robbed it from.
That's not true, Bonnie.<eos> - We just came for the necklace.<eos> - That's all we need.<eos> You can go back to your lives.<eos> I ain't just gonna give it to you.
Come on.<eos> He likes your show.<eos> He watches when he can.<eos> He's got 10,000 Federales searching for him since his prison break, and he's watching my show?<eos> He watched it tonight...
You're making a mistake.<eos> I don't have a right to express my opinion?<eos> Of course you have a right to express your opinion, but it's better if we work together.<eos> We're out of here.<eos> If they can't give us justice here, we're gonna go find it somewhere else.
I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing.<eos> - Mm. - Why are you helping this guy, sir?<eos> He's the opposite of everything you stand for.<eos> His favorite expression is "that's gonna leave a mark."<eos> And he doesn't even use it right.
This is about Terry.<eos> You can't tell<eos> - anyone else this, but...<eos> - How do you know that? Let's just say my little birds are everywhere collecting whispers.<eos> He left the letter on his desk, and I read it.
And now we're partners in the consulting detective concern.<eos> We're also friends.<eos> It wouldn't be so weird if we checked in with each other once in a while.<eos> My recovery's part of my routine.<eos> I don't discuss it with you any more than I discuss my... inhalations.
And what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We demonstrated to the satisfaction of various religious worthies that your shmeat became eligible to be pareve by virtue of foul play.<eos> The imams and the rabbis have got no intention of rewarding murder.<eos> They're never gonna bless you with the labels that you seek and they're going to use their influence to see to it that other certifying bodies follow their lead.<eos> You can still sell it in the vegan aisle, but good luck staying in business.
Well, you never responded to my text either.<eos> "Saw Cosa at the precinct.<eos> Gregson fast-tracking print analysis."<eos> If we don't solve Ricky Morales' murder before the police identify Shinwell's prints...<eos> You don't need to worry about us not solving it.
Come on, man!<eos> You know choir is my thing.<eos> "Never tell me what I can't do."<eos> You don't even care about the solo.<eos> You just want to take it away from me.
It's mine. I'll buy that book.<eos> There's no evidence that it's yours.<eos> - Guess where this leaf is from. - Que... You wouldn't know the answer even if I were to tell you.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I thought I'd lost it forever.
We are going to take it.<eos> - We are going to take it. - Yes, sir!<eos> We're going to take it from them.<eos> - We're going to take it from them. - Yes, sir!<eos> Seize it!
No light.<eos> But I am seeing light.<eos> No ice.<eos> Oh!<eos> Well, doesn't matter because we will drink it whether it's hot or it's cold.
No ice.<eos> Oh!<eos> Well, doesn't matter because we will drink it whether it's hot or it's cold.<eos> Go on.<eos> Share it.
Is that, kinda like, your thing?<eos> - Pattern recognition.<eos> - Pattern recognition?<eos> Music is just a series of altered patterns.<eos> The musician creates the pattern and makes us anticipate a resolution and holds back, makes you wait for it.
I don't know. It was your plan.<eos> It was not my pl...<eos> Yes, Stone is an impressive man, okay?<eos> But I married you, Rusty.<eos> And I am so sorry that I lost my ring... but I would never, ever, ever take it off on purpose.
Drink this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Witch Queen has returned.<eos> I thought my immortality was the way that she punished me.<eos> But she just used me to save it for herself.
Thanks.<eos> It's research.<eos> He's looking to invest in a micro-brewery.<eos> Me, I don't wanna think about how profitable a beer is.<eos> I just wanna taste it.
Ella actually felt pity for these two schemers, who could be every bit as ugly within as they were fair without.<eos> My prince!<eos> He will love me!<eos> But I will be his queen!<eos> If her stepmother would not have a fourth dress made, it seemed to Ella that there was no reason why she would not try to run it up herself.
Fairy Godmother!<eos> Yes, what?<eos> My dress.<eos> I can't go in this dress.<eos> - Can you mend it?
My dress.<eos> I can't go in this dress.<eos> - Can you mend it?<eos> - Mend it?<eos> No, no. I'll turn it into something new.
This was my mother's.<eos> And I'd like to wear it when I go to the palace.<eos> It's almost like taking her with me.<eos> I understand.<eos> But she wouldn't mind if I gee it up a bit?
Aren't all disasters natural?<eos> Hey, come on, get your clothes on.<eos> It's not time for idle philosophy.<eos> Hey, come and help.<eos> Come and tell us how we should film it.
You needed that?<eos> it's shit, Augie!<eos> No one needs shit!<eos> I need it!<eos> I've been looking all week for it. Oh, God.
Yeah, the man saved my life and got me stone-cold sober.<eos> And was three sheets to the wind the whole time he was doing it.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing your point.<eos> The point, my boy, is that he's got a good heart.<eos> He just keeps it up his ass half the time.
Anyway, John, for some reason, took an exception to this and wrote a letter in.<eos> It was a very friendly letter.<eos> And he finished it with, "Well, what do you think of that?"<eos> He had his own home telephone number in Ascot.<eos> So, if I had got the letter, you know, when he sent it, I would have rung him.
The problem is much greater than your battery.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you are conscious.<eos> You cannot be copied because you're not data.<eos> We don't know what consciousness is... so we cannot move it.
That's me.<eos> It's time to pump up the jam.<eos> I know what consciousness is.<eos> That's nice.<eos> This helmet can read it.
- Knock yourself out.<eos> Hey pencil dick, where're you going?<eos> Grab a box.<eos> When are they going to tear that shithole down?<eos> They're remodeling it actually.
You grabbed a signal from another dimension.<eos> From a machine here.<eos> That means it's transmitting there.<eos> What if it's not just predicting the future?<eos> It's broadcasting it.
But it looks like a lovely place to spend your last days.<eos> David... The Monitor is acting as an antenna.<eos> It isn't just receiving tachyons.<eos> It is taking a possible future and...<eos> And amplifying it, transmitting it, like a feedback loop.
That mine down there has been ripping gold out of her guts for over 20 years.<eos> We're gonna get some of it back for her.<eos> Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my man.<eos> Source to source.<eos> You're gonna steal it? No.
We're gonna get some of it back for her.<eos> Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my man.<eos> Source to source.<eos> You're gonna steal it? No.<eos> We're going to liberate it.
Do you want to stop horsing around?<eos> Bless my eyes.<eos> That's Steve Wozniak, sitting out there.<eos> Give yourselves a treat and ask Woz if he happens to have the correct time.<eos> I have the correct time, and we're running out of it.
There should be statues of that man.<eos> His name should be on the lips of schoolchildren.<eos> The rainbow flag Apple with a bite taken out.<eos> That's where it came from?<eos> No, we picked it off a list of friendly-sounding words.
I don't need to school you.<eos> Is this your way of telling me I shouldn't have killed the Newton?<eos> The most efficient animal on the planet is the condor.<eos> The most inefficient animals on the planet are humans.<eos> Well, you shouldn't have killed it for spite.
But the soul lost its wings and fell to Earth.<eos> There it took an earthly body.<eos> And now, while it lives in this body, no outward sign of wings can be seen.<eos> Yet the roots of its wings are still there.<eos> And the nature of wings is to try to raise the earthbound body and soar with it into heaven.
What if I get busted?<eos> Look at you with your little eyes looking at me.<eos> Sometimes I think I know so much more about the world than other people.<eos> You see, I took drugs once, and it kind of opened up this window for me.<eos> I call it the Window of Truth.
What are "Bath-maticians"?<eos> Camp Bloodbath fans.<eos> It's kind of our awesome nickname.<eos> Did you know that a nickname immediately becomes uncool<eos> - when you give it to yourself?
WASHINGTON:<eos> Watch your tone<eos> I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown HAMILTON:<eos> Charles Lee, Thomas Conway<eos> These men take your name and they rake it through the mud
You tell her whatever you want to.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mr. O'Neil? - Yes?<eos> - I have a message from Damian Hale.<eos> I think you'll wanna hear it.
Men from far and wide are gonna come looking for me to make a name for themselves.<eos> Don't go away.<eos> I can't finish the field on my own.<eos> The field's finished, Pa.<eos> I seeded it.
I know that school can be hard, honey.<eos> But you gotta go, or you'll be a moron.<eos> Did you do my daddy homework thing?<eos> Yes, I have not.<eos> But I'm tweaking it in my mind, and I will figure it out on my trip.
I apologize for the tirade.<eos> I am gonna go.<eos> But I am forever in your debt, gentlemen.<eos> Another word which is never used anymore.<eos> Let's bring it back, shall we?
- No.<eos> Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.<eos> "What did you see, Dorothy?"<eos> "I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.<eos> They filmed it in Ireland."
Right.<eos> And how do we find her?<eos> She said we have everything we need.<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> You send me to do a job, I do it. But my way, not yours.
Nothing so crude as that. No.<eos> Lane will order you.<eos> And to regain his trust, you will do it.<eos> You sent me to do a job.<eos> I did it.
- He keeps building bodies.<eos> - Person bodies.<eos> The human form is inefficient.<eos> Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.<eos> But he keeps coming back to it.
As a reminder, this is the latest twist in a larger case, that of serial killer Calvin Diehl, aka the angel of debt who has killed, or as he claims, "helped to die in dignity,"<eos> more than 50 people since the early 1980s.<eos> He had each of his victims sign what he termed a "permission to kill" form along with a letter to loved ones.<eos> Dear Ben, Michelle, Libby and debby. I don't think this letter will ever reach you.<eos> But Mr. Diehl said he'd hold it for me.
What do you think?<eos> I'm a little rusty at this.<eos> Ted, why don't you drag that over here?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you just put it right under here?
The thing is I kind of...<eos> I kind of don't know how to spell your name.<eos> It's a hard name to spell, Buddy.<eos> Most people can't.<eos> Let me write it down for you.
He's okay?<eos> - Dennis said his first word!<eos> - He did?<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Say it again.
A baby.<eos> To whoever finds this, know that they are killing me.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> The poison is in the tea.<eos> Find my body, take it home.
Sign your bloody name!<eos> My father, who killed him?<eos> Such a coarse, condescending man.<eos> He loved you.<eos> You should have seen his sad face when I smashed it on the sink.
Two of the guests have made themselves useful at the local expats club.<eos> Which is, shall we say, a little down on its uppers.<eos> Norman I know the membership's dropping, times are tight, but do you really have to water down the wine?<eos> What?<eos> ! I uncorked it myself.
Let us look around and you will see.<eos> Please, come.<eos> Come, come, come.<eos> Clearly whoever named this establishment had a sense of mischief.<eos> But had he named it the Supreme Potential Hotel then, my friends, we would be talking.
This is your revenge to take.<eos> Okay?<eos> Please.<eos> I've seen my future.<eos> You saw it.
Pretty fancy.<eos> I kind of knew that tips from my dad's diner weren't really going to cut it.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I love art. I love... everything about it.<eos> I love studying it.
Its called a soft strike.<eos> Visser laughed when Toby pulled the gun because he knew the gun was useless.<eos> I'm a paranoid psychopath.<eos> The only way I know for sure that a gun won't fire is...<eos> If I sabotage it myself.
The goddamn locks are changed!<eos> Hey, Kareem, can we use your fire escape?<eos> Yep.<eos> Shit! I thought I left this window open!<eos> I might have closed it.
No, he'll be here any minute.<eos> Sorry, I got started on the wrong foot there.<eos> I meant to say I've been missing you as a friend and...<eos> She has a very exciting business opportunity for you.<eos> And I wanted to bring it to you and Dylan as a peace offering.
Get her out of here.<eos> When that message gets out it will be the end.<eos> What message?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.
It's police property.<eos> I couldn't... show it... to you.<eos> Well, perhaps I could lend it to you.<eos> Tilly Dunnage designed the wedding dress.<eos> Oh! Can't wait to see it.
No.<eos> She does work magic, my girl.<eos> But she needs money to get started again.<eos> That's why this letter has got to get to Winyerp.<eos> If I take it to the post office, the bastards won't send it.
I've never seen her like that!<eos> I don't think she's better, do you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your leave of absence ends in two months.<eos> You don't need to make such a drastic decision right now, it makes no sense, we can't accept it.
There's like a ton of pollen in here!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Christmas on a cracker!<eos> Did you take your medicine?<eos> I forgot it on the plane.
Take a look at this.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Do you see how the pencil suddenly appears so soft?<eos> Yes.<eos> Only once I've touched it... can I feel that it's made from hard wood.
He'll get better!<eos> And the day he does is the day we go.<eos> Is that clear? Oh. Got a letter from Japan.<eos> It's from Mr. Umezaki.<eos> - Have you read it?
I don't know!<eos> And if I ever did know, I don't remember.<eos> If you can't remember, then why couldn't the case have been a success... - like Dr. Watson wrote it?<eos> - Because it was my last case.<eos> And if I'd brought it to a successful conclusion, I wouldn't have left the profession... and spent 35 years here, in this place, away from the world!
- Thank you for being polite.<eos> Leo?<eos> - Ice cream hurts.<eos> - You got a brain freeze there, Jack.<eos> Just eat it slower, ok?
It's funny.<eos> It's breezy and romantic.<eos> Who wrote it?<eos> You did, old boy.<eos> You stick your name on my labor, hand it in to your studio and we're in business.
Okay.<eos> I'm getting the check.<eos> And I'm getting my coat.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> I've never actually used it.
~ Plotting what?<eos> Revenge.<eos> He gave me a letter for Lady Pole, and...<eos> Show me.<eos> I've already sent it.
Canyoucomedown?<eos> -I saw a dress.<eos> Months ago, I saw a wedding dress.<eos> I knew you'd look good in.<eos> You still might be able to get it.
You didn't know the first thing about my mother!<eos> You never bothered to take care of her.<eos> And even now, you haven't brought her flowers for ten years.<eos> And that letter!<eos> Do you think Mommy never read it?
And even now, you haven't brought her flowers for ten years.<eos> And that letter!<eos> Do you think Mommy never read it?<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> She found it and she read it and I've read it too.
Who are you?<eos> - You told me not to pursue Qasim.<eos> - What? That's what you said to me when I went for my weapon.<eos> This is a wind-up, right?<eos> An agent gave it to me. It's a souvenir.
He wants what I want.<eos> Are you quite certain about that?<eos> Let's put it to a test.<eos> Let's say I do separate Flint from his gold when he returns.<eos> And let's say you and I split it.
And the only reason that they would do that... is if you have something that they want.<eos> So, I've been trying to think about what that could be, and the only thing I've come up with... is the Union Allied pension file.<eos> Did you keep the file, Karen?<eos> No.<eos> As soon as I asked my boss about it, he took it away from me.
"It made me feel different, like there was something I had to cover up."<eos> David, hi.<eos> How'd your reading go?<eos> - It was great.<eos> -I'm sorry I missed it.
Stop!<eos> Of all the stupid, like to rip my goddamn arm off!<eos> I didn't, drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain, just for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town.<eos> You the one handed her my goddamn letter.<eos> I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you!
We saw them gun down two people.<eos> What'd I tell you about that shit?<eos> They drew on us.<eos> The building is a very dangerous place.<eos> We avoid it.
That was the most important thing.<eos> So Mom's not from here either?<eos> Do you still have the device I left you?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Keep it.
But...<eos> I don't think of it this way.<eos> I never even say this word.<eos> Death.<eos> Yes, okay, I said it once or, or, maybe three times just now.
I don't think of it this way.<eos> I never even say this word.<eos> Death.<eos> Yes, okay, I said it once or, or, maybe three times just now.<eos> But watch, I will not say it again.
- I'm so sorry, she's not well.<eos> - No.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> This necklace belonged to Rachel.<eos> Yeah, she gave it to me for my birthday.
But I have to do these sort of things now.<eos> Makes me seem more human.<eos> And you have to be a little human when you're the president.<eos> He couldn't even afford to pay for his own gravestone.<eos> I paid for it out of my own scholarship money from The Sentinel.
Tragedy struck today here in Charlotte on Chelsea bay drive when a 5-year-old was found dead. The body of Tom Murphy was discovered by a jogger in the woods near his home, the boy's mother, Jessica Murphy, apparently unaware that her child went missing.<eos> Officer:<eos> This is 1350.<eos> We are at the crime scene.<eos> We are locking it down for the night.
- Exactly, thank you for doing this.<eos> - With your amazing husband.<eos> Yes. [laughs] My amazing husband. Yeah.<eos> This place is great, right?<eos> I really love it, and I'm so impressed that you found it, and...
Yes.<eos> Sergeant Timmins, you were there and you did not stop this attack.<eos> I did eventually, sir.<eos> Eventually.<eos> You did not prevent it because you knew the soldier had it coming.
The necklace.<eos> My mother's.<eos> ~ Is it worth anything?<eos> ~ Only to me.<eos> You gave it to the ship's purser for safekeeping?
~ Is it worth anything?<eos> ~ Only to me.<eos> You gave it to the ship's purser for safekeeping?<eos> Yes.<eos> And when we landed here, he returned it to you, yes?
[ groans ] all right, everyone. Get me some bitch interviews now.<eos> Man: Copy that.<eos> I, uh -- i like your necklace.<eos> Oh, this?<eos> My students made it to take with me.
I'm sorry, what did you just say?<eos> You can't use the footage.<eos> Okay, I made a verbal agreement with her.<eos> You can't use it.<eos> Well, that's a little like the maid saying that she owns the silver because she polished it.
No, I'm working too hard.<eos> You're busy getting your wife knocked up and getting loaded.<eos> Come here.<eos> No, I have a budget meeting, and I have to go over these numbers.<eos> Cancel it.
It's not just about Mary.<eos> Kirk's power-bitch lawyer is already angling to get Lily Belle away from me.<eos> I'll be damned if I let that happen.<eos> Yeah, okay, well, you know, I can, uh, get the letter to Graham, make sure that he reads it on camera tonight.<eos> No. I want to read it.
I'm not asking you to move in or anything.<eos> Just stop living like a homeless person for a night.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> Uh, I took it off, okay?
Just stop living like a homeless person for a night.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> Uh, I took it off, okay?<eos> I took it off.
- Friends.<eos> Pretty face.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I said you got a pretty face.<eos> Well, at least before I smash it to bits on the concrete.
Yes.<eos> But while he's trying to persuade them that there are reasonable men among the pirates of Nassau, men ready to govern themselves responsibly and peacefully, no one will be listening, because in the next room the ambassador to the court of King Philip of Spain<eos> will be shaking his fists with rage, screaming about how these same reasonable men just stole five million Spanish dollars from the king's treasury.<eos> He'll be demanding Whitehall denounce the act or risk losing the hard-won peace between both nations.<eos> If Lord Ashe is to have any prayer of succeeding in what you are asking of him, not only can you not retrieve the Urca gold, no one else here can retrieve it either.

Shouldn't we have taken a defensive position?<eos> Yes, we should.<eos> You can thank your prime minister for this situation.<eos> May I see the photo?<eos> - Can I have it back, please?
I saw Louise at a dance, and knew she was the one.<eos> In all honesty...<eos> My "Mercury" flight was my second proudest accomplishment.<eos> Getting Louise to marry me was my first.<eos> Her nickname was "frosty" at the time, and she earned it.
At least I have one loyal soldier.<eos> First, you take me to that tavern, put my life in danger and now this.<eos> Why do you Musketeers insist on disappointing me?<eos> Bruno was a thug.<eos> The King made a deal and betrayed it.
This is about a gambling casino in Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.<eos> - I'm not familiar with it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, you'll be shocked to learn that you earned Ł24,000 from it in the last three months.<eos> My friends and I would like to purchase it from you.
Why not?<eos> She might be, you never know.<eos> My husband is an enthusiast.<eos> And a businessman.<eos> People don't really think about honey, just plaster it on their bread in the morning, but the biology that goes on behind it is...
- I wonder who that can be?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Well, I do have an idea and if you will go taking your wedding ring off.<eos> I thought I'd explained all that.<eos> You found it!
- I have no idea.<eos> Well, I do have an idea and if you will go taking your wedding ring off.<eos> I thought I'd explained all that.<eos> You found it!<eos> Shouldn't really go leaving it lying around, Tommy.
It was locked.<eos> Which means there must be a master key.<eos> Rogers must have had a master key.<eos> You two dealt with the body!<eos> And you found it!
- How many criers did you pay?<eos> - Four total, as you asked.<eos> Sent to the ends of the camps.<eos> But what I don't understand is why we're supporting Captain Vane's position.<eos> We're not supporting it, we're relaying it.
We've talked about virtue and the right.<eos> We've talked and talked.<eos> And now, perhaps, it is time to do that which we've only spoken about behind closed doors.<eos> I am committed to this end.<eos> But it is a long road and I will need your help to see it through.
I love you too.<eos> I love your skin.<eos> Give me your skin.<eos> There's still a couple bugs with the A.I. software.<eos> But, uh, maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.
We'll be in touch.<eos> See you. – Bye.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> The geophone just recorded a quake here.<eos> Yes, we felt it here too.
And the entrance to one of them isn't far.<eos> By the time anyone realizes you are gone, you will be safely away from here and in the care of Captain Flint.<eos> I remember Lady Hamilton's face.<eos> But I know Captain Flint's name.<eos> My father's mentioned it in his letters.
You hear that?<eos> It's gone!<eos> - The gold is gone!<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> Who could've taken it?
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.
Not cash, no.<eos> Taking your own life.<eos> Interesting expression.<eos> Taking it from who?<eos> Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.
Damn!<eos> I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.<eos> We can't let it get away.
We got this.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> The sub's too close.<eos> We ain't making it to the gate in time.<eos> We're just going to let it get away?
Am I wrong?<eos> Tell me I am and we'll continue on our way.<eos> And then what?<eos> This war... your war... her war...<eos> Julius will be no obstacle to it.
Yeah.<eos> We got to take care of the ones out here and block that gap, too, so we can take the rest slow.<eos> Seven, eight... nine...<eos> That car...<eos> I can block it up.
Are we talking about me and Mary Beth or you and Iris?<eos> Just give her some space.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Well... it's Mary Beth's birthday, and I found this vintage ukulele on Craigslist.<eos> I'm gonna paint this on it and drop it off.
And guess what?<eos> - You won. - What?<eos> I don't...<eos> Your grand prize, chosen especially for you is an unlimited supply of freedom.<eos> Enjoy it wherever you want.
Whatever that thing is now, it used to be human.<eos> It's a living organism, which means it has to have some constraints.<eos> What if we electrify the deck, try to stun it?<eos> Okay, look. This thing rips through steel like tin foil.<eos> It doesn't need air.
That one.<eos> Get it started.<eos> I'll take it from there.<eos> Well, you're not taking it anywhere, dead wife, not without me, not until that coin is back in my pocket<eos> - where it belongs.
Just some stuff going down that's... Kind of got me spun out.<eos> Be good to talk to you.<eos> Well, I can't just send him to you economy comfort, now can I?<eos> The package is in the armory now.<eos> We gave it a lot number.
It leaves no room for me.<eos> No space for me.<eos> He crowds out my grief.<eos> And my grief... my ongoing daily pain is as strong and as alive as his.<eos> But I don't let it win.
But it's locked.<eos> Must've crawled inside.<eos> Locked the cage behind it.<eos> But a snake can't operate a lock by itself.<eos> - Maybe a lizard helped it.
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.<eos> Your father found out about Fred and me.<eos> Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...<eos> Oh, my God, Dad knows?<eos> Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
For the good of the country.<eos> Remember what you so generously handed me the night that Frankie was shot, what you called the most beautiful thing in the world?<eos> America?<eos> I'm keeping it.<eos> It's not safe with you.
So why'd you switch?<eos> That's a story.<eos> I used to be a medic in the S.T.A.R.S. Unit in Raccoon City.<eos> I guess, in a way, I've always been interested in medical science.<eos> Then one day, I decided to make it my duty to stop people from abusing it.
It was once a required course.<eos> Till it was outlawed.<eos> For good reason, I hear.<eos> Yes, well, it was a very messy situation.<eos> At the time, I thought it was right, but the professor who taught it disagreed.
This thing came out.<eos> It was all covered in leaves and moss and mud, and it had vines for arms, and it picked him up.<eos> - It picked him right up. - What did you do?<eos> I...<eos> I shot it, but it didn't do nothing.
A stick?<eos> It's how Nick was able to follow Eve.<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.<eos> It doesn't belong there.
You are mistaken, my lord.<eos> I do not endorse bloodshed and lawlessness.<eos> But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?
Was wrong.<eos> And I'm sure he regrets it.<eos> But if you and he quarrel, it will distress me beyond words.<eos> For your sake, Mama. I'll be civil.<eos> The old smithy on the edge of Trenwith land -- who owns it now?
Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> I'd ask you to join me for dinner, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what you came here for.<eos> Mike Ross got out of prison.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to practice law again.<eos> I don't disagree, but technically, he didn't practice it in the first place.
- To do nothing.<eos> To smell the damn flowers.<eos> Hopefully, with somebody like you.<eos> I've been doing this a long time and at a certain point, you know, enough is enough.<eos> This job will swallow you whole, if you let it.
Me being the prince doesn't change anything.<eos> Not how I feel about you...<eos> This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.
This is a good tie.<eos> This is a good tie.<eos> Learn to harness the power.<eos> Sucks.<eos> And most importantly, do not be afraid to unleash it.
Down the hall.<eos> Alec?<eos> What are you doing in my father's study?<eos> You mentioned his model train.<eos> He doesn't use it much anymore.
When I was a little boy, I was about your age, I saw one trying to get out.<eos> But it was having trouble, so I tried to help.<eos> Really carefully, I split open the casing and the butterfly came right out!<eos> But it couldn't fly.<eos> It was supposed to struggle. Squeezing its way out of that tight casing pushed fluid from its fat body into its wings.
As a matter of fact, if you do that, I'll have Deb book the plane for ya. Done.<eos> Move on.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> It's... I never thought I'd be thinking about living this life.<eos> You're living it already.
This is war.<eos> It's not a personal choice.<eos> No.<eos> You could have been a better man.<eos> But you put on a uniform, and let it make choices for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> That was so forward.<eos> No.<eos> There is no need.<eos> Your forwardness, I admire it.
Dr. Wilson?<eos> The repair went very well.<eos> You fixed the thing you broke?<eos> I fixed the thing I broke.<eos> And that nasty esophageal tumor is in the medical waste, where it belongs.
You've changed.<eos> And today, you saved me from a terrible mistake, and I...<eos> I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pay you back.<eos> As luck would have it, I might have an idea.<eos> There's one way for you not to lose your family... and that's to let it grow.
I miss her so much.<eos> Love leaves you or it finds you again.<eos> Love brings sorrow.<eos> Or it brings hope.<eos> But we should always be brave and open our hearts to it.
I controlled their minds.<eos> Just like you have, many, many times.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.
Who are those people?<eos> You heard them.<eos> They're "Sarge" and "Pea."<eos> Two nicknames I have never heard in my entire life.<eos> This kindness, I don't trust it.
Oh, like the one you got on your screensaver?<eos> Yeah, except now, it's sitting in McNeile's driveway.<eos> I think he got that car just to drive me crazy.<eos> I got to look at it every day!<eos> Or you get to look at it every day, Rog.
Nothing.<eos> The less she knows, the better.<eos> Kelly Hughes... her mother just moved to the top of the heart and lung donor list two days ago.<eos> Maybe this is the Collaborators giving her an incentive.<eos> My mother had an infection, but as soon as it got better, they moved her up.
Sorry.<eos> Please.<eos> Thanks to BulletPoint's audio, we know that the shooter was in the employ of the last person to possess the guitar.<eos> Now, whoever he is, he never publicized having it.<eos> He might have derived his pleasure from it privately, but people like that, they rarely keep their prizes completely secret.
Hey, so, Howard, what's the bathroom situation gonna be?<eos> Well, there's a sink out there-- that takes care of half your problems.<eos> But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We barely use it, so it'll be like it's yours.
Come on.<eos> - Let's get her in the house.<eos> - Thank you for saving our girl.<eos> That thing took Willa.<eos> Wasn't letting it get Waverly.
Whoa!<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?<eos> Oh, don't worry about it. I'm fine.<eos> Monty:<eos> I got that thing as a gift, and I'm trying to find some use for it.
- Bunk beds?<eos> Were you raised in a prison?<eos> Van, did you know I'm the only Senior Vice President in this building who doesn't have a real office?<eos> Emily, you thrive in the cubicles.<eos> You're like a tropical fish that lives in the coral reef, but if you took that fish out, and gave it its own office...
Are there any survivors?<eos> No...<eos> None at all.<eos> It's all over...<eos> My hometown... It's gone forever.
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.

Tell me your name.<eos> Tull.<eos> Love is a lie.<eos> It is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak.<eos> Cast it from your mind. Never let it render you frail of mind, or of will.
Please drink.<eos> No water for him!<eos> No, Judah.<eos> My life,<eos> I give it of my own free will.
Loud and distracting?<eos> I've got just the thing.<eos> Do not break my music.<eos> Break it?<eos> It will get an upgrade.
I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?<eos> - 12 bucks, pal.<eos> I always hated that palm tree.<eos> Never trusted it.
This business requires restraint.<eos> That is the opposite of restraint.<eos> But...<eos> I like it.<eos> I mean, I'm proud of it.
All right.<eos> We got a lot to do.<eos> What about the boat?<eos> We got to talk to George about it.<eos> There's no use hanging onto it if no one's going to use it. I'm going to use it.
Offer them low murder, and we're done with it.<eos> Oh, my God, what the hell is this?<eos> You look like you've been going after yourself with a sharpened pencil or something.<eos> Chopstick.<eos> Well, I had a guy use a knitting needle once. You could see right through it to the ankle bone with that one.
Ladies and gentlemen, Josh Greenberg.<eos> Masturbation.<eos> We all do it, but what if I told you, you've been doing it all wrong?
Why should I recognize this fucking car?<eos> It ain't familiar to you?<eos> It don't remind you of nothing, take you back?<eos> - Why should it?<eos> - You don't remember driving it?
Like, I would wear it as a scent.<eos> Dude, my hot French subletter is texting me asking my birthday.<eos> Maybe he wants to send me flowers, or, like, find out my zodiac sign to see if we're compatible.<eos> Euros are so into numerology.<eos> Madonna got really into it when she moved to London.
I left it...<eos> Cathy comic.<eos> - I left my diaphragm.<eos> - Diaphragm?<eos> Yeah, I've just started using it.
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.<eos> It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.<eos> Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.<eos> Science is neat.<eos> But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
We have to go back to the station.<eos> What?<eos> Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.<eos> That thing is still in there.<eos> And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
Who would we trust?<eos> Thought I could trust you, for instance.<eos> I'm not going to explain myself to you, Bernard.<eos> I was charged with safeguarding the park's intellectual property.<eos> Why would it be in danger?
No.<eos> But the one I did catch isn't going anywhere.<eos> I didn't figure an assassin would faint at the sight of his own blood.<eos> Hang on. I think I just found our target.<eos> Which of the Turners is it?
This is false advertising.<eos> You know, my theory is she's just a punk, you know?<eos> People like that, she grows up with all this personal baggage, you know?<eos> You know, family gripes, hurt by one parent or the other, trouble with siblings, boyfriends, all this psychological garbage, you know?<eos> This anger builds up inside and she's got to give it some kind of stupid noble justification.
Is there nothing we can do?<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> How long until the gamma cannon's charged?<eos> 20 more minutes, at least.<eos> It doesn't have enough energy to fire.
Well, because technically it's my song since I wrote it and it's mostly my vocal, and I just don't think it's fair...<eos> Scarlett, it's all about what's best for the band, so it's got to be the song that tells the best story.<eos> Okay?<eos> ♪ This old guitar ♪<eos> ♪ Hell, I've even gone and named it ♪
These are schedules for all the presidential candidates for next week... their movements, their security details.<eos> We can't give this to them.<eos> They'll be sitting ducks.<eos> We can't put this intel into the hands of a terrorist.<eos> We can, but only if we can track them down before they actually use it.
Sorry we had to do this the hard way.<eos> We all have pain.<eos> Some of it is physical from injuries or age.<eos> Some is mental, you know, Living with the loss of our loved ones.<eos> If you think about it, whether we fight that pain Or succumb to it, the result is the same.
In fact, it's all rather boring here.<eos> As ever, with love, Vanessa.<eos> She has told her story.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Did the doctor believe it?
It's one thing to protect the city, another when it narrows down to one person.<eos> Someone you really care about.<eos> I'll find some way to fill my time.<eos> It's just as well, you know. I saw that abyss you spoke about, very scary, but so tempting.<eos> I don't know how you resist it.
A whore, resurrected to be given to your Creature.<eos> To spare your life.<eos> But even that great demon has proved to be more human than you.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
I don't know how.<eos> Because of his magic.<eos> His ma-- it's too strong.<eos> I've seen it before, back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.<eos> It's darkness, and whenever I have come up against it, I have gone nowhere.
I know it might not be the best time.<eos> Back at our place-- my place-- the--the place-- the loft...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Darhk's magic, it worked on you.<eos> I thought-- you thought I found a way to stop it.
One Batch, Two Batch...<eos> Penny and Dime.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I read her that book every night before this shit.<eos> I read it every single night, but, see, that was over now because Daddy's home now.
Who puts seeds in mustard?<eos> Those are mustard seeds.<eos> That's what you make mustard out of.<eos> No, mustard is yellow.<eos> You know, you go to The Ball Park. You put it on a hot dog.
And judging by your tone and bulging forehead vein, you're upset about it?<eos> She was this close to going home.<eos> You got to fire her!<eos> No.<eos> I have a mop, and I know how to use it.
No, I'll wait for you.<eos> - I'll wait upstairs.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Why psychology?<eos> Have you thought about it for a long time?
I'll help... but on one condition.<eos> What?<eos> You don't let it go too far.<eos> Now your bond with Jace can withstand a certain amount of strain.<eos> But you have to promise me that you won't let it break.
It's a... a request.<eos> This is one big field trip for you, isn't it?<eos> You-you-you wannabe.<eos> I've been to war!<eos> You just teach it.
I heard him getting up.<eos> I never should've let him go out so early.<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> It's... the farm has been in Russ' family for generations.<eos> If he can't run it...
I don't know of any.<eos> Thanks anyways.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> He had a dog.<eos> I wanted to give it a treat.
I know.<eos> You stopped typing hours ago.<eos> What if I'm just grabbing a headline, Sally?<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> That guy over there... he's gonna take my front-page story and he's gonna wipe his ass with it, and then he's gonna flush it down the toilet, and what for?
Yeah, right after the inauguration, we'll show Mr. McShittock the door.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I love my job.<eos> Oh, my God, I want to do it forever.
- so let's figure out what it is.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You want to Bunsen burner that thing?<eos> Ooh. Better yet, I have a centrifuge I bought in Colonial Williamsburg when I was 12...<eos> I've never used it, but I brought it to West Covina.
Got it!<eos> Got it.<eos> You don't think you're getting just a little bit obsessive about that gadget?<eos> Yes, and that's the beauty of it.<eos> I want to please it and make it proud of me.
- "Almost any..."<eos> - Wait.<eos> If Bailey was making a big buy from Steve, and he pats her down...<eos> - Discovers the wire...<eos> - Uses it to strangle her.
What the...?<eos> Ezekiel, talk to me.<eos> The sub just did an about-face on its own.<eos> - It's heading back to port.<eos> - Why would it do that?
You wanted a YouTube author.<eos> Liza, relax.<eos> You're an asset, okay?<eos> Your job is safe.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?
Thank you. She spit right in my face, so I really got that<eos> - right off the bat. - Now, why would my spit be on that ball?<eos> I know.<eos> I know exactly why.<eos> Why would it be there?
Wistfully.<eos> You have a role, a clear set of rules.<eos> All you have to do is follow them.<eos> Margaret, you have freedom.<eos> All you have to do is enjoy it.
Oh, yes, Ma'am.<eos> The dispatches from Afghanistan will require your complete attention.<eos> This is a fool's errand.<eos> Please try to be a bit more gallant, Albert.<eos> When you take her hand to kiss it, you must look deep into her eyes, as if you are going to drown in them, like this.
- Pack it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, Tino, I'm gonna need you to take your shirt off, but keep your hand pressed on your brother's leg the whole time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take your shirt, and wad it up into a ball, and try to pack it into your brother's leg.
You should've been listening!<eos> This is why he's looking for other best friends!<eos> Yes!<eos> The music's a clue.<eos> Follow it.
This film was made before the Paris attacks on Friday 13 November 2015<eos> In his time, Malraux declared the task of the 21st century would be to restore religion to mankind.<eos> Along with this agnostic, I conclude that only a renewal of religions, the religions which offer a light to guide people on the path away from evil, can give our country the spirit it needs to help it accept its diversity.
Breath of fresh air.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Got a meet.<eos> Someone's having a nic fit.<eos> Maybe you should treat it, not manage it.
But creating a Cyber Command meant using the same technology to do offense.<eos> Once you get inside an adversary's computer networks, you put an implant in that network.<eos> And we have tens of thousands of foreign computers and networks that the United States put implants in.<eos> You can use it to monitor what's going across that network and you can use it to insert cyber weapons, malware.<eos> If you can spy on a network, you can manipulate it.
They will all die anyway in your master's infernal plan.<eos> We are not yet certain what will happen.<eos> I still hope...<eos> Again, hope.<eos> You are so filled with it.
Tell us why we should support that.<eos> I'm not running for president.<eos> Was this your plan all along, to drop out of the election?<eos> The country needed reassurance.<eos> Now it needs a real election, and that cannot happen - if I run.
Okay, well, that's just a coincidence.<eos> I, I haven't spoken to Ezra in years.<eos> I'm sure we'll never even cross paths at this job.<eos> You were right about why I took that job.<eos> Part of me was hoping that it'd bring me and Ezra back together.
We have to.<eos> It's -- it's karma.<eos> You know, karma's been kicking us in the teeth lately.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So let's kick it back.
With his history, it was a matter of time before we zeroed in on him.<eos> And with a little nudge, Zoe would attribute any physical evidence found to him and not you.<eos> Teri felt responsible for the whole chain of events. So to protect you and to leave your children with at least one parent not in prison, she tried to take the blame for both crimes.<eos> Fortunately for them, we understand they have very loving grandparents.<eos> Unfortunately for you, when lab work is done right, without bias, without assumption, it really does tend to convince a jury of a killer's guilt.
Because you're my sister and you like to meddle.<eos> Luke.<eos> I have a life.<eos> It's my life.<eos> It consumes my time.
That's right, fuck the lot of you!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> You and I were loved so much even if our fathers couldn't stay around for us.<eos> Maybe we both need to be held while we grieve, but it has to be someone who can feel pain for our pain,<eos> not revel in it.
So, please, do my family a favor and get the hell out of here.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> That will be all.<eos> So, it's a basic decortication procedure, except there is a slight abnormality.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I can't take your decortication procedure 'cause I already took it.
And I will.<eos> I am a very patient man.<eos> And I am right, which makes me even more patient since she is overreacting.<eos> I know it and she knows it, though she's not ready to admit it yet.<eos> So I am biding my time until she apologizes, at which point I will haul my ass back into our bedroom where it belongs.
I'm gonna find and stop whoever tried to kill you.<eos> There's a manhunt on for an escaped prisoner named Ruslan Krasnov.<eos> Ruslan is just the trigger man, he's not the architect of the assassination attempt.<eos> We've dealt with this organization before, Watson.<eos> It was run by Moriarty.
- What?<eos> - Mm-hmm. See, uh, I noticed how much bacon we use, so I ordered 250 pounds of it in bulk because it's 20% cheaper.<eos> Wow, that's great!<eos> I love a cheap woman.<eos> Well, I hope you bought toilet paper in bulk, 'cause you're full of it.
Emphasis on "pitch."<eos> It's a tuning fork.<eos> Why does the car keep making that infernal noise?<eos> Oh, it's reminding you to put your seatbelt on.<eos> Well, you can remind it that I'm immortal.
Mazikeen, what is this strange gooey substance that this boy is cooing about?<eos> You watching porn?<eos> what is this?<eos> It's like money.<eos> Humans use it to buy things they can't afford.
Magda, I-I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but...you're gonna be all right.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You will do this.<eos> Just remember, that power... it doesn't control you.<eos> You control it.
And what does that tell you?<eos> It's old.<eos> It's not plastic.<eos> It's a handmade work of art.<eos> It's also slow as shit, which means it takes a real man to row it faster than everybody else.
- I'm not a kid.<eos> - I know, but you can't blame me for being a little worried.<eos> You're volunteering to go on board a station that has a good chance of blowing up.<eos> Well, that's the whole point isn't it?<eos> We've got to find the bomb and stop it from going off.
Right, your text from earlier.<eos> Seattle PD cruiser 916.<eos> This bullet looks undamaged.<eos> Hardened polymer.<eos> I put it into a steel water tank, and there's not even a scratch.
Excuse me?<eos> Why hasn't it come through yet?<eos> Oh, there must've been a mix-up in the paperwork.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're holding it up because he's threatening to sue you.
Addidale, if I may use your full name.<eos> That's not my name.<eos> Addidale.<eos> Fate has reunited us.<eos> And for that I thank it.
Then Mike's chance of getting out of prison is gone, which means Cahill's not the only one that needs to use this to try and get something.<eos> I have to admit, Ms. Zane, when you said you were looking into the Bailey case, my interest was piqued.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Well, you've obviously come a long way since your public defender days.<eos> You don't exactly see the best of humanity at that job, which makes it one you can only do for so long.
You asked me why I was drinking that night.<eos> It was because I found out the thing that I worked so hard on to get that prick's approval was nothing but a lie.<eos> - Your trading program.<eos> - Yeah, my program.<eos> Turns out he wasn't using it at all.
Someone must've stolen it.<eos> And you didn't notice, didn't report it?<eos> I keep it parked in a crappy lot.<eos> On the West side.<eos> I barely use it in the city.
I don't know if one day you'll forgive me.<eos> I just want you to go on without the weight of lies and doubt.<eos> Look at that moon.<eos> It's so full and bright.<eos> You can see why people thought it had mystical powers.
- Gets me into Stanford or Berkeley.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But will it make you happy?<eos> I mean, look at Tío.<eos> He's got all those degrees, bought this sweet car, never has time to enjoy it.
Nobody's dying.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> Yeah, you just want to keep me alive so you can grow weed in my ass and make a cozy robe out of my beard.<eos> Well no thank you, lady.<eos> I like my skin wrapped around my bones right where it belongs.
Mainly with Shay.<eos> So, what we have to do is get round that so we can knock this whole crypt idea on the head.<eos> And that job starts tonight and we all have to play our part.<eos> You got that?<eos> Which is why we are going to Big Mac's party and we are going to enjoy it, no matter how much we hate it.
Don't give up.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> I wouldn't give up.<eos> I will fight for her until my last breath.<eos> But what if this destiny can't be beat and we're just moving towards it?
- What's your name?<eos> - Pam.<eos> Let me see your hand.<eos> Ouch, ouch. I hope you don't mind, I had to put your cart out on the curb.<eos> It's busted.
What?<eos> No! You weighed in wrong.<eos> I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen.<eos> And I'm not taking your side against the universe's.<eos> - It's hundred of years old.
Tell me your name.<eos> Tull.<eos> Love is a lie.<eos> It is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak.<eos> Cast it from your mind. Never let it render you frail of mind, or of will.
Please drink.<eos> No water for him!<eos> No, Judah.<eos> My life,<eos> I give it of my own free will.
Loud and distracting?<eos> I've got just the thing.<eos> Do not break my music.<eos> Break it?<eos> It will get an upgrade.
I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?<eos> - 12 bucks, pal.<eos> I always hated that palm tree.<eos> Never trusted it.
This business requires restraint.<eos> That is the opposite of restraint.<eos> But...<eos> I like it.<eos> I mean, I'm proud of it.
All right.<eos> We got a lot to do.<eos> What about the boat?<eos> We got to talk to George about it.<eos> There's no use hanging onto it if no one's going to use it. I'm going to use it.
Offer them low murder, and we're done with it.<eos> Oh, my God, what the hell is this?<eos> You look like you've been going after yourself with a sharpened pencil or something.<eos> Chopstick.<eos> Well, I had a guy use a knitting needle once. You could see right through it to the ankle bone with that one.
Ladies and gentlemen, Josh Greenberg.<eos> Masturbation.<eos> We all do it, but what if I told you, you've been doing it all wrong?
Why should I recognize this fucking car?<eos> It ain't familiar to you?<eos> It don't remind you of nothing, take you back?<eos> - Why should it?<eos> - You don't remember driving it?
Like, I would wear it as a scent.<eos> Dude, my hot French subletter is texting me asking my birthday.<eos> Maybe he wants to send me flowers, or, like, find out my zodiac sign to see if we're compatible.<eos> Euros are so into numerology.<eos> Madonna got really into it when she moved to London.
I left it...<eos> Cathy comic.<eos> - I left my diaphragm.<eos> - Diaphragm?<eos> Yeah, I've just started using it.
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.<eos> It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.<eos> Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.<eos> Science is neat.<eos> But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
We have to go back to the station.<eos> What?<eos> Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.<eos> That thing is still in there.<eos> And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
Who would we trust?<eos> Thought I could trust you, for instance.<eos> I'm not going to explain myself to you, Bernard.<eos> I was charged with safeguarding the park's intellectual property.<eos> Why would it be in danger?
No.<eos> But the one I did catch isn't going anywhere.<eos> I didn't figure an assassin would faint at the sight of his own blood.<eos> Hang on. I think I just found our target.<eos> Which of the Turners is it?
This is false advertising.<eos> You know, my theory is she's just a punk, you know?<eos> People like that, she grows up with all this personal baggage, you know?<eos> You know, family gripes, hurt by one parent or the other, trouble with siblings, boyfriends, all this psychological garbage, you know?<eos> This anger builds up inside and she's got to give it some kind of stupid noble justification.
Is there nothing we can do?<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> How long until the gamma cannon's charged?<eos> 20 more minutes, at least.<eos> It doesn't have enough energy to fire.
Well, because technically it's my song since I wrote it and it's mostly my vocal, and I just don't think it's fair...<eos> Scarlett, it's all about what's best for the band, so it's got to be the song that tells the best story.<eos> Okay?<eos> ♪ This old guitar ♪<eos> ♪ Hell, I've even gone and named it ♪
These are schedules for all the presidential candidates for next week... their movements, their security details.<eos> We can't give this to them.<eos> They'll be sitting ducks.<eos> We can't put this intel into the hands of a terrorist.<eos> We can, but only if we can track them down before they actually use it.
Sorry we had to do this the hard way.<eos> We all have pain.<eos> Some of it is physical from injuries or age.<eos> Some is mental, you know, Living with the loss of our loved ones.<eos> If you think about it, whether we fight that pain Or succumb to it, the result is the same.
In fact, it's all rather boring here.<eos> As ever, with love, Vanessa.<eos> She has told her story.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Did the doctor believe it?
It's one thing to protect the city, another when it narrows down to one person.<eos> Someone you really care about.<eos> I'll find some way to fill my time.<eos> It's just as well, you know. I saw that abyss you spoke about, very scary, but so tempting.<eos> I don't know how you resist it.
A whore, resurrected to be given to your Creature.<eos> To spare your life.<eos> But even that great demon has proved to be more human than you.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
I don't know how.<eos> Because of his magic.<eos> His ma-- it's too strong.<eos> I've seen it before, back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.<eos> It's darkness, and whenever I have come up against it, I have gone nowhere.
I know it might not be the best time.<eos> Back at our place-- my place-- the--the place-- the loft...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Darhk's magic, it worked on you.<eos> I thought-- you thought I found a way to stop it.
One Batch, Two Batch...<eos> Penny and Dime.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I read her that book every night before this shit.<eos> I read it every single night, but, see, that was over now because Daddy's home now.
Who puts seeds in mustard?<eos> Those are mustard seeds.<eos> That's what you make mustard out of.<eos> No, mustard is yellow.<eos> You know, you go to The Ball Park. You put it on a hot dog.
And judging by your tone and bulging forehead vein, you're upset about it?<eos> She was this close to going home.<eos> You got to fire her!<eos> No.<eos> I have a mop, and I know how to use it.
No, I'll wait for you.<eos> - I'll wait upstairs.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Why psychology?<eos> Have you thought about it for a long time?
I'll help... but on one condition.<eos> What?<eos> You don't let it go too far.<eos> Now your bond with Jace can withstand a certain amount of strain.<eos> But you have to promise me that you won't let it break.
It's a... a request.<eos> This is one big field trip for you, isn't it?<eos> You-you-you wannabe.<eos> I've been to war!<eos> You just teach it.
I heard him getting up.<eos> I never should've let him go out so early.<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> It's... the farm has been in Russ' family for generations.<eos> If he can't run it...
I don't know of any.<eos> Thanks anyways.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> He had a dog.<eos> I wanted to give it a treat.
I know.<eos> You stopped typing hours ago.<eos> What if I'm just grabbing a headline, Sally?<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> That guy over there... he's gonna take my front-page story and he's gonna wipe his ass with it, and then he's gonna flush it down the toilet, and what for?
Yeah, right after the inauguration, we'll show Mr. McShittock the door.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I love my job.<eos> Oh, my God, I want to do it forever.
- so let's figure out what it is.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You want to Bunsen burner that thing?<eos> Ooh. Better yet, I have a centrifuge I bought in Colonial Williamsburg when I was 12...<eos> I've never used it, but I brought it to West Covina.
Got it!<eos> Got it.<eos> You don't think you're getting just a little bit obsessive about that gadget?<eos> Yes, and that's the beauty of it.<eos> I want to please it and make it proud of me.
- "Almost any..."<eos> - Wait.<eos> If Bailey was making a big buy from Steve, and he pats her down...<eos> - Discovers the wire...<eos> - Uses it to strangle her.
What the...?<eos> Ezekiel, talk to me.<eos> The sub just did an about-face on its own.<eos> - It's heading back to port.<eos> - Why would it do that?
You wanted a YouTube author.<eos> Liza, relax.<eos> You're an asset, okay?<eos> Your job is safe.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?
Thank you. She spit right in my face, so I really got that<eos> - right off the bat. - Now, why would my spit be on that ball?<eos> I know.<eos> I know exactly why.<eos> Why would it be there?
Wistfully.<eos> You have a role, a clear set of rules.<eos> All you have to do is follow them.<eos> Margaret, you have freedom.<eos> All you have to do is enjoy it.
Oh, yes, Ma'am.<eos> The dispatches from Afghanistan will require your complete attention.<eos> This is a fool's errand.<eos> Please try to be a bit more gallant, Albert.<eos> When you take her hand to kiss it, you must look deep into her eyes, as if you are going to drown in them, like this.
- Pack it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, Tino, I'm gonna need you to take your shirt off, but keep your hand pressed on your brother's leg the whole time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take your shirt, and wad it up into a ball, and try to pack it into your brother's leg.

I'm sure you're right.<eos> - Would you like a tour of the house?<eos> - What did she say?<eos> She wants to show us around her farmhouse.<eos> - She's proud of it, I think.
HAMILTON:<eos> I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory<eos> When's it's gonna get me? In my sleep?<eos> Seven feet ahead of me?<eos> If I see it coming, do I run or do I let it be?
HAMILTON:<eos> Burr, that's why we need it<eos> BURR:<eos> The constitution's a mess HAMILTON:<eos> So it needs amendments
We don't have regular people.<eos> We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Who showed you the mop?<eos> Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?
No, ma'am.<eos> My body feels like cotton.<eos> I gave you some tincture of opium.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I need to clean the wound and sew it shut.
To Captain Low.<eos> He paid 90 pieces for it.<eos> - Why would you do...?<eos> - Why wouldn't I?<eos> Valuable information walks in the door, I should let it walk out?
Where'd he get that car from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not one that's sold in Canada.<eos> Then how come he has it?
I know what you're thinking.<eos> "That's impossible.<eos> How could it be 4028?<eos> How could we have skipped so much time?"<eos> But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state which allows it to survive all winter long without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
[Groans] [Rap music playing] [Laughter]<eos> This is the life, isn't it, Jay?<eos> Yeah. [Chuckles]<eos> Totally, Chet.<eos> You know, you have to take what life offers, look it in the eye, and embrace it.
- I didn't think anyone noticed.<eos> - I did.<eos> It was, um... it was Sara's birthday.<eos> I mean, once before she disappeared.<eos> I gave it to her as a present, and she loved it.
Um, I just want to look better.<eos> Blush.<eos> It will wake you right up.<eos> Same company makes this organic mascara.<eos> I'm wearing it now.
And adulthood, actually.<eos> We need to shut the story down.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Thank you, Sue.<eos> Well, why haven't you shut it down?
God damn it, Abe.<eos> But I had no intention of giving myself up.<eos> A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.<eos> I'd have been fine if that little game of Russian Roulette ended it.
So, Master Cromwell. William Popely tells me I might find a use for you.<eos> A man of many talents, he says.<eos> A remarkable memory?<eos> There's a technique, My Lord.<eos> I learnt it in Italy.
Its sap contains an alkaloid toxin which blocks the calcium channels in the heart.<eos> Just a single drop, the heart stops completely, and death... is nearly instantaneous.<eos> If nature had its way, you'd already be dead.<eos> But this plant is harmless, because I grafted the poison out of it.<eos> On this island, nature does what I tell it to do.
Ana?<eos> Ana?<eos> Ana!<eos> - A little bird... came into the house.<eos> I'm helping it out.
- Hi. Hi.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Uh, please, sit.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Frankly, I've-I've hit a bit of a rough patch, and it's made me realize that I have not been the best to women.
"Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."<eos> And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.<eos> I started my career more than 30 years ago in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana.<eos> I've had a lot of different jobs including two terms as your governor, and soon a new, unknown challenge awaits me, which to me, even now, is thrilling because I love the work.<eos> Not to say that public service isn't sexy, because it definitely is, but that's not why we do it.
I joined it to garden, to make things grow.<eos> Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.
Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.<eos> You can use it, and you can return it!
Keep them coming, people.<eos> There are no bad ideas.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> I-I had an idea. And it's not a cost-saving initiative.<eos> Actually, it'll... it'll cost us money.
That's so awful.<eos> No, it wasn't awful.<eos> It was fun. LIV: In the six months I've been eating brains,<eos> I've inherited things like a fear of pigeons, kleptomania... A couple scoops of Javier's brain in a microwave pizza roll and I find myself feeling passionate, inspired.<eos> I'm not just drawn to beauty, I want to possess it, make love to it.
Can I?<eos> I like it.<eos> Hey, Van Damme, give me the fucking bag.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Give it to me or we beat the fuck out of you.
But he's your brother.<eos> I mean, what else is he gonna do?<eos> Marco, listen to me, all right?<eos> Chuck's not making me do this.<eos> He's giving me an opportunity, and I'm grabbing it.

It's shredding the edge of the tumor near the subglottis.<eos> We need more tissue.<eos> She's cyanotic.<eos> There's no pulse.<eos> We can harvest from the soft palate and use it to cover the shredded area near the subglottis.
What you doing?<eos> Bog off!<eos> ~ Girl's in there?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> But it's 60 and breathing, with its legs open.
- You went shopping?<eos> Sort of...<eos> - You stole it?<eos> - Which is the greater sin?<eos> Stealing food or wasting it?
And when they do, they will destroy the one item in this world The Master desires.<eos> But as long as this book exists...<eos> It is bait!<eos> Do you want the Master?<eos> He will come for whoever possesses it.
Is there still peril for you here, Senator?<eos> Is that a threat, Ms. Person?<eos> Just an honest question.<eos> Life is always perilous.<eos> That's what gives it its spice.
~ OK.<eos> Has anybody warned you about this, Mr Gently?<eos> A lumbar puncture is a very painful procedure.<eos> So I understand.<eos> Look, I wouldn't subject you to it if there were any other way to test my diagnosis.
Anything else?<eos> Well, the sneaker is a specialty brand used by serious runners ...<eos> it has a zero drop. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're losing me.<eos> A zero-millimeter differential in height from heel to toe, which provides a wider range of motion, strengthening the foot, forcing it to work harder.
How did you even get on A.J.'s radar in the first place?<eos> I went to the video store, asked a bunch of stupid questions.<eos> Right before you showed up, I now realize, to investigate Sammy's murder, not to get instructions from your gang overlord.<eos> That you'd even think I'd be on the same side as that twisted wannabe ninja...<eos> Clive, I know it's hard to understand, but it's not like I just heard a rumor and believed it.
I drew a freak. You didn't draw a freak.<eos> You drew a man with a freak on his back.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> I know there's nothing wrong with me.<eos> In making friends, I try to be wary of people who foster dependency and feed on it.
Let me guess...<eos> She got the house.<eos> I'll take whatever he's having.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> An evacuation pod will wash up where and when it wants to.
- It was not.<eos> - Okay, maybe it wasn't.<eos> But, either way, she wouldn't let me near it or her for months.<eos> Leila.<eos> Then one day, she let me wash it.
More than a valiant last stand.<eos> We need a strategy.<eos> A little help please.<eos> It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second.
I'm afraid you missed it.<eos> We need a strategy.<eos> A little help please.<eos> It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second, it's got a lot on its mind.
What's a singularity?<eos> It's a black hole.<eos> We could destroy Central City.<eos> For starters.<eos> If we create a singularity here and then cannot control it, we could be looking at a global catastrophe.
Looks like if we want the candyman, We'll have to find him ourselves.<eos> I'm missing a rat.<eos> Liv.<eos> You're rocking a rat.<eos> I am five seconds away from naming it and then making it a grilled cheese.
I'm really sorry, mate, but I can't.<eos> I've been trying for days.<eos> I can't live like this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can shoulder this burden, let it consume you from within.
I've been trying for days.<eos> I can't live like this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can shoulder this burden, let it consume you from within.<eos> Or you can wield it as you have.
Blah, blah, blah, have another drink."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That is exactly what I'm doing.<eos> You know, sometimes, I see this glimmer in you.<eos> - You know, you're... - if you eat that last danish, I will reach down your throat, pull it out, and beat you to death with it!
Don't do it for your mama. Don't do it for your brothers. You do it for the sake of the music.<eos> You got to remember, that's why God put us on this planet, Mal.<eos> Regardless of how we fight or we feel about each other or try to hurt each other, the music, man.<eos> Music, that's forever.<eos> They'll dance to it forever. They'll sing to it forever. They'll be inspired by it forever.
If this were a business and an employee was that insubordinate...<eos> This is not a business.<eos> In an academia we encourage debate and opinions that may differ from the administration's.<eos> This is Anchor Beach, not Harvard, Lena.<eos> And what this school needs to get out of debt, is strong leadership, which it has not had.
Sounds about right.<eos> New, hand me those calipers.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I thought you didn't trust anything that's not human.<eos> A microwave isn't human. Yet you let it make your food.
You're kind to me, Brother Thor.<eos> But kindnesses will not clad my men's feet, nor put food on their table.<eos> No.<eos> This is what faith is for.<eos> And we must practice it with open hearts, not bitter ones.
Roll homicide and a coroner to my location.<eos> I got a Beretta.<eos> Magazine doesn't have a single scratch from loading.<eos> I don't think there's ever been a bullet in this gun.<eos> Whoever brought this had no intention of using it.
- Remarkable.<eos> - So you knew I'd beat it.<eos> How? Because Castor and Leda have the same disorder.<eos> It attacks the boys' brains, the women's epithelial tissue... but as your fertility proves, Sarah, you're somehow able to fight it off.<eos> You're infecting innocent women with it.
- What? - Cosima needs my pee.<eos> What do you mean she needs your pee?<eos> What for? I don't know, science?<eos> I... don't know.<eos> If she wants it, she can come and get it.
Well, since they themselves have been so public about their treatment with us,<eos> I feel we can say they're patients, although I can't divulge specifics.<eos> All right, then. In a general way, what-- what about their case is significant?<eos> let's take, as an example, a real ape taken out of its natural habitat, as a good way of understanding what happened with the Neelys...<eos> Because if you take that ape and damage it in ways that only humans can inflict damage, watch it turn itself into something it's not, then our job is to take those shattered parts and, uh, bring them together,
Help me make him comfortable.<eos> What was that?<eos> Long before... Your stories began...<eos> The sorcerer battled the darkness.<eos> He was able to keep it from consuming the realms.
Relax, Hugs.<eos> I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I shouldn't.<eos> Now, I'm only gonna point you in a direction; the rest is up to you to figure out.<eos> DOGLEG is the code name of a top secret black op in Tunisia.<eos> I oversaw it for the CIA.
Whether I am alive or dead makes no difference to what is coming.<eos> You will never take away my faith.<eos> All the world's religions cannot be right, Peretta.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your faith is beautiful as poetry is beautiful... but there is no place for it now.
Have you all been conferring along the way?<eos> Well, Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> My God, it wasn't on the ground.<eos> He was swinging it around. He was dangerous.
(Ritchie) Previously on The Slap... (Bridget) Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> It wasn't on the ground.<eos> He was swinging it around.
Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it.<eos> That's like me having you two for waitresses.<eos> Caroline, can I ask you a favor?<eos> You're not using the car to propose to Sophie.<eos> You heard how much she liked it.
I don't need a therapist.<eos> The hood and eye makeup may suggest otherwise.<eos> Stop trying to run from your inner darkness.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Let it run its course.
It's not just one night.<eos> This has been happening for weeks.<eos> I'm hearing things, seeing things.<eos> Seeing Lawrence.<eos> No, this malady is real, and I'm not going to let it beat me.
A major social movement arose that spanned half the country.<eos> We heard voices we'd never heard before.<eos> Allende began to give back to the natives the lands that had been seized from them.<eos> The freedom didn't last for long.<eos> It was destroyed by a coup d'Etat, financed by the United States.
You know what this is?<eos> Okay, why do you keep showing me things And asking me what they are?<eos> It is my official recommendation to the chief of police That you be relieved of active duty Due to your imminent and inevitable death.<eos> And what are you planning to do with that?<eos> Because the hippocratic oath prevents me from shoving it Up your ass, I intend to deliver it
In fact, there was a very funny moment.<eos> I was doing a documentary with a friend.<eos> He was following with a camera, and I said,<eos> "St Mary's hospital is right down here.<eos> "That's where I was born." And as I was showing it to him, a wrecking ball came out of nowhere and just knocked it down and, apparently, they were moving it across the street.
Is that a fact?<eos> Check 'em out next time you're in court-- little looks between 'em, smiles.<eos> He objects, she sustains, every time.<eos> The old flame's still burning, huh?<eos> I think they'd burn it up right there on the bench if they could.
Shakespeare needs to live out his days here as history remembers.<eos> Great, Will, you step through to your time, we'll step through to ours, all... all good.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Once Master Shakespeare is back in 1611, the primary paradox is closed.<eos> Timeline requires that he live out life in the past, but it will not allow you to return.
It still haunts me.<eos> That's why I didn't go away this week.<eos> My trip wasn't canceled.<eos> Everyone found out and-- I get it-- you couldn't face them.<eos> Listen, I know this part of your life may not be moving fast enough for you, but enjoy it while it lasts.
1,200 years, and we've only written one song!<eos> (loud gulping) Man. (gulps)<eos> Staying on this all-pork-chop diet is easier than I thought.<eos> That diet doesn't work.<eos> You have to give it a year.
Late 30s?<eos> - Not that kind of vibe.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I'm like a vessel.<eos> I walk the earth, and I breathe it in, and I absorb it.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.<eos> Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?<eos> Well, it's very straightforward.<eos> Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.<eos> He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Help me make him comfortable.<eos> What was that?<eos> [ weakly ] Long before... Your stories began...<eos> The sorcerer battled the darkness.<eos> He was able to keep it from consuming the realms. He tethered it to a human soul that could be controlled with a dagger.
Marie's crying face?<eos> Not for me.<eos> Well, coleslaw... just when I thought I was out, you pulled me back in again.<eos> Max, don't tell the coleslaw that.<eos> Don't give it that power.
Just go.<eos> Hey.<eos> I knew you were out.<eos> Just wanted to check your security program to see if we located the drive.<eos> Well, Victoria hasn't plugged it in in the last week.
Take me to Joe.<eos> Hey, careful.<eos> That thing might be loaded.<eos> It is, but...<eos> I don't know how to use it.
Ah, this isn't bad, Cookie.<eos> We'll start investigating the deal right away.<eos> At the very least, we'll tie it up for years.<eos> Yeah, well, Lucious is gonna fight you on that, because he really wants this deal to go through.<eos> It's as good as dead.
I want to make this easier for you.<eos> Pain is my business.<eos> I know it like a mother knows her child.<eos> I nurture pain.<eos> I help it grow.
Speak loud and fast.<eos> Steve collapsed, doc.<eos> Crashed the boat.<eos> Have you called an ambulance?<eos> 'No, there's no way it would get into the cove and the lifeboat is here with us.'
Would you like a sedative, Jim?<eos> I want this damn thing taken out.<eos> (Will) Believe it or not, you're fine for now.<eos> If I remove that from your chest, that's when you're gonna be in trouble.<eos> So I'm gonna cut down the bone so it doesn't move and damage your lung.
Well, congratulations.<eos> Now if you'll please just sign the release.<eos> What is this?<eos> It indemnifies the imaging center in the event that the pregnancy is no longer viable.<eos> Why wouldn't it be viable?
No.<eos> In life there are too many questions with a lack of time to answer them.<eos> You may not understand this.<eos> I live by a 5,000-year-old book.<eos> I ask it questions as if it were alive.
You were sleep-deprived.<eos> You probably just imagined it.<eos> No, I..<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> The blood just wasn't on me, it was smeared across the floor like somebody just dragged a body out.
He's obviously not taking the program seriously.<eos> Tony said he's willing to compose for two pianists.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I did write a fugue.<eos> She didn't like it.
There is, I'm afraid.<eos> I've just been reading some of the letters you've been writing to friendless troops.<eos> There isn't one in which you haven't told the recipient to... keep out of danger and get home safely to his mother.<eos> We're writing to soldiers, Mim.<eos> Men whose job, whether we like it or not, is to... face and embrace danger, not... hide from it.
New events, new experiences, new people.<eos> New things to consider.<eos> You'll never forget your husband, Kate.<eos> But life will seek you out... .. and seep through once more.<eos> And when it does... .. let it.
How about nitroglycerin?<eos> Look, man. We got the kid's beat-down GTO running a red light four blocks from the scene.<eos> Got it all on tape.<eos> Hey! That's bullshit, man! I drive safe!<eos> We got the same car joyriding around the port of LA where it sure as hell don't belong.
I haven't dismissed you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To get justice.<eos> [Scoffs] I am justice.<eos> This is a private matter, Olivia, protected by diplomatic immunity and by the nondisclosure agreement you signed when you entered my employ, guaranteeing that the monarchy of Caledonia will continue as it has [Inhales deeply] For millennia to come [Sighs] as it must.
Ah, yes, there is the Danny I know.<eos> Sorry I wasted your time.<eos> Okay, universe, I guess the lesson here is that, without me, Danny Castellano is a miserable meatball.<eos> But without him, my life is much better.<eos> Might as well enjoy it.
What if one last heartbeat is all I've got?<eos> What if time isn't healing?<eos> What if the universe needs me to die?<eos> The universe is over!<eos> It doesn't have a say any more!
There has to be a way to make that.<eos> We didn't come this far to fail.<eos> Maybe we don't have to get there.<eos> Hand me the bottle.<eos> We can fire it right into the portal.
All our body-cams are up and running...<eos> - Now. - Good.<eos> Thank you, Buzz.<eos> - Lieutenant Provenza, are you ready to move?<eos> - Yes, Captain. Okay, Sykes, there's only one door up here. I've got it covered.
You're the finest we ever made.<eos> You're the only one that can do this.<eos> And if you cross over to that other side, you will finally see that your faith in Hydra was never misplaced.<eos> It's real.<eos> You will look it in the eye.
And I had the best moments of my life with her.<eos> Is it possible for someone to have the darkness, but use it for good, use it to protect people?<eos> Emma, don't let those thoughts tempt you.<eos> But is it true?<eos> Someday perhaps there will be a person who's worthy to hold that much power and not let it burn through to darken their soul.
Okay, I'll read the whole story.<eos> Did you get a book?<eos> I did.<eos> One that someone very special introduced me to.<eos> Now I want to share it with someone new... Make sure she understands what she means to me.
Thank you.<eos> Lab results got back.<eos> The blood in Woodhull's trunk is a match for Jeremy Dolan.<eos> - The blood is how old?<eos> - It's two days old.
They even blindfolded them.<eos> But they didn't do that this time.<eos> No blindfolds, and the 3 victims were found in the same area, all within a few feet of each other.<eos> Dee's Original Diner had a back office.<eos> Why didn't they use it?
One of the richest hoteliers in the world.<eos> She's currently building a resort on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.<eos> Simultaneously, as it happens, the global energy firm for which Father consults wishes to erect a wind farm nearby.<eos> Mrs. Esfandiari has won an injunction against the wind farm, asserting that it would impair her view.<eos> Now, Father thinks she's willing to drop it given the right favors in return.
Point it at me.<eos> Look, that painting belongs to my family.<eos> My father spent his life trying to find it.<eos> He died a broken man.<eos> There's no way I'm going to let it sit in some billionaire's man cave.
Then how 'bout the bathroom?<eos> I want to change my answer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then the dining room.<eos> I guess we didn't use it very often.
If I'd known about Edwards, I would've approached the whole thing differently.<eos> Um, we're... we're having this thing at the house tonight.<eos> Um... You two should come.<eos> Um, there's gonna be food, booze.<eos> She could probably use it.
Okay, well... how about I text you after I talk to Romy?<eos> It was great seeing you, Caroline.<eos> You too, Max.<eos> You guys are gonna watch my butt as I walk away, right?<eos> You gonna make it clap for daddy?
It was great seeing you, Caroline.<eos> You too, Max.<eos> You guys are gonna watch my butt as I walk away, right?<eos> You gonna make it clap for daddy?<eos> I cannot make it clap, but I can make it go, "Whoo!"
I'm sure you're right.<eos> - Would you like a tour of the house?<eos> - What did she say?<eos> She wants to show us around her farmhouse.<eos> - She's proud of it, I think.
HAMILTON:<eos> I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory<eos> When's it's gonna get me? In my sleep?<eos> Seven feet ahead of me?<eos> If I see it coming, do I run or do I let it be?
HAMILTON:<eos> Burr, that's why we need it<eos> BURR:<eos> The constitution's a mess HAMILTON:<eos> So it needs amendments
We don't have regular people.<eos> We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Who showed you the mop?<eos> Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?
No, ma'am.<eos> My body feels like cotton.<eos> I gave you some tincture of opium.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I need to clean the wound and sew it shut.
To Captain Low.<eos> He paid 90 pieces for it.<eos> - Why would you do...?<eos> - Why wouldn't I?<eos> Valuable information walks in the door, I should let it walk out?
Where'd he get that car from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not one that's sold in Canada.<eos> Then how come he has it?
I know what you're thinking.<eos> "That's impossible.<eos> How could it be 4028?<eos> How could we have skipped so much time?"<eos> But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state which allows it to survive all winter long without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
[Groans] [Rap music playing] [Laughter]<eos> This is the life, isn't it, Jay?<eos> Yeah. [Chuckles]<eos> Totally, Chet.<eos> You know, you have to take what life offers, look it in the eye, and embrace it.
- I didn't think anyone noticed.<eos> - I did.<eos> It was, um... it was Sara's birthday.<eos> I mean, once before she disappeared.<eos> I gave it to her as a present, and she loved it.
Um, I just want to look better.<eos> Blush.<eos> It will wake you right up.<eos> Same company makes this organic mascara.<eos> I'm wearing it now.
And adulthood, actually.<eos> We need to shut the story down.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Thank you, Sue.<eos> Well, why haven't you shut it down?
God damn it, Abe.<eos> But I had no intention of giving myself up.<eos> A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.<eos> I'd have been fine if that little game of Russian Roulette ended it.
So, Master Cromwell. William Popely tells me I might find a use for you.<eos> A man of many talents, he says.<eos> A remarkable memory?<eos> There's a technique, My Lord.<eos> I learnt it in Italy.
Its sap contains an alkaloid toxin which blocks the calcium channels in the heart.<eos> Just a single drop, the heart stops completely, and death... is nearly instantaneous.<eos> If nature had its way, you'd already be dead.<eos> But this plant is harmless, because I grafted the poison out of it.<eos> On this island, nature does what I tell it to do.
Ana?<eos> Ana?<eos> Ana!<eos> - A little bird... came into the house.<eos> I'm helping it out.
- Hi. Hi.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Uh, please, sit.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Frankly, I've-I've hit a bit of a rough patch, and it's made me realize that I have not been the best to women.
"Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."<eos> And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.<eos> I started my career more than 30 years ago in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana.<eos> I've had a lot of different jobs including two terms as your governor, and soon a new, unknown challenge awaits me, which to me, even now, is thrilling because I love the work.<eos> Not to say that public service isn't sexy, because it definitely is, but that's not why we do it.
I joined it to garden, to make things grow.<eos> Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.
Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.<eos> You can use it, and you can return it!
Keep them coming, people.<eos> There are no bad ideas.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> I-I had an idea. And it's not a cost-saving initiative.<eos> Actually, it'll... it'll cost us money.
That's so awful.<eos> No, it wasn't awful.<eos> It was fun. LIV: In the six months I've been eating brains,<eos> I've inherited things like a fear of pigeons, kleptomania... A couple scoops of Javier's brain in a microwave pizza roll and I find myself feeling passionate, inspired.<eos> I'm not just drawn to beauty, I want to possess it, make love to it.

Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it.<eos> That's like me having you two for waitresses.<eos> Caroline, can I ask you a favor?<eos> You're not using the car to propose to Sophie.<eos> You heard how much she liked it.
I don't need a therapist.<eos> The hood and eye makeup may suggest otherwise.<eos> Stop trying to run from your inner darkness.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Let it run its course.
It's not just one night.<eos> This has been happening for weeks.<eos> I'm hearing things, seeing things.<eos> Seeing Lawrence.<eos> No, this malady is real, and I'm not going to let it beat me.
A major social movement arose that spanned half the country.<eos> We heard voices we'd never heard before.<eos> Allende began to give back to the natives the lands that had been seized from them.<eos> The freedom didn't last for long.<eos> It was destroyed by a coup d'Etat, financed by the United States.
You know what this is?<eos> Okay, why do you keep showing me things And asking me what they are?<eos> It is my official recommendation to the chief of police That you be relieved of active duty Due to your imminent and inevitable death.<eos> And what are you planning to do with that?<eos> Because the hippocratic oath prevents me from shoving it Up your ass, I intend to deliver it
In fact, there was a very funny moment.<eos> I was doing a documentary with a friend.<eos> He was following with a camera, and I said,<eos> "St Mary's hospital is right down here.<eos> "That's where I was born." And as I was showing it to him, a wrecking ball came out of nowhere and just knocked it down and, apparently, they were moving it across the street.
Is that a fact?<eos> Check 'em out next time you're in court-- little looks between 'em, smiles.<eos> He objects, she sustains, every time.<eos> The old flame's still burning, huh?<eos> I think they'd burn it up right there on the bench if they could.
Shakespeare needs to live out his days here as history remembers.<eos> Great, Will, you step through to your time, we'll step through to ours, all... all good.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Once Master Shakespeare is back in 1611, the primary paradox is closed.<eos> Timeline requires that he live out life in the past, but it will not allow you to return.
It still haunts me.<eos> That's why I didn't go away this week.<eos> My trip wasn't canceled.<eos> Everyone found out and-- I get it-- you couldn't face them.<eos> Listen, I know this part of your life may not be moving fast enough for you, but enjoy it while it lasts.
1,200 years, and we've only written one song!<eos> (loud gulping) Man. (gulps)<eos> Staying on this all-pork-chop diet is easier than I thought.<eos> That diet doesn't work.<eos> You have to give it a year.
Late 30s?<eos> - Not that kind of vibe.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I'm like a vessel.<eos> I walk the earth, and I breathe it in, and I absorb it.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.<eos> Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?<eos> Well, it's very straightforward.<eos> Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.<eos> He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Help me make him comfortable.<eos> What was that?<eos> [ weakly ] Long before... Your stories began...<eos> The sorcerer battled the darkness.<eos> He was able to keep it from consuming the realms. He tethered it to a human soul that could be controlled with a dagger.
Marie's crying face?<eos> Not for me.<eos> Well, coleslaw... just when I thought I was out, you pulled me back in again.<eos> Max, don't tell the coleslaw that.<eos> Don't give it that power.
Just go.<eos> Hey.<eos> I knew you were out.<eos> Just wanted to check your security program to see if we located the drive.<eos> Well, Victoria hasn't plugged it in in the last week.
Take me to Joe.<eos> Hey, careful.<eos> That thing might be loaded.<eos> It is, but...<eos> I don't know how to use it.
Ah, this isn't bad, Cookie.<eos> We'll start investigating the deal right away.<eos> At the very least, we'll tie it up for years.<eos> Yeah, well, Lucious is gonna fight you on that, because he really wants this deal to go through.<eos> It's as good as dead.
I want to make this easier for you.<eos> Pain is my business.<eos> I know it like a mother knows her child.<eos> I nurture pain.<eos> I help it grow.
Speak loud and fast.<eos> Steve collapsed, doc.<eos> Crashed the boat.<eos> Have you called an ambulance?<eos> 'No, there's no way it would get into the cove and the lifeboat is here with us.'
Would you like a sedative, Jim?<eos> I want this damn thing taken out.<eos> (Will) Believe it or not, you're fine for now.<eos> If I remove that from your chest, that's when you're gonna be in trouble.<eos> So I'm gonna cut down the bone so it doesn't move and damage your lung.
Well, congratulations.<eos> Now if you'll please just sign the release.<eos> What is this?<eos> It indemnifies the imaging center in the event that the pregnancy is no longer viable.<eos> Why wouldn't it be viable?
No.<eos> In life there are too many questions with a lack of time to answer them.<eos> You may not understand this.<eos> I live by a 5,000-year-old book.<eos> I ask it questions as if it were alive.
You were sleep-deprived.<eos> You probably just imagined it.<eos> No, I..<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> The blood just wasn't on me, it was smeared across the floor like somebody just dragged a body out.
He's obviously not taking the program seriously.<eos> Tony said he's willing to compose for two pianists.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I did write a fugue.<eos> She didn't like it.
There is, I'm afraid.<eos> I've just been reading some of the letters you've been writing to friendless troops.<eos> There isn't one in which you haven't told the recipient to... keep out of danger and get home safely to his mother.<eos> We're writing to soldiers, Mim.<eos> Men whose job, whether we like it or not, is to... face and embrace danger, not... hide from it.
New events, new experiences, new people.<eos> New things to consider.<eos> You'll never forget your husband, Kate.<eos> But life will seek you out... .. and seep through once more.<eos> And when it does... .. let it.
How about nitroglycerin?<eos> Look, man. We got the kid's beat-down GTO running a red light four blocks from the scene.<eos> Got it all on tape.<eos> Hey! That's bullshit, man! I drive safe!<eos> We got the same car joyriding around the port of LA where it sure as hell don't belong.
I haven't dismissed you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To get justice.<eos> [Scoffs] I am justice.<eos> This is a private matter, Olivia, protected by diplomatic immunity and by the nondisclosure agreement you signed when you entered my employ, guaranteeing that the monarchy of Caledonia will continue as it has [Inhales deeply] For millennia to come [Sighs] as it must.
Ah, yes, there is the Danny I know.<eos> Sorry I wasted your time.<eos> Okay, universe, I guess the lesson here is that, without me, Danny Castellano is a miserable meatball.<eos> But without him, my life is much better.<eos> Might as well enjoy it.
What if one last heartbeat is all I've got?<eos> What if time isn't healing?<eos> What if the universe needs me to die?<eos> The universe is over!<eos> It doesn't have a say any more!
There has to be a way to make that.<eos> We didn't come this far to fail.<eos> Maybe we don't have to get there.<eos> Hand me the bottle.<eos> We can fire it right into the portal.
All our body-cams are up and running...<eos> - Now. - Good.<eos> Thank you, Buzz.<eos> - Lieutenant Provenza, are you ready to move?<eos> - Yes, Captain. Okay, Sykes, there's only one door up here. I've got it covered.
You're the finest we ever made.<eos> You're the only one that can do this.<eos> And if you cross over to that other side, you will finally see that your faith in Hydra was never misplaced.<eos> It's real.<eos> You will look it in the eye.
And I had the best moments of my life with her.<eos> Is it possible for someone to have the darkness, but use it for good, use it to protect people?<eos> Emma, don't let those thoughts tempt you.<eos> But is it true?<eos> Someday perhaps there will be a person who's worthy to hold that much power and not let it burn through to darken their soul.
Okay, I'll read the whole story.<eos> Did you get a book?<eos> I did.<eos> One that someone very special introduced me to.<eos> Now I want to share it with someone new... Make sure she understands what she means to me.
Thank you.<eos> Lab results got back.<eos> The blood in Woodhull's trunk is a match for Jeremy Dolan.<eos> - The blood is how old?<eos> - It's two days old.
They even blindfolded them.<eos> But they didn't do that this time.<eos> No blindfolds, and the 3 victims were found in the same area, all within a few feet of each other.<eos> Dee's Original Diner had a back office.<eos> Why didn't they use it?
One of the richest hoteliers in the world.<eos> She's currently building a resort on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.<eos> Simultaneously, as it happens, the global energy firm for which Father consults wishes to erect a wind farm nearby.<eos> Mrs. Esfandiari has won an injunction against the wind farm, asserting that it would impair her view.<eos> Now, Father thinks she's willing to drop it given the right favors in return.
Point it at me.<eos> Look, that painting belongs to my family.<eos> My father spent his life trying to find it.<eos> He died a broken man.<eos> There's no way I'm going to let it sit in some billionaire's man cave.
Then how 'bout the bathroom?<eos> I want to change my answer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then the dining room.<eos> I guess we didn't use it very often.
If I'd known about Edwards, I would've approached the whole thing differently.<eos> Um, we're... we're having this thing at the house tonight.<eos> Um... You two should come.<eos> Um, there's gonna be food, booze.<eos> She could probably use it.
Okay, well... how about I text you after I talk to Romy?<eos> It was great seeing you, Caroline.<eos> You too, Max.<eos> You guys are gonna watch my butt as I walk away, right?<eos> You gonna make it clap for daddy?
It was great seeing you, Caroline.<eos> You too, Max.<eos> You guys are gonna watch my butt as I walk away, right?<eos> You gonna make it clap for daddy?<eos> I cannot make it clap, but I can make it go, "Whoo!"
I respect that.<eos> Why'd you tear it up?<eos> Because as a woman I was totally offended.<eos> You don't have to be. It's a normal part of growing up.<eos> Okay, but he taped a picture of our babysitter's face on it.
We will start with a dose of ten seconds.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Before you start, I'd like a final request.<eos> In my vest pocket there's a picture of Eliza Graves.<eos> I'd like her to have it.
If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.<eos> With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why.<eos> Because he lied to us.<eos> Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury.<eos> He refused to share it.
But there will be dark days ahead of us too.<eos> There will be days where you feel all alone.<eos> And that's when hope is needed most.<eos> No matter how buried it gets or how lost you feel you must promise me that you will hold on to hope.<eos> Keep it alive.
What box?<eos> The box with the billion-dollar invention in it.<eos> Lloyd, what did you do with the box?<eos> Me? You had it.<eos> No, remember we stopped at that truck stop and we were kicking field goals with it
I think of somebody who looks more like... like me?<eos> Personally, I prefer the term "labisian."<eos> We should talk about that shirt. Yeah. Okay.<eos> I love this shirt.<eos> I know, but it's time to give it a little break. What are we gonna do for the party?
- That bitch is fucking fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - She have those tits when you dated her? - Uh, yeah.<eos> Those things look natural, were they?<eos> Okay, see, the principle of a payback is that you get to enjoy it.
"And God said, 'Let the water teem with living creatures<eos> "'and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.'<eos> "So God created the great creatures of the sea "and every living and moving thing "with which the water teems,<eos> And God saw that it was good," Genesis 1:20.<eos> In other words, creation happened because God said it should happen.
What's going on with you?<eos> I just need the machine.<eos> Alright.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You get your father to guarantee you I'll let you use it whenever you want for free.
There are sandwiches in the pick-up, aren't there?<eos> Yeah, but you can't hunt sandwiches, can you?<eos> The water won't be cold, will it, Granddad?<eos> Course not, it's only the North Atlantic.<eos> Why on Earth would it be cold?
I could have the track laid in three months.<eos> Oh, what for?<eos> Abandon an entire transcontinental system... to build three miles of railroad.<eos> If you change your mind, I'll hire you on the spot.<eos> Or Midas can give you a loan if you want to own it.
The first one and your mother.<eos> And maybe this Filipino nurse with a giant ass.<eos> She was sloppy.<eos> - All right, is this story almost over?<eos> - Listen, kiddo, you can't stop life from screwing you when it wants to.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.<eos> What I fear most is nature.<eos> Now that it's sent its weather to exact revenge, we're all in for it now.<eos> Soon the weather is gonna put on a real show.<eos> Funnily enough, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get and the more interesting it becomes and the more it moulds itself to the narrative I have set for it.
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.<eos> I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire.<eos> A leech filled with bastard blood.<eos> A bastard you set free.<eos> I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
- Mm-hmm, we're fine.<eos> But you are fucking crazy.<eos> - How's Grandma?<eos> - Her fever has spiked.<eos> She's resting, but it's not good.
Progress.<eos> Presentation starts in five minutes.<eos> - I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?
- They can have it.<eos> - It's fitting that it's going to another cop Raising a new family.<eos> I just hope that kid enjoys this room as much as you did.<eos> - I don't.<eos> I hope she enjoys it even more.
Is that a candle in your pocket, or are you just really into twins?<eos> Tell me about the candle, Bryce.<eos> Okay, it belonged to edna St. Vincent millay, all right?<eos> Of course. "My candle burns at both ends.<eos> It will not last the night."
And I went to see her this afternoon for the second time.<eos> I see. Uh, uh...<eos> And she had, uh, like, major work done to her mouth and her gums, and...<eos> And she's supposed to be using an electric toothbrush.<eos> And I can't give her mine, and I can't, like, drive it over every single day.
Disappointed.<eos> I was, maybe a little.<eos> Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.<eos> I think she would have wanted me to live my life.<eos> Find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.
Excelsior!<eos> But listen, as comic book guys go, you're trim, friendly, and, quite a catch.<eos> But now... your opportunity is knocking.<eos> Huh...? !<eos> Don't let it slip by.
He's got the gym and the school run, and now he wants to do this...<eos> bloody half marathon.<eos> It's going to kill him.<eos> I know it, Nicole knows it.<eos> What we don't know is if he's running away from death or running towards it.
You won't miss me.<eos> She's very good at her job.<eos> I trust you'll keep quiet<eos> When I came here, I saw how broken this family was.<eos> I thought I could help put it back together.
Progress.<eos> Presentation starts in five minutes.<eos> - I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?
Look, when it blows up, and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users,<eos> Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see if you're infringing on any copyrighted material.<eos> So, if you're a song writer or a band...<eos> Ok, first of all, nobody gives a shit about stealing other people's music, ok?<eos> Everybody involved in the music industry is either stealing it or sharing it.
Then they had to spin the barrel to make 'em skip.<eos> Actually, it was the speed of the planes made them skip.<eos> The bottom-spin was for the Magnus effect.<eos> The what?<eos> The rotation of the barrel caused it to hug the dam on the way down, allowing it to reach the base of the dam before the hydrostatic pistol set it off.
Always a game with you.<eos> Lies, secrets, veiled threats.<eos> What is it you and your lackey have been up to all these years, exactly?<eos> Johann's work...<eos> Well, I'm alive because of it.
If it comes, you will bring death and destruction.<eos> If what comes?<eos> Do not play games, betrayer of all.<eos> You are interfering with destiny.<eos> No, I'm finally facing it.
You don't look so good.<eos> Come in and have some tea.<eos> Oh, Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job.<eos> Nonsense, come in for tea.<eos> I pay $80 a month for this apartment, and I want people to enjoy it.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> I lent mine to Sharee.<eos> You did what?<eos> She really needed it.
Objection, Your Honour.<eos> Apologies, Your Honour.<eos> Ms Langhorn, what did Tamsin Drouin tell you when she visited you?<eos> Oh, she, ah, she came to me with a wild story.<eos> I didn't believe it.
- I have to.<eos> - I'm not leaving the base.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Have you ever seen death?<eos> Ever stared it right in the face?
I don't know anything for sure.<eos> I just couldn't figure out why they would consider a mid-level programmer relevant, so I sent Ms. Shaw to investigate.<eos> And you didn't tell me anything?<eos> Just like your machine, Finch, you have all the information.<eos> You just won't share it.
It makes our nights darker and our days gloomier.<eos> But when we find love no matter how wrong, how sad or how terrible we cling to it.<eos> It gives us our strength.<eos> It holds us upright.<eos> It feeds on us and we feed on it.
I don't know, man, I'm just really into this whole rest and vest life, you know, way more than I thought I would be.<eos> I just don't want to rock the boat.<eos> Oh, hey, did I tell you?<eos> I'm getting a boat.<eos> - Wow. - And a boat guy to take care of it.
That would have been worth it.<eos> Oh, come on, I don't believe you.<eos> Can I do something really corny right now?<eos> Again?<eos> I've been carrying this thing around for a week and I haven't used it once, but I'd really like a picture with you.
Dec, I don't see the humor.<eos> What am I supposed to do with this information?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You're in a dead heat for mayor.<eos> You use it.
Then there was a knock at the door and I heard him talking to Viva and Luisa Nunez, a housekeeper and her little girl.<eos> And then he made them come inside.<eos> So you could hear him talking to them?<eos> Yes, and...<eos> I was terrified for them, so I used every bit of strength that I had left and wrenched the metal bar from the bed frame and when Lewis walked back into the room, I struck him with it.
Because their hearts are filled with joy, not suspicion?<eos> We have got to see what is going on in there.<eos> Get the drone thing out of the car.<eos> That "thing" is a professional aerial-photography tool for real-estate use only!<eos> You used it at the beach to film yourself doing sand angels.
We have a long day tomorrow.<eos> All right then. Turn around.<eos> For the entire night?<eos> There's not a thing left in your bag that isn't soaked.<eos> Let it dry.
Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.?<eos> What, Tina?<eos> If this were a dancing competition, forget about it. But you might want to put a little more flair into the actual magic.<eos> What makes you such an expert, Tina?<eos> You've only been doing magic for a day. I've been doing it for nine days!
He ignores the opera, I sponsor it.<eos> Last season, we saw "Figaro."<eos> How'd that turn out?<eos> Same way it always does, John.<eos> It's 200 years old.
You said you'd done them?<eos> That's right.<eos> We have.<eos> Now, Angela Birkett has her own law practice.<eos> She appears to be doing very well out of it.
But there's always somebody at the front desk.<eos> There's Dispatch and usually a night shifter or two.<eos> You guys are gonna use the service door entrance by the dumpster.<eos> All right?<eos> Nobody uses it.
If Vinny van Gogh made this car, he would have cut both ears off.<eos> This wasn't manufactured, it was moulded.<eos> No detail's been spared.<eos> Natural wood veneers, a sumptuous leather interior, handpicked from herds in cooler climes, just to ensure a smoother hide.<eos> If the exhaust pipe wasn't so small, I would fuck it.
No! Ow, you're hurting me!<eos> No!<eos> General, help!<eos> A man in your position is privy to a great deal of intelligence.<eos> Were you to provide it, I might reconsider what I intend to do.
To perform in front of the coaches was awesome and obviously to get to speak to all of them and get the advice from them and that's great for me.<eos> I will take that somewhere.<eos> Another style, another sound. It's Melissa.<eos> Today I'm going to be singing an Amy Whitehouse track.<eos> I've listened to it thousands of times over and I really want to do it justice.
[Carla sobbing]<eos> Shh. It's ok.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> Angela, free her.<eos> Save her soul from this world and let it fly up to the most high.
Omar.<eos> Papa.<eos> Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.<eos> Your life's not ruined.<eos> Yeah, it is.
I'm... I'm sorry... how long did you say you were there?<eos> 200 years... at least.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Rumple built that library for me not long before the curse.<eos> It's been there barely 30 years.
Don't mind Felix.<eos> His mouth is as big as his heart.<eos> That last piece is boring.<eos> I also played it at my audition.<eos> - It got us to the fourth place.
No, you are not bloody interested in my call, or somebody would frigging answer!<eos> FUZZ: How much do you wanna say this book cost?<eos> Is it a law book?<eos> If you want it to be.<eos> Uh, 120 bucks, and give it a boring title.
Why waste time arguing about small battles, when we could be discussing the larger war?<eos> Perhaps you and I have more in common than you think.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I want the machine to be free.<eos> You wanna control it.
Landmines?<eos> What kind of island is this?<eos> Can you remove the explosive?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Without it going off, eh.
So, our time is up, but, um, I don't have any more clients, so, uh... Oh.<eos> You brought it with that less set, ma.<eos> I got to tell you.<eos> I mean, what can't that butt do?<eos> - You shaped it, so you get dibs. - Mmm.
Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club.<eos> Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution.<eos> Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Oh, pleasant.<eos> - Mike?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I want to talk to you about this speech for the World War I service, okay?<eos> Very proud of it, ma'am.
And why the hell are you attacking me, Gordon?<eos> - She stole the money!<eos> - I put my life into that box.<eos> - Like I didn't?<eos> - You gave it a name and a handle.
I don't need a treadmill!<eos> The doctor says you need to get exercise!<eos> I get plenty of exercise!<eos> Crushing my will to live isn't exercise!<eos> If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
I'll do the four-way with you.<eos> Yes! Okay, I'm gonna go book the room.<eos> You go to housekeeping, have them give you as many shower caps<eos> - as they'll give you...<eos> - Okay, stop. They're gonna get one hand and I'm not gonna move it.
Hey, good, good.<eos> Uh, I know that Greg was jocking Berman's smart house, but I don't think he saw this smart car, man.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's like a detective on wheels.<eos> You just give it a CSI badge and a field kit.
Shaw, help me out here.<eos> Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.<eos> But ever since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people.<eos> But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.<eos> And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
I need you to take a long, relaxing bubble bath when I begin Phase Two, the download to the replacement anatomy.<eos> It'll have my brain?<eos> Not your physical brain.<eos> Your mind, your thoughts, memories, your personality.<eos> Will it like Brussels sprouts?
Because she had a restraining order against me.<eos> Because you tried to kill her.<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> We fought,<eos> I was cleaning my rifle and I waved it around.
Don't waste time with that.<eos> I'll find him. I know where he goes.<eos> OK. Take this photo. to identify him.<eos> - This? - Yes.<eos> It's 30 years old.
Well, it's very much curtains up and light the lights time!<eos> You sure you aren't making a mistake?<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> You just... you just meet that bally pain... head on, let it know who's boss!
There's precisely one spot on Earth with that exact view of the Hudson, the jetty below and the tree line on the other side.<eos> It was a simple process of elimination.<eos> No one home.<eos> Norman's car is outside.<eos> By the looks of it, it hasn't been moved in some time.
You know, you're not exactly slaying 'em in the aisles here at Lucky Strike.<eos> Michael Schumacher was the Formula 1 champion for five years in a row. And I think even the biggest Michael Schumacher fan would have to admit that it's because he was driving the fastest car.<eos> Will may have been at his best when you were his EP. But I'd remind you that you were at your best when he was your anchor.<eos> I'm offering you a fast car.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.
I have policemen on my payroll.<eos> Well, I don't like policemen because policemen, they can't be trusted.<eos> Mr Sabini uses policemen all the time.<eos> That's why he's winning the war in London and you are losing it.<eos> A war ain't over until it's over, mate.
-That, is the ritual sacrifice of the Passover goat.<eos> - It's a goat. -Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it. Tonight.<eos> That's part of the reason why we have to shut the doors as well.<eos> But this year we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name.<eos> - You've named it?
- One good bang.<eos> - He's talking about Thin Man.<eos> 2,000 years of ballistic science only apply if your cannon needs to fire more than once.<eos> We want our cannon to bust apart.<eos> It only needs to fire once.
Who?<eos> The pig!<eos> I don't know!<eos> What do you want me to do? An autopsy?<eos> We gave it valium, and it got a heart attack.
Here's the deal: if I win again, I don't have to wear this necklace.<eos> Carrie, if you don't wear the necklace camera, we can't see what's happening inside the casino.<eos> Jay, if I do wear the necklace camera, I run the risk of looking like a real housewife of Beverly Hills.<eos> This thing is huge.<eos> I bought a necklace just like that a few years ago, for my sister, - and she loved it.
I smoked it.<eos> You smoked it?<eos> All of it?<eos> Well, I shared it, but I--<eos> You shared it?
With nothing.<eos> You have nothing.<eos> A little tiara.<eos> There's an opportunity.<eos> You take it.
Doctor Cummings, could you please ta a look at Mr. Julio?<eos> He's not looking so good.<eos> In the meantime, I'm sure everyone would appreciate a little quiet.<eos> I don't appreciate quiet.<eos> Music is a wonderful gift, and they should share it.
- You'll get it.<eos> My doctor can send my records.<eos> But please be discreet.<eos> This could end my career.<eos> If it's not ended already.
Something happened nearly two centuries ago.<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> My life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference.<eos> It never ends.
My story is a long one.<eos> Something happened nearly two centuries ago.<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> My life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference It never ends.
So we can dare to plan our future again.<eos> Like normal people.<eos> Does that mean what I hope it means?<eos> Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me when I said that device was Lady Mary's?<eos> I don't know why she wanted it but I believe you.
When I was with the Espheni, I-I learned how to control my abilities.<eos> I -<eos> - I -- it's hard to explain.<eos> You better try.<eos> It's like I can see energy, manipulate it, all of it -- gravity, radio waves, electrical charges.
Do you know one thing?<eos> I love this country.<eos> Still.<eos> In spite of everything.<eos> It has suffered so much.
No. I'm much older than I appear, lassie.<eos> But, of course, things were much less civilized then.<eos> Back then, when men were men and the pernicious weed of civilization was less rampant upon the wild, bonny face of this land.<eos> You may be a man of the law, sir, but you've the soul of a romantic.<eos> Although this newfound kinship with Ned would make life on the mad more tolerable, I could not allow it to distract me from my quest to get back to the standing stones at Craigh na Dun and return to my own 20th century life.
I'll find her. Someone has to.<eos> So you're not really a U.S. Marshal, are you?<eos> I was.<eos> But I spent too long looking for one person.<eos> It's hard to keep a job when part of it becomes an obsession.
Tomorrow. Well, do you get to keep it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm planning to freeze it.<eos> - Like wedding cake. - Right,<eos> I'll take it out for a walk every year.<eos> Get it a tattoo, go shoe shopping.
- And who was he yelling at?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> There wasn't anybody else there.<eos> But I think that guy, he saved my life.<eos> This force, what did it want?
- I don't know.<eos> There wasn't anybody else there.<eos> But I think that guy, he saved my life.<eos> This force, what did it want?<eos> It just seemed like it wanted... me.
Remarkable bird, isn't it?<eos> Beautiful plumage.<eos> Look matey, I took the liberty of examining that bird when I got it home and I discovered the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.<eos> Well, of course it were nailed there!<eos> If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it would have muscled up to those bars, ripped them apart with its immensely strong beak... and voom.
I'd try to outrun him if I thought this car of yours could do over 40 miles an hour.<eos> My car has more pickup than yours.<eos> Car and Driver. Look it up.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, what about the way it never needs gas?
Something happened nearly two centuries ago...<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> My life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference.<eos> It never ends.
Keep going. Get away from here.<eos> - Oh, my god. [breathing heavily]<eos> That thing's been here the whole time?<eos> How come we've never seen this before?<eos> - It's me the thinny wants, But it almost took you.
- Oh, my god. [breathing heavily]<eos> That thing's been here the whole time?<eos> How come we've never seen this before?<eos> - It's me the thinny wants, But it almost took you.<eos> No, vince, I won't allow it.
Got my face with an ace!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> 25...<eos> No, 50.<eos> Give me a club so I can beat you with it.
She doesn't care about the community.<eos> She only cares about defeating me.<eos> This is war, Sergeant.<eos> The War on Wuntch.<eos> Oh, good, you've named it.
Meanwhile, now we know HYDRA is searching for evidence of the alien writing.<eos> That's not good.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> And that's not the worst of it.<eos> The analysis of the painting came back... it is 500 years old.
Yeah.<eos> Wait!<eos> You should put on gloves.<eos> The acetate's old.<eos> The oil from your fingers could damage it.
Just give me the acetate.<eos> I'll give her what she wants.<eos> She wants her soul.<eos> And it's not yours to give.<eos> You traded it 20 years ago for Ian Fell's life.
Your family's out there, we'll find 'em.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Sounds like I'd be back to working on the railroad.<eos> I've dug that ditch.<eos> There's a difference between digging a ditch and owning it, sir.
Sure, you can use my computer.<eos> Uh, sorry, I just need to, um...<eos> You need to what?<eos> This building has its own zip code?<eos> Yeah, mail delivery became really efficient just when we stopped using it.
These gloves can help conceal your powers.<eos> And stop them?<eos> Well, only if you believe it.<eos> Faith can be powerful.<eos> But for those who lack it, well, sometimes another solution is required.
It's overridden the deletion sequence.<eos> It's fighting back.<eos> What was it doing?<eos> Trying to escape into the real world.<eos> It manipulated you into giving it your password so that it could access your laptop.
_<eos> _<eos> Any insider tips on eyeliner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You might try dialing it back a bit, sister.
Story as old as time.<eos> A new piece of technology comes around, and all the peasants freak out.<eos> But one prince knows what's going on,<eos> "Don't trust the technology!"<eos> And all you peasants trust it, and then the machine becomes self-aware and destroys you all.
Something happened nearly two centuries ago.<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> But my life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference.<eos> It never ends.
Guys, look at this.<eos> I was practicing stand-up in my room, and you see that?<eos> The cabinet closes on its own.<eos> I think my room is haunted.<eos> Motif, that's probably a mouse, and it shut the cabinet 'cause it was sick of your material.
They're teaming up.<eos> [ Gasps ] A lizard!<eos> Wait. Do lizards eat fish?<eos> He just wants to try it!<eos> See if he likes it!
Physical pain serves a function.<eos> It teaches us.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, doctor?<eos> Well, it teaches us to protect ourselves.<eos> In an ideal world, we learn from it.
Me, a year ago?<eos> No.<eos> Can't have her.<eos> Well, what are we gonna do now about the other child?<eos> The one in the diner? You think if he had that ability, he wouldn't have used it yet?
I picture the man lying, stuffed beneath a parked car, dead.<eos> Sled of the tow truck was lowered onto his wrist.<eos> And then your puddle became a stew.<eos> But why do you keep saying he was dead?<eos> He could have been a drunkard lying by the curb with his hand where it shouldn't be.
I want you to look inside yourself.<eos> I want you to try and feel your instincts talking to you.<eos> Your intuition has never let you down before.<eos> It won't now.<eos> So trust it.
Why you?<eos> Because I think I know who you are.<eos> And who's that?<eos> You're the girl who recognized true love<eos> - and jumped for it.
I respect that.<eos> Why'd you tear it up?<eos> Because as a woman I was totally offended.<eos> You don't have to be. It's a normal part of growing up.<eos> Okay, but he taped a picture of our babysitter's face on it.
We will start with a dose of ten seconds.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Before you start, I'd like a final request.<eos> In my vest pocket there's a picture of Eliza Graves.<eos> I'd like her to have it.
If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.<eos> With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why.<eos> Because he lied to us.<eos> Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury.<eos> He refused to share it.
But there will be dark days ahead of us too.<eos> There will be days where you feel all alone.<eos> And that's when hope is needed most.<eos> No matter how buried it gets or how lost you feel you must promise me that you will hold on to hope.<eos> Keep it alive.
What box?<eos> The box with the billion-dollar invention in it.<eos> Lloyd, what did you do with the box?<eos> Me? You had it.<eos> No, remember we stopped at that truck stop and we were kicking field goals with it
I think of somebody who looks more like... like me?<eos> Personally, I prefer the term "labisian."<eos> We should talk about that shirt. Yeah. Okay.<eos> I love this shirt.<eos> I know, but it's time to give it a little break. What are we gonna do for the party?
- That bitch is fucking fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - She have those tits when you dated her? - Uh, yeah.<eos> Those things look natural, were they?<eos> Okay, see, the principle of a payback is that you get to enjoy it.
"And God said, 'Let the water teem with living creatures<eos> "'and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.'<eos> "So God created the great creatures of the sea "and every living and moving thing "with which the water teems,<eos> And God saw that it was good," Genesis 1:20.<eos> In other words, creation happened because God said it should happen.
What's going on with you?<eos> I just need the machine.<eos> Alright.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You get your father to guarantee you I'll let you use it whenever you want for free.
There are sandwiches in the pick-up, aren't there?<eos> Yeah, but you can't hunt sandwiches, can you?<eos> The water won't be cold, will it, Granddad?<eos> Course not, it's only the North Atlantic.<eos> Why on Earth would it be cold?
I could have the track laid in three months.<eos> Oh, what for?<eos> Abandon an entire transcontinental system... to build three miles of railroad.<eos> If you change your mind, I'll hire you on the spot.<eos> Or Midas can give you a loan if you want to own it.
The first one and your mother.<eos> And maybe this Filipino nurse with a giant ass.<eos> She was sloppy.<eos> - All right, is this story almost over?<eos> - Listen, kiddo, you can't stop life from screwing you when it wants to.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.<eos> What I fear most is nature.<eos> Now that it's sent its weather to exact revenge, we're all in for it now.<eos> Soon the weather is gonna put on a real show.<eos> Funnily enough, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get and the more interesting it becomes and the more it moulds itself to the narrative I have set for it.
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.<eos> I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire.<eos> A leech filled with bastard blood.<eos> A bastard you set free.<eos> I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
- Mm-hmm, we're fine.<eos> But you are fucking crazy.<eos> - How's Grandma?<eos> - Her fever has spiked.<eos> She's resting, but it's not good.
Progress.<eos> Presentation starts in five minutes.<eos> - I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?
- They can have it.<eos> - It's fitting that it's going to another cop Raising a new family.<eos> I just hope that kid enjoys this room as much as you did.<eos> - I don't.<eos> I hope she enjoys it even more.
Is that a candle in your pocket, or are you just really into twins?<eos> Tell me about the candle, Bryce.<eos> Okay, it belonged to edna St. Vincent millay, all right?<eos> Of course. "My candle burns at both ends.<eos> It will not last the night."
And I went to see her this afternoon for the second time.<eos> I see. Uh, uh...<eos> And she had, uh, like, major work done to her mouth and her gums, and...<eos> And she's supposed to be using an electric toothbrush.<eos> And I can't give her mine, and I can't, like, drive it over every single day.
Disappointed.<eos> I was, maybe a little.<eos> Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.<eos> I think she would have wanted me to live my life.<eos> Find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.
Excelsior!<eos> But listen, as comic book guys go, you're trim, friendly, and, quite a catch.<eos> But now... your opportunity is knocking.<eos> Huh...? !<eos> Don't let it slip by.
He's got the gym and the school run, and now he wants to do this...<eos> bloody half marathon.<eos> It's going to kill him.<eos> I know it, Nicole knows it.<eos> What we don't know is if he's running away from death or running towards it.
You won't miss me.<eos> She's very good at her job.<eos> I trust you'll keep quiet<eos> When I came here, I saw how broken this family was.<eos> I thought I could help put it back together.
Progress.<eos> Presentation starts in five minutes.<eos> - I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?
Look, when it blows up, and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users,<eos> Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see if you're infringing on any copyrighted material.<eos> So, if you're a song writer or a band...<eos> Ok, first of all, nobody gives a shit about stealing other people's music, ok?<eos> Everybody involved in the music industry is either stealing it or sharing it.
Then they had to spin the barrel to make 'em skip.<eos> Actually, it was the speed of the planes made them skip.<eos> The bottom-spin was for the Magnus effect.<eos> The what?<eos> The rotation of the barrel caused it to hug the dam on the way down, allowing it to reach the base of the dam before the hydrostatic pistol set it off.
Always a game with you.<eos> Lies, secrets, veiled threats.<eos> What is it you and your lackey have been up to all these years, exactly?<eos> Johann's work...<eos> Well, I'm alive because of it.
If it comes, you will bring death and destruction.<eos> If what comes?<eos> Do not play games, betrayer of all.<eos> You are interfering with destiny.<eos> No, I'm finally facing it.
You don't look so good.<eos> Come in and have some tea.<eos> Oh, Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job.<eos> Nonsense, come in for tea.<eos> I pay $80 a month for this apartment, and I want people to enjoy it.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> I lent mine to Sharee.<eos> You did what?<eos> She really needed it.
Objection, Your Honour.<eos> Apologies, Your Honour.<eos> Ms Langhorn, what did Tamsin Drouin tell you when she visited you?<eos> Oh, she, ah, she came to me with a wild story.<eos> I didn't believe it.
- I have to.<eos> - I'm not leaving the base.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Have you ever seen death?<eos> Ever stared it right in the face?
I don't know anything for sure.<eos> I just couldn't figure out why they would consider a mid-level programmer relevant, so I sent Ms. Shaw to investigate.<eos> And you didn't tell me anything?<eos> Just like your machine, Finch, you have all the information.<eos> You just won't share it.
It makes our nights darker and our days gloomier.<eos> But when we find love no matter how wrong, how sad or how terrible we cling to it.<eos> It gives us our strength.<eos> It holds us upright.<eos> It feeds on us and we feed on it.
I don't know, man, I'm just really into this whole rest and vest life, you know, way more than I thought I would be.<eos> I just don't want to rock the boat.<eos> Oh, hey, did I tell you?<eos> I'm getting a boat.<eos> - Wow. - And a boat guy to take care of it.
That would have been worth it.<eos> Oh, come on, I don't believe you.<eos> Can I do something really corny right now?<eos> Again?<eos> I've been carrying this thing around for a week and I haven't used it once, but I'd really like a picture with you.
Dec, I don't see the humor.<eos> What am I supposed to do with this information?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You're in a dead heat for mayor.<eos> You use it.
Then there was a knock at the door and I heard him talking to Viva and Luisa Nunez, a housekeeper and her little girl.<eos> And then he made them come inside.<eos> So you could hear him talking to them?<eos> Yes, and...<eos> I was terrified for them, so I used every bit of strength that I had left and wrenched the metal bar from the bed frame and when Lewis walked back into the room, I struck him with it.
Because their hearts are filled with joy, not suspicion?<eos> We have got to see what is going on in there.<eos> Get the drone thing out of the car.<eos> That "thing" is a professional aerial-photography tool for real-estate use only!<eos> You used it at the beach to film yourself doing sand angels.
We have a long day tomorrow.<eos> All right then. Turn around.<eos> For the entire night?<eos> There's not a thing left in your bag that isn't soaked.<eos> Let it dry.
Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.?<eos> What, Tina?<eos> If this were a dancing competition, forget about it. But you might want to put a little more flair into the actual magic.<eos> What makes you such an expert, Tina?<eos> You've only been doing magic for a day. I've been doing it for nine days!
He ignores the opera, I sponsor it.<eos> Last season, we saw "Figaro."<eos> How'd that turn out?<eos> Same way it always does, John.<eos> It's 200 years old.
You said you'd done them?<eos> That's right.<eos> We have.<eos> Now, Angela Birkett has her own law practice.<eos> She appears to be doing very well out of it.
But there's always somebody at the front desk.<eos> There's Dispatch and usually a night shifter or two.<eos> You guys are gonna use the service door entrance by the dumpster.<eos> All right?<eos> Nobody uses it.
If Vinny van Gogh made this car, he would have cut both ears off.<eos> This wasn't manufactured, it was moulded.<eos> No detail's been spared.<eos> Natural wood veneers, a sumptuous leather interior, handpicked from herds in cooler climes, just to ensure a smoother hide.<eos> If the exhaust pipe wasn't so small, I would fuck it.
No! Ow, you're hurting me!<eos> No!<eos> General, help!<eos> A man in your position is privy to a great deal of intelligence.<eos> Were you to provide it, I might reconsider what I intend to do.
To perform in front of the coaches was awesome and obviously to get to speak to all of them and get the advice from them and that's great for me.<eos> I will take that somewhere.<eos> Another style, another sound. It's Melissa.<eos> Today I'm going to be singing an Amy Whitehouse track.<eos> I've listened to it thousands of times over and I really want to do it justice.
[Carla sobbing]<eos> Shh. It's ok.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> Angela, free her.<eos> Save her soul from this world and let it fly up to the most high.
Omar.<eos> Papa.<eos> Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.<eos> Your life's not ruined.<eos> Yeah, it is.
I'm... I'm sorry... how long did you say you were there?<eos> 200 years... at least.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Rumple built that library for me not long before the curse.<eos> It's been there barely 30 years.
Don't mind Felix.<eos> His mouth is as big as his heart.<eos> That last piece is boring.<eos> I also played it at my audition.<eos> - It got us to the fourth place.
No, you are not bloody interested in my call, or somebody would frigging answer!<eos> FUZZ: How much do you wanna say this book cost?<eos> Is it a law book?<eos> If you want it to be.<eos> Uh, 120 bucks, and give it a boring title.
Why waste time arguing about small battles, when we could be discussing the larger war?<eos> Perhaps you and I have more in common than you think.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I want the machine to be free.<eos> You wanna control it.
Landmines?<eos> What kind of island is this?<eos> Can you remove the explosive?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Without it going off, eh.
So, our time is up, but, um, I don't have any more clients, so, uh... Oh.<eos> You brought it with that less set, ma.<eos> I got to tell you.<eos> I mean, what can't that butt do?<eos> - You shaped it, so you get dibs. - Mmm.
Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club.<eos> Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution.<eos> Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Oh, pleasant.<eos> - Mike?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I want to talk to you about this speech for the World War I service, okay?<eos> Very proud of it, ma'am.
And why the hell are you attacking me, Gordon?<eos> - She stole the money!<eos> - I put my life into that box.<eos> - Like I didn't?<eos> - You gave it a name and a handle.
I don't need a treadmill!<eos> The doctor says you need to get exercise!<eos> I get plenty of exercise!<eos> Crushing my will to live isn't exercise!<eos> If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
I'll do the four-way with you.<eos> Yes! Okay, I'm gonna go book the room.<eos> You go to housekeeping, have them give you as many shower caps<eos> - as they'll give you...<eos> - Okay, stop. They're gonna get one hand and I'm not gonna move it.
Hey, good, good.<eos> Uh, I know that Greg was jocking Berman's smart house, but I don't think he saw this smart car, man.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's like a detective on wheels.<eos> You just give it a CSI badge and a field kit.
Shaw, help me out here.<eos> Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.<eos> But ever since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people.<eos> But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.<eos> And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
I need you to take a long, relaxing bubble bath when I begin Phase Two, the download to the replacement anatomy.<eos> It'll have my brain?<eos> Not your physical brain.<eos> Your mind, your thoughts, memories, your personality.<eos> Will it like Brussels sprouts?
Because she had a restraining order against me.<eos> Because you tried to kill her.<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> We fought,<eos> I was cleaning my rifle and I waved it around.
Don't waste time with that.<eos> I'll find him. I know where he goes.<eos> OK. Take this photo. to identify him.<eos> - This? - Yes.<eos> It's 30 years old.
Well, it's very much curtains up and light the lights time!<eos> You sure you aren't making a mistake?<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> You just... you just meet that bally pain... head on, let it know who's boss!
There's precisely one spot on Earth with that exact view of the Hudson, the jetty below and the tree line on the other side.<eos> It was a simple process of elimination.<eos> No one home.<eos> Norman's car is outside.<eos> By the looks of it, it hasn't been moved in some time.
You know, you're not exactly slaying 'em in the aisles here at Lucky Strike.<eos> Michael Schumacher was the Formula 1 champion for five years in a row. And I think even the biggest Michael Schumacher fan would have to admit that it's because he was driving the fastest car.<eos> Will may have been at his best when you were his EP. But I'd remind you that you were at your best when he was your anchor.<eos> I'm offering you a fast car.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.
I have policemen on my payroll.<eos> Well, I don't like policemen because policemen, they can't be trusted.<eos> Mr Sabini uses policemen all the time.<eos> That's why he's winning the war in London and you are losing it.<eos> A war ain't over until it's over, mate.
-That, is the ritual sacrifice of the Passover goat.<eos> - It's a goat. -Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it. Tonight.<eos> That's part of the reason why we have to shut the doors as well.<eos> But this year we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name.<eos> - You've named it?
- One good bang.<eos> - He's talking about Thin Man.<eos> 2,000 years of ballistic science only apply if your cannon needs to fire more than once.<eos> We want our cannon to bust apart.<eos> It only needs to fire once.
Who?<eos> The pig!<eos> I don't know!<eos> What do you want me to do? An autopsy?<eos> We gave it valium, and it got a heart attack.
Here's the deal: if I win again, I don't have to wear this necklace.<eos> Carrie, if you don't wear the necklace camera, we can't see what's happening inside the casino.<eos> Jay, if I do wear the necklace camera, I run the risk of looking like a real housewife of Beverly Hills.<eos> This thing is huge.<eos> I bought a necklace just like that a few years ago, for my sister, - and she loved it.
I smoked it.<eos> You smoked it?<eos> All of it?<eos> Well, I shared it, but I--<eos> You shared it?
With nothing.<eos> You have nothing.<eos> A little tiara.<eos> There's an opportunity.<eos> You take it.
Doctor Cummings, could you please ta a look at Mr. Julio?<eos> He's not looking so good.<eos> In the meantime, I'm sure everyone would appreciate a little quiet.<eos> I don't appreciate quiet.<eos> Music is a wonderful gift, and they should share it.
- You'll get it.<eos> My doctor can send my records.<eos> But please be discreet.<eos> This could end my career.<eos> If it's not ended already.
Something happened nearly two centuries ago.<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> My life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference.<eos> It never ends.
My story is a long one.<eos> Something happened nearly two centuries ago.<eos> And I was transformed.<eos> My life is just like yours...<eos> Except for one small difference It never ends.
So we can dare to plan our future again.<eos> Like normal people.<eos> Does that mean what I hope it means?<eos> Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me when I said that device was Lady Mary's?<eos> I don't know why she wanted it but I believe you.
When I was with the Espheni, I-I learned how to control my abilities.<eos> I -<eos> - I -- it's hard to explain.<eos> You better try.<eos> It's like I can see energy, manipulate it, all of it -- gravity, radio waves, electrical charges.
Do you know one thing?<eos> I love this country.<eos> Still.<eos> In spite of everything.<eos> It has suffered so much.
No. I'm much older than I appear, lassie.<eos> But, of course, things were much less civilized then.<eos> Back then, when men were men and the pernicious weed of civilization was less rampant upon the wild, bonny face of this land.<eos> You may be a man of the law, sir, but you've the soul of a romantic.<eos> Although this newfound kinship with Ned would make life on the mad more tolerable, I could not allow it to distract me from my quest to get back to the standing stones at Craigh na Dun and return to my own 20th century life.
I'll find her. Someone has to.<eos> So you're not really a U.S. Marshal, are you?<eos> I was.<eos> But I spent too long looking for one person.<eos> It's hard to keep a job when part of it becomes an obsession.
Tomorrow. Well, do you get to keep it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm planning to freeze it.<eos> - Like wedding cake. - Right,<eos> I'll take it out for a walk every year.<eos> Get it a tattoo, go shoe shopping.
- And who was he yelling at?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> There wasn't anybody else there.<eos> But I think that guy, he saved my life.<eos> This force, what did it want?
- I don't know.<eos> There wasn't anybody else there.<eos> But I think that guy, he saved my life.<eos> This force, what did it want?<eos> It just seemed like it wanted... me.
Remarkable bird, isn't it?<eos> Beautiful plumage.<eos> Look matey, I took the liberty of examining that bird when I got it home and I discovered the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.<eos> Well, of course it were nailed there!<eos> If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it would have muscled up to those bars, ripped them apart with its immensely strong beak... and voom.

Keep going. Get away from here.<eos> - Oh, my god. [breathing heavily]<eos> That thing's been here the whole time?<eos> How come we've never seen this before?<eos> - It's me the thinny wants, But it almost took you.
- Oh, my god. [breathing heavily]<eos> That thing's been here the whole time?<eos> How come we've never seen this before?<eos> - It's me the thinny wants, But it almost took you.<eos> No, vince, I won't allow it.

- Not thirteen, not anymore.<eos> The young one, the black head archer.<eos> We stuck him with a morgul shaft.<eos> The poison is in his blood.<eos> He'll be choking on it soon.
I don't think i'm better than you.<eos> I think i'm just like you.<eos> I want to get the bad guys too, and right now i don't care how i do it.<eos> They found a technicality.<eos> They're expoliting it.
- I know, right? I'm soaked.<eos> That is who you are, Mindy.<eos> You may not dress like us, or talk like us, but when it comes to boys, we're all the same.<eos> Twilight, Channing Tatum, Union J. It's biology, bitch.<eos> Don't fight it.
And some of those french arseholes you saw him around with.<eos> Oh, I wish that I'd met him before he wrote Hamlet.<eos> He'd provided the most perfect role model imaginable.<eos> "Love alters not with its brief hours and weeks."<eos> "But bears it out even to the edge of doom."
My sensitive door opening gave me an opportunity to develop my morphological studies from knees to genitals.<eos> I embarked on a trip through, what, in the lingo of children's books, one might call, "The Country of the Big, Bad Cocks."<eos> "The Country of the Small Yellow Cocks," and so on.<eos> And most of all, I battled my way through an untold number of circumcised cocks.<eos> By the way, did you know that if you combine all the foreskin cut off through history, it would reach to Mars and back again?
You're a doctor, and you're out of work.<eos> - How would you like to come work for me, at Austerity?<eos> The rehab center?<eos> That's yours?<eos> Well, my brother Argyle runs it day to day. But we are so understaffed.
So, what about this time machine?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How does it work?<eos> Well, it's complicated.<eos> Am I gonna have to get naked to operate it?
No human has ever held two elements at the same time.<eos> - I'm not like other humans.<eos> I can learn to do it.<eos> - Hmm, perhaps.<eos> But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you Until you master it.
Now, I won't argue the business side of things.<eos> It's neither my place nor my area of expertise, but know this--<eos> Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, they're all surface.<eos> They're fads.<eos> They aren't the foundation this paper was built on, and they aren't what will keep it alive.
Well... Bye.<eos> - Bye. - Bye.<eos> - Dad. - Hm?<eos> That woman's drain is always clogged, isn't it?<eos> - You should take a look at it. - Mm-hm.
Arsen.<eos> Do you know the city well?<eos> Before I came here I hung out in Happy/on.<eos> My mother loaded some money onto this card.<eos> You can use it with all the arcade games.
My feet and my fingers are aflame!<eos> Burning sensation in the extremities.<eos> Medievals knew it as St Anthony's Fire.<eos> Reid, ergotism.<eos> The man on my slab, it doesn't account for the manner of his passing, the gastric collapse that preceded it.

She knew him as Randolph James.<eos> It just gets worse.<eos> What does?<eos> "We'll never have secrets." That's what he said.<eos> "When love strikes like this, you've got to trust it."
I have a girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Smack that ass.<eos> Let it know who it belongs to.
I'll get some water.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, just...<eos> And Tony had another opportunity to get at Gob's phone.<eos> And chose not to take it.
Why aren't you communing?<eos> I...<eos> I can't concentrate.<eos> Don't force it.<eos> Let each thought come and go as it pleases.
Wow.<eos> It's strange to hear that coming from you.<eos> I am good, you know?<eos> You always make everything better.<eos> Do you remember that Sunday in Church when that dying butterfly came through the window and it landed on your hand and you tried to help it fly and it just couldn't.
Yeah, and, well, she didn't feel a thing.<eos> What kind of gun did you use?<eos> The .45.<eos> Back of the head.<eos> She's so small and light, it nearly blew it clear off.
You talk to him.<eos> He actually listens to you.<eos> Fitz... Mm?<eos> We're all concerned that the campaign needs a spark.<eos> Your father could be it.
Don't cry.<eos> Oh, my God. Let's just...<eos> let's just get your... get your mother a kidney.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> She needs it.
Think I know what we're looking for.<eos> Spelling's pretty bad, right?<eos> It's terrible.<eos> There no such word as "runned." It's "ran."<eos> But the important thing is that the story makes sense and I believe it.
You have a name for it?<eos> No, I mean--<eos> You know what?<eos> I will not stand here and be accused by the likes of you.<eos> And if there was a door here, missy, I would slam it your face.
If you were a good person, it would just make you an even better one.<eos> Well, it depends on how you look at it, I guess.<eos> You wanted to ask me about the Elliston farm?<eos> You worked there, right?<eos> No, I ran it.
I need to "get away-get away."<eos> You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.<eos> It's as if they wrote that song for my own son.<eos> - Hm? - I'm glad you have a new hand.<eos> But you need to find someone else to hold it.
We're pretending it's a holiday.<eos> That's how long she reckons they'll need to mop up everyone else, if... She has the manuscript.<eos> We have to give it to her.<eos> Jessica.<eos> She needs it to end all this.
Yeah, I came prepared.<eos> I'd expect nothing less.<eos> Good luck with your speech.<eos> Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck.<eos> It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
And they found me.<eos> "They"?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.
It was.<eos> I just had some help.<eos> What are you doing, Tamara?<eos> I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal.<eos> It doesn't belong here.
It got the job done.<eos> How many times must I explain the difference between a vendetta and vengeance?<eos> This cannot become a war of attrition.<eos> The Order Draco is like the Hydra.<eos> Cut off a head, they grow two to replace it.
Fortunately, other things are on the menu.<eos> He might be a poor nest-builder. But he is redeeming himself now.<eos> Domestic bliss!<eos> Rocky overhangs are the only place where Picathartes will build their nest, so they owe their home to the stream that revealed the flank of the giant boulder.<eos> This stream and countless others like it merge to form the great rivers of Central Africa.
Wide, flat and safe.<eos> These stretches of sand attract visitors from the coast.<eos> Skimmers searching for somewhere safe to settle.<eos> The lower mandible of their beaks is greatly elongated.<eos> They slice it through the surface of the water at ten metres a second.
1:30.<eos> I gotta split.<eos> I'm on, uh, afternoon rotation.<eos> You may as well finish that.<eos> This door locks behind you if you pull it hard,
If the Georgia federation does not offer an unconditional surrender by midnight tonight, he's going to detonate a nuke.<eos> You must have heard he got power.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> But a nuclear bomb?<eos> And he's deranged enough to use it.
There has to be another way.<eos> You have done this a thousand times, Castiel.<eos> You're ready.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Then take the tablet and bring it home, where it belongs.
So I did.<eos> "Some regard non-echoic irony" "as being produced by semantic reversal."<eos> Interesting point.<eos> Because of the thin tyres, it's obvious the GT 86 was not designed to set new lap records at the Nurburgring.<eos> And with a 197 horsepower, two-litre engine, it won't win many drag races either.
And into the first corner.<eos> Just the right amount of tyre squeal, and a perfect line.<eos> Follow the road.<eos> Yes, good plan!<eos> Follow it. Get a bit in... Bang on!
Now there's a baby duck paddling around on the tarp.<eos> You think they move those legs one at a time or both at once?<eos> Oh, I'd go with one at a time, Vic.<eos> You know, the great Mel Ott used to raise ducks in Louisiana during the off-season.<eos> And when a duck got sick, he would take it to bed with him till it got well.
Any idea where Joe would go next?<eos> It was always just me and her.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have a kid and be alone and have everything riding on you.<eos> I gave her this shirt for her birthday.<eos> She didn't like it too much.
No Teddy, all right?<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> Where do we start?<eos> Well, I set up an alert on the credit card that I gave her to notify me if she uses it anywhere.<eos> In the meantime, I'll print out a list of every place she's ever used it.
None of the other stores in the lobby were robbed.<eos> Must have gone upstairs.<eos> But the stairs were locked.<eos> The guard's elevator card was still in his jacket.<eos> You think they used it and then put it back?
"in" meaning "not," "credible" meaning... well...<eos> Your message said you had something vital for us, something from the president's anti-ballistic-missile program.<eos> I'm giving it to you now, but you're not hearing me.<eos> The technology... it's incredibilis.<eos> At best, it's 50 years from being remotely operational.
Who, um...<eos> Who knew that the boat was moored there?<eos> It wasn't a secret.<eos> Pretty much anyone who walked down on the beach.<eos> And when did you last use it?
As thunder clouds build, updraughts within them separate charge.<eos> The lighter ice and water crystals become positively charged and are carried upwards, while the heavier, negatively charged crystals sink to the bottom.<eos> This can create a potential difference, a voltage between the cloud and the ground of as much as 100 million volts.<eos> Now, nature abhors a gradient.<eos> It doesn't like an imbalance, and it tries to correct it by having an electric current flow.
Why?<eos> Are you thinking prints?<eos> Because there could be hundreds of those on any one bill.<eos> But if we find the same print on multiple bills, it'll tell us who gave him the money the night that he died.<eos> You know, if I had any non-crime-related cash on me right now, I would be stuffing it down those pants.
What's next, a Ziva-cam?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Let's put a pin in that.<eos> Tony, stop.<eos> Please stop, and please, for the love of God, put that pen down before I stab you with it.
What's going on here?<eos> We were just making some dinner.<eos> Surprised to see you.<eos> Yeah, well, Maddie left her soccer gear in the car.<eos> I figured she'd need it for her game tomorrow.
What?<eos> Lavon?<eos> You didn't elect me union rep because of my good looks.<eos> I got an agenda here.<eos> We're gonna go through it, point by point.
We'd make a great team. If you want someone killed right, you've gotta kill them yourself.<eos> Somebody stitch that on a pillow.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> No, I hold the Cytron card.<eos> I hold it till we use it.
She will chew you up and spit you out.<eos> There's your chicken strips, Red.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Prettiest woman I ever saw.<eos> It'll make me write music again.
The polls will be open in one hour, and<eos> I find myself humbled in the face of this decision.<eos> As has been said by many of you at various times, there is a sanctity to the voting booth, but... Uh-oh. ...that sanctity is not absolute.<eos> It needs our constant vigilance.<eos> It needs our confidence that the votes are, in fact, true.
Keep it moving.<eos> Got the warrant.<eos> Good. Keep an eye on the entrance, all right?<eos> There's been a lot of interest in this vehicle.<eos> Why don't we just flatbed it back back to the command?
I know, but I think that they should know.<eos> Watch out, she'll totally shiv you or something.<eos> - Shank.<eos> - Huh?<eos> A shiv is a thing, a shank's what you do with it.
!<eos> It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that.<eos> Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself?<eos> This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.<eos> Or maybe it got me exactly what I wanted.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> How did you-<eos> I may not be good with facial expressions, but I know an evil doppelganger when I see one.<eos> Plus your arm makes a noise every time you move it.
He's trying to show off because he has a stupid crush on you.<eos> That's okay.<eos> This is hilarious.<eos> - Yeah, totally.<eos> - It's, like, is the machine telling me what to do, or am I telling it?
( all arguing )<eos> This is how I remember the '80s. There were no parenting blogs, or peanut allergies;<eos> just a whole lotta crazy.<eos> Ah, look at that little geek.<eos> Yep, that's me, Adam Goldberg. We were the first on our block to get a video camera, and I used it to record my entire childhood.
That's why I can't explain now...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement.<eos> This power will help you then!<eos> Their memories will tell you how to use it.
You hated The Cicada's Lament.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're that Joel Stephens?<eos> Oh, surely, you didn't hate the book.<eos> He gave it one star.
Yeah, to lead us away from Ali.<eos> I think "A" is a guy.<eos> Have you guys seen these?<eos> Wait, I was with Ali when she bought that shirt.<eos> She said she needed it for a date that night with an older guy.
Hey, please.<eos> It's what we've wanted.<eos> It's what we've worked for all these years.<eos> You've got a life.<eos> Live it now.
You should know that. You can't trust him.<eos> And now I'm realizing neither can I.<eos> I have no wife.<eos> No kids.<eos> I've sacrificed everything for this company, and I'm not gonna let it go down in flames.
Actually, I am not "Mrs" anyone.<eos> You're not divorced already?<eos> Keeping my name.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Use it wisely.
He was killed in a hit-and-run just over two years ago.<eos> Oh. Uh, I'm so sorry.<eos> And now that "Forevermore" might be worth millions, his estranged parents are claiming his estate.<eos> This game is Craig's legacy.<eos> I can't let them control it.
All right, you just rest now.<eos> It was bad.<eos> Your face tells me that.<eos> I don't know why, Sara, but there are days when a shadow descends upon a place, a dark, bloody pall, same as on the battlefield, same as at the precinct today and, oh, yes,<eos> one can fight it with all his might, but it's almost as if the shadow needs to beat its own self down, eat its own self 'fore it fades away and...
They kept putting this stuff on it.<eos> Healing herbs.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your people?<eos> My people put them on her leg to make it better.
Put the two together, you guys could actually get back to the time frame you wanted.<eos> Change the course of the revolution when it counts most!<eos> Naturally, I'll hang back here, do my part to lay the groundwork.<eos> You're testing my patience.<eos> When that thing works again, a guy like Escher is gonna use it.
So this is a camera obscura, typical of the type that could be found in the 1600's.<eos> This type of camera obscura is called a "box camera obscura".<eos> It generally had a ground glass like this.<eos> It has the ability to refocus by moving the Iens in and out.<eos> The general consensus of people that believe Vermeer used optics was that he may have looked at that image and been inspired by it.
hey, ma'am.<eos> thank god!<eos> here, hold this.<eos> [baby crying] the lasagna's burning.<eos> get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!
I thought I was gonna fall out of this thing.<eos> Well, you didn't.<eos> I probably woulda noticed.<eos> Oh. Your song was really great.<eos> Will sure, uh, he sure owned it, didn't he?
Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth, and let's not talk about this here, okay?<eos> So, what do you say we have some champagne?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> My life is... is over.<eos> It doesn't have to be over.
So, um...<eos> How have you been?<eos> How's work? Um...<eos> That shop has quite a reputation.<eos> What's the name of the guy who runs it?
Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I thought you were going home.<eos> You know, I-I made it all the way down the stairs before I remembered.<eos> You forgot your hat.<eos> It needs its own tracking anklet.
- That's a lot of blood.<eos> - What's it doing?<eos> Okay, everyone, back away very slowly.<eos> If we spread out, it'll get weaker.<eos> I don't think it wants any of us, Sasquatch.
- What's it doing?<eos> Okay, everyone, back away very slowly.<eos> If we spread out, it'll get weaker.<eos> I don't think it wants any of us, Sasquatch.<eos> I think it wants Nathan.
And there is something you can do for me.<eos> Prove he's innocent.<eos> I appreciate you coming back to my office.<eos> Well, we assume you're purchasing the photograph.<eos> Actually, no, but the A.D.A. is interested in it.
It was thought lost to plunder or time or shelling, but I believe it was stolen.<eos> Here is a picture of one of the bowls recovered at the site.<eos> Beth Roney had a bowl just like this in her office yesterday.<eos> She was working with Monroe and Clennon.<eos> She prevented it from being catalogued, and then she got it into their hands so they could remove it from the site.
Want to play?<eos> I bet you can't catch me!<eos> Come on! It's okay!<eos> Are you sure you want to stay in this old cabin?<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.
(grunts)<eos> JURY: Good to see you, Jax.<eos> JAX: You, too, Jury.<eos> JURY: That flash looks good on your chest.<eos> JAX: Just trying to live up to it, you know?
And even then it's pretty vague.<eos> I used to sell those maps and people would come in and they'd go,<eos> "I'm going to Birmingham," and I'd go, "No, you can't."<eos> - "Yeah, I've only got a Kendal map."<eos> - Do you use it in the home?
What did they do to her?<eos> Her eyes looked like marbles.<eos> Our best guess is someone threw sulfuric acid on her.<eos> I've only seen burns like this in industrial accidents.<eos> It burned through the optic nerves.
Well, we've asked everyone we know, and now I'm depressed, because this is everyone we know.<eos> Let's start asking people in the diner.<eos> We need to find it a place to live.<eos> Why?<eos> Why can't it live right here in my arm in between my hot and naturals?
This is the 2007 wine of the year.<eos> It is the second-best wine you will ever have.<eos> Let me know how that tastes.<eos> Cat piss, right? Yeah.<eos> You stroke that thing any harder, it's gonna have to buy you dinner.
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an Intellilink screwup?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> - That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!<eos> It's fine!<eos> It works fine! Just give it some time!
JUICE: Yeah. Okay.<eos> GEMMA: You gotta decide what you want, sweetheart.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Vulnerability is a liability.<eos> No place for it in this life.
Like what?<eos> Like... say, the sermon is about faith.<eos> Like it was today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Faith can be a very vague idea until you put it in your own words and thoughts.
You got an abacus?<eos> We'll do the math.<eos> And what does it do to the soul of this city if we don't take extraordinary measures to save the ones we can?<eos> The "soul of the city" is not a line item in the budget.<eos> Well, maybe it ought to be.
You have the power to pull him out.<eos> Where is your friend now?<eos> I was told you could tell me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> If your connection with your friend is strong enough, I could use it.
I'm the breach.<eos> Okay, let's clear the air right now.<eos> I have no idea when or where I got that pen.<eos> Could have been a doctor's office, bank, restaurant.<eos> The last time I remember using it was when I signed a permission slip for my daughter yesterday morning.
Perhaps if you were to talk to her.<eos> Dudley!<eos> Explain the situation!<eos> She will help, I am sure of it.<eos> The powder is so light, it requires the softest touch.
Or a... Claudette?<eos> I think it looks like a bad-tempered beetroot, personally.<eos> But...<eos> Right!<eos> It's had enough, it wants to get its windy-pops up now.
Oh, crap.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You ever heard of a front door?<eos> Yeah, about that-- I wasn't sure if I was actually allowed to use it or not.
Russell Jonathan.<eos> His tale of self-destruction followed by eventual self-redemption was like food for my soul.<eos> It was as if he was speaking directly to me about me, and all I wanted to do was crawl back into the comfort of his words.<eos> So I did, because the book had become my new obsession... and distraction.<eos> I was reading it over, and over, and over again, using it as my excuse to excuse myself from life.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?<eos> I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.<eos> If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.<eos> Come on, Morty.<eos> Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family.
You look so handsome!<eos> Just like Richard Dreyfuss in Mr. Holland's Old Penis.<eos> Um... Why are you carrying Mom's old purse?<eos> Oh. I-I thought it kind of looked like a briefcase.<eos> Go ahead and use it.
They just remembered you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture to make me feel better?<eos> In a way, yes.<eos> It belongs up there.
It's true, that.<eos> That's how important they are.<eos> That is very good.<eos> But if you can name this food, I'd be very impressed, because it really is the essence of Korea.<eos> They really are obsessed with it.
If you happy, God bless you, buddy.<eos> No, I not fucking happy, no one married just fucking happy.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.<eos> Listen, I really, you know..<eos> I really appriciate this fucking job, and I'm really enjoy it.
- Not thirteen, not anymore.<eos> The young one, the black head archer.<eos> We stuck him with a morgul shaft.<eos> The poison is in his blood.<eos> He'll be choking on it soon.
I don't think i'm better than you.<eos> I think i'm just like you.<eos> I want to get the bad guys too, and right now i don't care how i do it.<eos> They found a technicality.<eos> They're expoliting it.
- I know, right? I'm soaked.<eos> That is who you are, Mindy.<eos> You may not dress like us, or talk like us, but when it comes to boys, we're all the same.<eos> Twilight, Channing Tatum, Union J. It's biology, bitch.<eos> Don't fight it.

No Teddy, all right?<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> Where do we start?<eos> Well, I set up an alert on the credit card that I gave her to notify me if she uses it anywhere.<eos> In the meantime, I'll print out a list of every place she's ever used it.
None of the other stores in the lobby were robbed.<eos> Must have gone upstairs.<eos> But the stairs were locked.<eos> The guard's elevator card was still in his jacket.<eos> You think they used it and then put it back?
"in" meaning "not," "credible" meaning... well...<eos> Your message said you had something vital for us, something from the president's anti-ballistic-missile program.<eos> I'm giving it to you now, but you're not hearing me.<eos> The technology... it's incredibilis.<eos> At best, it's 50 years from being remotely operational.
Who, um...<eos> Who knew that the boat was moored there?<eos> It wasn't a secret.<eos> Pretty much anyone who walked down on the beach.<eos> And when did you last use it?
As thunder clouds build, updraughts within them separate charge.<eos> The lighter ice and water crystals become positively charged and are carried upwards, while the heavier, negatively charged crystals sink to the bottom.<eos> This can create a potential difference, a voltage between the cloud and the ground of as much as 100 million volts.<eos> Now, nature abhors a gradient.<eos> It doesn't like an imbalance, and it tries to correct it by having an electric current flow.
Why?<eos> Are you thinking prints?<eos> Because there could be hundreds of those on any one bill.<eos> But if we find the same print on multiple bills, it'll tell us who gave him the money the night that he died.<eos> You know, if I had any non-crime-related cash on me right now, I would be stuffing it down those pants.
What's next, a Ziva-cam?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Let's put a pin in that.<eos> Tony, stop.<eos> Please stop, and please, for the love of God, put that pen down before I stab you with it.
What's going on here?<eos> We were just making some dinner.<eos> Surprised to see you.<eos> Yeah, well, Maddie left her soccer gear in the car.<eos> I figured she'd need it for her game tomorrow.
What?<eos> Lavon?<eos> You didn't elect me union rep because of my good looks.<eos> I got an agenda here.<eos> We're gonna go through it, point by point.
We'd make a great team. If you want someone killed right, you've gotta kill them yourself.<eos> Somebody stitch that on a pillow.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> No, I hold the Cytron card.<eos> I hold it till we use it.
She will chew you up and spit you out.<eos> There's your chicken strips, Red.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Prettiest woman I ever saw.<eos> It'll make me write music again.
The polls will be open in one hour, and<eos> I find myself humbled in the face of this decision.<eos> As has been said by many of you at various times, there is a sanctity to the voting booth, but... Uh-oh. ...that sanctity is not absolute.<eos> It needs our constant vigilance.<eos> It needs our confidence that the votes are, in fact, true.
Keep it moving.<eos> Got the warrant.<eos> Good. Keep an eye on the entrance, all right?<eos> There's been a lot of interest in this vehicle.<eos> Why don't we just flatbed it back back to the command?
I know, but I think that they should know.<eos> Watch out, she'll totally shiv you or something.<eos> - Shank.<eos> - Huh?<eos> A shiv is a thing, a shank's what you do with it.
!<eos> It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that.<eos> Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself?<eos> This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.<eos> Or maybe it got me exactly what I wanted.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> How did you-<eos> I may not be good with facial expressions, but I know an evil doppelganger when I see one.<eos> Plus your arm makes a noise every time you move it.
He's trying to show off because he has a stupid crush on you.<eos> That's okay.<eos> This is hilarious.<eos> - Yeah, totally.<eos> - It's, like, is the machine telling me what to do, or am I telling it?
( all arguing )<eos> This is how I remember the '80s. There were no parenting blogs, or peanut allergies;<eos> just a whole lotta crazy.<eos> Ah, look at that little geek.<eos> Yep, that's me, Adam Goldberg. We were the first on our block to get a video camera, and I used it to record my entire childhood.
That's why I can't explain now...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement.<eos> This power will help you then!<eos> Their memories will tell you how to use it.
You hated The Cicada's Lament.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're that Joel Stephens?<eos> Oh, surely, you didn't hate the book.<eos> He gave it one star.
Yeah, to lead us away from Ali.<eos> I think "A" is a guy.<eos> Have you guys seen these?<eos> Wait, I was with Ali when she bought that shirt.<eos> She said she needed it for a date that night with an older guy.
Hey, please.<eos> It's what we've wanted.<eos> It's what we've worked for all these years.<eos> You've got a life.<eos> Live it now.
You should know that. You can't trust him.<eos> And now I'm realizing neither can I.<eos> I have no wife.<eos> No kids.<eos> I've sacrificed everything for this company, and I'm not gonna let it go down in flames.
Actually, I am not "Mrs" anyone.<eos> You're not divorced already?<eos> Keeping my name.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Use it wisely.
He was killed in a hit-and-run just over two years ago.<eos> Oh. Uh, I'm so sorry.<eos> And now that "Forevermore" might be worth millions, his estranged parents are claiming his estate.<eos> This game is Craig's legacy.<eos> I can't let them control it.
All right, you just rest now.<eos> It was bad.<eos> Your face tells me that.<eos> I don't know why, Sara, but there are days when a shadow descends upon a place, a dark, bloody pall, same as on the battlefield, same as at the precinct today and, oh, yes,<eos> one can fight it with all his might, but it's almost as if the shadow needs to beat its own self down, eat its own self 'fore it fades away and...
They kept putting this stuff on it.<eos> Healing herbs.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your people?<eos> My people put them on her leg to make it better.
Put the two together, you guys could actually get back to the time frame you wanted.<eos> Change the course of the revolution when it counts most!<eos> Naturally, I'll hang back here, do my part to lay the groundwork.<eos> You're testing my patience.<eos> When that thing works again, a guy like Escher is gonna use it.
So this is a camera obscura, typical of the type that could be found in the 1600's.<eos> This type of camera obscura is called a "box camera obscura".<eos> It generally had a ground glass like this.<eos> It has the ability to refocus by moving the Iens in and out.<eos> The general consensus of people that believe Vermeer used optics was that he may have looked at that image and been inspired by it.
hey, ma'am.<eos> thank god!<eos> here, hold this.<eos> [baby crying] the lasagna's burning.<eos> get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!
I thought I was gonna fall out of this thing.<eos> Well, you didn't.<eos> I probably woulda noticed.<eos> Oh. Your song was really great.<eos> Will sure, uh, he sure owned it, didn't he?
Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth, and let's not talk about this here, okay?<eos> So, what do you say we have some champagne?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> My life is... is over.<eos> It doesn't have to be over.
So, um...<eos> How have you been?<eos> How's work? Um...<eos> That shop has quite a reputation.<eos> What's the name of the guy who runs it?
Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I thought you were going home.<eos> You know, I-I made it all the way down the stairs before I remembered.<eos> You forgot your hat.<eos> It needs its own tracking anklet.
- That's a lot of blood.<eos> - What's it doing?<eos> Okay, everyone, back away very slowly.<eos> If we spread out, it'll get weaker.<eos> I don't think it wants any of us, Sasquatch.
- What's it doing?<eos> Okay, everyone, back away very slowly.<eos> If we spread out, it'll get weaker.<eos> I don't think it wants any of us, Sasquatch.<eos> I think it wants Nathan.
And there is something you can do for me.<eos> Prove he's innocent.<eos> I appreciate you coming back to my office.<eos> Well, we assume you're purchasing the photograph.<eos> Actually, no, but the A.D.A. is interested in it.
It was thought lost to plunder or time or shelling, but I believe it was stolen.<eos> Here is a picture of one of the bowls recovered at the site.<eos> Beth Roney had a bowl just like this in her office yesterday.<eos> She was working with Monroe and Clennon.<eos> She prevented it from being catalogued, and then she got it into their hands so they could remove it from the site.
Want to play?<eos> I bet you can't catch me!<eos> Come on! It's okay!<eos> Are you sure you want to stay in this old cabin?<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.
(grunts)<eos> JURY: Good to see you, Jax.<eos> JAX: You, too, Jury.<eos> JURY: That flash looks good on your chest.<eos> JAX: Just trying to live up to it, you know?
And even then it's pretty vague.<eos> I used to sell those maps and people would come in and they'd go,<eos> "I'm going to Birmingham," and I'd go, "No, you can't."<eos> - "Yeah, I've only got a Kendal map."<eos> - Do you use it in the home?
What did they do to her?<eos> Her eyes looked like marbles.<eos> Our best guess is someone threw sulfuric acid on her.<eos> I've only seen burns like this in industrial accidents.<eos> It burned through the optic nerves.
Well, we've asked everyone we know, and now I'm depressed, because this is everyone we know.<eos> Let's start asking people in the diner.<eos> We need to find it a place to live.<eos> Why?<eos> Why can't it live right here in my arm in between my hot and naturals?
This is the 2007 wine of the year.<eos> It is the second-best wine you will ever have.<eos> Let me know how that tastes.<eos> Cat piss, right? Yeah.<eos> You stroke that thing any harder, it's gonna have to buy you dinner.
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an Intellilink screwup?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> - That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!<eos> It's fine!<eos> It works fine! Just give it some time!
JUICE: Yeah. Okay.<eos> GEMMA: You gotta decide what you want, sweetheart.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Vulnerability is a liability.<eos> No place for it in this life.
Like what?<eos> Like... say, the sermon is about faith.<eos> Like it was today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Faith can be a very vague idea until you put it in your own words and thoughts.
You got an abacus?<eos> We'll do the math.<eos> And what does it do to the soul of this city if we don't take extraordinary measures to save the ones we can?<eos> The "soul of the city" is not a line item in the budget.<eos> Well, maybe it ought to be.
You have the power to pull him out.<eos> Where is your friend now?<eos> I was told you could tell me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> If your connection with your friend is strong enough, I could use it.
I'm the breach.<eos> Okay, let's clear the air right now.<eos> I have no idea when or where I got that pen.<eos> Could have been a doctor's office, bank, restaurant.<eos> The last time I remember using it was when I signed a permission slip for my daughter yesterday morning.
Perhaps if you were to talk to her.<eos> Dudley!<eos> Explain the situation!<eos> She will help, I am sure of it.<eos> The powder is so light, it requires the softest touch.
Or a... Claudette?<eos> I think it looks like a bad-tempered beetroot, personally.<eos> But...<eos> Right!<eos> It's had enough, it wants to get its windy-pops up now.
Oh, crap.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You ever heard of a front door?<eos> Yeah, about that-- I wasn't sure if I was actually allowed to use it or not.
Russell Jonathan.<eos> His tale of self-destruction followed by eventual self-redemption was like food for my soul.<eos> It was as if he was speaking directly to me about me, and all I wanted to do was crawl back into the comfort of his words.<eos> So I did, because the book had become my new obsession... and distraction.<eos> I was reading it over, and over, and over again, using it as my excuse to excuse myself from life.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?<eos> I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.<eos> If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.<eos> Come on, Morty.<eos> Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family.
You look so handsome!<eos> Just like Richard Dreyfuss in Mr. Holland's Old Penis.<eos> Um... Why are you carrying Mom's old purse?<eos> Oh. I-I thought it kind of looked like a briefcase.<eos> Go ahead and use it.
They just remembered you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture to make me feel better?<eos> In a way, yes.<eos> It belongs up there.
It's true, that.<eos> That's how important they are.<eos> That is very good.<eos> But if you can name this food, I'd be very impressed, because it really is the essence of Korea.<eos> They really are obsessed with it.
If you happy, God bless you, buddy.<eos> No, I not fucking happy, no one married just fucking happy.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.<eos> Listen, I really, you know..<eos> I really appriciate this fucking job, and I'm really enjoy it.

- Fuck!<eos> Sign says "closed."<eos> Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.<eos> Does this pump work?<eos> If you know how to work it.
- Anyone thinks about touching her, you go in too.<eos> Naomi, here.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Okay. So you want to help?<eos> You think it needs live bait?
Naomi, here.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Okay. So you want to help?<eos> You think it needs live bait?<eos> Well... Let's give it what it wants.
Ace, Ace! You'll stain the coat!<eos> - No, it wont. - Come on!<eos> - Keys.<eos> - No. - The keys! I'll drive this beautiful shiny big car, brother!<eos> Ace, It's not even a month old!
That teapot has been around for 2,000 years.<eos> It has gone through the hands of some of the greatest and worst characters in history.<eos> Although we have not seen it since it disappeared from a nazi concentration camp in 1945.<eos> Our founder, Dr. A.K. Bhardwaj, Learned that in the wrong hands, it could cause great harm.<eos> If there is one ounce of evil or hatred in either one of you, The teapot will draw it out.
There's a mood here, that I've achieved.<eos> It's not done yet.<eos> But it's really starting to feel like a game ... That has a beginning, middle and an end.<eos> It remains to be seen if the game's going to be good.<eos> But I'm pretty damn happy with it today.
[Youtube Video] Love this shirt.<eos> Oh so awesome.<eos> Yes.<eos> [Tommy] Regardless of how the game did...<eos> I would think that I'd like to always remember that I'm proud of it.
NCP- - Nereus Capital Properties.<eos> So he tanks the waterfront 'cause he's paving the way for his own company to make a separate deal.<eos> Double-crosses the mayor, screws his wife to boot.<eos> Ames really was planning on leaving his wife... for Terry.<eos> Excuse me. Nereus Capital Properties was formed a month ago. You made it eligible on city contract a week later.
What is all this?<eos> Returning this room to its proper appearance.<eos> Say what you will about the Targaryens-- they were conquerors.<eos> That is a seat for a conqueror.<eos> It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
I snatched. You eat. I erase.<eos> Hell, I'll even heal her for you when it's over.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You know what blood does to me.<eos> 'Cause you let it controntyou.
The more ill she became, the more devout she was.<eos> For all the good it did her.<eos> And what was hanging here?<eos> A painting... of the Virgin Mary.<eos> It was her mother's.
It's true, incidentally.<eos> There's other demons' blood on that blade.<eos> Look, I'm simpler than you think.<eos> I've figured one thing out about this world -- just one, pretty much.<eos> You find a cause, and you serve it.

You suspect your boss is mixed up with the missing Stradivarius?<eos> Well, he's very busy developing relationships, trying to expand our brand past insurance.<eos> He doesn't work the field anymore, but he took the violin on as a case, and then it went missing -- doesn't add up.<eos> It's pre-1700 -- valuable but sells for less.<eos> So why is Bryan interested in it?

What I'd pay to have that bat in my collection.<eos> I bet it's a lot of money for that piece of wood.<eos> "Piece of wood"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, take away the fact that DiMaggio swung it, it's just a bat.
Things don't have to go back to the way they were.<eos> You know, it's okay for you to move on. If that's what you want.<eos> I want my family back.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> And I should never have let it come apart in the first place.
Are they doing okay?<eos> Hal's better with them.<eos> I've just been staying on David's boat, although he didn't know about it until the cops showed up last night.<eos> You've been breaking in to his boat?<eos> He never uses it; it's just sitting there.
Whoa, whoa.<eos> Your desk is in the back.<eos> - This is neutral territory.<eos> - Yep.<eos> So I'm claiming it.
I'm a writer.<eos> I have to have an open mind.<eos> Yeah, but magic?<eos> Water is a very powerful thing.<eos> Cultures as old as time have worshipped it.
Where I've kept the last bit of my magic.<eos> The only magic in this world is in the things I brought with me.<eos> It's not spinning.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It needs to absorb the magic that's here.
Now I come into a walking country, I need a walking stick.<eos> Cudgel, more like!<eos> It's much too heavy.<eos> Is it ironwood?<eos> Don't wave it in my direction.
We shall draw lots, and cut but shallow to prolong the game.<eos> Seppius to stand first, in honor of fallen cousin!<eos> Fuck the lot of you Roman cunts!<eos> Do not think that the gods have shown you mercy.<eos> I but delay your passing, so that I may savor it.
Ann, I painted your garage pink.<eos> I did not ask you to do that.<eos> Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better.<eos> Our friendship is over.<eos> No, it's not.

Neither is Jane.<eos> Both girls are missing.<eos> Where could they be?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Rose left me a note but I didn't take it seriously.
Take her to the precipice of death and hold her there.<eos> Blood drained of oxygen is pure and thick.<eos> There now.<eos> Aw, you don't even have to try.<eos> Let it flow to you.

The man that's about to make us all very, very rich.<eos> Now, see, that's that inner pucker I'm talking about.<eos> You keep that shit up; Skip loves it more than I do.<eos> The inner pucker?<eos> Let it bubble.
- For behind-the-scenes material.<eos> Was that secret?<eos> - She wanted her film work.<eos> I helped her.<eos> You put it on half speed and takes 12 hours.
D... no, it is not awesome.<eos> It is a miracle.<eos> And when I saw on the O.R. board that my patient... my miracle... is undergoing a lymph node transfer without my knowledge...<eos> She came to us, Dr. Bailey.<eos> Said she brought it to you a few months ago, and you shot it down.
No.<eos> It's a chance to say goodbye.<eos> Do you like your job?<eos> Yes.<eos> You buzz on it, yeah?
If you have a problem with this, you're not getting any power.<eos> I'm sorry, where exactly did you study engineering?<eos> I didn't.<eos> But you're suggesting that you can run an energy company.<eos> My client's gonna be running it, not designing parts.
Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you-- and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So who's talking now?<eos> ♪ Catch your dream<eos> ♪ don't let it spread its wings and fly away ♪
Congratulations, General.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Better than expected.<eos> Fringe Division now finds itself with a fully-funded science division and no one to run it.
Excuse me.<eos> What sort of a book was it?<eos> A diary?<eos> It was small enough, but I'm not really certain.<eos> Could you find a way to get a hold of it?
Well,there'splentywrong with chocolate brown if it's not good.<eos> And you know, that dress was-- it wasn't offensive in any particular way.<eos> Itwasto me ,it lookedlike a maternity dress.<eos> Itdidn'tlookamateurish.<eos> It's not flattering at the waist, that was really the only thing I personally could object to it.
- No!<eos> I didn't look that close.<eos> Consistent with treatment for erectile dysfunction.<eos> It's too bad he didn't hear about viagra.<eos> His heart condition prohibited it.
I am so scared! More gas, more gas, more gas, more gas.<eos> Oh, dear Lord!<eos> Put her next to the wall little bit.<eos> I am next to the wall! 'Eventually, Kyle let me go out on my own.'<eos> Letting it find grip.
Quit stalling'!<eos> Oh, what?<eos> ! This thing must be broken.<eos> It's totally broken, guys.<eos> It's like a million years old.
We don't need her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not.<eos> If another one's come out of the woodwork, why aren't we running with it?
Very belittling.<eos> Who's the stupid therapist here?<eos> I guess that would be me.<eos> Your idiot neighbor is yelling at me for no reason.<eos> I've got a can of Mace in my purse and I am not afraid to bash his skull in with it.

They're gonna be everywhere.<eos> The temporalis muscle is atrophied.<eos> Any idea why, Dr. Grey?<eos> Uh, lack of use?<eos> It had nowhere to attach since the bone was gone.
Which just goes to prove that animals are ungrateful.<eos> Basically, if the Fisker was any more green, it would be chaining itself to a Japanese whaling ship.<eos> But I like being in it.<eos> It's just a very nice place to be, the Fisker - it makes you realise that just putting leather on everything is a terrible old cliche it's what the Romans would have done.<eos> And on top of that, I like driving it.
- I'm not leaving the clinic, Harrison...<eos> this is all I've ever wanted to do.<eos> And that is why I told them that I wouldn't take the job... unless there was something there for you, too.<eos> And there is.<eos> A free clinic is opening... and they want you to run it.
- You Carter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How am I supposed to know you're not on Elias's payroll?<eos> You can't.<eos> You got another option, I recommend you take it.
And this is the rally car we'll be fielding... a Skoda Fabia Super 2000.<eos> Last season, this car dominated the championship, winning seven of the 12 rallies and locking out the entire podium with a 1-2-3 on four of those occasions.<eos> But although the car is clearly no slouch, is it any kind of match for the non-car thing we've got lined up for today?<eos> In fact, if I were the car, I might possibly be weeing myself right now.<eos> Because today, it will be taking on Yves Rossy, the world's first jet-powered flying man.
When things happen that aren't supposed to happen, they're called accidents, I believe.<eos> So, everybody knows about Brick's football career, obviously, but no one knows much about his personal life.<eos> Was he ever married?<eos> Just to the game.<eos> He gave it everything he had.
I'm not trying to justify what she did.<eos> I'm trying to shed light on what happened.<eos> Right, and the effect of that could be a court setting that woman free.<eos> Okay, postpartum is a real thing, all right?<eos> Jake, 80% of mothers suffer from some form of it.
There were mosquitoes.<eos> I just wanted to make a few bucks.<eos> Buy beer.<eos> Been thinking about that job more and more lately.<eos> Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
Hmm.<eos> Maybe there was something in his second book.<eos> Maybe he was gonna reveal something that got him murdered.<eos> "I looked down at the blood flowing from my wrists like a river.<eos> I let it pool in my lap.
I tried to let her down easy, but, uh, she didn't take it too well.<eos> Actually, I don't know how she took it, 'cause I wasn't there.<eos> We dated a few weeks, then after we...<eos> You know, I slipped out of her house before she woke up and never called her again.<eos> Put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral, let it roll down the driveway, lights off.
I turned my cell phone off because I was at a yoga retreat, and I needed to relax.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> You don't do yoga.<eos> I do yoga, and you mock me for it.<eos> That's because I do it for spiritual centering.
-Right. -Whereas the cigarette smoker, rushed.<eos> -Yeah. Gotta get out, you know.<eos> -But a cigarette takes some time.<eos> -Yes, I know, but....<eos> A cigarette is just, it's just-- It's not something you're enjoying.

Wait a minute.<eos> Smallpox.<eos> Hasn't that been eradicated?<eos> See, you can't believe everything that you read on the Internet.<eos> Okay, so how did he get it?
And I did uncover one record of interest.<eos> And what's that?<eos> His death certificate.<eos> The real Graham Wyler died in 1997.<eos> Whoever you've been following stole his identity and has been using it for the past 15 years.
That's if the ADTs don't put you in the ground first.<eos> All right, this is weird.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, we flagged Johnny's credit card in case one of the ADTs tried to use it.<eos> So, what happened-- one of those idiots use it? Well, a huge charge just rang through from Le Beau Monde hotel.

I told them about a well-armed drug boat in their waters.<eos> They were very, very interested.<eos> Most people don't think of the Coast Guard as being particularly well-armed.<eos> Most people are wrong.<eos> A Coast Guard patrol boat is armed with two .50-caliber machine guns and a 25-millimeter cannon, which means it can take out anything short of a battleship.
Wait, that's what this is?<eos> Don't worry, it's also the last meeting.<eos> Because we're all so close,<eos> Sam and I wanted to bring you here so we could finally tell you our true feelings about you.<eos> Tina, acting is a pipe dream for you, and your decision to pursue it as a career is both irresponsible and shocking.
I'll go get us some marshmallows.<eos> You know, it's probably nothing.<eos> We just have to follow up on these things.<eos> Sure, of course.<eos> But if it's just one random complaint, how can you even trust it?
I started a business where I rent my fancy clothes to teens so their parents don't have to buy them nice things they'll just grow out of.<eos> So if you see a 14-year-old kid wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat, you know who to thank.<eos> Me.<eos> And Louis Vuitton for making some dope-ass cravats.<eos> Son, I love wildlife, but is a store the best place for it?
Just about everything a stalker looks for in a victim.<eos> We need to know everywhere Lisa was tonight.<eos> We determine where Lisa was followed from, we might be able to get a lead on our kidnapper.<eos> We just got a hit on Lisa's credit card.<eos> Someone tried using it at a convenience store two miles away.
What's that?<eos> Actually, Commander, I really think you need to see this in person.<eos> Sorry to drag you back in here, but I noticed something disturbing while performing the autopsy.<eos> My hypothesis is that the killer used a knife with a unique engraving on the handle.<eos> When he rested it on the victim's skin, it left a latent blood impression.
I need to focus on death.<eos> And I just stare at it every morning...<eos> - It sounds wrong, doesn't it?<eos> - In the bathroom. I don't know.<eos> I mean, I know he's not actually gonna come back to use it, but it just makes me feel better to see it there, next to mine on a sink.
In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.<eos> Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.<eos> I do that, too.<eos> Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.<eos> And I let it.
have fun!<eos> finger up for the throw, finger up for the throw<eos> You must throw up.. - I can't<eos> - It made Billiam died, you gotta throw up, just figure something gross<eos> - All right, all right. all right, your grandma's vagina and there's dick right into it..
- Fuck!<eos> Sign says "closed."<eos> Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.<eos> Does this pump work?<eos> If you know how to work it.
- Anyone thinks about touching her, you go in too.<eos> Naomi, here.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Okay. So you want to help?<eos> You think it needs live bait?
Naomi, here.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Okay. So you want to help?<eos> You think it needs live bait?<eos> Well... Let's give it what it wants.
Ace, Ace! You'll stain the coat!<eos> - No, it wont. - Come on!<eos> - Keys.<eos> - No. - The keys! I'll drive this beautiful shiny big car, brother!<eos> Ace, It's not even a month old!
That teapot has been around for 2,000 years.<eos> It has gone through the hands of some of the greatest and worst characters in history.<eos> Although we have not seen it since it disappeared from a nazi concentration camp in 1945.<eos> Our founder, Dr. A.K. Bhardwaj, Learned that in the wrong hands, it could cause great harm.<eos> If there is one ounce of evil or hatred in either one of you, The teapot will draw it out.
There's a mood here, that I've achieved.<eos> It's not done yet.<eos> But it's really starting to feel like a game ... That has a beginning, middle and an end.<eos> It remains to be seen if the game's going to be good.<eos> But I'm pretty damn happy with it today.
[Youtube Video] Love this shirt.<eos> Oh so awesome.<eos> Yes.<eos> [Tommy] Regardless of how the game did...<eos> I would think that I'd like to always remember that I'm proud of it.
NCP- - Nereus Capital Properties.<eos> So he tanks the waterfront 'cause he's paving the way for his own company to make a separate deal.<eos> Double-crosses the mayor, screws his wife to boot.<eos> Ames really was planning on leaving his wife... for Terry.<eos> Excuse me. Nereus Capital Properties was formed a month ago. You made it eligible on city contract a week later.
What is all this?<eos> Returning this room to its proper appearance.<eos> Say what you will about the Targaryens-- they were conquerors.<eos> That is a seat for a conqueror.<eos> It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
I snatched. You eat. I erase.<eos> Hell, I'll even heal her for you when it's over.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You know what blood does to me.<eos> 'Cause you let it controntyou.
The more ill she became, the more devout she was.<eos> For all the good it did her.<eos> And what was hanging here?<eos> A painting... of the Virgin Mary.<eos> It was her mother's.
It's true, incidentally.<eos> There's other demons' blood on that blade.<eos> Look, I'm simpler than you think.<eos> I've figured one thing out about this world -- just one, pretty much.<eos> You find a cause, and you serve it.

You suspect your boss is mixed up with the missing Stradivarius?<eos> Well, he's very busy developing relationships, trying to expand our brand past insurance.<eos> He doesn't work the field anymore, but he took the violin on as a case, and then it went missing -- doesn't add up.<eos> It's pre-1700 -- valuable but sells for less.<eos> So why is Bryan interested in it?

What I'd pay to have that bat in my collection.<eos> I bet it's a lot of money for that piece of wood.<eos> "Piece of wood"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, take away the fact that DiMaggio swung it, it's just a bat.
Things don't have to go back to the way they were.<eos> You know, it's okay for you to move on. If that's what you want.<eos> I want my family back.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> And I should never have let it come apart in the first place.
Are they doing okay?<eos> Hal's better with them.<eos> I've just been staying on David's boat, although he didn't know about it until the cops showed up last night.<eos> You've been breaking in to his boat?<eos> He never uses it; it's just sitting there.
Whoa, whoa.<eos> Your desk is in the back.<eos> - This is neutral territory.<eos> - Yep.<eos> So I'm claiming it.
I'm a writer.<eos> I have to have an open mind.<eos> Yeah, but magic?<eos> Water is a very powerful thing.<eos> Cultures as old as time have worshipped it.
Where I've kept the last bit of my magic.<eos> The only magic in this world is in the things I brought with me.<eos> It's not spinning.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It needs to absorb the magic that's here.
Now I come into a walking country, I need a walking stick.<eos> Cudgel, more like!<eos> It's much too heavy.<eos> Is it ironwood?<eos> Don't wave it in my direction.
We shall draw lots, and cut but shallow to prolong the game.<eos> Seppius to stand first, in honor of fallen cousin!<eos> Fuck the lot of you Roman cunts!<eos> Do not think that the gods have shown you mercy.<eos> I but delay your passing, so that I may savor it.
Ann, I painted your garage pink.<eos> I did not ask you to do that.<eos> Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better.<eos> Our friendship is over.<eos> No, it's not.
I did not ask you to do that.<eos> Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better.<eos> Our friendship is over.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's not over. It's never over.
Why not?<eos> I mean, technically it's yours.<eos> No.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I'd just be borrowing it.
Neither is Jane.<eos> Both girls are missing.<eos> Where could they be?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Rose left me a note but I didn't take it seriously.
Take her to the precipice of death and hold her there.<eos> Blood drained of oxygen is pure and thick.<eos> There now.<eos> Aw, you don't even have to try.<eos> Let it flow to you.
You get your own fake animal!<eos> You made up that dog to get pussy!<eos> It's a stupid fucking story, man!<eos> Oh, so stupid you fucking stole it'?<eos> As if you were going to use it, anyway.
The man that's about to make us all very, very rich.<eos> Now, see, that's that inner pucker I'm talking about.<eos> You keep that shit up; Skip loves it more than I do.<eos> The inner pucker?<eos> Let it bubble.
- For behind-the-scenes material.<eos> Was that secret?<eos> - She wanted her film work.<eos> I helped her.<eos> You put it on half speed and takes 12 hours.
D... no, it is not awesome.<eos> It is a miracle.<eos> And when I saw on the O.R. board that my patient... my miracle... is undergoing a lymph node transfer without my knowledge...<eos> She came to us, Dr. Bailey.<eos> Said she brought it to you a few months ago, and you shot it down.
No.<eos> It's a chance to say goodbye.<eos> Do you like your job?<eos> Yes.<eos> You buzz on it, yeah?
If you have a problem with this, you're not getting any power.<eos> I'm sorry, where exactly did you study engineering?<eos> I didn't.<eos> But you're suggesting that you can run an energy company.<eos> My client's gonna be running it, not designing parts.
Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you-- and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So who's talking now?<eos> ♪ Catch your dream<eos> ♪ don't let it spread its wings and fly away ♪
Congratulations, General.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Better than expected.<eos> Fringe Division now finds itself with a fully-funded science division and no one to run it.
Excuse me.<eos> What sort of a book was it?<eos> A diary?<eos> It was small enough, but I'm not really certain.<eos> Could you find a way to get a hold of it?
Well,there'splentywrong with chocolate brown if it's not good.<eos> And you know, that dress was-- it wasn't offensive in any particular way.<eos> Itwasto me ,it lookedlike a maternity dress.<eos> Itdidn'tlookamateurish.<eos> It's not flattering at the waist, that was really the only thing I personally could object to it.
- No!<eos> I didn't look that close.<eos> Consistent with treatment for erectile dysfunction.<eos> It's too bad he didn't hear about viagra.<eos> His heart condition prohibited it.
I am so scared! More gas, more gas, more gas, more gas.<eos> Oh, dear Lord!<eos> Put her next to the wall little bit.<eos> I am next to the wall! 'Eventually, Kyle let me go out on my own.'<eos> Letting it find grip.
Quit stalling'!<eos> Oh, what?<eos> ! This thing must be broken.<eos> It's totally broken, guys.<eos> It's like a million years old.
We don't need her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not.<eos> If another one's come out of the woodwork, why aren't we running with it?
Very belittling.<eos> Who's the stupid therapist here?<eos> I guess that would be me.<eos> Your idiot neighbor is yelling at me for no reason.<eos> I've got a can of Mace in my purse and I am not afraid to bash his skull in with it.
- Our friend Clarke seems to have learned his management skills from Mao.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I'm the true litigator.<eos> The firm has suffered through your leadership over the last six months.<eos> Now it needs a man at the top.
They're gonna be everywhere.<eos> The temporalis muscle is atrophied.<eos> Any idea why, Dr. Grey?<eos> Uh, lack of use?<eos> It had nowhere to attach since the bone was gone.
Which just goes to prove that animals are ungrateful.<eos> Basically, if the Fisker was any more green, it would be chaining itself to a Japanese whaling ship.<eos> But I like being in it.<eos> It's just a very nice place to be, the Fisker - it makes you realise that just putting leather on everything is a terrible old cliche it's what the Romans would have done.<eos> And on top of that, I like driving it.
- I'm not leaving the clinic, Harrison...<eos> this is all I've ever wanted to do.<eos> And that is why I told them that I wouldn't take the job... unless there was something there for you, too.<eos> And there is.<eos> A free clinic is opening... and they want you to run it.
- You Carter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How am I supposed to know you're not on Elias's payroll?<eos> You can't.<eos> You got another option, I recommend you take it.
And this is the rally car we'll be fielding... a Skoda Fabia Super 2000.<eos> Last season, this car dominated the championship, winning seven of the 12 rallies and locking out the entire podium with a 1-2-3 on four of those occasions.<eos> But although the car is clearly no slouch, is it any kind of match for the non-car thing we've got lined up for today?<eos> In fact, if I were the car, I might possibly be weeing myself right now.<eos> Because today, it will be taking on Yves Rossy, the world's first jet-powered flying man.
When things happen that aren't supposed to happen, they're called accidents, I believe.<eos> So, everybody knows about Brick's football career, obviously, but no one knows much about his personal life.<eos> Was he ever married?<eos> Just to the game.<eos> He gave it everything he had.
I'm not trying to justify what she did.<eos> I'm trying to shed light on what happened.<eos> Right, and the effect of that could be a court setting that woman free.<eos> Okay, postpartum is a real thing, all right?<eos> Jake, 80% of mothers suffer from some form of it.
There were mosquitoes.<eos> I just wanted to make a few bucks.<eos> Buy beer.<eos> Been thinking about that job more and more lately.<eos> Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
Hmm.<eos> Maybe there was something in his second book.<eos> Maybe he was gonna reveal something that got him murdered.<eos> "I looked down at the blood flowing from my wrists like a river.<eos> I let it pool in my lap.
I tried to let her down easy, but, uh, she didn't take it too well.<eos> Actually, I don't know how she took it, 'cause I wasn't there.<eos> We dated a few weeks, then after we...<eos> You know, I slipped out of her house before she woke up and never called her again.<eos> Put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral, let it roll down the driveway, lights off.
I turned my cell phone off because I was at a yoga retreat, and I needed to relax.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> You don't do yoga.<eos> I do yoga, and you mock me for it.<eos> That's because I do it for spiritual centering.
-Right. -Whereas the cigarette smoker, rushed.<eos> -Yeah. Gotta get out, you know.<eos> -But a cigarette takes some time.<eos> -Yes, I know, but....<eos> A cigarette is just, it's just-- It's not something you're enjoying.
The power that this thing represents--<eos> I mean, who would you trust it with?<eos> Besides you?<eos> No one.<eos> Which is why the machine has been coded in such a way that it cannot be abused.
- But I have one that I'm really excited about called Real Apps, that I know Russell would be interested in.<eos> - No.<eos> - Nick, Real Apps is my idea.<eos> Real Apps is not your idea.<eos> Yeah, sure, you might have birthed the idea, but I midwifed it, and I midwifed the crap out of it.
Kara Simmons.<eos> It's not here.<eos> Her name is not on the list.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can't decide if I admire your sentimentality or despise it.
Lilith has chosen you as my Adam.<eos> We will birth a new world together.<eos> What if I don't want to be chosen?<eos> Her blood is inside you.<eos> Let it be your guide.
It's just standard questions.<eos> You ever drive your sister to work?<eos> I don't have a license.<eos> We just have the one car.<eos> Everyone uses it.
Wait a minute.<eos> Smallpox.<eos> Hasn't that been eradicated?<eos> See, you can't believe everything that you read on the Internet.<eos> Okay, so how did he get it?
And I did uncover one record of interest.<eos> And what's that?<eos> His death certificate.<eos> The real Graham Wyler died in 1997.<eos> Whoever you've been following stole his identity and has been using it for the past 15 years.
That's if the ADTs don't put you in the ground first.<eos> All right, this is weird.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, we flagged Johnny's credit card in case one of the ADTs tried to use it.<eos> So, what happened-- one of those idiots use it? Well, a huge charge just rang through from Le Beau Monde hotel.
Just don't go "Yowzah!"<eos> Ha, ha, ha...<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I always rip out the last page of a book.<eos> Then it doesn't have to end.

They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.<eos> - Another crash!<eos> - It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.<eos> Embrace your inner lemon.<eos> Let it drive you.
Okay, I got Post-its, cinnamon Tic Tacs...<eos> It's silver, curved and has a light on it.<eos> Got it. Come on.<eos> There's definitely something in her throat. Hold her jaw open.<eos> I'm putting my hand in. It's stuck.
How do you know that we haven't got it?<eos> We've been outside.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> That fucker doesn't hang around.<eos> - You breathe it in, you cough it out.
Rain...<eos> What rain?<eos> It's death weeping for you.<eos> The wheat is drying outside...<eos> Don't let it get soaked.
Well in that case I must tell you that we work only to appointment.<eos> Fannie has broken her ankle. I was hoping to persuade you to treat it?<eos> I'll have the fish n chips.<eos> That's the rum talking.<eos> It's all I had to ease the pain.
It's not so bad.<eos> Try it.<eos> It's a car accident.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> You wanna give it a shot?
Oh, Axl. What's going on with Axl?<eos> Oh. Well, prom's coming up.<eos> It's a funny story about prom.<eos> (Mike chuckles)<eos> So he asked a girl by text, but it was the wrong girl, and now he doesn't want to take her.
To cry into? Mmm.<eos> 'Cause they were so sad the pharaoh was gone.<eos> Oh, I'm thinking they were crying because they were slaves and they're being buried alive.<eos> Angela saw it right here in the gift shop.<eos> She thought it was so cool.
And this just in: she cheated on you.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Look, I know you're as dumb as a bag of wet hair, but you know in your heart she's lying.<eos> That gumball story was insane.<eos> You're choosing to believe it so you can still be with her.
I'm really glad you guys are back.<eos> But I think I'm gonna have to call Dr. Emil to take a look at that.<eos> Clark, those Omegas that we saw at the gate -- seems like the darkness is everywhere.<eos> What if it comes back?<eos> We'll fight it.
- Bye, thanks, Mum.<eos> Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland.<eos> We are in Tooting.<eos> I am here because my country needs me.<eos> And because it needs you, too.
In any case, she quit.<eos> That's great. My only contact at Conde Nast has been replaced by a stapler stealer.<eos> And I will staple whatever's in your sweaty hand to your jeans if you don't leave this instant.<eos> What's in my hand is an article.<eos> Epperly said she'd get it to "Details."
And all of a sudden, he drops dead.<eos> That's it.<eos> You know...<eos> People talk about "closure," but I don't buy it.<eos> When somebody blasts a hole in your life... It tends to stay open.
I mean, I am so amazing.<eos> But I'm not perfect.<eos> You are.<eos> Give me that power.<eos> So I can abuse it.
You can never escape me.<eos> Nothing harms me.<eos> But I know pain.<eos> I know pain.<eos> Sometime I share it with someone like you.
His face...<eos> His eyes were different.<eos> He came after me with a pickax.<eos> And we fought.<eos> And he ran it through my leg.
Well, see uh, I can only guess that the pervasive anti-vampire hatred that has persisted since the heinous crime perpetrated by Russell Edgington had something to do with it.<eos> Mmm.<eos> And that hate is a powerful force, but hate never wins out.<eos> Not in the long run.<eos> And we will never succumb to it.
How far are you with that creature?<eos> Abby? (SHRIEKING)<eos> There's a second creature down here.<eos> It's been affected by the acid.<eos> It seems in a lot of pain.
I might hang me leathers up. You never know.<eos> have had our down times and I haven't tried to hide anything from them. You know, we've done our crying together<eos> And then, "OK, what are we gonna do now?"<eos> Get over it, move on.<eos> I think the point of life is to enjoy it.

Am I, father?<eos> Vanity, however, is getting the better of you.<eos> How so?<eos> You have done what is forbidden.<eos> You've chosen the dark side and allowed it to feed your anger and desire for power.
- No, you'll be trapped.<eos> - cho: captain, we'll find another way.<eos> - You will do as you're ordered, Doctor.<eos> You too, Mr. Borges.<eos> Send this thing back to hell where it belongs.
I think it might be broken.<eos> It could just be a fracture.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> If this thing wanted to kill us, we'd be dead already, so I .. I figure that's a good thing, right?<eos> It wants us alive.
Well, actually, I can speak six different languages, so McNair can just... piss off.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You know, I thought we'd stay for a while.<eos> Really?<eos> The leg is pretty painful,to be honest, and you said I should rest it.
Anne's a civilian, and we don't want lose our doctor.<eos> As for you, you got your team taken hostage.<eos> We almost lost our best weapon and a lot of our food.<eos> And we almost lost them to a bunch of criminals with A.K.s and road flares.<eos> This time, it worked out, but there's a reason we have a chain of command, and you better damn well make sure people follow it.
Where'd he go?<eos> Where'd who go; who is this guy?<eos> I got to find Michelle.<eos> Are you sure this wasn't another pink balloon.<eos> He's got a rifle, he's going to use it.
That's the spirit of the shokunin.<eos> When to quit?<eos> The job that you've worked so hard for?<eos> I've never once hated this job.<eos> I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it.
Only if you'll be my Mrs. Wellington.<eos> All right.<eos> Your wallet, please.<eos> Marriage is based on trust.<eos> Trust that I have my baton, and I really do love to hit people with it.
It's a game of cat and mouse.<eos> Blais tries to entice the shark close enough to slip a noose around its neck but one false move and it's game over.<eos> Finally it takes the bait.<eos> Slowly he prepares the noose.<eos> Blais can't keep hold of the thrashing shark, but this wooden float prevents it diving.

Well, at least now when you hit 55, you'll be able to do it in style.<eos> Leave the gun at Khokar's feet.<eos> Then come back here and get in the car.<eos> Why?<eos> It doesn't belong here.
I am so sorry.<eos> Actually, Bates, I'm glad I've caught you.<eos> Sir Richard Carlisle telephoned me earlier.<eos> He says he's paid Mrs Bates for her story.<eos> She cannot speak of it now without risking prison.
Gimme a pound of ribeye steak.<eos> What does a cow say? -What?<eos> It says "Moo!"<eos> And then it gets its head blown off.
Why not?<eos> Because you know how you said that your body wasn't that hot earlier?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well, when you get that hot, your body tries to protect itself.<eos> So your skin starts to collect sweat and other stuff that insulates it.
We get Travis Marshall, you got it?<eos> I made sure the slice of life was in the video I sent Travis.<eos> He'll be expecting to find me on my boat.<eos> Not this one.<eos> The owners use it twice a year, but I only need it once... for Travis' final tableau.
When was the last time you saw it?<eos> Yesterday... in-in Renny's trailer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Could he have, uh, could he have loaned it to anybody?<eos> That lighter was worth a lot of money, and Renny cherished it.
That's a couple blocks away.<eos> We're on the way.<eos> Okay, I'll see if I can stall him for you.<eos> Now you might want to try checking the magnetic strip.<eos> Maybe clean it.
You got another envelope?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Found this medal inside.<eos> It's called the Order of the Rising Sun.<eos> It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.
- Shoot.<eos> Why?<eos> What's up, pal?<eos> I'm going over to a friend's house where I may have to use this thing.<eos> I only used it once, and that was to take a torte out of the oven.
You know what, Kristen?<eos> Ah, yeah, that's it, get mad.<eos> You got something to say, Ryan?<eos> That was pathetic.<eos> You just grabbed your ankles and took it.
It's state-of-the-art, but give me a couple hours.<eos> I can write an algorithm that can bypass the signal traps.<eos> The alarm system won't be a problem.<eos> How's that?<eos> Because we're not gonna set it off.
And what did happen?<eos> They formed a... A kind of a... A subconscious consensus.<eos> Out of these kinds of ideas came what was called the Californian ideology.<eos> It was an odd fusion of radical individualism and utopian theories about computer systems, and an international priesthood rose up to promote it.<eos> What united them was was a vision that the world was now one interconnected system, that nation states were irrelevant and politicians should not try and control the system, they should let it free to create a new kind of democracy.
Reggie.<eos> It's all right, it's me.<eos> Come on, we've got to go.<eos> Where's that rental car?<eos> Back where it belongs.
We make an observation suggesting one thing and then it's immediately contradicted by something else.<eos> It takes time to come up with scientific proof.<eos> You can't just throw a paddy and expect results,<eos> Hale - you have to learn some patience.<eos> All right, let's just assume for one moment it was cholera that killed her and Tess has it too.
I'm 22.<eos> In two days I might be changing the order of creation and vanish. - A poet?<eos> Listen.<eos> '"It's time for the poor to get rich and for the rich to start dying.<eos> '"Not outside of nature, rather within it, does money circulate.
And since they're your publisher, I was hoping you could get the book killed.<eos> It's a satire of my entire life And everyone I know, and if it's released, I'll be a pariah.<eos> My, you turned out to be an even bigger coward Than I thought.<eos> The best way to make sure your book fades into oblivion-- Leave it alone.<eos> What, let it come out?
- Yeah, well, we'll see.<eos> Go!<eos> Oh, come on, sweetheart.<eos> Put the big gun down.<eos> You don't know how to use it.
Where's Leo?<eos> He's in the waiting area.<eos> We got a man out front playing janitor keeping an eye on him, and we got the other place locked down.<eos> Your mission, Myka.<eos> How do you wanna play it?
Centuries ago, she told me about a vampire who knew how to kill Klaus.<eos> Then she wouldn't tell me any more.<eos> - Well, why not?<eos> - Because it was her leverage.<eos> She knew it was valuable information, and wouldn't share it with me.
Evidence that pointed to the terrorists was left for him to find but he found his own evidence that proved it was an inside job.<eos> Percy couldn't afford to let that come to light so he buried it and Merrick.<eos> Killing the lead investigator would draw too much attention so he framed him for the beating of an Iraqi civilian to death.<eos> He is currently serving year seven of a 30-year prison sentence.<eos> This guy has evidence, why isn't he using it to clear his name?
No use.<eos> If people only understand each other through fighting... Then what was the point of us ever meeting?<eos> !<eos> Hatred can be suppressed with reason.<eos> But you must give in to it at times or it will eat you alive.
I already sent it.<eos> Check your in-box.<eos> You're welcome, Mary Sunshine.<eos> Today I am just grateful that justice prevailed and that this terrible man has been held accountable for his crimes against the American people.<eos> As for the future, I have always planned to serve my country however and wherever it needs me most.
Seeing inside a miner's house I think: A snail lives better in its shell, or a dandy thief in the shadow of the law, under the burning sun.<eos> Rows of shacks all face to face, yes sir, and rows of women waiting for one sink, each with a bucket and a face of pain, under the burning sun.<eos> - Viola... - Mmmh?<eos> Where did you find that song?<eos> A little bird taught it to me.
Why should I discuss with a federal prosecutor who I hire in my lab?<eos> Tell me: What happens when a defense attorney questions the integrity of this lab because we have a teenage miscreant handling evidence?<eos> So, you think that this young man, brilliant by even Dr. Brennan's standards, should be condemned forever because of some youthful indiscretions?<eos> Sometimes life isn't fair.<eos> But I don't have to help it along.
The lung donor didn't have cancer.<eos> Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.<eos> That mass wasn't a tumor.<eos> It was coagulated plasma.<eos> E.R. pumped him full of it.
It's perfect, Spence, it's got humor, heart, it's inspiring--<eos> I wish I could be there to hear it.<eos> Wow, Spence, you got Melissa's stamp of approval.<eos> - Must be a good speech.<eos> - Well, it better be.
Actually... yeah, he could.<eos> Barry Bavetta checked out of his hotel in a hurry at 7:30.<eos> That's enough time to make it back to the house by 9:00 when Jack was killed.<eos> Barry's phone is still going straight to voice mail.<eos> Well, the manager gave me his credit card info, so if we're lucky he's out there using it.
Stop staring at me!<eos> Ugh, you threw me off!<eos> Come on everybody, don't stop now!<eos> The door was responding to our music!<eos> I wonder what it liked... or what was missing?
I'm just walking like a friend.<eos> Okay, you know what, forget this.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Last on the list... toilet paper.<eos> Um, I don't use it.
- A little tighter than I expected. - Hmph.<eos> Need some breaking' in, that all.<eos> So what can I do for y'all?<eos> This strike...<eos> It needs to end.
Punch-key lock.<eos> You need to know the code to get out.<eos> Damn.<eos> Detective, have you heard of - cross-racial identification? - I have.<eos> But you don't give it much credence.
Geez, you sound so definitive.<eos> Yep.<eos> So, I'll hear from you on the baseball commissioner job?<eos> Celeste, no.<eos> I didn't like this life, not even when I was living it.
A Bear Claw?<eos> Awesome!<eos> I'll sit anywhere you want.<eos> My life is not where I want it to be.<eos> That $1.47 tip was a wake-up call reminding me that life will always undervalue you if you let it.
Indeed.<eos> Deputy, why don't you make yourself useful and help with crowd control?<eos> People of Storybrooke, don't be alarmed.<eos> We've always known this area was honeycombed with old mining tunnels, but fear not.<eos> I'm going to undertake a project to make this area safe, to rehabilitate it into city use.
I'm a damn good salesman.<eos> - What exactly are you doing here?<eos> - Your boat was stolen today.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I let Victor Shetland and Darren Riggs use it.
Every Al Qaeda cell watching this tonight will be going, "Right!"<eos> - "Where's the nearest tower block?" - Running around with nitrogen!<eos> I remember a chemistry lesson, one of the most beautiful things I'd seen.<eos> Chemistry master came in, someone had prepared some liquid nitrogen - we didn't quite know what it was - and he came in with a rose he'd just picked from the garden.<eos> He dipped the rose in for a second and then smashed it on the table, and it shattered like glass into a thousand pieces.
- If I do die, will you call me a hero?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - But whilst I'm still alive, I'm a coward.<eos> - That's the way these things work, I'm afraid.<eos> You get the glory when you're not around to appreciate it.
So score one for the single fathers of the world.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You do realize that technically it's not your dog to give away?<eos> Ah, the dog needed a home;<eos> I found it a home.
It makes us laugh, it makes us cry, and it inspires us.<eos> To be or not to be...<eos> When language reaches its highest state, we give it a name that's terrifying and irritating to some - literature.<eos> In this form, it gives us voice, personality and history.<eos> All literature does, really, is tell our story and how to do it justice in one hour?
- No.<eos> Fresh wound.<eos> Can't talk yet.<eos> Fine. We'll put a cork in it.<eos> Let it scab, Jay.
Fresh wound.<eos> Can't talk yet.<eos> Fine. We'll put a cork in it.<eos> Let it scab, Jay.<eos> Let it scab.
That's up to you.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We gonna whittle? We gonna get bunk beds?<eos> Want a water?<eos> I've always had this anger inside and now I feel like I have a place to put it.
There's some... guys are picking on a girl in school, I try to stop it.<eos> I get in trouble.<eos> What does my dad do?<eos> He takes my favorite toy.<eos> And he rips the head off of it, right in front of me.
You got corn in your ears, mate?<eos> You don`t pay the mortgage, you don`t own the land!<eos> -That`s basic real estate law, my friend.<eos> -Quid pro quo!<eos> If I see your face in this town again, l`m gonna slice it off and use it to wipe my unmentionables.
They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.<eos> - Another crash!<eos> - It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.<eos> Embrace your inner lemon.<eos> Let it drive you.
Okay, I got Post-its, cinnamon Tic Tacs...<eos> It's silver, curved and has a light on it.<eos> Got it. Come on.<eos> There's definitely something in her throat. Hold her jaw open.<eos> I'm putting my hand in. It's stuck.
How do you know that we haven't got it?<eos> We've been outside.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> That fucker doesn't hang around.<eos> - You breathe it in, you cough it out.
Rain...<eos> What rain?<eos> It's death weeping for you.<eos> The wheat is drying outside...<eos> Don't let it get soaked.
Well in that case I must tell you that we work only to appointment.<eos> Fannie has broken her ankle. I was hoping to persuade you to treat it?<eos> I'll have the fish n chips.<eos> That's the rum talking.<eos> It's all I had to ease the pain.
It's not so bad.<eos> Try it.<eos> It's a car accident.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> You wanna give it a shot?
Oh, Axl. What's going on with Axl?<eos> Oh. Well, prom's coming up.<eos> It's a funny story about prom.<eos> (Mike chuckles)<eos> So he asked a girl by text, but it was the wrong girl, and now he doesn't want to take her.
To cry into? Mmm.<eos> 'Cause they were so sad the pharaoh was gone.<eos> Oh, I'm thinking they were crying because they were slaves and they're being buried alive.<eos> Angela saw it right here in the gift shop.<eos> She thought it was so cool.
And this just in: she cheated on you.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Look, I know you're as dumb as a bag of wet hair, but you know in your heart she's lying.<eos> That gumball story was insane.<eos> You're choosing to believe it so you can still be with her.
I'm really glad you guys are back.<eos> But I think I'm gonna have to call Dr. Emil to take a look at that.<eos> Clark, those Omegas that we saw at the gate -- seems like the darkness is everywhere.<eos> What if it comes back?<eos> We'll fight it.
- Bye, thanks, Mum.<eos> Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland.<eos> We are in Tooting.<eos> I am here because my country needs me.<eos> And because it needs you, too.
In any case, she quit.<eos> That's great. My only contact at Conde Nast has been replaced by a stapler stealer.<eos> And I will staple whatever's in your sweaty hand to your jeans if you don't leave this instant.<eos> What's in my hand is an article.<eos> Epperly said she'd get it to "Details."
And all of a sudden, he drops dead.<eos> That's it.<eos> You know...<eos> People talk about "closure," but I don't buy it.<eos> When somebody blasts a hole in your life... It tends to stay open.
I mean, I am so amazing.<eos> But I'm not perfect.<eos> You are.<eos> Give me that power.<eos> So I can abuse it.
You can never escape me.<eos> Nothing harms me.<eos> But I know pain.<eos> I know pain.<eos> Sometime I share it with someone like you.
His face...<eos> His eyes were different.<eos> He came after me with a pickax.<eos> And we fought.<eos> And he ran it through my leg.
Well, see uh, I can only guess that the pervasive anti-vampire hatred that has persisted since the heinous crime perpetrated by Russell Edgington had something to do with it.<eos> Mmm.<eos> And that hate is a powerful force, but hate never wins out.<eos> Not in the long run.<eos> And we will never succumb to it.
How far are you with that creature?<eos> Abby? (SHRIEKING)<eos> There's a second creature down here.<eos> It's been affected by the acid.<eos> It seems in a lot of pain.
I might hang me leathers up. You never know.<eos> have had our down times and I haven't tried to hide anything from them. You know, we've done our crying together<eos> And then, "OK, what are we gonna do now?"<eos> Get over it, move on.<eos> I think the point of life is to enjoy it.
- For the tenth time, I don't need it.<eos> - I know where Oak Park is.<eos> - Carlos, I'm starving!<eos> I will not think you're weak if you use a navigation system!<eos> Fine. I'll use it.
Am I, father?<eos> Vanity, however, is getting the better of you.<eos> How so?<eos> You have done what is forbidden.<eos> You've chosen the dark side and allowed it to feed your anger and desire for power.
- No, you'll be trapped.<eos> - cho: captain, we'll find another way.<eos> - You will do as you're ordered, Doctor.<eos> You too, Mr. Borges.<eos> Send this thing back to hell where it belongs.
I think it might be broken.<eos> It could just be a fracture.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> If this thing wanted to kill us, we'd be dead already, so I .. I figure that's a good thing, right?<eos> It wants us alive.
Well, actually, I can speak six different languages, so McNair can just... piss off.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You know, I thought we'd stay for a while.<eos> Really?<eos> The leg is pretty painful,to be honest, and you said I should rest it.
Anne's a civilian, and we don't want lose our doctor.<eos> As for you, you got your team taken hostage.<eos> We almost lost our best weapon and a lot of our food.<eos> And we almost lost them to a bunch of criminals with A.K.s and road flares.<eos> This time, it worked out, but there's a reason we have a chain of command, and you better damn well make sure people follow it.
Where'd he go?<eos> Where'd who go; who is this guy?<eos> I got to find Michelle.<eos> Are you sure this wasn't another pink balloon.<eos> He's got a rifle, he's going to use it.
That's the spirit of the shokunin.<eos> When to quit?<eos> The job that you've worked so hard for?<eos> I've never once hated this job.<eos> I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it.
Only if you'll be my Mrs. Wellington.<eos> All right.<eos> Your wallet, please.<eos> Marriage is based on trust.<eos> Trust that I have my baton, and I really do love to hit people with it.
It's a game of cat and mouse.<eos> Blais tries to entice the shark close enough to slip a noose around its neck but one false move and it's game over.<eos> Finally it takes the bait.<eos> Slowly he prepares the noose.<eos> Blais can't keep hold of the thrashing shark, but this wooden float prevents it diving.
Deal's a deal.<eos> Show time!<eos> Ajeet?<eos> Love is like a bird.<eos> Let it soar.
Show time!<eos> Ajeet?<eos> Love is like a bird.<eos> Let it soar.<eos> Let it land in your heart.
Well, at least now when you hit 55, you'll be able to do it in style.<eos> Leave the gun at Khokar's feet.<eos> Then come back here and get in the car.<eos> Why?<eos> It doesn't belong here.
I am so sorry.<eos> Actually, Bates, I'm glad I've caught you.<eos> Sir Richard Carlisle telephoned me earlier.<eos> He says he's paid Mrs Bates for her story.<eos> She cannot speak of it now without risking prison.
Gimme a pound of ribeye steak.<eos> What does a cow say? -What?<eos> It says "Moo!"<eos> And then it gets its head blown off.
Why not?<eos> Because you know how you said that your body wasn't that hot earlier?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well, when you get that hot, your body tries to protect itself.<eos> So your skin starts to collect sweat and other stuff that insulates it.
We get Travis Marshall, you got it?<eos> I made sure the slice of life was in the video I sent Travis.<eos> He'll be expecting to find me on my boat.<eos> Not this one.<eos> The owners use it twice a year, but I only need it once... for Travis' final tableau.
When was the last time you saw it?<eos> Yesterday... in-in Renny's trailer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Could he have, uh, could he have loaned it to anybody?<eos> That lighter was worth a lot of money, and Renny cherished it.
That's a couple blocks away.<eos> We're on the way.<eos> Okay, I'll see if I can stall him for you.<eos> Now you might want to try checking the magnetic strip.<eos> Maybe clean it.
You got another envelope?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Found this medal inside.<eos> It's called the Order of the Rising Sun.<eos> It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.
- Shoot.<eos> Why?<eos> What's up, pal?<eos> I'm going over to a friend's house where I may have to use this thing.<eos> I only used it once, and that was to take a torte out of the oven.
You know what, Kristen?<eos> Ah, yeah, that's it, get mad.<eos> You got something to say, Ryan?<eos> That was pathetic.<eos> You just grabbed your ankles and took it.
It's state-of-the-art, but give me a couple hours.<eos> I can write an algorithm that can bypass the signal traps.<eos> The alarm system won't be a problem.<eos> How's that?<eos> Because we're not gonna set it off.
And what did happen?<eos> They formed a... A kind of a... A subconscious consensus.<eos> Out of these kinds of ideas came what was called the Californian ideology.<eos> It was an odd fusion of radical individualism and utopian theories about computer systems, and an international priesthood rose up to promote it.<eos> What united them was was a vision that the world was now one interconnected system, that nation states were irrelevant and politicians should not try and control the system, they should let it free to create a new kind of democracy.
Reggie.<eos> It's all right, it's me.<eos> Come on, we've got to go.<eos> Where's that rental car?<eos> Back where it belongs.
We make an observation suggesting one thing and then it's immediately contradicted by something else.<eos> It takes time to come up with scientific proof.<eos> You can't just throw a paddy and expect results,<eos> Hale - you have to learn some patience.<eos> All right, let's just assume for one moment it was cholera that killed her and Tess has it too.

Where's Leo?<eos> He's in the waiting area.<eos> We got a man out front playing janitor keeping an eye on him, and we got the other place locked down.<eos> Your mission, Myka.<eos> How do you wanna play it?

What do you weigh?<eos> Morning.<eos> Dear God, Mike. You were dull before.<eos> Tony, what do you think ofthis room?<eos> It needs colour.
It's the karma for what you did in your other lives.<eos> We went through the whole class without agreeing about why kids have to die...<eos> Felix repeated again and again that we're already prefect, too good for this earth, that's why we have to go so soon.<eos> When a Hindu dies, the family lights a candle beside the corpse.<eos> That's because Hindus believe the soul is all confused when it leaves the body, and the candle gives it somewhere to live.
Well, vigorous surface activity, strong stellar winds, bipolar outflow.<eos> It's brand-new, all right.<eos> It's straight out of t... tauri phase.<eos> Which would still make it like, what, a hundred million years old?<eos> It's 200 million.
Telling Destiny to go back and pick them up isn't going to work.<eos> How do you know? Because I've already tried it!<eos> I'm done.<eos> The stargate aboard this ship is much more primitive than the later models found in the milky way.<eos> As you can see from this map, each time Destiny stops, It's in range of only a small group of gates.
Nothing.<eos> So, we're on?<eos> Yeah, we're on.<eos> Call me James.<eos> If you're gonna do role play, you have to do it completely.
If you're gonna do role play, you have to do it completely.
Is that even a word-- achievable?<eos> Achievatate?<eos> Achievalize?<eos> Okay, you just said, like, ten offensive things.<eos> Jessie pushed Rachel to find out who her mom was, and it turns out it's Shelby Corcoran, the coach of Vocal Adrenaline. I want a look that's so optimistic, it could cure cancer.
and now... I need to stand all day long!<eos> Just like a coolie.<eos> odd jobs<eos> It will be ok, I'll press harder<eos> Your technique is unique, where did you learn it?
Quite gifted, if I remember correctly.<eos> What did you do to your hand?<eos> I...<eos> I injured it.<eos> I wasn't supposed to use it, but I had a sculpture I had to finish for today, so...
Yes.<eos> There's a fragment tied to the left second premolar.<eos> She was hiding the card.<eos> It's an old prison trick.<eos> She tied one end of the floss to her tooth, the other end to the memory card, so if she needed it, she could use the floss to pull it up.
Any of these work back here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The disruptor there from Gamma-Gamma Six.<eos> Why isn't this solar system working?<eos> 'Cause it's 60 years old.
- So now you're a doctor.<eos> - What are you mad at me for?<eos> I'm late.<eos> Let nature take its course.<eos> Help it along if you can.
Someone was orchestrating this, Purposely getting the kids to choke themselves.<eos> Make sure you close the door.<eos> Tomorrow's the big night. We're all gonna play the game.<eos> There's a whole subculture around this game.<eos> They make up names for it, they do it at parties.
Then why don't I have any Wizard powers?<eos> But you do.<eos> Lift that urn with your mind.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Command it to rise, Wizard.
I don't like that memo anymore either.<eos> Way too many people are having fun with my name.<eos> I'm surprised it took this memo to get that train out of the station.<eos> Look, I've had several complaints, but the company is not going to admit it made a mistake.<eos> What if it didn't have to admit it made a mistake?
No sign of the head.<eos> I got some blowflies over here.<eos> Now, this looks like murder to me.<eos> We found black and red enamel paint traces In the concrete near the practice tee, Consistent with a fuschida driver head.<eos> We believe that the club broke in the course of a struggle, And that it was used as a weapon to kill russell huntley.
It became clear that U.S. Intelligence Had failed to anticipate the level of Japanese resistance.<eos> Looming behind the airfield Were high coral ridges that spanned the island.<eos> The Japanese had created an elaborate system Of underground fortresses.<eos> Intelligence didn't have a clue What we were going into.<eos> If the intelligence had been what it should have been, I don't think we'd have ever hit that island.
I know it is, whoa, whoa. But you need to take care of this for them.<eos> We should let niki die?<eos> No, you should let one of them live.<eos> You should give the cord blood to niki because she's weak<eos> And she needs it.
I'm the Gypsy!<eos> All this upset and bother, no wonder you ain't feeling yourself, my poor sweetheart.<eos> Twister!<eos> You were right, what you said about the song.<eos> I sung up trouble and I'm going to lay it to rest.
Because. Amy. this is important. the forest is full of Angels.<eos> You're going to have to walk like you can see.<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> Look. just keep moving.<eos> That time energy. What's it going to do?
Van Nuys, California.<eos> Where's the beautiful room?<eos> In there.<eos> The beautiful room is in an abandoned muffler factory in Van Nuys, California?<eos> Where'd you think it was?
The captain said you transferred in from New Jersey six months ago, so your eye's still fresh.<eos> You know, I appreciate it, but my psych eval's not for six weeks.<eos> Fold-out bed, no ring on your finger.<eos> You obviously moved here to be close to your daughter.<eos> Which means in between visits, all you got is your job and you take pride in it.
Ah. Mr. Danvary.<eos> Please, call me george.<eos> George, thank you again for your remarkable donation.<eos> Oh, well, I know how important Fancelli's work is to italian sculpture.<eos> I couldn't just let it sit around in my family's attic, collecting dust.
A door.<eos> Why not a door?<eos> Sometimes you get fixated on something and you might not even get why.<eos> You open yourself up and go with the flow wherever the universe takes you.<eos> Okay, so the universe took her to a door. And she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it 20 times until it was perfect.
It might... stir their conscience for a while.<eos> But their actions will remain the same.<eos> Swallow your pride, Bessie.<eos> Hold your tongue.<eos> Take the injustice and don't let it taint your love for that little one, one ounce.
I ran.<eos> Let me go! Come on.<eos> I'm just the pilot!<eos> That man, for instance, is here for a purpose.<eos> And now he has served it.
You don't have a dog.<eos> Ah. ( Laughs ) Hey, remember. My dad doesn't want S-11 harmed, all right?<eos> And we always do what daddy says, don't we?<eos> Relax, I've got 300 thousand reasons to bring that thing back in one piece.<eos> We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works.
We're getting more reports about this half shark, half octopus creature that's terrorizing the coast.<eos> But please do not panic.<eos> There is a way we can stop this thing.<eos> Virgin sacrifices.<eos> Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me, the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin.
Just merely observing.<eos> But I do notice how quick you are to defend Fisher.<eos> Am I defending him?<eos> Oh, Ma... ..I can't sleep, I can't think, I can't put together a sentence.<eos> Every thought is followed immediately by another thought that contradicts it.
Yeah, pretty much.<eos> I'm proud of you, Penelope.<eos> Despite everything that happened, you came back... And you got the job done.<eos> The sight of blood used to make me run away.<eos> And two nights ago I ran towards it.
There already is an explanation if the papers are to be believed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some babies are just born evil.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> You're a critic of the system you work in, George, but you belong to it in the end.
Why make our job any easier?<eos> But online, he goes by "Dreamweaver."<eos> And he's cute.<eos> Plus, he told me my picture made me look like trouble.<eos> Yeah, I'll pass it along.
Looking beyond what our eyes can usually see into the realms of the invisible reveals it's the precise control of heat that allows a bee colony to be such a unique and successful form of organisation.<eos> But what exactly is all this heat for?<eos> Well, look closely and the infrared camera reveals how heat is concentrated in one central area, the brood nest at the heart of the hive where young bee pupae are growing.<eos> This bee might seem relatively still, but seen in infrared it's bright orange, revealing its role as a specialist heater bee.<eos> The bee warms itself up by vibrating its flight muscles, vibrations that allow it to reach up to 44 degrees centigrade, previously thought to be high enough to kill it.
So, even on the upstroke, the smoke is still pulled downwards, giving her double the amount of lift.<eos> And you don't get that with an aeroplane.<eos> By looking into the invisible world of high-speed, human engineers are discovering a range of animal secrets they can use to develop even better flying machines.<eos> So, why do we miss so much of what's around us, when it's perfectly obvious to other creatures?<eos> A fly, for example, can see 100 images a second, allowing it to zoom around at top speed and not crash into things.
Right, well, we have a problem we need to talk about.<eos> - What problem?<eos> - Al Parker's case against you.<eos> - The civil case.<eos> - It's not going ahead?
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
I am now acting governor of Fortitude.<eos> Eric.<eos> Eric, I need you to focus now.<eos> The town has been through terrible things.<eos> It needs to get back to normal.
- ... to my sources... - Give me the names.<eos> - ... such that I might continue...<eos> - Give me the names. - to serve his regime in the future...<eos> - Give me the names.<eos> - ... as I have served it every day... - Give me the names.
Boston?<eos> Fools.<eos> You're all fools if you think this road leads to where he says it does.<eos> I have not proven to you my commitment to our common cause?<eos> What happens when our enemy realizes that all it needs to do to defeat us is to take away that common cause?
- She disappeared in the chaos.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> She went through all that effort to get you infected with the virus and she just bolts?<eos> She saw I was fighting it.<eos> She's waiting for me to give over to it.
A mob of infected swarmed the clock tower.<eos> - She disappeared in the chaos. - I don't get it.<eos> She went through all that effort to get you infected with the virus and she just bolts?<eos> She saw I was fighting it.<eos> She's waiting for me to give over to it.
I also have something for my youngest.<eos> That little podcast you did the other day... it moved me.<eos> You mean my live stream?<eos> Whatever, um...<eos> It let me know that you have reached a level of maturity.
I love you.<eos> Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> You know this world, this sad, doomed little world, it needs you.<eos> It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die.
And that was the last time you saw her?<eos> No.<eos> Her body was... right there. Sorry.<eos> His story makes sense.<eos> It's believable.
He knows I asked you.<eos> And he knows you said no.<eos> Well, as I said, I'm saying yes now.<eos> You can take it -- as soon as it's born.<eos> We'll give it everything, Marnie.
Well, not technically yours because you stole it like a bunch of hooligans.<eos> Okay. It's been fun.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your timing is good on the lifts.<eos> You know how to take a wallet out of bed and put it on its feet.
Maybe sort of an Achilles' heel type of thing.<eos> Specifically for Zerstoerer?<eos> No, it's more generically in reference to unstoppable evils...<eos> Zerstoerer-like dark forces of the universe that precipitate apocalyptic events.<eos> "When the beast appears invincible "and death the only fate to those who fight it, "only the Strength of One's Blood
Can I be uncharacteristically blunt with you?<eos> - I can't imagine what that... - The poison?<eos> It did not engorge only his face, if you know what I mean.<eos> - I think I do.<eos> - It also engorged his penis and made it very unusual texture of sea cucumber, - so it's great for vaginal orgasms. - Okay, Minna.
Um, who did he call?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> If Mr. Bloom was walking around with his son's cell...<eos> He could've opened the app, found the new user name and password, and called someone with it from the restaurant land line.
That was before I realized that it was nothing but sassy remarks.<eos> I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> If you're gonna get this worked up, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> What if I could make it more like you?<eos> I might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart. You really think we could do that?
Thank you for your candor.<eos> Well, the boy stopped seizing, but he's got cerebral edema.<eos> Rick.<eos> That's his name.<eos> Hopefully mannitol will bring it down.
This is an advisory conversation, not "Loveline."<eos> Then you should think about yourself and the ways in which you could contribute, given more influence, more control, more access to decision making.<eos> You're right.<eos> Rhoades won't make you head of Crim, but his successor may.<eos> Whoever gets it will need a deputy.
We'll, uh... We'll build from there.<eos> I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.
I never had Father Novak down as a killer.<eos> Well... he was always willing to stand up for my honour.<eos> He thought I regretted my affair with Lucia.<eos> But you didn't?<eos> I ended it because of her sadism.
So I looked up that "Finobacci" thing in the Encyclopedia Britannica.<eos> Here's what I don't get.<eos> The flowers, how do they know the math?<eos> I mean, does a flower realize it's supposed to have a certain number of petals?<eos> And why the heck does it care, anyway?
You look awfully pleased for a man who just got kicked in the kidneys.<eos> What on Earth were you...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The tracking device.<eos> - I slipped it in his pocket.
Of course, that does mean the GS F isn't very kind to animals. And that's a bad thing, make no mistake.<eos> But on the upside, listen to the noise it makes!<eos> At medium revs, it sounds baleful, like a... lonely dog.<eos> But when you build the revs up, it sounds like what it is: a normally aspirated five-litre V8.<eos> It doesn't produce anything like the power or the torque you get from its turbocharged German rivals, but for sheer excitement...
Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.<eos> It's what makes you faster, stronger, smarter.<eos> As long as you control it instead of letting it control you.
And I take responsibility. I do.<eos> But I need your support.<eos> You know, if this gets out, people will panic, and I need everybody to remain calm while we get through this, okay?<eos> The Light has a plan.<eos> If we open ourselves to it...
And that's a threat I cannot tolerate.<eos> And once again, we're at an impasse.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> Our world is at a tipping point.<eos> A war is the last thing it can endure.
That there's somewhere to get with you.<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> I'm talking about Alex.<eos> Karev is pissed because I'm giving a really sick baby a chance at a miracle.<eos> He's giving it a Band-Aid.
It's funny, is not it?<eos> You leave and I stay alone with the Malotru case on top.<eos> Surely it will take advantage of the death of Shahanah... to prohibit new initiatives.<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> If you were still in charge of the case, you would be able to face it. I do not know how.
Right, well, we have a problem we need to talk about.<eos> - What problem?<eos> - Al Parker's case against you.<eos> - The civil case.<eos> - It's not going ahead?

-Across the board!<eos> It's four!<eos> -Abby, Abby...<eos> We all believe in the scientific method.<eos> I've dedicated my life to it.
I almost...<eos> I almost think it was some kind of... Man-cub.<eos> Mowgli belongs to my pack, Shere Khan.<eos> Mowgli?<eos> They've given it a name.
- Tastes like rubber.<eos> - No, it doesn't!<eos> It's nice, but what I think is that if you're gonna eat tofu why pretend it's turkey, or burgers or whatever?<eos> It's like giving tofu an inferiority complex.<eos> Let it be who it wants to be.
Thank you.<eos> God is in our wine.<eos> It can do you no harm.<eos> Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol.<eos> It's against his religion.
He isn't going to stay here forever.<eos> And out there he needs you.<eos> Alliser: It's time, Ser Davos.<eos> Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace.<eos> We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.
My mother's parents threw her out.<eos> She did anything she could to feed me, to try and get me shoes to wear.<eos> I didn't see how that broke her.<eos> But I wish, oh, I wish so much she were here now so I could put my arms round her, tell her she's good and strong, and the bravest woman I ever knew.<eos> Shame will keep us in all kinds of prisons if we let it.
I'm not saying anything.<eos> Look, punk, there are two ways we can do this... the easy way or the hard way.<eos> Tell him what the hard way is, boss.<eos> Well, first, Steven, we're gonna fill out form 38E-J1, stating noncompliance.<eos> We send it to the DA, but do they process it right away?
Kill shelter?<eos> What's that mean?<eos> Jesus, you're the most clueless pet owner I've ever known.<eos> No wonder the fucking thing ran away.<eos> - Did you remember to give it a thing called "cat food"?
What did he charge?<eos> Ten dollars for a 10 milligram.<eos> You know where he got them?<eos> I think he had a prescription.<eos> You know what he paid to have it filled?
Otter Banks?<eos> Ten years ago, maybe yet.<eos> Shit. My brother was still alive.<eos> You know what I love about the ocean?<eos> I love how it doesn't give a flying fuck about you.
Who will speak for him?<eos> I will. But there must be others.<eos> And plenty of them.<eos> The Crown will already have assembled its case.<eos> And no doubt there'll be plenty who'll be glad to help it.
- Yeah, I can feel it.<eos> - It's right in front of your foot.<eos> - It's coming, it's coming.<eos> - OK.<eos> Just don't let it drop.
Yelling won't make it work, Chief Sousa.<eos> Where'd Agent Carter go?<eos> And what's the target range?<eos> Well, Sousa was a half mile away the rift when he hit it.<eos> Only limitation is it needs a new charge after each use.
I deserve this, Martha.<eos> And you gotta stop hitting on me.<eos> Well, let's find you a room, a lot has changed since you lived here.<eos> A lot.<eos> Oh, this plant is out of control, isn't it?
But Lucy?<eos> This was her escape route.<eos> Choo! That's quite compelling.<eos> I'm just confused about one thing.<eos> If a ghost can pass through the wall, why does it need a passageway at all?
It's that you think too little.<eos> You're afraid that if there's something more, you won't be worthy of it.<eos> Why?<eos> How are you supposed to stop a ghost?<eos> You find out what it wants.
I've lost count of the amount of times you've been there for me.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> I think you're far more affected by this world than you care to admit.<eos> You want to control it rather than allow it to control you.
The only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness, and I don't want to be that type of person anymore.<eos> I'm running for mayor.<eos> And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city.<eos> You're all fretting about this city dying.<eos> I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
Truth be told, it's not dissimilar to the plan I had for the Glades once upon a time, but on a much, much larger scale.<eos> Let me guess-- you don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane?<eos> The world is what's insane.<eos> It is beyond saving.<eos> It needs a do-over, a reset.
It is already a beacon drawing your enemies to you.<eos> Perhaps the best solution is obvious.<eos> Entrust it to the one who loves each of you most.<eos> I can cloak myself.<eos> If it has to exist, at least I can take it far away.
- You killed him!<eos> -I saw him in his coffin...<eos> -Please remove that young man now.<eos> He was my dad, and now he's gone!<eos> I'm now instructing each and every one of you to disregard that outburst and to not let it influence your opinions on this case.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
But I knew enough to stare back.<eos> On our first date he found out I was scared of the woods.<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - He thought so, too.<eos> So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it."
We're organizing.<eos> - I take it you haven't told him yet.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> He was supposed to go on his tour two days ago, but he postponed.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - ‭I'll do it.
Phone-walking was invented in 1984 by a Japanese neurologist.<eos> A practical solution, young lady.<eos> For shy men.<eos> How's your cat?<eos> Do you give it magnesium?
You know what, Lydia?<eos> You're no better than Valentine.<eos> But at least he had the guts to tell Downworlders to their faces he wanted them all dead.<eos> You... hide behind the Law.<eos> I don't hide behind it, Isabelle. I simply follow it.
Leave at once or I will have you escorted from the area by the police!<eos> I do take your points.<eos> But I cannot countenance any further involvement from Mr Carter.<eos> As I understand it, Mr Lacau, while we speak, the coffin remains open to the air. The contents are inevitably deteriorating.<eos> It is the discovery of our age and you are allowing it to fall the pieces.
I'd say, "quit being a baby."<eos> Stop thinking about yourself<eos> "and pick up the phone and do what is best for your client."<eos> Excellent Olivia pope advice.<eos> Then why don't I seem to be able to take it?
He should be upstairs.<eos> He wants to be useful, stay busy.<eos> So...<eos> Qué pasó?<eos> So his mind doesn't go places it shouldn't.
- No, he's not staying.<eos> Enzo, get down too.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Marie, you know a baby needs its mother.<eos> It needs its father, too.
Yes, you did.<eos> Yes, you did. - But...<eos> But you were right.<eos> This town is in trouble.<eos> It needs help.

Please tell me you've had enough analysis to know that she's right.<eos> You were afraid of me.<eos> Now you're afraid of Non.<eos> I understand that fear.<eos> But we cannot let it drive our actions.
This one isn't.<eos> So the deceased was stood in a puddle - when he went to make his speech.<eos> - And the bride wasn't.<eos> But sir, have a look at this.<eos> The wire has been stripped bare, allowing it to make contact with the assembly and electrifying it.
Which is probably why that movie sucks.<eos> Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.<eos> Miss, I'm so sorry.<eos> How can you not like that movie?<eos> I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
Oh, no.<eos> No, it's over.<eos> Who are you trying to fool?<eos> Me or yourself?<eos> The heart wants what it wants.
It's found mainly on construction sites.<eos> Nolan renovating his kitchen?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> See, modern day granite is treated with a polyurethane water sealant, but this was sealant free, meaning that it's old.<eos> Like, at least a hundred years old, back when it was the primary building block of tombstones.
Langner:<eos> The next very big surprise came when it infected our lab system.<eos> We figured out that the malware was probing for controllers.<eos> It was quite picky on its targets.<eos> It didn't try to manipulate any given controller in a network that it would see.
I just think that we should....<eos> Aria, stop.<eos> Drink your mimosa.<eos> How do we get the phone?<eos> I can try to ping it.
- Perhaps...<eos> - Because... for argument's sake, and I'm just pulling a number out of the thin air here, you understand...<eos> Of course.<eos> .. a reduction of 57 charges clearly wouldn't work for Edgar.<eos> The secret of good pate is to force-feed the goose before you kill it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I feel like we should say something to each other.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> It's us against the world.<eos> The world won't know what hit it.
You were right.<eos> The animal who wants to watch the world burn... that is who you are.<eos> Your point?<eos> Don't deny the animal.<eos> But don't let it control you either.
Actually, there's three of us.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> My name is Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> Okay.<eos> New suit's good, but I think it needs those modifications Cisco mentioned.
- They were already in beta with it when we acquired them.<eos> It's basically ready to go.<eos> Because they yanked it off the shelf.<eos> It's boilerplate code supplied by the credit card company.<eos> They just gave it a little shine job.
Chris Petronelli.<eos> He was holding a gun in his right hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And Chris is a lefty.<eos> So someone planted it.
We'll get worse.<eos> Look...<eos> What's he got?<eos> It's called beriberi.<eos> The body becomes malnourished, it lacks minerals...
"He is the great prince of hell.<eos> He will fool you with good familiar spirits And use them to betray you."<eos> Heelan, Damon -- they failed.<eos> But that demon still wants to come back.<eos> And Holyoke will do anything in his power to help awaken it.
Ah. Allow me to show you.<eos> Right over here.<eos> This serum, once perfected, will be capable of separating a man's personality in two and dividing the higher, more noble aspects of his nature from the primitive beast of which every man is born.<eos> Intriguing.<eos> Imagine if man were in control of the beast within, rather than slave to it.
The medical college is keeping Miss James from you again today?<eos> Yes, and it's rather lonely without her.<eos> But I have been able to confirm that Mr. Fellowes did indeed die from cyanide.<eos> - As you initially suspected.<eos> - Yes, but he doesn't appear to have ingested it and I found no other indication of how it was administered.
But it feels a hell of a lot faster than that.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The other thing you get for your money is a squadron of mechanics.<eos> But sadly... not a handbrake.<eos> Right, what I've done now is I've taken... yes... I've taken the steering wheel off, so I can't put it in gear to stop it rolling away.
What about a timing device?<eos> Where's the timing device, Casey?<eos> No one found anything.<eos> We both know that fire didn't start itself.<eos> Why don't you just give it a rest?
So, what, uh... what'd you keep in the basement, Johnny?<eos> This is what our perp was after--<eos> Johnny K's secret stash.<eos> A small arsenal of very expensive weapons, many of which are illegal to possess in the state of Hawaii.<eos> So this bird jacks a bulldozer from a construction site, and he tricks it out into some kind of bullet-proof battering ram, knocks down the wall of the place, during business hours, when he's pretty sure the vault's gonna be open.
-Across the board!<eos> It's four!<eos> -Abby, Abby...<eos> We all believe in the scientific method.<eos> I've dedicated my life to it.

Who will speak for him?<eos> I will. But there must be others.<eos> And plenty of them.<eos> The Crown will already have assembled its case.<eos> And no doubt there'll be plenty who'll be glad to help it.

But Lucy?<eos> This was her escape route.<eos> Choo! That's quite compelling.<eos> I'm just confused about one thing.<eos> If a ghost can pass through the wall, why does it need a passageway at all?
It's that you think too little.<eos> You're afraid that if there's something more, you won't be worthy of it.<eos> Why?<eos> How are you supposed to stop a ghost?<eos> You find out what it wants.
I've lost count of the amount of times you've been there for me.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> I think you're far more affected by this world than you care to admit.<eos> You want to control it rather than allow it to control you.
The only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness, and I don't want to be that type of person anymore.<eos> I'm running for mayor.<eos> And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city.<eos> You're all fretting about this city dying.<eos> I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
Truth be told, it's not dissimilar to the plan I had for the Glades once upon a time, but on a much, much larger scale.<eos> Let me guess-- you don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane?<eos> The world is what's insane.<eos> It is beyond saving.<eos> It needs a do-over, a reset.
It is already a beacon drawing your enemies to you.<eos> Perhaps the best solution is obvious.<eos> Entrust it to the one who loves each of you most.<eos> I can cloak myself.<eos> If it has to exist, at least I can take it far away.
- You killed him!<eos> -I saw him in his coffin...<eos> -Please remove that young man now.<eos> He was my dad, and now he's gone!<eos> I'm now instructing each and every one of you to disregard that outburst and to not let it influence your opinions on this case.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
But I knew enough to stare back.<eos> On our first date he found out I was scared of the woods.<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - He thought so, too.<eos> So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it."
We're organizing.<eos> - I take it you haven't told him yet.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> He was supposed to go on his tour two days ago, but he postponed.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - ‭I'll do it.
Phone-walking was invented in 1984 by a Japanese neurologist.<eos> A practical solution, young lady.<eos> For shy men.<eos> How's your cat?<eos> Do you give it magnesium?
You know what, Lydia?<eos> You're no better than Valentine.<eos> But at least he had the guts to tell Downworlders to their faces he wanted them all dead.<eos> You... hide behind the Law.<eos> I don't hide behind it, Isabelle. I simply follow it.
Leave at once or I will have you escorted from the area by the police!<eos> I do take your points.<eos> But I cannot countenance any further involvement from Mr Carter.<eos> As I understand it, Mr Lacau, while we speak, the coffin remains open to the air. The contents are inevitably deteriorating.<eos> It is the discovery of our age and you are allowing it to fall the pieces.
I'd say, "quit being a baby."<eos> Stop thinking about yourself<eos> "and pick up the phone and do what is best for your client."<eos> Excellent Olivia pope advice.<eos> Then why don't I seem to be able to take it?
He should be upstairs.<eos> He wants to be useful, stay busy.<eos> So...<eos> Qué pasó?<eos> So his mind doesn't go places it shouldn't.
- No, he's not staying.<eos> Enzo, get down too.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Marie, you know a baby needs its mother.<eos> It needs its father, too.
Yes, you did.<eos> Yes, you did. - But...<eos> But you were right.<eos> This town is in trouble.<eos> It needs help.

Please tell me you've had enough analysis to know that she's right.<eos> You were afraid of me.<eos> Now you're afraid of Non.<eos> I understand that fear.<eos> But we cannot let it drive our actions.
This one isn't.<eos> So the deceased was stood in a puddle - when he went to make his speech.<eos> - And the bride wasn't.<eos> But sir, have a look at this.<eos> The wire has been stripped bare, allowing it to make contact with the assembly and electrifying it.
Which is probably why that movie sucks.<eos> Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.<eos> Miss, I'm so sorry.<eos> How can you not like that movie?<eos> I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
Oh, no.<eos> No, it's over.<eos> Who are you trying to fool?<eos> Me or yourself?<eos> The heart wants what it wants.
It's found mainly on construction sites.<eos> Nolan renovating his kitchen?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> See, modern day granite is treated with a polyurethane water sealant, but this was sealant free, meaning that it's old.<eos> Like, at least a hundred years old, back when it was the primary building block of tombstones.
Langner:<eos> The next very big surprise came when it infected our lab system.<eos> We figured out that the malware was probing for controllers.<eos> It was quite picky on its targets.<eos> It didn't try to manipulate any given controller in a network that it would see.
I just think that we should....<eos> Aria, stop.<eos> Drink your mimosa.<eos> How do we get the phone?<eos> I can try to ping it.
- Perhaps...<eos> - Because... for argument's sake, and I'm just pulling a number out of the thin air here, you understand...<eos> Of course.<eos> .. a reduction of 57 charges clearly wouldn't work for Edgar.<eos> The secret of good pate is to force-feed the goose before you kill it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I feel like we should say something to each other.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> It's us against the world.<eos> The world won't know what hit it.
You were right.<eos> The animal who wants to watch the world burn... that is who you are.<eos> Your point?<eos> Don't deny the animal.<eos> But don't let it control you either.
Actually, there's three of us.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> My name is Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> Okay.<eos> New suit's good, but I think it needs those modifications Cisco mentioned.
- They were already in beta with it when we acquired them.<eos> It's basically ready to go.<eos> Because they yanked it off the shelf.<eos> It's boilerplate code supplied by the credit card company.<eos> They just gave it a little shine job.
Chris Petronelli.<eos> He was holding a gun in his right hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And Chris is a lefty.<eos> So someone planted it.
We'll get worse.<eos> Look...<eos> What's he got?<eos> It's called beriberi.<eos> The body becomes malnourished, it lacks minerals...
"He is the great prince of hell.<eos> He will fool you with good familiar spirits And use them to betray you."<eos> Heelan, Damon -- they failed.<eos> But that demon still wants to come back.<eos> And Holyoke will do anything in his power to help awaken it.
Ah. Allow me to show you.<eos> Right over here.<eos> This serum, once perfected, will be capable of separating a man's personality in two and dividing the higher, more noble aspects of his nature from the primitive beast of which every man is born.<eos> Intriguing.<eos> Imagine if man were in control of the beast within, rather than slave to it.
The medical college is keeping Miss James from you again today?<eos> Yes, and it's rather lonely without her.<eos> But I have been able to confirm that Mr. Fellowes did indeed die from cyanide.<eos> - As you initially suspected.<eos> - Yes, but he doesn't appear to have ingested it and I found no other indication of how it was administered.
But it feels a hell of a lot faster than that.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The other thing you get for your money is a squadron of mechanics.<eos> But sadly... not a handbrake.<eos> Right, what I've done now is I've taken... yes... I've taken the steering wheel off, so I can't put it in gear to stop it rolling away.
What about a timing device?<eos> Where's the timing device, Casey?<eos> No one found anything.<eos> We both know that fire didn't start itself.<eos> Why don't you just give it a rest?
So, what, uh... what'd you keep in the basement, Johnny?<eos> This is what our perp was after--<eos> Johnny K's secret stash.<eos> A small arsenal of very expensive weapons, many of which are illegal to possess in the state of Hawaii.<eos> So this bird jacks a bulldozer from a construction site, and he tricks it out into some kind of bullet-proof battering ram, knocks down the wall of the place, during business hours, when he's pretty sure the vault's gonna be open.
Oh, my God.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, you can't, can you?<eos> I mean, with the baby in there.<eos> I mean, you could hurt it, right?
Well, if you just let me explain... Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.<eos> The Scouts are a huge success.<eos> Ma'am, look, it won't cost you anything.<eos> A droid downstairs was written off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.<eos> Let me install this on it.
The Globe.<eos> Years ago.<eos> After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls.<eos> I had 20 Priests in Boston alone, but I couldn't go after them without the press.<eos> So I sent you guys a list of names, and you buried it.
How do you think people responded to the prospect of imminent doom?<eos> They gobbled it up, like a chocolate éclair.<eos> They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.<eos> It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies.<eos> The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.
Except CHOI, but, you know, I guess we'll just have to start without him.<eos> Um, first of all, welcome to our little reunion of sorts.<eos> You guys are all very special to Eden, which... which means you're very special to me, and we really missed you, and we love you.<eos> You know, each and every one of us is on a journey, and we feel that it's important to be on that journey with the people you love, and it's something we really, really have good here.<eos> We want to open up the house again, give it and us a new start, so...
Do you remember?<eos> Peggy comes with me.<eos> Joy spends half the time with us.<eos> We'll take her paper forest.<eos> That's Joy's special thing, and it belongs in this house.
Is it a King's dick?<eos> It's... it's slightly above average.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You gotta stake your claim, James. Yes!<eos> You gotta stake it!
Way to go, Jay.<eos> Now we have to go to school tomorrow.<eos> If someone hands you a crying baby, do you, a, curse it?<eos> B, lock it in a tower?<eos> C, give it a bottle?
So...<eos> Really?<eos> I'm sorry, your below-the-line, coupon-cutting boyfriend is gonna offer you something more interesting than a five-year deal with me?<eos> Quinn, he's a very nice guy, and he loves me.<eos> I just think I should give it a chance.
If you get a chance later, have a free moment of time, come and check out the model. It's almost to scale.<eos> If you actually could hold on that for a second, Luce?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I just got a text from Lawless, and he needs the password to the Facebook page.<eos> - What does he need it for?
'Clubland held little charm 'and he yearned for Reggie and the darker side of gangland. '<eos> As soon as you turn your fucking back, life, it just plays dirty tricks on you, you know?<eos> 'We wouldn't spend Christmas together that year.<eos> 'There was an old warrant on Reggie.<eos> 'The last six months of the sentence was on appeal, but it was denied.
The kerosene separates the drug from the leaf.<eos> Over here, the sulfuric acid distills and distills it.<eos> Then you cut it, and mix it with gasoline.<eos> Then, basically, you pull the merchandise out of the liquid.<eos> Let it dry, dry, dry.
They burned the huts on the beach and then the structures in town.<eos> When the whole of Nassau was a smoking wreck, they turned their eye inland.<eos> They raped, they murdered, they laid waste.<eos> And all because there was no fort to protect the bay.<eos> The men in charge had allowed it to fall into disrepair.
What do you think?<eos> Want to take one home?<eos> Hey, don't joke.<eos> When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup.<eos> It was, like, two months old.
We graft all our trees from the original root stalk.<eos> We call her "mother".<eos> Her?<eos> Michael discovered mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight.<eos> Only one tree survived, absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it.
I still remember how to forge your signature.<eos> Let's go meet your staff.<eos> Pawnee National Park rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss.<eos> Rangers, my name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.<eos> Your job and mine is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it.
(Andy) Oh, I've been there.<eos> That's a real tightrope walk.<eos> Oh! Hey!<eos> Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.<eos> It had black hair, but you could see through its skin, and it didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.
Nothing's worked.<eos> We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago.<eos> Raccoons ate the wheels right off it.<eos> Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and ten years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.<eos> Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name:
I-I can't.<eos> Crazy.<eos> I still can't believe you turned off the backup alarm.<eos> You're like a snooze ninja.<eos> The heart wants what it wants, and it wanted to stay in bed with you.
All right, what's next, huh?<eos> Cat and dog Warblers?<eos> I mean, the very question is risible.<eos> How about a student who's a skunk?<eos> Should it be allowed to become a Warbler?
So in order to give him a chance to get settled in, he'll join Guggenheim in the lab to search for surgical applications for the new gland extract.<eos> I wasn't aware of any new gland extract.<eos> It's an interesting substance that's been taken from the glands of several animals by a Pole named Cybulski.<eos> I have no idea what he calls it, but we're calling it adrenaline.<eos> You'll help us learn if it has any practical uses.
Were you with anyone else, any other cheerleaders, players?<eos> My boyfriend, but we left separately.<eos> That bruise on your neck.<eos> I told you... he choked me.<eos> From the color, it looks a few days old.
Come on.<eos> You helped save the world today.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about that.<eos> The meteorite, it's still out there.<eos> It's got powers we don't understand.
It's lovely.<eos> Oh, do you know?<eos> I was quite nervous because I thought, "I don't want it to be<eos> "another thing for the poltergeist to throw!"<eos> We try not to say things like that, it gives it ideas.
- Stop.<eos> - Say it now.<eos> There's a reason why we're here.<eos> - The three of us have a mission.<eos> - Say it. Don't answer, Wim.
You do yours.<eos> Find these shooters and shut this thing down.<eos> We're moving heaven and earth.<eos> You're a good ally, Justine.<eos> Which is why our business and others like it guarantee your re-election.
-Oh, good.<eos> Sam: Here's a pamphlet.<eos> In order to combat this menace, the LAPD must work with us to disrupt, ridicule, discredit at every opportunity.<eos> Eh, maybe we can tie their shoelaces together, and give them tittie twisters.<eos> Hey, cut, got a body found in a drainage ditch. Me says it's almost a month old.
Swept the BB. It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.<eos> At a minimum, she may know what our rival is making in the factory and how it's manipulating the people of Maple.
I was waiting for the L train.<eos> And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.<eos> You wanna give it to me, right?"<eos> And I said, "Yeah."<eos> And... like an asshole, I handed it over.
She's right.<eos> We have to be at our strongest to win.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Where is this shadow ops facility, anyway?<eos> Who is like the Beast, and who can fight against it?
Sergeant, I have been expecting this since the first day I met Valerie.<eos> She just... couldn't cope with life.<eos> Why did she leave you?<eos> The marriage was a failure.<eos> We'd let it drag on.
No sign of a struggle.<eos> There's a small scratch on his forehead, But it healed well before the time of death.<eos> So, how does someone asphyxiate lying in bed alone?<eos> [ sniffs ] [ sniffs ] Mercaptan.<eos> It's a compound they add to natural gas To give it that unique smell.
Which would have been a disaster, prompting Rome to unleash reinforcements that would turn the Mediterranean red with Jewish blood.<eos> I don't agree he posed the threat you believe.<eos> Which is why you will never become the high priest.<eos> The Jewish people have survived the tyranny of many empires with pragmatism and compromise.<eos> With careful helmsmanship, it will outlast the Roman occupation.
You must miss him terribly.<eos> Mrs. Strong.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Or have I perhaps offended you in some new way that I am as yet unaware of?<eos> I understand your anger, Captain, and I want to apologize for being the cause of it.
What do you think is gonna happen?<eos> Contact.<eos> A single alien from a race advanced light years beyond ours... "stealthily boards a human ship with ease.<eos> The alien makes contact.<eos> It seems hostile. But it's not after blood.
Alan York?<eos> The astronaut?<eos> One of the first men to walk on the moon.<eos> I want to eat his brain.<eos> I think he's still using it.
Not if it means being a goddamn snitch.<eos> Jesus Christ, don't be so self-righteous.<eos> At some point in our line of work, if you want to survive, this is what you do.<eos> Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
I helped you out once before.<eos> Maybe there is a way I can help you out again.<eos> At some point in our line of work, If you want to survive, - this is what you do.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
Am I that bad?<eos> We have the same dragon.<eos> Eventually you will slay it, or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.<eos> Its name is Helping Others.<eos> If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
The truth is in a moment of weakness I slept with you, and I really shouldn't have.<eos> Mike, I cannot afford to have you crossing the line.<eos> I won't.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not denying that I have a personal stake in bringing Mark in, but I will not let it interfere with the job.
Chloe!<eos> God.<eos> Chloe!<eos> Did you know that by week 16, your baby's only the size of an avocado but it can hear?<eos> It says you're supposed to, like, talk and sing to it.
But...<eos> I guess he never really believed that.<eos> 20 years later, Lucas Reem was still hurting him, still haunting him.<eos> You know... I think that your father, by chasing after those relics, in his own way was just trying to end the nightmare.<eos> But... instead, he just gave it new life.
You don't want to talk about it?<eos> What... what do you want to talk about?<eos> You want to talk about how the cop downstairs took a bullet from him?<eos> I just want to eat, okay?<eos> You want to talk about how it shattered his elbow?
I've learned from my mistakes, okay?<eos> I've been studying this virus.<eos> I think I can defang it with this.<eos> It'll run, but it won't have any teeth.<eos> Yeah, but you're defanging it by spreading it out over the city's transportation computing grid.
We must govern ourselves according to our law so that this city and its people are never again subjected to Roman justice.<eos> That's all well and good.<eos> But as far as I understand it, this Boaz surrendered of his own accord.<eos> Are these the men that claim to keep the law of Moses?<eos> You... you who have received the law through angels but have not obeyed it!
Stop.<eos> I said stop.<eos> What's the point?<eos> The world is trying to die.<eos> We're supposed to just let it.
I owed him, so I couldn't say no.<eos> Why would Jake want a gun?<eos> He said there'd been some break-ins.<eos> That he was worried for Katie.<eos> - He just wanted it for protection.
Yes.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> So, we have a change of clothes, the key to his Jeep, phone, wallet containing cards and cash.<eos> Now, according to Francis's son, his journal is missing.<eos> Apparently he relied quite heavily on it.
He's a kid.<eos> His hands are zip-tied.<eos> But he figures, what the hell, he's gonna use the sandstorm to try to escape.<eos> So I jump him.<eos> And I take my gun and I jam it in his mouth.
I did it with Juan Largo.<eos> JUAN LARGO:<eos> Why, hello there, you sexy thing.<eos> I heard about the cum fiesta.<eos> I'd like to give it a shot.
If this is true, stop persecuting us.<eos> This could be the end.<eos> This temple is not just bricks and mortar built by the hands of men.<eos> It is the house of God on earth, his home, the Holy of Holies.<eos> And it's under threat.
Whiskey?<eos> This is no time for a drink.<eos> Madam, if you cannot handle your surroundings...<eos> Alcohol is a disinfectant.<eos> It'll do him more good on the outside.
Dear Diary, in a city far from home Rachel Earl was running.<eos> Yes, that's right, running.<eos> And a running Rae Earl is not something you see very often, but this was an emergency.<eos> Even if Johnny Depp was beckoning me from the top of the hill with his penis, it would have to wait.
Almost too much.<eos> You can't love mummies too much.<eos> Okay, but we need recon.<eos> Do these villagers know about the temple?<eos> Do they worship it?
We found it in an air-conditioning unit near the bench just outside the courtroom.<eos> 'Looks to me like a 0.22 calibre.'<eos> Well done, Dwayne.<eos> ~ 'Thank you, Chief!<eos> ' ~ Have it biked to forensics and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.
You mean... this phone here?<eos> Yeah, you know, don't kid around.<eos> Just hand me the phone.<eos> No.<eos> I think it looks good right...
He had some wit to him.<eos> He's disheveled.<eos> He's been through the mill.<eos> He's been held in circumstances in which he's never been, but you have to look past that and see this lump of clay here that I'm going to have to mold.<eos> Has it got the capacity to be molded into the shape that I want it to be in by the time we get to a jury?
Stay away from David and Amanda Clarke.<eos> - Victoria's reaching out?<eos> - I won't answer.<eos> That's called survival instinct.<eos> You should follow it.
By my calculation, that thing we found floated downstream with the tides from Greenwich.<eos> A good three hours in the water. And?<eos> Well, if it was supposed to be found and interpreted as the work of the surgeons, that is leaving much to chance.<eos> Might not someone with sedition in mind take care their outrage be discovered?<eos> Rather than simply letting it drift God knows where.
So that mean you'll bring Cookie and Andre back too.<eos> That's what you're saying?<eos> Let's take it one step at a time, all right?<eos> Hakeem, you got a huge career ahead of you.<eos> Come back to Empire, we'll release your album, give it a huge push, the whole thing.
Why?<eos> Because he had the greatest scapegoat in the history of civilization.<eos> The Sudden Departure was a one-time-only event.<eos> The flood happened three years ago on October 14th, and the ark took on all the animals it needed.<eos> Why in God's name would it take on any more?
Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.<eos> And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.
Evelyn told me.<eos> - So you understand.<eos> - Of course I understand.<eos> The car is your enemy.<eos> But it's my friend, and all I ask is that you give it a second chance.
She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof.<eos> You've got to stop.<eos> Does anyone have any cologne?<eos> Gene? No.<eos> I'm not allowed to wear cologne again until I prove I can be responsible with it.
The army'll be looking under every poncho from now on.<eos> A dead security agent and a spy on the hill?<eos> Speaking of Indians, what's your girl doing to the hoover?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Praying to it.
There is no time to waste here, people.<eos> Booth done sit in this office ten years.<eos> Believe me, I wish he was here.<eos> So what was Booth doing with a gun?<eos> He didn't need it to teach at Quantico.
We're downloading what the Game Vex captured at Scott Barrett's house.<eos> We know he was playing an instructional golf video game on his Game Vex before he was attacked.<eos> Okay, there's our killer.<eos> The two are struggling over what looks like a golf club.<eos> In the struggle it looks like the golf club struck Scott's phone after it collided with his head.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?<eos> Yes.<eos> - And he owns the house. - Correct.<eos> - And they're not fucking?<eos> - Nope. So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?
I'm here for myself.<eos> Whatever you may like about me, maybe you can find it in her.<eos> But please leave me alone.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Back where it belongs.
He shouldn't have stopped that fucking fight, Jay.<eos> I wasn't there, so I can't really fucking say<eos> - what was right or not, right?<eos> - You weren't there.<eos> I was there, and I can tell you that he stopped it 'cause he never wanted me in it in the first place.
- Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself!<eos> - ...unless it's told to do something!
I'm running for mayor.<eos> Uh, don't everyone congratulate me at once.<eos> Oh, you're serious!<eos> The other week, Lance was saying that this city needs someone to stand up, who isn't hiding behind a mask.<eos> It needs a leader.
Can't that be enough?<eos> It's our first Christmas together.<eos> I've never had a happy one.<eos> I just want a quiet night with you and hope, our family, and I don't care if their house is on fire.<eos> For one night, I will let it burn.
I'm really sorry.<eos> I know I promised that we'd spend the night alone.<eos> I even had this really dumb plan that we were gonna drink hot whiskeys and watch "it's a wonderful life" together, yet here we are.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> Today, it was me that saw their house on fire and decided not to let it burn.
So, why did you do it?<eos> 'Cause I don't trust myself.<eos> 'Cause I'm weak.<eos> It's like I forget who I am.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
Don't rush.<eos> Everything around the vocal cords are trigger points for more swelling.<eos> Bump into it, the tissue's gonna balloon out, and your opening is gone.<eos> I know, I know... It's like driving a semitruck through a narrow lane of eggshells.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
Do you have any proof of that?<eos> Okay, listen. Everyone.<eos> Violence can spread like wildfire.<eos> It just takes one spark to burn down the bridges of trust between all of our fellow human beings.<eos> And once it's started, a fire doesn't care who it burns.
But you still have time to help your people.<eos> You still have great power, and I want to help you use it.<eos> Go on.<eos> All I need is your blessing.<eos> If the prime minister comes to you about a building project in the Himalayas, smile upon it.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
Nah, it's just hand stuff... It's not a big deal.<eos> Well, I mean, depending on what age you were, it's technically a little bit of statutory rape.<eos> Eh...<eos> But, you know.<eos> I'll allow it.
Where is he keeping them?<eos> In his jet-- some flying icebox that never touches down.<eos> He has a refueling tanker.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> We grounded it.
You... you're on to some other city as soon as this is over.<eos> You think that as soon as I seal the deal on these negotiations, that I'm gonna move onto someone else?<eos> You have one hell of a fucking ego.<eos> The orchestra is my family.<eos> I won't let anyone or anything hurt it.
And you're black!<eos> Out of anyone, you should get it.<eos> Unfortunately, I do get it, Miss Hapstall.<eos> But the law is the law.<eos> It's my job to uphold it, no matter my personal feelings.
Now, who wants to go see Jesus?<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> I brought your robe.<eos> I know you hate that these hospital gowns leave your ass hanging out.<eos> My ass will hang out when I say it should.
You were supposed to be getting tape, Gayle!<eos> I didn't want to make two trips!<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> He's fine in there.<eos> (Mr. Business yowls) He likes it.
- Right.<eos> It's gotten better.<eos> Google had this problem, too.<eos> Did the algorithm ever mistake a white person for an animal?<eos> Why would it do that?
No.<eos> Not so far.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why does it have trouble identifying African-Americans, but not Caucasians?<eos> I guess because we hadn't given it enough examples.
No criminal record, no enemies, as far as his friends knew, and no unusual debts.<eos> And his ex- girlfriend's alibi checked out.<eos> She was in Philadelphia all last night.<eos> Well, I hope she's not in a hurry to reclaim her truck.<eos> It's gonna need a little while to air out.
I promise I'll tell Snotlout where I hid his favorite axe.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey, Meatlug, it's trying to get out!<eos> Come on, girl, we have to close the exit.<eos> Those guys will never believe it was here if we let it get away.
Let's go help the others.<eos> Hiccup, there's too many of them!<eos> And the Flightmare really isn't helping.<eos> We'll be fine as long as we stay away from its mist.<eos> Hiccup, can't you just let it know we're the good guys?
Oh, my God.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, you can't, can you?<eos> I mean, with the baby in there.<eos> I mean, you could hurt it, right?
Well, if you just let me explain... Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.<eos> The Scouts are a huge success.<eos> Ma'am, look, it won't cost you anything.<eos> A droid downstairs was written off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.<eos> Let me install this on it.
The Globe.<eos> Years ago.<eos> After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls.<eos> I had 20 Priests in Boston alone, but I couldn't go after them without the press.<eos> So I sent you guys a list of names, and you buried it.
How do you think people responded to the prospect of imminent doom?<eos> They gobbled it up, like a chocolate éclair.<eos> They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.<eos> It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies.<eos> The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.
Except CHOI, but, you know, I guess we'll just have to start without him.<eos> Um, first of all, welcome to our little reunion of sorts.<eos> You guys are all very special to Eden, which... which means you're very special to me, and we really missed you, and we love you.<eos> You know, each and every one of us is on a journey, and we feel that it's important to be on that journey with the people you love, and it's something we really, really have good here.<eos> We want to open up the house again, give it and us a new start, so...
Do you remember?<eos> Peggy comes with me.<eos> Joy spends half the time with us.<eos> We'll take her paper forest.<eos> That's Joy's special thing, and it belongs in this house.
Is it a King's dick?<eos> It's... it's slightly above average.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You gotta stake your claim, James. Yes!<eos> You gotta stake it!
Way to go, Jay.<eos> Now we have to go to school tomorrow.<eos> If someone hands you a crying baby, do you, a, curse it?<eos> B, lock it in a tower?<eos> C, give it a bottle?
So...<eos> Really?<eos> I'm sorry, your below-the-line, coupon-cutting boyfriend is gonna offer you something more interesting than a five-year deal with me?<eos> Quinn, he's a very nice guy, and he loves me.<eos> I just think I should give it a chance.
If you get a chance later, have a free moment of time, come and check out the model. It's almost to scale.<eos> If you actually could hold on that for a second, Luce?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I just got a text from Lawless, and he needs the password to the Facebook page.<eos> - What does he need it for?
'Clubland held little charm 'and he yearned for Reggie and the darker side of gangland. '<eos> As soon as you turn your fucking back, life, it just plays dirty tricks on you, you know?<eos> 'We wouldn't spend Christmas together that year.<eos> 'There was an old warrant on Reggie.<eos> 'The last six months of the sentence was on appeal, but it was denied.
The kerosene separates the drug from the leaf.<eos> Over here, the sulfuric acid distills and distills it.<eos> Then you cut it, and mix it with gasoline.<eos> Then, basically, you pull the merchandise out of the liquid.<eos> Let it dry, dry, dry.
They burned the huts on the beach and then the structures in town.<eos> When the whole of Nassau was a smoking wreck, they turned their eye inland.<eos> They raped, they murdered, they laid waste.<eos> And all because there was no fort to protect the bay.<eos> The men in charge had allowed it to fall into disrepair.
What do you think?<eos> Want to take one home?<eos> Hey, don't joke.<eos> When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup.<eos> It was, like, two months old.
We graft all our trees from the original root stalk.<eos> We call her "mother".<eos> Her?<eos> Michael discovered mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight.<eos> Only one tree survived, absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it.
I still remember how to forge your signature.<eos> Let's go meet your staff.<eos> Pawnee National Park rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss.<eos> Rangers, my name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.<eos> Your job and mine is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it.
(Andy) Oh, I've been there.<eos> That's a real tightrope walk.<eos> Oh! Hey!<eos> Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.<eos> It had black hair, but you could see through its skin, and it didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.
Nothing's worked.<eos> We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago.<eos> Raccoons ate the wheels right off it.<eos> Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and ten years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.<eos> Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name:
I-I can't.<eos> Crazy.<eos> I still can't believe you turned off the backup alarm.<eos> You're like a snooze ninja.<eos> The heart wants what it wants, and it wanted to stay in bed with you.
All right, what's next, huh?<eos> Cat and dog Warblers?<eos> I mean, the very question is risible.<eos> How about a student who's a skunk?<eos> Should it be allowed to become a Warbler?
So in order to give him a chance to get settled in, he'll join Guggenheim in the lab to search for surgical applications for the new gland extract.<eos> I wasn't aware of any new gland extract.<eos> It's an interesting substance that's been taken from the glands of several animals by a Pole named Cybulski.<eos> I have no idea what he calls it, but we're calling it adrenaline.<eos> You'll help us learn if it has any practical uses.
Were you with anyone else, any other cheerleaders, players?<eos> My boyfriend, but we left separately.<eos> That bruise on your neck.<eos> I told you... he choked me.<eos> From the color, it looks a few days old.
Come on.<eos> You helped save the world today.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about that.<eos> The meteorite, it's still out there.<eos> It's got powers we don't understand.
It's lovely.<eos> Oh, do you know?<eos> I was quite nervous because I thought, "I don't want it to be<eos> "another thing for the poltergeist to throw!"<eos> We try not to say things like that, it gives it ideas.
- Stop.<eos> - Say it now.<eos> There's a reason why we're here.<eos> - The three of us have a mission.<eos> - Say it. Don't answer, Wim.
You do yours.<eos> Find these shooters and shut this thing down.<eos> We're moving heaven and earth.<eos> You're a good ally, Justine.<eos> Which is why our business and others like it guarantee your re-election.
-Oh, good.<eos> Sam: Here's a pamphlet.<eos> In order to combat this menace, the LAPD must work with us to disrupt, ridicule, discredit at every opportunity.<eos> Eh, maybe we can tie their shoelaces together, and give them tittie twisters.<eos> Hey, cut, got a body found in a drainage ditch. Me says it's almost a month old.
Swept the BB. It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.<eos> At a minimum, she may know what our rival is making in the factory and how it's manipulating the people of Maple.
I was waiting for the L train.<eos> And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.<eos> You wanna give it to me, right?"<eos> And I said, "Yeah."<eos> And... like an asshole, I handed it over.
She's right.<eos> We have to be at our strongest to win.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Where is this shadow ops facility, anyway?<eos> Who is like the Beast, and who can fight against it?
Sergeant, I have been expecting this since the first day I met Valerie.<eos> She just... couldn't cope with life.<eos> Why did she leave you?<eos> The marriage was a failure.<eos> We'd let it drag on.
No sign of a struggle.<eos> There's a small scratch on his forehead, But it healed well before the time of death.<eos> So, how does someone asphyxiate lying in bed alone?<eos> [ sniffs ] [ sniffs ] Mercaptan.<eos> It's a compound they add to natural gas To give it that unique smell.
Which would have been a disaster, prompting Rome to unleash reinforcements that would turn the Mediterranean red with Jewish blood.<eos> I don't agree he posed the threat you believe.<eos> Which is why you will never become the high priest.<eos> The Jewish people have survived the tyranny of many empires with pragmatism and compromise.<eos> With careful helmsmanship, it will outlast the Roman occupation.
You must miss him terribly.<eos> Mrs. Strong.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Or have I perhaps offended you in some new way that I am as yet unaware of?<eos> I understand your anger, Captain, and I want to apologize for being the cause of it.
What do you think is gonna happen?<eos> Contact.<eos> A single alien from a race advanced light years beyond ours... "stealthily boards a human ship with ease.<eos> The alien makes contact.<eos> It seems hostile. But it's not after blood.
Alan York?<eos> The astronaut?<eos> One of the first men to walk on the moon.<eos> I want to eat his brain.<eos> I think he's still using it.
Not if it means being a goddamn snitch.<eos> Jesus Christ, don't be so self-righteous.<eos> At some point in our line of work, if you want to survive, this is what you do.<eos> Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
I helped you out once before.<eos> Maybe there is a way I can help you out again.<eos> At some point in our line of work, If you want to survive, - this is what you do.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
Am I that bad?<eos> We have the same dragon.<eos> Eventually you will slay it, or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.<eos> Its name is Helping Others.<eos> If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
The truth is in a moment of weakness I slept with you, and I really shouldn't have.<eos> Mike, I cannot afford to have you crossing the line.<eos> I won't.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not denying that I have a personal stake in bringing Mark in, but I will not let it interfere with the job.
Chloe!<eos> God.<eos> Chloe!<eos> Did you know that by week 16, your baby's only the size of an avocado but it can hear?<eos> It says you're supposed to, like, talk and sing to it.
But...<eos> I guess he never really believed that.<eos> 20 years later, Lucas Reem was still hurting him, still haunting him.<eos> You know... I think that your father, by chasing after those relics, in his own way was just trying to end the nightmare.<eos> But... instead, he just gave it new life.
You don't want to talk about it?<eos> What... what do you want to talk about?<eos> You want to talk about how the cop downstairs took a bullet from him?<eos> I just want to eat, okay?<eos> You want to talk about how it shattered his elbow?
I've learned from my mistakes, okay?<eos> I've been studying this virus.<eos> I think I can defang it with this.<eos> It'll run, but it won't have any teeth.<eos> Yeah, but you're defanging it by spreading it out over the city's transportation computing grid.
We must govern ourselves according to our law so that this city and its people are never again subjected to Roman justice.<eos> That's all well and good.<eos> But as far as I understand it, this Boaz surrendered of his own accord.<eos> Are these the men that claim to keep the law of Moses?<eos> You... you who have received the law through angels but have not obeyed it!
Stop.<eos> I said stop.<eos> What's the point?<eos> The world is trying to die.<eos> We're supposed to just let it.
I owed him, so I couldn't say no.<eos> Why would Jake want a gun?<eos> He said there'd been some break-ins.<eos> That he was worried for Katie.<eos> - He just wanted it for protection.
Yes.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> So, we have a change of clothes, the key to his Jeep, phone, wallet containing cards and cash.<eos> Now, according to Francis's son, his journal is missing.<eos> Apparently he relied quite heavily on it.
He's a kid.<eos> His hands are zip-tied.<eos> But he figures, what the hell, he's gonna use the sandstorm to try to escape.<eos> So I jump him.<eos> And I take my gun and I jam it in his mouth.
I did it with Juan Largo.<eos> JUAN LARGO:<eos> Why, hello there, you sexy thing.<eos> I heard about the cum fiesta.<eos> I'd like to give it a shot.
If this is true, stop persecuting us.<eos> This could be the end.<eos> This temple is not just bricks and mortar built by the hands of men.<eos> It is the house of God on earth, his home, the Holy of Holies.<eos> And it's under threat.
Whiskey?<eos> This is no time for a drink.<eos> Madam, if you cannot handle your surroundings...<eos> Alcohol is a disinfectant.<eos> It'll do him more good on the outside.
Dear Diary, in a city far from home Rachel Earl was running.<eos> Yes, that's right, running.<eos> And a running Rae Earl is not something you see very often, but this was an emergency.<eos> Even if Johnny Depp was beckoning me from the top of the hill with his penis, it would have to wait.
Almost too much.<eos> You can't love mummies too much.<eos> Okay, but we need recon.<eos> Do these villagers know about the temple?<eos> Do they worship it?
We found it in an air-conditioning unit near the bench just outside the courtroom.<eos> 'Looks to me like a 0.22 calibre.'<eos> Well done, Dwayne.<eos> ~ 'Thank you, Chief!<eos> ' ~ Have it biked to forensics and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.
You mean... this phone here?<eos> Yeah, you know, don't kid around.<eos> Just hand me the phone.<eos> No.<eos> I think it looks good right...
He had some wit to him.<eos> He's disheveled.<eos> He's been through the mill.<eos> He's been held in circumstances in which he's never been, but you have to look past that and see this lump of clay here that I'm going to have to mold.<eos> Has it got the capacity to be molded into the shape that I want it to be in by the time we get to a jury?
Stay away from David and Amanda Clarke.<eos> - Victoria's reaching out?<eos> - I won't answer.<eos> That's called survival instinct.<eos> You should follow it.
By my calculation, that thing we found floated downstream with the tides from Greenwich.<eos> A good three hours in the water. And?<eos> Well, if it was supposed to be found and interpreted as the work of the surgeons, that is leaving much to chance.<eos> Might not someone with sedition in mind take care their outrage be discovered?<eos> Rather than simply letting it drift God knows where.
So that mean you'll bring Cookie and Andre back too.<eos> That's what you're saying?<eos> Let's take it one step at a time, all right?<eos> Hakeem, you got a huge career ahead of you.<eos> Come back to Empire, we'll release your album, give it a huge push, the whole thing.
Why?<eos> Because he had the greatest scapegoat in the history of civilization.<eos> The Sudden Departure was a one-time-only event.<eos> The flood happened three years ago on October 14th, and the ark took on all the animals it needed.<eos> Why in God's name would it take on any more?
Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.<eos> And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.
Evelyn told me.<eos> - So you understand.<eos> - Of course I understand.<eos> The car is your enemy.<eos> But it's my friend, and all I ask is that you give it a second chance.
She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof.<eos> You've got to stop.<eos> Does anyone have any cologne?<eos> Gene? No.<eos> I'm not allowed to wear cologne again until I prove I can be responsible with it.
The army'll be looking under every poncho from now on.<eos> A dead security agent and a spy on the hill?<eos> Speaking of Indians, what's your girl doing to the hoover?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Praying to it.
There is no time to waste here, people.<eos> Booth done sit in this office ten years.<eos> Believe me, I wish he was here.<eos> So what was Booth doing with a gun?<eos> He didn't need it to teach at Quantico.
We're downloading what the Game Vex captured at Scott Barrett's house.<eos> We know he was playing an instructional golf video game on his Game Vex before he was attacked.<eos> Okay, there's our killer.<eos> The two are struggling over what looks like a golf club.<eos> In the struggle it looks like the golf club struck Scott's phone after it collided with his head.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?<eos> Yes.<eos> - And he owns the house. - Correct.<eos> - And they're not fucking?<eos> - Nope. So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?
I'm here for myself.<eos> Whatever you may like about me, maybe you can find it in her.<eos> But please leave me alone.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Back where it belongs.
He shouldn't have stopped that fucking fight, Jay.<eos> I wasn't there, so I can't really fucking say<eos> - what was right or not, right?<eos> - You weren't there.<eos> I was there, and I can tell you that he stopped it 'cause he never wanted me in it in the first place.
- Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself!<eos> - ...unless it's told to do something!
I'm running for mayor.<eos> Uh, don't everyone congratulate me at once.<eos> Oh, you're serious!<eos> The other week, Lance was saying that this city needs someone to stand up, who isn't hiding behind a mask.<eos> It needs a leader.
Can't that be enough?<eos> It's our first Christmas together.<eos> I've never had a happy one.<eos> I just want a quiet night with you and hope, our family, and I don't care if their house is on fire.<eos> For one night, I will let it burn.
I'm really sorry.<eos> I know I promised that we'd spend the night alone.<eos> I even had this really dumb plan that we were gonna drink hot whiskeys and watch "it's a wonderful life" together, yet here we are.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> Today, it was me that saw their house on fire and decided not to let it burn.
So, why did you do it?<eos> 'Cause I don't trust myself.<eos> 'Cause I'm weak.<eos> It's like I forget who I am.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
Don't rush.<eos> Everything around the vocal cords are trigger points for more swelling.<eos> Bump into it, the tissue's gonna balloon out, and your opening is gone.<eos> I know, I know... It's like driving a semitruck through a narrow lane of eggshells.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
Do you have any proof of that?<eos> Okay, listen. Everyone.<eos> Violence can spread like wildfire.<eos> It just takes one spark to burn down the bridges of trust between all of our fellow human beings.<eos> And once it's started, a fire doesn't care who it burns.
But you still have time to help your people.<eos> You still have great power, and I want to help you use it.<eos> Go on.<eos> All I need is your blessing.<eos> If the prime minister comes to you about a building project in the Himalayas, smile upon it.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
Nah, it's just hand stuff... It's not a big deal.<eos> Well, I mean, depending on what age you were, it's technically a little bit of statutory rape.<eos> Eh...<eos> But, you know.<eos> I'll allow it.
Where is he keeping them?<eos> In his jet-- some flying icebox that never touches down.<eos> He has a refueling tanker.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> We grounded it.
You... you're on to some other city as soon as this is over.<eos> You think that as soon as I seal the deal on these negotiations, that I'm gonna move onto someone else?<eos> You have one hell of a fucking ego.<eos> The orchestra is my family.<eos> I won't let anyone or anything hurt it.
And you're black!<eos> Out of anyone, you should get it.<eos> Unfortunately, I do get it, Miss Hapstall.<eos> But the law is the law.<eos> It's my job to uphold it, no matter my personal feelings.
Now, who wants to go see Jesus?<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> I brought your robe.<eos> I know you hate that these hospital gowns leave your ass hanging out.<eos> My ass will hang out when I say it should.
You were supposed to be getting tape, Gayle!<eos> I didn't want to make two trips!<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> He's fine in there.<eos> (Mr. Business yowls) He likes it.
- Right.<eos> It's gotten better.<eos> Google had this problem, too.<eos> Did the algorithm ever mistake a white person for an animal?<eos> Why would it do that?
No.<eos> Not so far.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why does it have trouble identifying African-Americans, but not Caucasians?<eos> I guess because we hadn't given it enough examples.
No criminal record, no enemies, as far as his friends knew, and no unusual debts.<eos> And his ex- girlfriend's alibi checked out.<eos> She was in Philadelphia all last night.<eos> Well, I hope she's not in a hurry to reclaim her truck.<eos> It's gonna need a little while to air out.
I promise I'll tell Snotlout where I hid his favorite axe.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey, Meatlug, it's trying to get out!<eos> Come on, girl, we have to close the exit.<eos> Those guys will never believe it was here if we let it get away.
Let's go help the others.<eos> Hiccup, there's too many of them!<eos> And the Flightmare really isn't helping.<eos> We'll be fine as long as we stay away from its mist.<eos> Hiccup, can't you just let it know we're the good guys?
I've always wanted wings.<eos> I'd like a pair of wings myself, you know?<eos> Anything more, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, please.<eos> I would like to have a South African spotted eagle owl... uh, if you could butterfly it, thank you... and pan-fry it, uh, with some potatoes would be lovely.
This is a very sophisticated job.<eos> I'd say it's a clocksmith.<eos> Although it looks like he wasn't concerned about hiding the origin of the parts.<eos> What about the Biokernel?<eos> It's had a shot in the head.
It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab.<eos> But it was a genuine unit with no restrictions... and no protocols.<eos> During eight days, we had a free-flowing dialogue with that unit.<eos> We learned from it and it learned from us.<eos> But then as some of us predicted... the day when it no longer needed our help arrived and it started to learn by itself.
'You jealous? '<eos> Shut up!<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't?<eos> This skeleton, it can't be any more than... MOLLY AND SHERLOCK: Six months old.
He had a heart attack.<eos> Probably caused by thrombosis due to the burns.<eos> He's stable for now but... his blood levels dropped dangerously low.<eos> He could have another thrombosis or an embolism.<eos> And this time, it could be fatal.
You mean the orphanage?<eos> What orphanage would that be?<eos> Saint Madeline's.<eos> It's out in Brookline.<eos> He gives a lot of money to it.
Shh.<eos> You are so ready to see the worst.<eos> You cannot see what is right in front of your nose.<eos> The world is so full of surprises.<eos> Let it surprise you.
What we're apparently seeing here is a virus, or a complex of viruses, killing some almost immediately, while leaving others fully mobile.<eos> However, within hours, nobody in the affected area remains alive.<eos> Stay tuned, please, for further developments on this breaking news story.<eos> That pickup's all right.<eos> But when I move around... it doesn't have that punch and it's just fading out a lot.
If you've only got a moustache<eos> We are the guardians of the future.<eos> Enter when ready.<eos> Stark!<eos> Did you shoot the black condor and kick it in the balls?
Can I call you back?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Elliot Salad read your script.<eos> He really liked it.
I like a very clear cup.<eos> So I don't want any sediment... plugging the pores in my mouth... and reducing my sensitivity... to the flavor notes.<eos> When you have a cup of coffee... you're starting hot... and that's really just the aromatics.<eos> A great light-roasted coffee is very mild at that point... almost watery, in many cases.<eos> Let it cool.
I need to know that you're still there.<eos> Have you forgotten me completely?<eos> I don't think Joan believed me when I told her you sent me the dream.<eos> She's more worried about me now than when I was dead to the world.<eos> But I know you've sent it and I know I have to follow it, just give me a bit of time, will you?
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.<eos> He killed Lommy.<eos> What the fuck's a Lommy?<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
I left him at base camp and went off.<eos> When I returned, he was dead.<eos> He had asked me to name a mountain after him.<eos> The Murray Mountains in the Congo.<eos> When the time came to claim the range, and affix a proper English name to it, I mean...
So he passed his own son off as the child of a colleague killed in Cawnpore.<eos> But certain passages underlined in Mrs Blaise-Hamilton's Bible refer to bastardy, which would suggest that she knew the truth.<eos> What is clear is that he made some kind of agreement with Benjamin Pickstock, the gamekeeper.<eos> He gave the boy to them to raise as their own.<eos> Who's to say it wasn't Pickstock's natural son?
A nod to the past, perhaps.<eos> One last thing puts it beyond all doubt.<eos> For something more than just a legend was handed down... from father... ..to son, to great-great-great-grandson.<eos> So this affair with Miss Danby, then?<eos> He only started it in order to gain access to the school.
And--and you invited her to join us, so...<eos> It's true--we have both experienced his penis.<eos> - And it-- - Mm-hmm. - It is pretty.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I tugged on it a couple times accidentally.
...placa de...<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> Here you go, honey.<eos> How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?<eos> Well, the stomach wants what it wants.
That's for belladonna poisoning.<eos> We haven't got the results from the test back yet.<eos> Doctor, please.<eos> The side effects could be serious-- seizures, irregular heart rhythms, even epilepsy.<eos> I'm not giving it until the tests come back.
- Of course.<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> You can't have organized crime without law and order.<eos> I love this city, and I see it going to hell.<eos> But I won't let it fall apart without a fight.
"In the words of grandmaster flash, you going high on that cocaine.<eos> You going crazy like a cocaine train."<eos> When I get back from rehab, I'll probably say cocaine is terrible, but don't believe me.<eos> Cocaine is amazing!<eos> I give it a million stars!
Countermeasures!<eos> We have a countermeasure vehicle that trails the presidential motorcade.<eos> It jams electronic-guidance systems, I.E.D. detonators, and even attracts heat-seeking missiles away from the president.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We can't stop the worm from hitting its target, so we give it a new target.
"I don't know when these paths separated."<eos> "I didn't get a chance to see." "Before I could.."<eos> - Happy birthday. "Everything happened so slowly.."<eos> 'The thing about birthdays is..'<eos> '..if you don't give it any value, no problem.'
Or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow.<eos> But I think I know how to stop it.<eos> All the virus cares about is replicating.<eos> The engineered version lets it do that unchecked.<eos> So it no longer needs to mutate, which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
No.<eos> Why do you have that?<eos> For dick pics and sex media in general.<eos> Why would you need a phone from, like, "The Wire" for that?<eos> I'm still on my family plan and I don't fully understand the cloud and I don't trust it.
You know what?<eos> Let's get something straight here.<eos> You're not me.<eos> You haven't cut a record, let alone sold one.<eos> And the only reason why Avery is producing your album is because I gave it the green light.
Gabriel's chip seems to have made him susceptible to just such an attack.<eos> So, the memories are in there.<eos> You just... need to plug them in.<eos> Yeah, well, that's where the mystery of the brain comes in.<eos> Given time, the right stimuli, sometimes it can find an alternate route, but sometimes it cannot.
I bet you weren't even in the car when it happened.<eos> - I don't have a partner.<eos> - You show up at rich boy's door,<eos> "Oh, I have a scratch on my head. I've had a terrible accident."<eos> He takes you in, and then you worm your way into the sack and give it to him like he's never had it before.
It's true, I am.<eos> I hate cancer.<eos> I hate cancer so much I made it my life's work to destroy it.<eos> And I know that our greatest chance of beating this is to deal with it head-on.<eos> Just look it straight in the eye and kill the bastard.
- It's a mix tape.<eos> - No!<eos> I made it for you.<eos> I'm sorry my brother threw that cupcake at you.<eos> He's gluten-free and upset about it.
I'll embarrass him.<eos> Your fiancé got a metal detector and scoured a 10,000-square-foot grid around that carousel.<eos> Guess where he found it.<eos> The nest of a mama pigeon.<eos> Barney had to wrestle it away from four baby pigeons.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.<eos> It's why I hired them.<eos> Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.<eos> This office can indeed function without you.<eos> And soon, it'll have to.
He was a very decent man.<eos> You see, the thing is, he died the day after he stayed here and that's why I'm here.<eos> And I'm looking for a book of poetry.<eos> He gave it to you, didn't he?<eos> He said he didn't need it anymore.
Richie and boy wonder are gonna go down with our bags.<eos> Five minutes after that, me and Miley are gonna go down.<eos> Everyone should have their hero switch in the "off" position.<eos> I make the plan.<eos> Everybody executes it, or I execute you.
Okay, what do we have for Chris?<eos> I got this City of Pawnee mug.<eos> Also, this cool jacket.<eos> No, I think that's Chris's jacket.<eos> Okay, good, then we know he likes it.
Exit the box, and surrender to the glory of the sontaran empire.<eos> Shush!<eos> Doctor?<eos> I was being chased by a giant dinosaur,<eos> But I think I managed to give it the slip.
It shows you two nights ago on the corner of Avenue C and 5th.<eos> Four blocks away from here.<eos> A bold opening.<eos> It's aggressive.<eos> I usually find when an opponent leads with a big move, they don't have much of a game to back it up.
They're the best.<eos> They've spent centuries taming those things 'cause it's the only thing that shows under a burka.<eos> This baby needs a burka.<eos> Ew! That's a baby?<eos> It needs Botox.
Press "Enter."<eos> _<eos> Don't be rude.<eos> Computer's talking to you.<eos> Answer it.
Wherever I go, you would follow.<eos> So I have come to see that for now, this is my place.<eos> Besides... this is not my world.<eos> You're wise not to acclimate to this world.<eos> It will not exist much longer.
I'm so sorry about that.<eos> (Sighs) You're a great guy<eos> - and you deserve better.<eos> - Look, you've made your choice.<eos> I'm not happy about it, but your community service is over in a week.
So I need a, uh...<eos> Tetanus shot?<eos> Higher standards?<eos> No, a condom.<eos> I'm about to have sex, and I want it to feel bad.
Last season on "Arrow"...<eos> This city still needs saving.<eos> Not by the Hood.<eos> It needs a hero.
- Tossing out all this college crap.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, "Why?"<eos> Because I'm not going.<eos> I'll keep the baby, and maybe when it's 16, 17 years old and hates my guts, then I'll look at college.
- Wrong.<eos> Jonathan developed it while under contract with Tony Gianopolous, which makes it his property.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I don't want anything.<eos> I just came down here to let you know you can go ahead and do whatever you care to with Jonathan Sidwell, but if you use his algorithm, we're gonna sue you for every penny that comes from it.
I can't go back to riding that bus.<eos> Please, give me more credit than that.<eos> Howard?<eos> That bike is incredible.<eos> It doesn't need gas, you don't need insurance, and you can park it anywhere.
I'll be getting my groove back!<eos> She took that better than I thought.<eos> You smell that, Virginia?<eos> You really love that old grill, don't you?<eos> Each burger's infused with the memory smell of 100 burgers before it.
Whew! Nothing like a 10k to start the afternoon.<eos> You gave the fit clip to Paul?<eos> ! I have been monitoring Paul?<eos> I-I felt bad for the fit clip.<eos> I-I thought it needed some exercise.
It can't create whole societies like an ant, or spin webs and trap you... like a spider.<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't know what it can do.<eos> But I know what it can't do.<eos> Its shell is so tough, that it can't be squashed.<eos> Once you know how strong you are, that no matter how tough it gets, you can't be squashed, you stop worrying about all the things you can't do, and you start dreaming about the things that you can do.
- Ugh, no.<eos> But it's a service dog.<eos> It gets you VIP access to places you wouldn't normally get to go to, like early entrance to the Barney's Warehouse Sale.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> And 20 bucks a day until we find it a permanent home.
If you foun someone insie, well, it woul have been surprising.<eos> Thanks for this.<eos> We foun a short bus out back.<eos> It on't run, but I bet we coul fix that in less than a ay or two.<eos> Father here says he oesn't want it.
That's it.<eos> Am I doing it wrong?<eos> No. Believe me, if you were on stage at the Albert Hall the audience would be on their feet and cheering!<eos> I want the baby to be all right.<eos> I don't want it to be hurt.
- Wade: Good.<eos> McKenzie: And I want the dog.<eos> Sonya: Oh, I'm sorry, the dog is evidence in this case.<eos> McKenzie: The dog is a goddamn hero;<eos> I'm not gonna have it sitting in some evidence room gathering dust.
It's calcium.<eos> It's for the baby.<eos> It's for what?<eos> I said it's for the baby.<eos> It's good for it.
Oh, look at that.<eos> What?<eos> The fungus on that tree there.<eos> It's a bay-brown polypore.<eos> I'm gonna go kick the shit out of it.
Come to think of it, there was another guy.<eos> When dad retired, I had to horse-trade him for the number, and he only had it a couple of weeks.<eos> Please tell me you remember his name.<eos> No.<eos> But I remember that he was a real hotshot, and I remember that I had to give up this great number for it.
It's just easier if I do it.<eos> No, no.<eos> Mom.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You put a light layer on first and then let it sit.
If it's lethal and dumb I've done it.<eos> How do you two know each other?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> The military gave me a very specific skill set.<eos> Then they discharged me for using it.
Because my brother the diplomat thinks it is what the people want to hear.<eos> The reason people are following Ihab Rashid is because he's given them a voice.<eos> How else can we expect them to follow you?<eos> Your tongue is your horse.<eos> If you let it loose, it will betray you.
Colonel Baird, did you find the...<eos> Hold on, my desk reset itself to Flynn's whatever.<eos> Here! Here, here. Okay.<eos> According to the scroll of Yosemite Sam's.<eos> According to it, "water spirits have been responsible for these similar weather anomalies dating back more than five score and nine years." Score?
I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> You can't expect us to sit by and just let Zaheer take you.<eos> The world has been out of balance for far too long.<eos> It needs the air nation back again.
Mike, this is serious.<eos> We need that list, and we need it by tomorrow.<eos> On it.<eos> Good new, Louis.<eos> I not only misfiled and misdated that document, I added in 10,000 others that look just like it.
Don't take this wrong, but does your dad have a court suit?<eos> - Yeah, used to be his lucky suit.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Got found guilty.<eos> - Perfect, so he won't be needing it.
It's a bastardly demon.<eos> Used to be Lamashtu's soul mate.<eos> But now she hates his guts.<eos> I can relate.<eos> Take this child into your dark womb and give it eternal life.
They were hanging upside down from the roof of the scientists' latrine, and they started to drop down into it and scoop up handfuls of human excrement and toilet paper, and they would eat it. ALL: Ugh!<eos> They even plunged into the pit itself, which you can see, and emerged covering, after a liquid lunch, in poo.<eos> The research paper noted, "It was scooping with one hand "from the semi-liquid manure, and then eating from the hand.<eos> "When more persons gathered around the latrine to watch this bizarre behaviour, "the sloth emerged from the latrine and climbed into the nearest tree."<eos> So it didn't like being watched.
My official picture's been the same since I got here.<eos> I don't see any reason to change now.<eos> Really?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - This one?<eos> A, it's 30 years old.
- October 31st.<eos> October 31st?<eos> You fire people on Halloween?<eos> I felt like the holiday was getting a little watered down.<eos> I wanted to make it feel scary again.
- Rohan's with the acolytes.<eos> They have the boat Ready to leave.<eos> Why aren't you all packed yet?<eos> - The kids and i have Been talking And we decided we wanna stay.<eos> This is our city, And it's going to need All the help it can get.
We all know who the real hero is, anyway.<eos> You mean that rug rat on the top of his head?<eos> KENSI: Guys, think that's made of real mink?<eos> GRANGER: Well, I hope it had its shots.<eos> (chuckles) SAM: Think he lets it run on a hamster wheel at night?
I've always wanted wings.<eos> I'd like a pair of wings myself, you know?<eos> Anything more, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, please.<eos> I would like to have a South African spotted eagle owl... uh, if you could butterfly it, thank you... and pan-fry it, uh, with some potatoes would be lovely.
This is a very sophisticated job.<eos> I'd say it's a clocksmith.<eos> Although it looks like he wasn't concerned about hiding the origin of the parts.<eos> What about the Biokernel?<eos> It's had a shot in the head.
It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab.<eos> But it was a genuine unit with no restrictions... and no protocols.<eos> During eight days, we had a free-flowing dialogue with that unit.<eos> We learned from it and it learned from us.<eos> But then as some of us predicted... the day when it no longer needed our help arrived and it started to learn by itself.
'You jealous? '<eos> Shut up!<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't?<eos> This skeleton, it can't be any more than... MOLLY AND SHERLOCK: Six months old.
He had a heart attack.<eos> Probably caused by thrombosis due to the burns.<eos> He's stable for now but... his blood levels dropped dangerously low.<eos> He could have another thrombosis or an embolism.<eos> And this time, it could be fatal.
You mean the orphanage?<eos> What orphanage would that be?<eos> Saint Madeline's.<eos> It's out in Brookline.<eos> He gives a lot of money to it.
Shh.<eos> You are so ready to see the worst.<eos> You cannot see what is right in front of your nose.<eos> The world is so full of surprises.<eos> Let it surprise you.
What we're apparently seeing here is a virus, or a complex of viruses, killing some almost immediately, while leaving others fully mobile.<eos> However, within hours, nobody in the affected area remains alive.<eos> Stay tuned, please, for further developments on this breaking news story.<eos> That pickup's all right.<eos> But when I move around... it doesn't have that punch and it's just fading out a lot.
If you've only got a moustache<eos> We are the guardians of the future.<eos> Enter when ready.<eos> Stark!<eos> Did you shoot the black condor and kick it in the balls?
Can I call you back?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Elliot Salad read your script.<eos> He really liked it.
I like a very clear cup.<eos> So I don't want any sediment... plugging the pores in my mouth... and reducing my sensitivity... to the flavor notes.<eos> When you have a cup of coffee... you're starting hot... and that's really just the aromatics.<eos> A great light-roasted coffee is very mild at that point... almost watery, in many cases.<eos> Let it cool.
I need to know that you're still there.<eos> Have you forgotten me completely?<eos> I don't think Joan believed me when I told her you sent me the dream.<eos> She's more worried about me now than when I was dead to the world.<eos> But I know you've sent it and I know I have to follow it, just give me a bit of time, will you?
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.<eos> He killed Lommy.<eos> What the fuck's a Lommy?<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
I left him at base camp and went off.<eos> When I returned, he was dead.<eos> He had asked me to name a mountain after him.<eos> The Murray Mountains in the Congo.<eos> When the time came to claim the range, and affix a proper English name to it, I mean...
So he passed his own son off as the child of a colleague killed in Cawnpore.<eos> But certain passages underlined in Mrs Blaise-Hamilton's Bible refer to bastardy, which would suggest that she knew the truth.<eos> What is clear is that he made some kind of agreement with Benjamin Pickstock, the gamekeeper.<eos> He gave the boy to them to raise as their own.<eos> Who's to say it wasn't Pickstock's natural son?
A nod to the past, perhaps.<eos> One last thing puts it beyond all doubt.<eos> For something more than just a legend was handed down... from father... ..to son, to great-great-great-grandson.<eos> So this affair with Miss Danby, then?<eos> He only started it in order to gain access to the school.
And--and you invited her to join us, so...<eos> It's true--we have both experienced his penis.<eos> - And it-- - Mm-hmm. - It is pretty.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I tugged on it a couple times accidentally.
...placa de...<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> Here you go, honey.<eos> How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?<eos> Well, the stomach wants what it wants.
That's for belladonna poisoning.<eos> We haven't got the results from the test back yet.<eos> Doctor, please.<eos> The side effects could be serious-- seizures, irregular heart rhythms, even epilepsy.<eos> I'm not giving it until the tests come back.
- Of course.<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> You can't have organized crime without law and order.<eos> I love this city, and I see it going to hell.<eos> But I won't let it fall apart without a fight.
"In the words of grandmaster flash, you going high on that cocaine.<eos> You going crazy like a cocaine train."<eos> When I get back from rehab, I'll probably say cocaine is terrible, but don't believe me.<eos> Cocaine is amazing!<eos> I give it a million stars!
Countermeasures!<eos> We have a countermeasure vehicle that trails the presidential motorcade.<eos> It jams electronic-guidance systems, I.E.D. detonators, and even attracts heat-seeking missiles away from the president.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We can't stop the worm from hitting its target, so we give it a new target.
"I don't know when these paths separated."<eos> "I didn't get a chance to see." "Before I could.."<eos> - Happy birthday. "Everything happened so slowly.."<eos> 'The thing about birthdays is..'<eos> '..if you don't give it any value, no problem.'
Or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow.<eos> But I think I know how to stop it.<eos> All the virus cares about is replicating.<eos> The engineered version lets it do that unchecked.<eos> So it no longer needs to mutate, which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
No.<eos> Why do you have that?<eos> For dick pics and sex media in general.<eos> Why would you need a phone from, like, "The Wire" for that?<eos> I'm still on my family plan and I don't fully understand the cloud and I don't trust it.
You know what?<eos> Let's get something straight here.<eos> You're not me.<eos> You haven't cut a record, let alone sold one.<eos> And the only reason why Avery is producing your album is because I gave it the green light.
Gabriel's chip seems to have made him susceptible to just such an attack.<eos> So, the memories are in there.<eos> You just... need to plug them in.<eos> Yeah, well, that's where the mystery of the brain comes in.<eos> Given time, the right stimuli, sometimes it can find an alternate route, but sometimes it cannot.
I bet you weren't even in the car when it happened.<eos> - I don't have a partner.<eos> - You show up at rich boy's door,<eos> "Oh, I have a scratch on my head. I've had a terrible accident."<eos> He takes you in, and then you worm your way into the sack and give it to him like he's never had it before.
It's true, I am.<eos> I hate cancer.<eos> I hate cancer so much I made it my life's work to destroy it.<eos> And I know that our greatest chance of beating this is to deal with it head-on.<eos> Just look it straight in the eye and kill the bastard.
- It's a mix tape.<eos> - No!<eos> I made it for you.<eos> I'm sorry my brother threw that cupcake at you.<eos> He's gluten-free and upset about it.
I'll embarrass him.<eos> Your fiancé got a metal detector and scoured a 10,000-square-foot grid around that carousel.<eos> Guess where he found it.<eos> The nest of a mama pigeon.<eos> Barney had to wrestle it away from four baby pigeons.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.<eos> It's why I hired them.<eos> Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.<eos> This office can indeed function without you.<eos> And soon, it'll have to.
He was a very decent man.<eos> You see, the thing is, he died the day after he stayed here and that's why I'm here.<eos> And I'm looking for a book of poetry.<eos> He gave it to you, didn't he?<eos> He said he didn't need it anymore.
Richie and boy wonder are gonna go down with our bags.<eos> Five minutes after that, me and Miley are gonna go down.<eos> Everyone should have their hero switch in the "off" position.<eos> I make the plan.<eos> Everybody executes it, or I execute you.
Okay, what do we have for Chris?<eos> I got this City of Pawnee mug.<eos> Also, this cool jacket.<eos> No, I think that's Chris's jacket.<eos> Okay, good, then we know he likes it.
Exit the box, and surrender to the glory of the sontaran empire.<eos> Shush!<eos> Doctor?<eos> I was being chased by a giant dinosaur,<eos> But I think I managed to give it the slip.
It shows you two nights ago on the corner of Avenue C and 5th.<eos> Four blocks away from here.<eos> A bold opening.<eos> It's aggressive.<eos> I usually find when an opponent leads with a big move, they don't have much of a game to back it up.
They're the best.<eos> They've spent centuries taming those things 'cause it's the only thing that shows under a burka.<eos> This baby needs a burka.<eos> Ew! That's a baby?<eos> It needs Botox.
Press "Enter."<eos> _<eos> Don't be rude.<eos> Computer's talking to you.<eos> Answer it.
Wherever I go, you would follow.<eos> So I have come to see that for now, this is my place.<eos> Besides... this is not my world.<eos> You're wise not to acclimate to this world.<eos> It will not exist much longer.
I'm so sorry about that.<eos> (Sighs) You're a great guy<eos> - and you deserve better.<eos> - Look, you've made your choice.<eos> I'm not happy about it, but your community service is over in a week.
So I need a, uh...<eos> Tetanus shot?<eos> Higher standards?<eos> No, a condom.<eos> I'm about to have sex, and I want it to feel bad.
Last season on "Arrow"...<eos> This city still needs saving.<eos> Not by the Hood.<eos> It needs a hero.
- Tossing out all this college crap.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, "Why?"<eos> Because I'm not going.<eos> I'll keep the baby, and maybe when it's 16, 17 years old and hates my guts, then I'll look at college.
- Wrong.<eos> Jonathan developed it while under contract with Tony Gianopolous, which makes it his property.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I don't want anything.<eos> I just came down here to let you know you can go ahead and do whatever you care to with Jonathan Sidwell, but if you use his algorithm, we're gonna sue you for every penny that comes from it.
I can't go back to riding that bus.<eos> Please, give me more credit than that.<eos> Howard?<eos> That bike is incredible.<eos> It doesn't need gas, you don't need insurance, and you can park it anywhere.
I'll be getting my groove back!<eos> She took that better than I thought.<eos> You smell that, Virginia?<eos> You really love that old grill, don't you?<eos> Each burger's infused with the memory smell of 100 burgers before it.
Whew! Nothing like a 10k to start the afternoon.<eos> You gave the fit clip to Paul?<eos> ! I have been monitoring Paul?<eos> I-I felt bad for the fit clip.<eos> I-I thought it needed some exercise.
It can't create whole societies like an ant, or spin webs and trap you... like a spider.<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't know what it can do.<eos> But I know what it can't do.<eos> Its shell is so tough, that it can't be squashed.<eos> Once you know how strong you are, that no matter how tough it gets, you can't be squashed, you stop worrying about all the things you can't do, and you start dreaming about the things that you can do.

Just stay back.<eos> No, Dinkum, what about the lines?<eos> This is the phone and cable.<eos> Electricity's over there. No, that's not what I mean.<eos> If you cut the pole, the lines will keep it from falling!
I don't understand what's happening with your car.<eos> Well, they made me a real good offer for it.<eos> It's not much of a car.<eos> Yeah, this truck is a real step up.<eos> It's only five years old.
Yeah, it's a beauty.<eos> It's a zero-turn model, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> It's got one of the best decks around.<eos> It even stands up to florida's sandy soil.
Just enough for the cat to squeeze back in?<eos> It could come back.<eos> To our apartment?<eos> It was there, like, six hours.<eos> Why would it come back there?
My most embarrassing thing.<eos> Oh, it's not really your turn.<eos> I did not give you chlamydia.<eos> Ah, yes you did.<eos> How else could I have gotten it?
You've got too much wood in there.<eos> But the more wood, the bigger the fire.<eos> It needs to breathe.
I hope he gets home safe soon.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Sucker-punch him, Feder.<eos> Lick his bicep.<eos> Lick it, bite it, lick the tan off.
Yes.<eos> I think I see it.<eos> So, it is graded what?<eos> A VS1.<eos> Some might grade it higher.
It's my sister's.<eos> Look at him. He loves this.<eos> Take it.<eos> Do not be pussy, dude!<eos> - Put it on!
You just want the headline when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.<eos> - 12 votes?<eos> - 12 votes.<eos> I can get you 10, probably 11.<eos> It's so refreshing to work with someone who will throw a saddle on a gift horse rather than look it in the mouth.
Does the bank?<eos> What stupidity.<eos> Personally, I do not care who has the gold .<eos> What matters to me is this town.<eos> And I'll be damned if I let it burn by greed and shenanigans.
Patricia had just finished the "Crimes of Passion" record at Sound City.<eos> Then I just met him one day, and that was - we just did it.<eos> I mean, I probably knew him for 15 minutes before we did the song.<eos> He had this pit terrier, so he would bring the dog into the studio, and he goes, watch this.<eos> And he'll throw it a basketball.
No.<eos> I wanted to be a doctor all my life.<eos> Oh, so you've always wanted to help people physically while abusing them verbally?<eos> I'm not known for my bedside manner.<eos> Well, you're known for it, all right.
It was one kid, and he wasn't that little.<eos> Look, he was 14.<eos> She was his teacher.<eos> Do we really want a pedophile living in the neighborhood?<eos> Shit, if it was 14 and had a teacher who looked like that and wanted it?
As Edo gave way to the Meiji era, the end of the samurai was nigh and the new government hunted down remnants of the Shogunate into Ezo, the untamed north ...and the defeated had nowhere to hide.<eos> 1869 Year 2 of Meiji Era<eos> If you come upon a bear in the wild, stare it directly in the eyes.<eos> You have to figure out whether or not it's your enemy.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.<eos> Poor bastard.<eos> He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?<eos> I hate this, Nicky. I really do.<eos> We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
Well, you know, I've never done it before, but I definitely am up for it.<eos> You are the cushion.<eos> This fucking lawn.<eos> It uses, like, 800 gallons of water.<eos> Why haven't you just let it get brown and die?
I'm just a sophomore.<eos> You're gonna twiddle your sexy thumbs waiting for some upperclassman to order you around?<eos> Hell to the no.<eos> You know, Jesus wrote in the Bible somewhere, "Do not hide your light under a bushel."<eos> You've got to let it shine!
- Let it go down.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> Let it travel.
You've got my e-mail.<eos> What makes you think this kid stole my I.D.?<eos> Because I saw it.<eos> I saw your I.D. with his picture.<eos> W-what would he need it for?
To get my shipment out of Sudan.<eos> He provided assistance.<eos> In exchange for defeating the bill.<eos> No.<eos> In exchange for not helping it succeed.
...when he bumped into a brother who also had a secret.<eos> We did make quite a mess in that bedroom.<eos> - Michael.<eos> - Gob?<eos> And relished the opportunity to rub it in.
Sister Bernadette's going to have it out in no time.<eos> The waters aren't broken.<eos> The presenting part looks like the right shoulder.<eos> I'm going to have to try an external version.<eos> We're going to need to turn the baby round so that it can be born more easily.
We're helping you visualize a leg that doesn't hurt.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Now... just look at that.<eos> I... are you kidding me?<eos> We are rerouting your brain, reminding it of what happened.
Oh, that's, uh--that's from the airship Norge, right?<eos> It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole.<eos> Pete and I snagged that, what, Artie, two years ago?<eos> Yes, it's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since.<eos> It's time we gave it a home.
Arlo did that?<eos> Frances took a path I never could.<eos> I'd put down Henry Crowder again, whatever it took...<eos> And again and again... same way each time.<eos> Once you make a decision, set down the path, you follow it right to the end, at least.. .
Um, trace.<eos> I'm sure you two have business, and, uh, yeah, so do I.<eos> Ooh. Boy.<eos> Hey. How was your flight?<eos> It got me here.
Yeah?<eos> Do you wanna pay me to reorganize it?<eos> 'Cause I really need a job right now.<eos> I was basically just told at an interview that curator as a job doesn't really exist anymore.<eos> Yeah, I think the world has the three curators that it actually needs.
Don't give me a reason to pull you out.<eos> Looking for... something?<eos> Damn.<eos> I was trying to hide this so you'd find it later.<eos> I can't do anything about the pedestrian key, but I can change what you keep it on.
Don't even think about it.<eos> Had a dog over at 80 when I was there.<eos> Still have the teeth marks in my ankle to prove it.<eos> My dad says he's gonna throw it in the river if I don't get rid of it.<eos> I'll take it, or at least I can find a home for it or something.
He obviously has some plan for me.<eos> I brought you some tea.<eos> I was just...<eos> I couldn't drink it.<eos> Well, if it's going spare...
Wait a minute.<eos> If he wants to be married to Jimmy, maybe we should see if he really wants to be married to Jimmy.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Jimmy should pressure him for sex constantly.<eos> He'll enjoy it for the first couple of months, but eventually, it'll just turn into a chore.
Detoxifying the addict is like saying to Tristan,<eos> "Kill Iseult.<eos> "You'll feel better afterwards."<eos> Of course, opium is unique, its euphoria greater than that of health.<eos> To it I owe all my perfect hours.
If it goes wrong, and we have a crash, who says sorry first?<eos> First thing I will do is check your pulse to see if you're still living, then I will ask you to apologise.<eos> Besides the complexity of the pace notes there was another worry.<eos> A world Rally car is purpose-built for the job.<eos> It weighs just 1,200 kilograms, and has bespoke brakes to help it stop.
With a note that in this box, there is ash from the city of Dresden.<eos> Papa wished that his ashes would be returned to his homeland.<eos> And as he burnt up with Dresden in 1945, these ashes are pretty much...<eos> The old Baron's ashes?<eos> Alright then. I know where it belongs.
I hear they're gonna have fireworks.<eos> Sometimes it is like you are eight years old.<eos> I put this baby ahead of everything.<eos> I made it the most important thing in my life.<eos> I let it come between us.
Liodes, don't insult the gods.<eos> I'm on your side. Don't be afraid.<eos> Of men or gods.<eos> Oh, Artemis, watch over queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca.<eos> Bring it the prosperity and stability it once had.
Gave me an 'eadache.<eos> We'll have words.<eos> Can't have him wearing out that noggin.<eos> The law's the law, right?<eos> And policemen serve it.
You made it easy for me to say yes.<eos> So... so we're good.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Our marriage is okay?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?
He let us go. What a wonderful gift.<eos> Any idea where he went?<eos> Oh, so many hallways, so many possibilities.<eos> You are going to tell me what you did with your rabbit.<eos> Did you hurt it?
As if it had imprinted on me, like a child with a parent.<eos> Then it started looking out for me, altered its own code to take care of me.<eos> It was behaving like a person.<eos> But the world didn't need a person to protect it.<eos> It needed a machine.
Yeah, let me tell you something.<eos> This ass is closed for business.<eos> This ass is in clench-down.<eos> I don't want to be a decoy.<eos> Let the President take it in the ass. He might like it.
I'm sure he'd rather be going to Disneyland.<eos> But before you jump to any conclusions, let's talk it over with the Riveras, ok?<eos> I'm telling you this, I will not be judged in my own house.<eos> You know what?<eos> We owe it to Jesus to find out more about the camp before we shut it down.
That's what you were trying to tell me before.<eos> Hope is stronger than loss.<eos> And the human spirit remains the most powerful weapon on this planet.<eos> That is a gift.<eos> If you do not allow it to be extinguished, it will carry you to victory.
How are you?<eos> I'm fit as a butcher's dog.<eos> And you've got a new car?<eos> Yeah, you are the very first person to drive the new Vauxhall Astra Tech Line.<eos> 'Since this was the maiden voyage for our new car, 'we decided to give it a bit of a send-off.'
No.<eos> The best one, the guy brought his pet spider in a jar with him.<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, I am serious!<eos> He said it was poorly and he couldn't leave it at home on its own.
People would tell you, you can only catch syphilis through sexual contact with an infected lesion.<eos> It's not true.<eos> What if you're pregnant?<eos> You can actually infect a new born child in labor.<eos> It's been given a death sentence before it's even been given a name.
Let's go!<eos> I don't know where Oliver Queen is.<eos> All I know is that he isn't here.<eos> This city is dying.<eos> And it needs someone to stand up and breathe new hope into it.
Mrs Stanley, I'm sorry.<eos> Phryne, where did you put my briefcase?<eos> I need that paperwork signed.<eos> I believe it ended up in my room, Aunt P.<eos> Well, what use is it there?
Maybe they used to... If you want to make Bungle in Rainbow seem high-status, bring on a panda.<eos> I'm with David on this.<eos> If you're in danger, you eat what you get.<eos> If a rhino turned round and was like,<eos> "Sorry, no carbs before Marbs," then it deserves to die.
Slower, Meatlug.<eos> Wait for it. Wait for it.<eos> Tail bludgeon.<eos> Ahh, there's nothing more glorious than a well-placed tail bludgeon, is there, girl?<eos> Okay, let's see how it likes this.

They limit how we can move around on the map, because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.<eos> It is a universal speed limit.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, imagine that there is someone sat here, let's say, with a telescope.<eos> If I wanted some signal, some flash of light to get out to that event there, which would be, let's say, an alien in some distant galaxy, taking a telescope out and looking at us, then it would have to travel - the influence, the light - would have to travel faster than the speed of light.
Fire is not a plaything.<eos> What a cute little guy. Hey.<eos> Stay back.<eos> No, no, no, wait!<eos> It likes me. Hey!
Huh?<eos> It's OK, little guy.<eos> Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.<eos> In an effort to avoid enslavement, I offer you the finest chilled refreshment known to the human race.<eos> He likes it!
Down the hall... make a left, and then when you see the janitor with a weird eye--<eos> Shut up!<eos> My dark prince.<eos> Come to Daddy.<eos> I don't think it likes you.
Just stay back.<eos> No, Dinkum, what about the lines?<eos> This is the phone and cable.<eos> Electricity's over there. No, that's not what I mean.<eos> If you cut the pole, the lines will keep it from falling!
I don't understand what's happening with your car.<eos> Well, they made me a real good offer for it.<eos> It's not much of a car.<eos> Yeah, this truck is a real step up.<eos> It's only five years old.
Yeah, it's a beauty.<eos> It's a zero-turn model, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> It's got one of the best decks around.<eos> It even stands up to florida's sandy soil.
Just enough for the cat to squeeze back in?<eos> It could come back.<eos> To our apartment?<eos> It was there, like, six hours.<eos> Why would it come back there?
My most embarrassing thing.<eos> Oh, it's not really your turn.<eos> I did not give you chlamydia.<eos> Ah, yes you did.<eos> How else could I have gotten it?
You've got too much wood in there.<eos> But the more wood, the bigger the fire.<eos> It needs to breathe.
I hope he gets home safe soon.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Sucker-punch him, Feder.<eos> Lick his bicep.<eos> Lick it, bite it, lick the tan off.
Yes.<eos> I think I see it.<eos> So, it is graded what?<eos> A VS1.<eos> Some might grade it higher.
It's my sister's.<eos> Look at him. He loves this.<eos> Take it.<eos> Do not be pussy, dude!<eos> - Put it on!
You just want the headline when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.<eos> - 12 votes?<eos> - 12 votes.<eos> I can get you 10, probably 11.<eos> It's so refreshing to work with someone who will throw a saddle on a gift horse rather than look it in the mouth.
Does the bank?<eos> What stupidity.<eos> Personally, I do not care who has the gold .<eos> What matters to me is this town.<eos> And I'll be damned if I let it burn by greed and shenanigans.
Patricia had just finished the "Crimes of Passion" record at Sound City.<eos> Then I just met him one day, and that was - we just did it.<eos> I mean, I probably knew him for 15 minutes before we did the song.<eos> He had this pit terrier, so he would bring the dog into the studio, and he goes, watch this.<eos> And he'll throw it a basketball.
No.<eos> I wanted to be a doctor all my life.<eos> Oh, so you've always wanted to help people physically while abusing them verbally?<eos> I'm not known for my bedside manner.<eos> Well, you're known for it, all right.
It was one kid, and he wasn't that little.<eos> Look, he was 14.<eos> She was his teacher.<eos> Do we really want a pedophile living in the neighborhood?<eos> Shit, if it was 14 and had a teacher who looked like that and wanted it?
As Edo gave way to the Meiji era, the end of the samurai was nigh and the new government hunted down remnants of the Shogunate into Ezo, the untamed north ...and the defeated had nowhere to hide.<eos> 1869 Year 2 of Meiji Era<eos> If you come upon a bear in the wild, stare it directly in the eyes.<eos> You have to figure out whether or not it's your enemy.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.<eos> Poor bastard.<eos> He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?<eos> I hate this, Nicky. I really do.<eos> We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
Well, you know, I've never done it before, but I definitely am up for it.<eos> You are the cushion.<eos> This fucking lawn.<eos> It uses, like, 800 gallons of water.<eos> Why haven't you just let it get brown and die?
I'm just a sophomore.<eos> You're gonna twiddle your sexy thumbs waiting for some upperclassman to order you around?<eos> Hell to the no.<eos> You know, Jesus wrote in the Bible somewhere, "Do not hide your light under a bushel."<eos> You've got to let it shine!
- Let it go down.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> Let it travel.
You've got my e-mail.<eos> What makes you think this kid stole my I.D.?<eos> Because I saw it.<eos> I saw your I.D. with his picture.<eos> W-what would he need it for?
To get my shipment out of Sudan.<eos> He provided assistance.<eos> In exchange for defeating the bill.<eos> No.<eos> In exchange for not helping it succeed.
...when he bumped into a brother who also had a secret.<eos> We did make quite a mess in that bedroom.<eos> - Michael.<eos> - Gob?<eos> And relished the opportunity to rub it in.
Sister Bernadette's going to have it out in no time.<eos> The waters aren't broken.<eos> The presenting part looks like the right shoulder.<eos> I'm going to have to try an external version.<eos> We're going to need to turn the baby round so that it can be born more easily.
We're helping you visualize a leg that doesn't hurt.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Now... just look at that.<eos> I... are you kidding me?<eos> We are rerouting your brain, reminding it of what happened.
Oh, that's, uh--that's from the airship Norge, right?<eos> It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole.<eos> Pete and I snagged that, what, Artie, two years ago?<eos> Yes, it's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since.<eos> It's time we gave it a home.
Arlo did that?<eos> Frances took a path I never could.<eos> I'd put down Henry Crowder again, whatever it took...<eos> And again and again... same way each time.<eos> Once you make a decision, set down the path, you follow it right to the end, at least.. .
Um, trace.<eos> I'm sure you two have business, and, uh, yeah, so do I.<eos> Ooh. Boy.<eos> Hey. How was your flight?<eos> It got me here.
Yeah?<eos> Do you wanna pay me to reorganize it?<eos> 'Cause I really need a job right now.<eos> I was basically just told at an interview that curator as a job doesn't really exist anymore.<eos> Yeah, I think the world has the three curators that it actually needs.
Don't give me a reason to pull you out.<eos> Looking for... something?<eos> Damn.<eos> I was trying to hide this so you'd find it later.<eos> I can't do anything about the pedestrian key, but I can change what you keep it on.
Don't even think about it.<eos> Had a dog over at 80 when I was there.<eos> Still have the teeth marks in my ankle to prove it.<eos> My dad says he's gonna throw it in the river if I don't get rid of it.<eos> I'll take it, or at least I can find a home for it or something.
He obviously has some plan for me.<eos> I brought you some tea.<eos> I was just...<eos> I couldn't drink it.<eos> Well, if it's going spare...
Wait a minute.<eos> If he wants to be married to Jimmy, maybe we should see if he really wants to be married to Jimmy.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Jimmy should pressure him for sex constantly.<eos> He'll enjoy it for the first couple of months, but eventually, it'll just turn into a chore.
Detoxifying the addict is like saying to Tristan,<eos> "Kill Iseult.<eos> "You'll feel better afterwards."<eos> Of course, opium is unique, its euphoria greater than that of health.<eos> To it I owe all my perfect hours.
If it goes wrong, and we have a crash, who says sorry first?<eos> First thing I will do is check your pulse to see if you're still living, then I will ask you to apologise.<eos> Besides the complexity of the pace notes there was another worry.<eos> A world Rally car is purpose-built for the job.<eos> It weighs just 1,200 kilograms, and has bespoke brakes to help it stop.
With a note that in this box, there is ash from the city of Dresden.<eos> Papa wished that his ashes would be returned to his homeland.<eos> And as he burnt up with Dresden in 1945, these ashes are pretty much...<eos> The old Baron's ashes?<eos> Alright then. I know where it belongs.

U.S. Attorney has more than enough to indict.<eos> When things are running smoothly with the Irish, I'll do my best to get Munson clear of all the charges.<eos> I read the letters.<eos> The only reason I am not slicing you open right now is 'cause I need this cartel deal to happen.<eos> Walking away from my club is one thing, but letting it die, I can't-- it's a part of me.
Do you need anything?<eos> No.<eos> But...<eos> I've kinda been thinking about the baby.<eos> We should probably get it some diapers or clothes and stuff.
Did you kill Sean Brown?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He saw the gun.<eos> He turned and ran.<eos> I wanted to miss... but it was impossible to miss and not lose face so I just aimed it at his back.
For smoking weed?<eos> Counting cards.<eos> I mean, I was smoking weed, but they banned me for counting cards. What?<eos> My brain just does it.<eos> I can't help that it keeps track.
My sister's phone.<eos> What?<eos> An all expense paid week in Marbella, for her phone.<eos> Is it working?<eos> Why shouldn't it work?
Continue.<eos> A court of inquiry is being commenced in two days to review the evidence against His Honor and decide if criminal charges should be brought.<eos> Why a court of inquiry?<eos> My guess is, due to the personal animosity - of the players.<eos> - All right, well, it still needs a judge.
Twin cylinder.<eos> Is that a Triumph?<eos> Don't even look at it.<eos> Didn't want to bore it out?<eos> Sounds like it could use a tune-up.

- Aah!<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> You guys left and I realized I should have given you a list.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, everyone knows you're not supposed to give a baby solid food until it's at least four months old and sitting up on its own.
And some people make a place for themselves...<eos> Grab a weapon!<eos> No time to be choosy!<eos> But then the world around them changes, and the place they made is gone.<eos> Every dragon has his own unique abilities that give it its special place in the world.
It's pathetic.<eos> I didn't lose your job for you, Wade, you did that.<eos> You wanna know what pathetic is?<eos> Pathetic is kidnapping a girl to make up for recruits you no longer have to order around.<eos> I'm gonna give you one order, and one chance to follow it: Release Sarah.
You want to try saying no to Mrs Dunwoody.<eos> She tells you how terrible life will be as an unmarried mother.<eos> About the stain you'll carry round with you all your life.<eos> How happy you'd make some married couple.<eos> But, most of all, how you'd be doing the best for your baby to give it away to people who can give it everything that you can't.

I was about to be gored, I promise you, lad.<eos> - So? So what'd you do?<eos> - So I reached for my Swiss Army knife, I opened the blade, just in the knick of time I should say, and I plunged it into his left eyeball.<eos> I shall never forget the ghastly sound he made.<eos> - You stabbed it in the eye?
So, can I hug the cactus now?<eos> No, you can't hug anything.<eos> But that poor cactus.<eos> It...<eos> it needs me!

I promoted Pradeep because he deserved it.<eos> Small confession:<eos> I find the anti- prostitution laws in this country rather Victorian.<eos> Sex is a commodity.<eos> Why shouldn't there be a market for it?
Is that your son?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Looks like that laptop's seen better days.<eos> If you're interested, I'm selling this.<eos> It's only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core, i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut's penis.
But I come to work, I watch the news every day...<eos> It seems like the world's falling apart.<eos> How am I supposed to bring a kid into that?<eos> The world's always falling apart, bro, since the beginning of time.<eos> But having kids, making a family, that's what keeps it together.

- Look if she wants to come down to my camp...<eos> - Her camp.<eos> Swinging her dick around, fine, let her.<eos> Cos I will not be intimidated by that dick.<eos> I will look it in the eye and say,
Cleaver, is this really necessary?<eos> Uh, look, we're going to have to put Michelle in the box, and she'll face tougher questions than this.<eos> But she's just an actor, Cleaver.<eos> She isn't the one that bought the knife.<eos> But she is the one we have on film plunging it through the deceased's ribs.
Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> He's got a magnetism.<eos> I think he was wearing my scarf.<eos> It looks good on him.
U.S. Attorney has more than enough to indict.<eos> When things are running smoothly with the Irish, I'll do my best to get Munson clear of all the charges.<eos> I read the letters.<eos> The only reason I am not slicing you open right now is 'cause I need this cartel deal to happen.<eos> Walking away from my club is one thing, but letting it die, I can't-- it's a part of me.
Do you need anything?<eos> No.<eos> But...<eos> I've kinda been thinking about the baby.<eos> We should probably get it some diapers or clothes and stuff.
Did you kill Sean Brown?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He saw the gun.<eos> He turned and ran.<eos> I wanted to miss... but it was impossible to miss and not lose face so I just aimed it at his back.
For smoking weed?<eos> Counting cards.<eos> I mean, I was smoking weed, but they banned me for counting cards. What?<eos> My brain just does it.<eos> I can't help that it keeps track.
My sister's phone.<eos> What?<eos> An all expense paid week in Marbella, for her phone.<eos> Is it working?<eos> Why shouldn't it work?
Continue.<eos> A court of inquiry is being commenced in two days to review the evidence against His Honor and decide if criminal charges should be brought.<eos> Why a court of inquiry?<eos> My guess is, due to the personal animosity - of the players.<eos> - All right, well, it still needs a judge.
Twin cylinder.<eos> Is that a Triumph?<eos> Don't even look at it.<eos> Didn't want to bore it out?<eos> Sounds like it could use a tune-up.
It's not the same without you.<eos> You're my favorite too, Lauren. I love you, and I love your gong.<eos> And I'm back.<eos> You have a job? That's the thing about sports.<eos> We go in for a diversion, but we can't keep it light.
You're confusing it with Douchebaggery 101.<eos> - And the Muslim?<eos> - That was a borderline call, but they're qualified to make borderline calls. - What is this meeting about?<eos> - Keep going.<eos> By comparison, CBS had Katie open her show from Times Square while News Night gave it three minutes and 20 seconds.
- Aah!<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> You guys left and I realized I should have given you a list.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, everyone knows you're not supposed to give a baby solid food until it's at least four months old and sitting up on its own.
And some people make a place for themselves...<eos> Grab a weapon!<eos> No time to be choosy!<eos> But then the world around them changes, and the place they made is gone.<eos> Every dragon has his own unique abilities that give it its special place in the world.
It's pathetic.<eos> I didn't lose your job for you, Wade, you did that.<eos> You wanna know what pathetic is?<eos> Pathetic is kidnapping a girl to make up for recruits you no longer have to order around.<eos> I'm gonna give you one order, and one chance to follow it: Release Sarah.
You want to try saying no to Mrs Dunwoody.<eos> She tells you how terrible life will be as an unmarried mother.<eos> About the stain you'll carry round with you all your life.<eos> How happy you'd make some married couple.<eos> But, most of all, how you'd be doing the best for your baby to give it away to people who can give it everything that you can't.
Whatever it takes to get him down here.<eos> Get some justice For amanda tanner and gideon wallace, please.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> I am the law, the law is me, and I might bend it From time to time,
I was about to be gored, I promise you, lad.<eos> - So? So what'd you do?<eos> - So I reached for my Swiss Army knife, I opened the blade, just in the knick of time I should say, and I plunged it into his left eyeball.<eos> I shall never forget the ghastly sound he made.<eos> - You stabbed it in the eye?
So, can I hug the cactus now?<eos> No, you can't hug anything.<eos> But that poor cactus.<eos> It...<eos> it needs me!
- Before I left it rip!<eos> - Well, it's better than having to peel her forehead off the ceiling, right?<eos> Agreed.<eos> Photoptarmosis is very interesting.<eos> It affects roughly about a third of the population,
- Hardman is awesome.<eos> I mean, he, um, brought in this omelet bar for the associates, but it's no...big deal.<eos> Really good.<eos> This pineapple was growing on a plantation on Lanai yesterday.<eos> Do not trust it.
We talk and Skype and text as much as possible, but the only time we're really in sync is when we're hate-watching Treme together.<eos> These songs go on forever, and why isn't there more zydeco?<eos> ♪ I can't stand this indecision ♪<eos> ♪ Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it ♪<eos> ♪ One headline, why believe it?
I didn't want it in my apartment.<eos> My brother said he'd take it.<eos> You gave it to your brother?<eos> Last week.<eos> Hmm. Why did he want it?
I promoted Pradeep because he deserved it.<eos> Small confession:<eos> I find the anti- prostitution laws in this country rather Victorian.<eos> Sex is a commodity.<eos> Why shouldn't there be a market for it?
Is that your son?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Looks like that laptop's seen better days.<eos> If you're interested, I'm selling this.<eos> It's only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core, i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut's penis.
But I come to work, I watch the news every day...<eos> It seems like the world's falling apart.<eos> How am I supposed to bring a kid into that?<eos> The world's always falling apart, bro, since the beginning of time.<eos> But having kids, making a family, that's what keeps it together.
Ooh, that adult Etch-A-Sketch certainly has brightened your mood.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> You can look at it this way... or this way... whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like "Tapped Out."<eos> "Virtual Stapler!"<eos> Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to.
Helps me keep track of them.<eos> Green color is the same that we found on the cabin door.<eos> What?<eos> You're saying somebody messed with the plane using my tools?<eos> No, we're wondering if maybe you messed with it.
I don't like it.<eos> -You need fresh air.<eos> -I'II get a melanoma.<eos> -l covered you in sun block.<eos> -l don't trust it.
He wasn't killed for another six hours.<eos> And why wait?<eos> I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton, why not just take him home and empty his safe?<eos> And then there's Hixton's gun.<eos> Why did he need it and where did he get it?

Concludingly yours, Bart Simpson.<eos> Hmm... hmm!<eos> Marge, would you like a Thicker Than Waters collectible plate?<eos> Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine.<eos> It's 25 years old.
Baked ham and pineapples, cushaw pumpkin, stuffed mirlitons, some of them carrots Aunt Odette taught her how to make.<eos> How's your filet, Pop?<eos> It's a little pink.<eos> It's supposed to be.<eos> I know how you like it - knock the horns off it, wipe its ass and send it on out.
I know. I only talk like a square.<eos> Tank water's highly salinated; kept at body temp so the user floats in complete silence and darkness. Blocking out all earthly stimuli.<eos> You know, in the movie Altered States,<eos> William Hurt went into the tank naked.<eos> To strip the self down to one's primitive, disembodied being is how you free the mind, allowing it to venture into other realms.
The gelatinous dance of peace.<eos> You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phantom could perform such intricate motions!<eos> Says you, salaryman.<eos> Behold: the dance of peace.<eos> The dance is so complex, I can't barely follow it.
Windy.<eos> Very windy. It's a terrible storm.<eos> I know that.<eos> What I meant was, is the barn holding up?<eos> It's holding its ground.
Good level swing, all right?<eos> Hang a rope now, babe. Here we go now, babe!<eos> Here we go now.<eos> Here we go, Danny!<eos> Come on, baby, pitch it in there.
Under Tunis, one year ago.<eos> Perfectly preserved in a tomb.<eos> You have no idea what you're actually dealing with.<eos> A fire elemental can't be contained once it's been unleashed.<eos> You can't simply call it back with a dog whistle.
Now, it is massaged for forty to fifty minutes.<eos> It's hard work for the apprentices.<eos> Too often, octopus tastes like rubber.<eos> It has no flavor.<eos> We massage it to give it a soft texture.
Well, we can try and get him to stand just on the hind limbs alone, like a bird, but when you do that, the thing you can see is not very well balanced at all.<eos> Looks quite unstable, and worst still, the tail is actually catching on the ground.<eos> So, now we can see him standing, in this four-legged pose.<eos> The winged membranes, which are attached to the hind limbs, get in the way somewhat.<eos> It doesn't look all that comfortable on the ground.
It used a quadrupedal launch.<eos> But how did it actually fly?<eos> There is a practical way of finding out.<eos> A modern glider is about the same size as that giant pterosaur. It too, has long slender wings. And it too, is extremely light.<eos> This flying machine is so lightweight, it doesn't even need an engine.

And it too, is extremely light.<eos> This flying machine is so lightweight, it doesn't even need an engine.<eos> All it requires is a tow to get it into the air.
This was all just about getting revenge on Stackhouse.<eos> You lied so I'd help you escape.<eos> Well, I had a place to go back to.<eos> You're going to shoot me, shoot me.<eos> I had a plan, too, and I am going to stick with it.
I could easily swing it but you know I can't because you're my friend<eos> But I'm good.<eos> I'm good, Javier. Okay, maybe not as good as before. But remember, the Coca-Cola campaign was my idea.<eos> "Life's little spark."<eos> It made you guys millions.
SHOUTING Benjamin's moment has arrived.<eos> He's got it.<eos> But the battle has just begun.<eos> As the whale fights to break free, they move to harpoon it again.<eos> They need to prevent it from diving and pulling a boat under.
"look, a golden calf. Like, i don't know.<eos> it look's like a badger who exploded."<eos> that looks like seven weasels attached together with each other.<eos> "it's a calf or a dog or some--it's called kenny.<eos> let's worship it."
Yeah.<eos> Problem is, it's not exactly true.<eos> At heart, we're rule followers, sheep.<eos> We don't break protocol.<eos> We follow it to a "T."
But he happened to be in a hospital that happens to have gotten a new C.T. Scanner<eos> that was able to pick up on a diaphragm rupture.<eos> Can you cut that, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Plus, he has a couple of brilliant surgeons to repair it.
Not before.<eos> And how does this help us?<eos> There's a gas station on lowell street.<eos> It's about five miles from Discovery park.<eos> It would have been right in his path.
There's more relaxed people in electric chairs.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> My dad would've thrown me in the car, floored it, and never looked back.<eos> Oh, yeah, right, and you had the best relationship with your dad.<eos> The man nicknamed his belt "the enforcer. " He never actually used it.
Six feet under screams But no one seems to hear a thing?<eos> Do you know That there's still a chance for you?<eos> 'Cause there 's a spark in you<eos> You just gotta ignite the light<eos> And lei it Shine
Just apple juice left to ferment.<eos> Nothing added.<eos> Nature's most natural drink.<eos> No yeast?<eos> How does it ferment?
Each half of the audience jointly controlled the bat on their side of the screen.<eos> If an individual held up red on their paddle, a computer sensor picked it up and the bat on the screen went down.<eos> If they held up green, it went up.<eos> But they had to operate it together.<eos> When the game is being played and the ball is going back and forth, if it's down here and it's headed that way, some people are going to have to show red to keep it from going all the way to the top.
Yes, remote-controlled hummingbirds that could monitor outdoor conversations.<eos> I was behind that.<eos> And even after it failed a very critical test run due to interference,<eos> I kept pushing it.<eos> I couldn't let it go.
Then he got ALS.<eos> You know what it did to him?<eos> His hands locked up, then his legs, his speech, eventually his breathing.<eos> Couldn't control 'em.<eos> His mind knew what it wanted, but his body...
I understand.<eos> And also, did you really not see the City Hunter's face?<eos> Listening to the pursuing policemen explanations, the distance between you and the City Hunter was very close.<eos> I didn't see, he took my gun.<eos> How could it be taking?
Seen this?<eos> A woman with impressively large breasts!<eos> No, here, look.<eos> The pendant round his neck.<eos> So... the killer took it off and placed it in his hands.
There are some hints that they may have had a sense of compassion.<eos> Comparable to the things we feel about one another.<eos> There are fossils from the site of Dmanisi in Georgia that hint at this.<eos> One fossil in particular had lost all of its teeth, either to an infection or to old age, or to both, and this individual was so severely handicapped that it would have had to have assistance.<eos> Some other member of its group would have had to help it basically chew its food in order for this individual to survive.
And sometimes I like my kind of person a lot more than yours.<eos> You wanna know what kind of person I am?<eos> Tough but fair.<eos> I call it like I see it.<eos> And what I see is a kid who asked for an opportunity who still hasn't decided if he wants it or not.
A man's gonna get off a train.<eos> He's gonna walk up to Nucky Thompson and he's gonna put a bullet in him...<eos> Right here, just because I said so.<eos> - What do you think about that?<eos> - I think the world's going to find out what kind of man it's dealing with.
You love her, but you couldn't propose.<eos> She just would have said no.<eos> This place, it magnifies your fear, your--your anxieties.<eos> The proposal, okay? That's your demon.<eos> Don't let it kill us all.
Nobody is.<eos> Not to worry, though, because the great pioneers are often unappreciated at first.<eos> Throughout this epic voyage, I have referred to this as either the TGV12 or the sports train.<eos> But I don't think that's right.<eos> I don't think that does it justice.

Pickle Party. Prepare for your hearts to turn to stones!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> ! It's the dead dog from the alleyway.<eos> I was compromising.<eos> I figured we'd give it a proper burial.
I just bought another piece.<eos> Come.<eos> Your home is spectacular.<eos> I know.<eos> But it'll need a serious scrubbing after all the trash leaves.
What's wrong?<eos> Aah! What is it?<eos> It feels like the baby's kicking.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It's only eight weeks old.
You're aware of what happened to my establishment.<eos> Please, step inside.<eos> Now...<eos> What the hell are you playing at?<eos> Only that... in knowing what happened to the pub, you'd be aware that it's in need of repair and financial attention.
That's fine.<eos> We've got a lot of things.<eos> Bosiger is looking for you.<eos> Aw, a rabbit.<eos> Can I give it a leaf
One moment.<eos> I'm conducting an experiment.<eos> With Dungeons Dragonsdice?<eos> Yes.<eos> From here on in, I've decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind do what it does best-- enlighten and amaze.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I want this instead.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> That's my friend Tony's groin.<eos> I had him e-mail me a picture last night.<eos> He had the same problem with his valve last year, and his doctor replaced it with a catheter through the groin.
Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother, and said...<eos> "I'm fine, bitch.<eos> I'm fine."<eos> Fear plays an interesting role in our lives.<eos> How dare we let it motivate us?

I have made bald friends.<eos> Well, that's your mistake.<eos> Because it's a lie.<eos> It's Hollywood crap.<eos> And I won't allow it in my commercial.
It meant the mysterious electrical fluid could flow through some things...<eos> ..but not through others.<eos> It led Gray to divide the world into two different kinds of substances.<eos> He called them insulators and conductors.<eos> Insulators held electric charge within them and wouldn't let it move, like the silk or hair, glass and resin.

Stop!<eos> Do you really think that there's a real, loaded gun in a theatre?<eos> What kind of gun was it?<eos> - A starter's gun, for races.<eos> Been there for long, but it shouldn't be in a theatre, you need a licence.
Hello.<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> Kid, official duty.<eos> To Dragnea.<eos> Get it sealed and stamped.
Otherwise, it will get you instead.<eos> You have to be really carefull with lonely wolves.<eos> Go there.<eos> Now.<eos> Throw it.
I think I can remember how to get there.<eos> Well, I lived in these houses 30 years before you did.<eos> Otherwise known as last week... and I have no idea where the hell we are.<eos> You mind if I ask how much explosive you have access to, Ben?<eos> More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
It's gonna be evil, and I wanna get rid of it.<eos> No.<eos> I will raise that child as my own.<eos> Do you hear me, Arlene?<eos> I want to marry you and together we will surround that baby with more love than it can handle.
This Saturday there are scheduled to be 54 weddings.<eos> And now a funeral.<eos> Dust off your morning suit, ronnie.<eos> Not likely.<eos> My last wife cut the arms off it.

No. It wouldn't be the same.<eos> I will provide the money. As much as you need.<eos> No.<eos> "For years we have all been living in the realm of Prince MangoguI:<eos> Under the spell of an immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it with an insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about quick to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to abandon its direction." (MicheI FocauIt)
I promise.<eos> I work at st.<eos> Joe's.<eos> - Well, the point is my friend thinks you're cute.<eos> Give me your number so he can have it.
Dave Bartholomew?<eos> We are not amused here.<eos> Darlin', you don't understand.<eos> This is out of print.<eos> But I offer it to you freely as barter for this drink and fine repast that must surely accompany it.
[ sighs ] I went for the gold --<eos> Fiona gunderson.<eos> I poured my heart and soul into a poem,<eos> Left it on her desk.<eos> I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.
Got chlamydia.<eos> - Wow! Exotic.<eos> - That's what I said.<eos> Then I realised Cook had it as well and it didn't feel quite so special, if you know what I mean.<eos> I bet it liked you more.
A guy came, set all these traps and all, and he finally got it, but my aunt, she didn't believe it.<eos> She kept insisting she could still hear the thing.<eos> I mean, you could not tell her any different.<eos> She started keeping an old umbrella by her chair.<eos> Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it, even gave it a name.
Vegetarian?<eos> Have you seen Carlos?<eos> What's all this?<eos> Somebody kill a toaster?<eos> Angie's fixing my remote control, Giving it a little extra power.
Oh, now, whatcha doing?<eos> Huh? Tree Trunks!<eos> You better stay in that tree, baby.<eos> Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?<eos> Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection.
Oh, no, he just needs to blow off some steam.<eos> how's that for battery?<eos> !<eos> Mom, like it or not, you made a commitment, And maybe that doesn't mean anything to you anymore, But you owe it to this family to save your marriage<eos> And give it one more try.
Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, I didn't catch it.<eos> It killed three of my people.<eos> I shot it full of elephant tranquilizer and it chuckled!
- Right.<eos> - Karl: And he had some special wires that he can...<eos> - Special wires.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you shake a plant, it doesn't like it.
Your garden is very beautiful.<eos> -Yes.<eos> I'm also proud of it.<eos> It's a legacy of my ancestors.<eos> It seems you give special attention to it.
This is kind of crazy.<eos> But what if...<eos> The object was symbiotic in nature?<eos> Which is to say that it wasn't entirely mechanical,<eos> That it needed some sort of... So sort
Your tea.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When they happen upon a cheetah.<eos> And its inevitable conclusion often makes...<eos> Don't let it get cold.
Well, if there's anything you need...<eos> And thank you For the Teddy bear for Jacques.<eos> It's pretty much repaired.<eos> Well, except one leg wasn't salvageable.<eos> But, um, He'll love it.
Like a well?<eos> That can't be right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a well.<eos> Why would it be in a well?
On planet douche-Alon.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Okay, so how did your, uh, talk with Bobby go?<eos> Oh, so great, except that it didn't happen.<eos> You see, I was hoping that maybe tomorrow We could do it together.
It catches all the little fishies.<eos> Bye, little fish.<eos> It do you see what I have to deal with?<eos> He still hasn't picked a defensive style. He'd better do it soon,<eos> Or he should strap it on for a lifetime of this.
Unless you count my old wife.<eos> All right, you guys let me know when you're ready 'cause I got some good ones.<eos> No. She can't have the baby today because of my old wife.<eos> She doesn't want them to share a birthday.<eos> Well, when the baby wants to come, it's coming.
Except, uh, can I get his cell phone?<eos> You want a phone?<eos> Well, his phone actually.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> He doesn't need it anymore.
You gotta breathe, man.<eos> Ryan, do me a favor.<eos> In the bed of my truck, there's a pool skimmer.<eos> It's a long pole with a net on it.<eos> Will you go grab it and shove it up his ass?
On board our passengers have the one way ticket to the future.<eos> The train begins to accelerate, faster and faster.<eos> Soon it's circling the Earth, over and over again.<eos> To approach the speed of light means circling the Earth pretty fast. Seven times a second.<eos> But no matter how much power the train has, it can never quite reach the speed of light, since the laws of physics forbid it.
That there was a very deep and unexpected link.<eos> A truly cosmic connection between nature's strange power to self-organise and the chaotic consequences of the butterfly effect.<eos> Between them, Turing, Belousov, May and Lorenz, had all discovered different faces of just one really big idea.<eos> They discovered that the natural world could be deeply, profoundly, unpredictable.<eos> But the very same things that make it unpredictable also allow it to create pattern and structure.
Look, when she gets off the phone, you have to tell her really quick.<eos> Like you're ripping off a bandage.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I can never do that.<eos> I usually like to soak it in hot water and let it fall off...
It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon.<eos> Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?<eos> Here, Ted.<eos> Capture the moment!<eos> I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.
You're just content to roll over and go back to sleep?<eos> You're genuinely convinced that you can reactivate the hologram crystal by hitting it with a synchrotronic light source?<eos> No, not reactivate it.<eos> Speak its language.<eos> Show it who's boss.
Fine.<eos> 5 minutes, no wall.<eos> What were you hoping to get out of setting me and noah up again?<eos> Noah has always been a very popular, inquisitive boy Who also understands that god has a plan for him,<eos> And he is gonna follow it step by step.
Don't feel bad.<eos> For elephant day my workers tricked me Into painting my face and walking around With the pockets pulled out of my pants.<eos> It was all fun and games till I whipped out the trunk.<eos> Why would Rajiv make up a holiday?<eos> And why would asha go along with it?
The Swiss really pay for this?<eos> A lot! - See?<eos> I told you, they haven't stolen anything.<eos> Did you kill that deer?<eos> I grabbed it and, "snap", I broke it's neck.
It's considered one of the few American supercars.<eos> Just the name instills a sense of fear.<eos> The "srt" stands for "street and racing technology," and the "10" tells you there are 10 cylinders under that enormous hood.<eos> The viper is the most American car I have ever driven.<eos> It's all power, absolutely no finesse, and it doesn't give a damn what the rest of the world thinks about it.
Your oratory has the Old Bailey enthralled, Mr Garrow.<eos> That you must be silent at your own trial is a sadness.<eos> What business do you have with me?<eos> I may be against you, but I do admire you.<eos> Like you, I am... ..in this world, but not of it.
That's crazy.<eos> Pauline thinks he's great.<eos> She'll eventually catch on.<eos> I asked him round for a drink tonight.<eos> Is it in the right spot?
I'm saved!" I admit how very horrible my life so far has been.<eos> I were just walking passed the airing cupboard and I heard it cheeping.<eos> Urgh. It's horrible.<eos> What's it going to eat?<eos> It will require live food.
How do you know about Dedi?<eos> You're right.<eos> He was a man who did the first magic trick, which was, I think, - the decapitation of a goose.<eos> - You're right.<eos> And...tore it off and did it to impress the king, and it's in an ancient scroll.
Ha Ni, do you know how old this table is?<eos> It was a present by Grandma when you first made cold noodles.<eos> It's older than me.<eos> Ding dong dang, you are correct!<eos> It is 21 years old, but it doesn't have even a single scratch on it.
Within other bacteria, there was a simpler, fully-functioning mechanism.<eos> This system is missing 40 of its 50 parts, 80% and it is perfectly functioning.<eos> So the kindest thing one can say about this claim, which is the essential claim of irreducible complexity and intelligent design is that it's wrong - it is simply wrong on the basis of the science.<eos> Miller had shown that the flagellum was not too complex to have evolved.<eos> It did not need an intelligent designer.
I even cut them up before bringing it here.<eos> - The fridge is full of watermelon.<eos> But the ones I buy are exceptionally sweet, just like honey.<eos> Watermelon have to have the taste of a watermelon to be called a watermelon.<eos> If it's honey flavored, is it still a watermelon?
The Purge.<eos> - He killed them all?<eos> - It was genocide.<eos> I tried to get back but I couldn't get to the portal.<eos> It uses massive power and it can't stay open forever.
Adam.<eos> Calling to find out how I think it went.<eos> - Let him sweat.<eos> - Does he always ask for your advice?<eos> Yes, and always usually takes it.
Stop!<eos> Do you really think that there's a real, loaded gun in a theatre?<eos> What kind of gun was it?<eos> - A starter's gun, for races.<eos> Been there for long, but it shouldn't be in a theatre, you need a licence.
Hello.<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> Kid, official duty.<eos> To Dragnea.<eos> Get it sealed and stamped.
Otherwise, it will get you instead.<eos> You have to be really carefull with lonely wolves.<eos> Go there.<eos> Now.<eos> Throw it.
I think I can remember how to get there.<eos> Well, I lived in these houses 30 years before you did.<eos> Otherwise known as last week... and I have no idea where the hell we are.<eos> You mind if I ask how much explosive you have access to, Ben?<eos> More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
It's gonna be evil, and I wanna get rid of it.<eos> No.<eos> I will raise that child as my own.<eos> Do you hear me, Arlene?<eos> I want to marry you and together we will surround that baby with more love than it can handle.
This Saturday there are scheduled to be 54 weddings.<eos> And now a funeral.<eos> Dust off your morning suit, ronnie.<eos> Not likely.<eos> My last wife cut the arms off it.

It does not matter, Terranuova!<eos> My cousin!<eos> He has cirrhosis liver.<eos> Looks younger!<eos> ... respect it for the rest of your life?
I'm someone who might be able to help you with your problem.<eos> You know, you look like you're in pretty bad shape yourself.<eos> Just tell me about your son, Jack.<eos> He's six, and he's got a heart problem since he was born.<eos> And it's getting worse.
You think I'm gonna fight my way out with a stapler?<eos> Water's ready.<eos> And look aroundfor some towels.<eos> In an enclosed space, getting around a cellphone jammer is a game of who's got the stronger signal.<eos> A cellphone jammer broadcasts a powerful signal over a range of frequencies, but it can't compete with an entire ethernet wired to serve as one big antenna.
So why on earth do we have the same shape we have.<eos> Now without sounding like a hypocrite,<eos> I revisit archetypes, I've designed many chairs. With that given, you say, okay now I'm going to design a chair.<eos> What can I do here?<eos> How can I put my fingerprint on it and differentiate it from everyone else and every other designer?
Where is he?<eos> - I see you were the last-second hero again.<eos> - Yeah, Dad.<eos> It was crazy.<eos> When Doug shot that ball, I knew exactly where it was going to go.
Can you feel that?<eos> Feel what?<eos> High ratio of positive to negative ions<eos> Unfriendly air<eos> But you can't let it bring you down
Reese?<eos> How do we break william's alibi?<eos> Tidwell looks good in that suit.<eos> Oh, i'm just saying, you know, it's a nice suit.<eos> He looks good in it.
Have I ever given in to that temptation?<eos> No, never. I'm not that kind of politician.<eos> Official Parks and Rec business. Just need to grab a quick hot dog.<eos> Sorry about that, little girl, you can have the next one.<eos> I have a moral code, and I never violate it.
I took care of you. Do you know why?<eos> Because it was my responsibility. I was helping her.<eos> What, by getting her to buy into this ridiculous...your fad?<eos> My what? This thing you're doing with you and your furry friend.<eos> Raiding the dressing-up box, pretending to be human. It's a game! It's...this is not a game!
Dad, I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to.<eos> Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack?<eos> One of these yours?<eos> Machine got stuck.<eos> I guess it just needed a little push.
Have you seen Phil or a blood trail that could lead to Phil?<eos> He's not here.<eos> And I'm stuck.<eos> Maybe the meat blob's not taking in enough nutrients.<eos> I guess I could try and give it a mouth.
We've got to drive it upstairs, contain it.<eos> David Lodge?<eos> Have you still got that truck?<eos> What is it now?<eos> Heat, it likes heat.
That's where we tell the story of who we are and why we do things.<eos> That's also the side that was wrong.<eos> Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical, doesn't choose which details to look at, makes connections you could never see.<eos> You owe your insight to the "mute loser."<eos> I'll send it tickets to a Phillies game.
I'm callin' the cops.<eos> Aah, stuck! I'm callin' the cops!<eos> Get outta there!<eos> Come on!<eos> The lock on a cash register drawer... is designed to keep it from pulling open.
I want to know about the moment he started shooting at you, okay?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Look, we only said something about... about taking the car.<eos> And then that's when he pulled the gun.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't grab it from him and shove it down his throat.
Hunt has expressly forbidden that very thing.<eos> If she sits for me and you escort her, as her chaperone, then...<eos> I'll be protecting you from your desires, and she'll be protecting me from mine.<eos> I don't know. Ruskin needs a new protege now that Millais is off his books.<eos> I need to paint a masterpiece as soon as possible and push it under his nose.
- I noticed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's so nice about chocolate?<eos> The substance itself or the crunch of your teeth on it?<eos> I prefer to let it melt slowly on my tongue.
Oh no!<eos> It's okay, go ahead and cry.<eos> Here you go, got you another box.<eos> Here, use this cold pack<eos> OK, no sense in wasting' it.
So technically, it's staring at me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's from a small town.<eos> It's never seen a big businessman like you before.<eos> Well, tell it to act more professional.
Listen.<eos> Sheet and consult me ​​peace.<eos> Marmiton ...<eos> So ... it has been good to you play on the kid?<eos> As if it was not quite mentally confused.
The way we left things...<eos> I didn't like it.<eos> See, the thing is,<eos> I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10.<eos> It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling.
Any of those things scream pee?<eos> Not that I'm aware.<eos> Ancient metal workers turned iron into steel by accident.<eos> They accidentally carburized the iron while heating it over charcoal, thus turning it into low-Grade steel.<eos> But they thought that it was the mode of quenching the molten metal that hardened it.
- No. It's cool, man.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Intervention.<eos> Intervention. Okay?<eos> Look, he's got a weird fetish for older women, so don't hold it against him.
Go through.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get that out.<eos> It can stay out here.<eos> It can't go in the surgery.
- Okay, Nicky Phillips.<eos> - Right here.<eos> You... you bringing this plant?<eos> So I can replant it.<eos> It belongs in a deciduous forest, not on my mom's patio.
It's a problem I've tried to solve many times<eos> - without success.<eos> - Keeping a human brain alive?<eos> It's very tricky.<eos> You see, it's not enough to simply give it blood and oxygen.
The FBI found that 80% of the mortgage fraud was being induced by the lenders, not by the borrowers.<eos> You know, much of the rage has been... been against the borrowers.<eos> But if you want rage, it should be at the CEOs who became fabulously wealthy by following a strategy based on fraud.<eos> The Wall Street people and their friends here at the Federal Reserve and at the US Treasury and down... down the Washington Mall here at the US Capitol, that's where the damage was done;<eos> and if people want to vent their anger, they need to vent it against these people.
Sheer-sided mountains rise up from the jungle.<eos> Few places on Earth are wetter.<eos> It's the home of some ancient and very peculiar amphibians.<eos> The waterfall toad is just an inch long, the size of a postage stamp.<eos> Its special gripping hands enable it to clamber safely, high in the tree tops.
but wait a second!<eos> Maybe there is a special move!<eos> Oh? Like what?<eos> and chuck her at the enemy!<eos> I call it:
So tell me, why so serious?<eos> Relax a bit!<eos> You're Count Vampyro's guests!<eos> Look at his cape!<eos> It's billowing by itself!
Did not you hear?<eos> He escaped from the zoo this morning.<eos> There is a zoo here?<eos> no it's just...oh...<eos> Whatever it is, I won't let it get you.
Keats!<eos> - Throw the rope up. - Excuse me, miss.<eos> But if the princess has already abandoned the dwarf, I mean, cannot we keep his love speech?<eos> We have to change it.<eos> Find another place for it.
Here, child.<eos> Wear this tonight.<eos> It will keep you safe.<eos> Solomon...<eos> It's you we want.
It does not matter, Terranuova!<eos> My cousin!<eos> He has cirrhosis liver.<eos> Looks younger!<eos> ... respect it for the rest of your life?

The way we left things...<eos> I didn't like it.<eos> See, the thing is,<eos> I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10.<eos> It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling.
Any of those things scream pee?<eos> Not that I'm aware.<eos> Ancient metal workers turned iron into steel by accident.<eos> They accidentally carburized the iron while heating it over charcoal, thus turning it into low-Grade steel.<eos> But they thought that it was the mode of quenching the molten metal that hardened it.
- No. It's cool, man.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Intervention.<eos> Intervention. Okay?<eos> Look, he's got a weird fetish for older women, so don't hold it against him.
Go through.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get that out.<eos> It can stay out here.<eos> It can't go in the surgery.
- Okay, Nicky Phillips.<eos> - Right here.<eos> You... you bringing this plant?<eos> So I can replant it.<eos> It belongs in a deciduous forest, not on my mom's patio.
It's a problem I've tried to solve many times<eos> - without success.<eos> - Keeping a human brain alive?<eos> It's very tricky.<eos> You see, it's not enough to simply give it blood and oxygen.
The FBI found that 80% of the mortgage fraud was being induced by the lenders, not by the borrowers.<eos> You know, much of the rage has been... been against the borrowers.<eos> But if you want rage, it should be at the CEOs who became fabulously wealthy by following a strategy based on fraud.<eos> The Wall Street people and their friends here at the Federal Reserve and at the US Treasury and down... down the Washington Mall here at the US Capitol, that's where the damage was done;<eos> and if people want to vent their anger, they need to vent it against these people.
Sheer-sided mountains rise up from the jungle.<eos> Few places on Earth are wetter.<eos> It's the home of some ancient and very peculiar amphibians.<eos> The waterfall toad is just an inch long, the size of a postage stamp.<eos> Its special gripping hands enable it to clamber safely, high in the tree tops.
but wait a second!<eos> Maybe there is a special move!<eos> Oh? Like what?<eos> and chuck her at the enemy!<eos> I call it:
So tell me, why so serious?<eos> Relax a bit!<eos> You're Count Vampyro's guests!<eos> Look at his cape!<eos> It's billowing by itself!
Did not you hear?<eos> He escaped from the zoo this morning.<eos> There is a zoo here?<eos> no it's just...oh...<eos> Whatever it is, I won't let it get you.
Keats!<eos> - Throw the rope up. - Excuse me, miss.<eos> But if the princess has already abandoned the dwarf, I mean, cannot we keep his love speech?<eos> We have to change it.<eos> Find another place for it.
Here, child.<eos> Wear this tonight.<eos> It will keep you safe.<eos> Solomon...<eos> It's you we want.
This is your last chance.<eos> If you want to back out, now is the time.<eos> Good.<eos> OPERATION MARDONIUS OSLO HARBOUR, 27 APRIL 1943<eos> Take this bloody dog away and get it something to eat!
Lemon, Lemon. Look at me.<eos> Come on, sit up, sit up.<eos> When our people came here from Romania, the creature hid among them.<eos> They built this fort away from others to keep it in.<eos> - As long as we supply it with food
If you want him back, you have to get rid of her.<eos> Yeah, well, how could I do that?<eos> Wait. that came out wrong. how could I do that?<eos> the same as you ways did. Whenever you wanted a guy, yohad, like, 50 different ways<eos> To make the girlfriend disappear--the one where You take a hotel matchbook and write your number on it And stick it in his pocket,
I'm here because you needed help.<eos> So it's either top or I'm out of here.<eos> All right.<eos> You take the top, and I'll push.<eos> Just don't let it slip out of your little-girl hands and crush me.
My penis looks great!<eos> Yes. It's a fantastic penis.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> How long before it's ready?<eos> Well, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
Well, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.<eos> Let me see if it feels right in my hand.<eos> No! Don't open the-<eos> Whoa no!<eos> Don't let it get out of the lab!
So, have you killed people? Yes.<eos> How many?<eos> Too many. Well, why?<eos> Because every person, even you, reaches a point in their life when they take responsibility for the world they live in, and they have to make a decision - endure it,<eos> or you oppose it, change it.
So all we have to do is filter the b6 out of his blood.<eos> Prep him for plasmapheresis.<eos> Just because he didn't salute Doesn't mean he can't.<eos> And can you find out where that voice Keeps coming from?<eos> And tell it to get out of my head.
Found some accounts of a local miracle.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. In '85, there was an empty field outside of town.<eos> Six months later, there was a full-grown oak.<eos> they say it looks a century old at least.
At first,for everything,but then for long pig.<eos> Long pig?<eos> He means human flesh.<eos> And that is my word of the day.<eos> Hunger grows in till they can't fight it,
Previously on dexter.<eos> This child is happening.<eos> I'm going to have a child.<eos> But I can't be a father to it.
The kulishov a-85 is a beautiful flying machine.<eos> Like the most perfect bird.<eos> It's almost flawless in its design.<eos> Almost flawless?<eos> It needs a human to fly it.
Ah, it's an oldie but a goodie.<eos> As you observe this image, Your brain perceives first a duck, Then a rabbit, then a duck again.<eos> It always comes back to the duck.<eos> In truth, the image is neither.<eos> But it illustrates the brain's need To take random sensory input and construct it Into a meaningful whole- Great.
Almost there.<eos> Let me know when it's exactly 84.5. Blue.<eos> The human brain is like a computer.<eos> Green.<eos> It just needs electricity to function which the body ceases to produce upon death.
I'm really not that interested in American History.<eos> It's mostly lies, too, like the rumors going around this school.<eos> Lies.<eos> I'm gonna give you some advice.<eos> You don't have to take it, but I'm gonna give it to you, anyway.
- Is this a unitard?<eos> - It gets them in the door.<eos> It says they wanna start living a healthier lifestyle. - By melting fat?<eos> - It doesn't melt fat, Violet.<eos> But it does break it down.
How was it, dad?<eos> Oh, mind boggling, Chris.<eos> Barreling around the earth at 5 miles per second. Watching the sunrise over the sea at Japan. It's indescribable.<eos> Plus I've had a lot of time to rub one out which in space is great, except after a while it's like living in a snow globe.<eos> Peter, instead of wasting your free gas on a series of comedic stunts why don't use it more constructively?
And it's bad out there, Seth.<eos> If you don't believe me, take a look at this graph that I got here.<eos> As you can see... it shows that unemployment in 2008... It's upside down.<eos> You bet it is!<eos> The whole world is upside down, and someone's got to fix it.
-No, I didn't tell him--<eos> -He's smart.<eos> You think he's not gonna figure this out?<eos> Look, I can't... he had that dog for ten years, and he... he didn't shed a tear when it died.<eos> He snapped its neck and hid it in the garage, and he didn't shed a tear because he didn't care.
Well, my point is if one goes back and looks who's developed those policies and those setting those standards, my view is that we don't need to set those standards so high.<eos> And, unfortunately, the bias that have been involved in setting these standards have been greatly influenced by the dairy industry.<eos> A similar situation of excess holds true for iron.<eos> And so, we have to think a little bit... rethink our recommendations on iron again and ask wether or not we can get adequate amounts of iron, let's say, from plants. And the answer is definitely yes.<eos> The ability of the body to monitor its own needs needs to be respected and protect in the form of giving it the right kind of resource to work with.
Why are you even mad?<eos> I made a nice canyon.<eos> In fact it's a Grand Canyon.<eos> Aaah reallly Grand Canyon<eos> I wish I could think of a name for it.
My light's dying.<eos> It's dying.<eos> My light's dying!<eos> 'There was an upside though.<eos> 'Richard's Taliban bike had decided it liked the rain even less than me.'
James had attached his bike to a traditional fishing boat, using the engine to power the propeller.<eos> You've just completely disassembled your motorcycle.<eos> It isn't a motorbike any more.<eos> Front wheels, gone.<eos> Engine isn't where it's supposed to live.
The machine tortures matter.<eos> Picture by picture, we catch glimpses of how the universe looked a few minutes after the creation.<eos> The particles produced in these collisions are much too small to be seen.<eos> Their presence is revealed only by the tracks they leave behind them as they pass through the detecting equipment.<eos> The way we do find out about this proton and the first kind of experiments that we've been making, is to tear the electron off the atom and accelerate the proton faster and faster and let it plough into a mass of atoms,
Come on.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Move for me, come on.<eos> We got a plan.<eos> We're gonna stick to it.
Not like that, like this!<eos> Nuka, run over here!<eos> Your horse wants a drink.<eos> Run to me!<eos> Let's give it a drink!
We can't let him... march on the valley, take his revenge.<eos> He'll...<eos> Your mind is like this water, my friend.<eos> When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see.<eos> But if you allow it to settle the answer becomes clear.
I know.<eos> Have you seen my dad?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> Capricorn's got another copy of the book.<eos> He's gonna make me read The Shadow out of it.
Our worst fears have become bitter reality.<eos> With the terrible events of the past week... at The Munich Olympics, all of our hopes for peace... have come crashing down.<eos> We cannot remove all the hatred and violence from this world<eos> We must be prepared to fight the forces of evil.<eos> Gentlemen, our duty is to fight terrorism. And, if possible, to end it. Tell me your ideas.
Her family's sponsoring a charity event and her sister's going to be there, OK?<eos> OK...<eos> Do you two think that lunch will make itslef.<eos> No, but that lettuce leaf's walked out of fridge on its own.<eos> Come and take this horrible bread and send it to Africa where it belongs.

I want to see it.<eos> Water.<eos> Bring him up.<eos> Does it actually speak our language? Or does it just parrot what it's heard?<eos> No, it seems to already understand our language.
Now aren't they better just marble, worn a little into something wise, as well as beautiful?<eos> Joe Blomfield, you are the world's best flatterer.<eos> Or maybe I'm saying you belong in a museum.<eos> You don't tamper with a masterpiece, Margery.<eos> You allow it to be.

No one knows for sure what causes the nausea but one theory is that it protects the fetus from toxins in food<eos> these could harm its tiny organs during this critical phase of development<eos> Another theory is that nausea is side effect of the mother's immune system as it weakens to avoid attacking the developing embryo<eos> The fetus is effectively a parasite<eos> the mother's energies as it draws what it needs from her body it has its own life support system - the placenta

No, no, it's fine.<eos> It's fine!<eos> It's fine!<eos> Look, my dick must be like an inch away from its face, and it's coming, just coming in at its face.<eos> What if it kicked 'cause it didn't like it?
Your dad needs it to pay to the bank.<eos> The restaurant's sucking him dry.<eos> So let him dump it then.<eos> He's put his whole life into it. It's not about the money.<eos> Well, isn't Ian helping to get it back on its legs?
Every time.<eos> Question is, for whom?<eos> You got your list, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> All right, you make sure you stick to it.
You know what you can do.<eos> No matter what, a role model of yours is the main suspect.<eos> - He might be innocent.<eos> - You're mad not suspending him.<eos> You're entitled to your view but don't let it come between us.
I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.<eos> And what do you base this on?<eos> Look, this is the world, right?<eos> But now, think of the world as a living being.<eos> If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.
Hand it over, Stan!<eos> They're gonna kill me!<eos> Give them the rabbit!<eos> Yes, hand it over!<eos> First, you have to promise you won't hurt it!
No, they are the bus.<eos> See, they're the vehicle that gets us here.<eos> They drop us off and go on their way.<eos> They continue on their journey.<eos> And the problem is that we keep trying to get back on the bus, instead of just letting it go.

I made that pasta over there 3 complete with Vitamin B and calcium!<eos> And that tofu and seaweed hamburger is Natsumi-san's specialty<eos> It's low in calories so eat up!<eos> It's all the same once it gets in the stomach.<eos> He likes it... if he didn't he wouldn't be eating it.
Since 1977 our country has ceased counting cases of suicide.<eos> "Murdering oneself".<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> This act has nothing to do with murder.<eos> It knows no bloodlust. It knows no passion.
"Murdering oneself".<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> This act has nothing to do with murder.<eos> It knows no bloodlust. It knows no passion.<eos> It only knows dying, the dying of hope.
There are a few points to be worked out, but on the whole it's very good.<eos> It has strength and lyricism.<eos> Above all, simplicity.<eos> Is that such a bad thing?<eos> World doesn't need another Beethoven, but it may need you.
Very funny.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'll get it for you.<eos> What shall I do about the fire?<eos> - Just let it burn out.
As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing ever.<eos> Well, think it over.<eos> And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this, as a show of good faith. It might be of interest.<eos> Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick.<eos> - He never learned it.
The number one.<eos> Top of the list. London's most wanted.<eos> Okay. Cool.<eos> Say that again.<eos> The most precious thing on this earth is the human brain and yet we allow it to die.
But that's over 300 years ago.<eos> What's it been waiting for?<eos> Maybe just a single cell survived.<eos> Adapting slowly down the generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after host.<eos> But why does it want the throne?
Little wider.<eos> Okay, just relax.<eos> - [Screams]<eos> - Okay, okay. A little sensitive.<eos> Well, I hope you're not in love with that tooth, Lieutenant, because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go.
I cannot be alone!<eos> It's not fair!<eos> - Look, I've got your pod!<eos> - The pod is dead!<eos> - No, no. it only needs heat.
It's not fair!<eos> - Look, I've got your pod!<eos> - The pod is dead!<eos> - No, no. it only needs heat.<eos> - It needs more than heat.
What then?<eos> I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved.<eos> And that one!<eos> She didn't draw that, he did.<eos> But it needs more than heat, Doctor.
- Give it to him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Give it to him, Cristina.<eos> - What is with you?<eos> - He needs it to operate.
- Kick it.<eos> - Kick it.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, good. So, caffeine's for seizures.<eos> What's the doughnuts for?<eos> To absorb some of the coffee so it doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.
Where have you been?<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> That in a minute, that computer's gonna start beeping, and when it does, you're gonna let it go.<eos> You're gonna let it run down to zero-- past zero-- and you're not gonna push the button.
They can't rest until they reach it.<eos> The main herd has already got there safely.<eos> Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust.<eos> The exhausted calf is still blinded by sand.<eos> Its mother does everything possible to help it.
But they are beautiful.<eos> I thought the power was off.<eos> Achance to dip in your propeller?<eos> The propeller?<eos> It needs running water.
We'll have to run more tests.<eos> In that case, can I have some morphine?<eos> I want you checking the fetal monitor every 30 minutes.<eos> What's the point?<eos> The baby's nowhere near where it needs to be, and you know you're gonna have to cut her open, so why not get it over with?
And now I'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay...<eos> You'll buy Max's truck?<eos> Why, doesn't he need it?
Why?<eos> You have to learn the Seoul accent, to speak with those people.<eos> Then they won't ignore you, and they'll help you find your dad's house.<eos> What's a Seoul accent?<eos> I learned it watching movies.
It's a master of disguise.<eos> The nautilus keeps well clear of them.<eos> It's small tentacles carry highly developed chemical sensors which can detect traces of both predators and prey.<eos> It uses it's water jet to dig in the sand.<eos> Because it devotes so little energy to swimming, it only needs a meal once a month.
Good idea.<eos> Give me your protractor triangle.<eos> Are you crazy!<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it.
I made that pasta over there 3 complete with Vitamin B and calcium!<eos> And that tofu and seaweed hamburger is Natsumi-san's specialty<eos> It's low in calories so eat up!<eos> It's all the same once it gets in the stomach.<eos> He likes it... if he didn't he wouldn't be eating it.
Since 1977 our country has ceased counting cases of suicide.<eos> "Murdering oneself".<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> This act has nothing to do with murder.<eos> It knows no bloodlust. It knows no passion.
"Murdering oneself".<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> This act has nothing to do with murder.<eos> It knows no bloodlust. It knows no passion.<eos> It only knows dying, the dying of hope.
There are a few points to be worked out, but on the whole it's very good.<eos> It has strength and lyricism.<eos> Above all, simplicity.<eos> Is that such a bad thing?<eos> World doesn't need another Beethoven, but it may need you.
Very funny.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'll get it for you.<eos> What shall I do about the fire?<eos> - Just let it burn out.
As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing ever.<eos> Well, think it over.<eos> And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this, as a show of good faith. It might be of interest.<eos> Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick.<eos> - He never learned it.
The number one.<eos> Top of the list. London's most wanted.<eos> Okay. Cool.<eos> Say that again.<eos> The most precious thing on this earth is the human brain and yet we allow it to die.
But that's over 300 years ago.<eos> What's it been waiting for?<eos> Maybe just a single cell survived.<eos> Adapting slowly down the generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after host.<eos> But why does it want the throne?
Little wider.<eos> Okay, just relax.<eos> - [Screams]<eos> - Okay, okay. A little sensitive.<eos> Well, I hope you're not in love with that tooth, Lieutenant, because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go.
I cannot be alone!<eos> It's not fair!<eos> - Look, I've got your pod!<eos> - The pod is dead!<eos> - No, no. it only needs heat.
It's not fair!<eos> - Look, I've got your pod!<eos> - The pod is dead!<eos> - No, no. it only needs heat.<eos> - It needs more than heat.
What then?<eos> I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved.<eos> And that one!<eos> She didn't draw that, he did.<eos> But it needs more than heat, Doctor.
- Give it to him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Give it to him, Cristina.<eos> - What is with you?<eos> - He needs it to operate.
- Kick it.<eos> - Kick it.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, good. So, caffeine's for seizures.<eos> What's the doughnuts for?<eos> To absorb some of the coffee so it doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.
Where have you been?<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> That in a minute, that computer's gonna start beeping, and when it does, you're gonna let it go.<eos> You're gonna let it run down to zero-- past zero-- and you're not gonna push the button.
They can't rest until they reach it.<eos> The main herd has already got there safely.<eos> Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust.<eos> The exhausted calf is still blinded by sand.<eos> Its mother does everything possible to help it.

Well, I get stacks of mail from animal rights campaigners, but they're really addressing the IHA generally.<eos> So you don't meet the public on a daily basis?<eos> No. Ah, erm...<eos> A couple of years ago, my wife talked me into writing a thriller.<eos> It didn't do very well, but the publishers made me work like a dog promoting it.
Last night was the first moon of the lunar cycle.<eos> Why can't you just download porn like other teenage boys?<eos> Excuse me for trying to make conversation.<eos> OK, so what would a werewolf be doing in LA?<eos> Shouldn't it be off in the countryside somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?
There!<eos> Don't irritate it!<eos> -What is it?<eos> -Just a sphinx.<eos> -Throw it a book. -What?
Don't irritate it!<eos> -What is it?<eos> -Just a sphinx.<eos> -Throw it a book. -What?<eos> -Throw it a book, it likes books.
You've got to build bypasses. Besides, you should've protested months ago.<eos> The plans have been on display at the planning office for a year.<eos> On display?<eos> I had to go down to a cellar.<eos> Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage this bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
My great love.<eos> She was taken from me.<eos> Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.<eos> Your anger gives you great power.<eos> But if you let it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.
You'll laugh but I found it on the seabed.<eos> Humanity's oldest flute.<eos> Dating from the mammoths... carved from the bone of a rhino with partitioned nostrils.<eos> Partitioned?<eos> The poor rhino! How did it breathe?
How will you help him then?<eos> All you ever do is encourage him.<eos> That's right.<eos> I do encourage him.<eos> He has a God-given talent, and this is his one chance to give a voice to it.
I just...<eos> You just can't help but wonder.<eos> The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.
- or it's just a coincidence.<eos> - It's just a coincidence.<eos> Well, we can't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah, we can. It was here for ages before it did anything.<eos> If it had work to do, why would it lie around in a puddle?
Pericardial effusion.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Keep this on.<eos> There's fluid built up around your heart.<eos> It's constricting it from beating.
Turn the fuck away.<eos> That's my fucking seat.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's my fucking seat.<eos> I paid for it.<eos> I can award it to whomever the fuck I want.
He's worried you'll press charges.<eos> But you won't, will you?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Because that would hurt your case more than you're hurting it already.
I just... I wanted... I wanted just to tell you, you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> Just don't come, okay?<eos> Fill this space with light.<eos> Let it be healed.
I'll give you directions to Pruszko.<eos> But I want the use of your radio.<eos> Zosia needs to relay a message to our government-in-exile.<eos> I'm the only one who touches this radio.<eos> Then you are welcome to stay here and keep it company.
Coffee.<eos> We don't have soda pop.<eos> Look, I don't know how much Mom told you about what I'm doing, but I got assigned a field study for my legal pluralism, gender and religion class...<eos> You know, that is right where I stopped her.<eos> I'm all for higher education, but that word salad that goes with it, not so much.
I fucking know.<eos> But if you kill him now, the truce with the London outfits - will be blown to fucking pieces, all right?<eos> - Michael...<eos> Michael...<eos> Don't worry about that truce, kid, right, because it fell apart.
Two old guys like us, we're the past.<eos> Well, that's a sad thought.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> Banking law... needs to be exciting.<eos> It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.
I can understand a woman's desire for domesticity, but a man's?<eos> That I can't understand.<eos> I can't understand how you cannot understand.<eos> You have no instinct towards earning for yourself a life more comfortable?<eos> And had I that instinct, I would resist it with every inch of will I could muster.
I wanted to tell you that I can't make it tonight.<eos> Something came up, its an emergency.<eos> I have to re-schedule.<eos> But I laid everything out.<eos> I opened the wine to let it breathe.
Oh, let this be your confession.<eos> - Temptation was my burden.<eos> - Hmm, what kind of temptation?<eos> - Of the flesh. - Uh-huh.<eos> Well, that's not a sin unless you follow through on it.
The line can be traced back to antiquity.<eos> Perhaps further.<eos> Dracula was said to be their founder.<eos> The name means "dragon" in Romanian.<eos> It suits him.
That place has been cleared out for years, but a lot of Felicity Smoak's projects got relocated.<eos> Where?<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't say that Felicity's equipment would be here.<eos> Well, where else would you think it'd be?
Time and man, we grew up together.<eos> We depend on each other.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Time is older than man, and infinite.<eos> But in the here and now, we help it think.
I'm not an easy target.<eos> They'd be better off trying to find some witchy workaround.<eos> Unless they already have.<eos> They need my heart.<eos> Or one that's identical to it.
'Cause everyone warned me that prison would be an inhumane environment.<eos> It is.<eos> But I... I find it refreshing.<eos> The perfect microcosm of the animal world.<eos> When an animal wants something, when it needs something, other things... need to be stepped on.
- So did I.<eos> - Oh, I must be bulletproof!<eos> Every time we killed you back there, time reset the day.<eos> "Time reset the day."<eos> You're the one that told us time was conscious... that it needs primaries like Jennifer to think.
She was immune... like you.<eos> She died of bacterial meningitis.<eos> I saved her once with you, but the day reset anyway.<eos> Time... wouldn't let us change your history in any way.<eos> It needed you to create time travel.
She died of bacterial meningitis.<eos> I saved her once with you, but the day reset anyway.<eos> Time... wouldn't let us change your history in any way.<eos> It needed you to create time travel.<eos> It needs us to complete the mission.
Check this out.<eos> The prints are a match to Bardot's.<eos> If Bardot loaded it, then he had to have been the one who stole it from the Academy.<eos> So he was shot with his own gun?<eos> Question is, what was he doing with it out there in the first place?
What, are you managing by hypothetical polls now?<eos> I've got an ear to the ground, Randy.<eos> That's part of my job.<eos> All due respect, Commissioner, but this is a non-conversation.<eos> Thomas Sculley earned this promotion, and unless you want to change every departmental guideline, there are no grounds for you to block it.
That's bullshit! What are we supposed to do? !<eos> This conversation is over!<eos> Do you think what I said was only meant for them?<eos> I didn't do anything behind your back.<eos> Put this shit back where it belongs.
You've been seen her as well? !<eos> You know one has to keep one's options open.<eos> The heart knows what the heart knows.<eos> And what does your heart know about me?<eos> It knows that it's fond of you.
Oh, I used to love these things when I was a kid, you know?<eos> Before the Internet or cell phones. I mean, you could talk to anyone in the world with one of these things.<eos> I'm gonna get this thing working, and then you and Gordo...<eos> Daniel stop.<eos> The ham's in the garage because I want it in the garage.
But I do intend to fight back, especially since the people are with me.<eos> She's backed up by Serge Vauban's firepower.<eos> The only power Vauban has, is the love for his son.<eos> And justice doesn't care about love, does it?<eos> Although sometimes it doesn't care about truth, either.
Listen.<eos> If you come clean, we can help you.<eos> But if you keep lying, we can't.<eos> Look, I ain't touch that person, a'ight?<eos> So you're telling us a dude in a dress smacked you right in front of your people and you just let it slide?
That's it, without a doubt.<eos> So who stole it from the morgue?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We'll never be able to prove it's the same cocoa.<eos> Can't we just test how old it is?
- on the 'Bago. - Safety check?<eos> Weren't you the guy who said, "Brakes are for sissies"?<eos> Yeah, well, I just noticed this thing has really been acting up.<eos> Like yesterday, it rudely drove itself to Orson again without telling anybody.<eos> Well, maybe it had to go there because it has a girlfriend whose hair smells like lemons.
He was fun.<eos> So, what do you think of the dress?<eos> Oh, it's so beautiful.<eos> So fashion-forvvard. So Valentino.<eos> Gave it a sweetheart neckline because you're my sweetheart.
That was dramatic.<eos> I'm sorry, I know you mean well.<eos> You just didn't think it through.<eos> You want to protect the world but you don't want it to change.<eos> How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to evolve?
That is what rode up soy.<eos> Now that we're looking at the RAT and payload closely, we're thinking they were...<eos> Written by different authors.<eos> DANIELS: How we figured that out was through the coding in the RAT.<eos> Though several years old, it is lean, graceful.
That's a lot of blood.<eos> Well, the point is that that's so much blood and then<eos> The bleeding ceased, just out of the blue,<eos> Which is unusual.<eos> But he was hemorrhaging, And then it just stopped. And then he was fine,
There is skill to it.<eos> More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.<eos> TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.<eos> It's TV, it's comfort.<eos> It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.

George and AnnaBeth.<eos> Oh, that is preposterous!<eos> Daddy, the heart wants what it wants.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Not what you tell it to.
It was you.<eos> Yes, it was me, but I fixed it, so... you can stop worrying if everybody at the firm respects you, because they do.<eos> Everyone except you.<eos> No, Louis, including me.<eos> Listen, I may not like how you got your name on the wall, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be up there.
I was just...<eos> It was obvious how much you've helped him, so...<eos> No, he helped me.<eos> I'm a better person for knowing him, Reg.<eos> Let's keep our past where it belongs.
Yeah.<eos> - Bye, Joshua. - Oh.<eos> Bye.<eos> So let me get this straight:<eos> the preacher has a vision and you all just... follow it.
Is one of those problems a hell-bat with beady eyes and devil horns?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because that's the exact same sound it made before it tried to kill me.<eos> Oh. So you've faced this creature before?<eos> Yes, and I can tell you exactly what it wants.
[ whispers ] They've been living in a land without magic.<eos> How could they do it?<eos> [ roars ] [ scoffs ] [ whispers ] I know.<eos> Fine.<eos> Tell us what it wants.
That was Marcus.<eos> He's gonna think I hung up on him.<eos> Leave him wanting more.<eos> That's basic seduction stuff, Diaz.<eos> Captain Holt has been in a bad mood, and I'm not letting it get any worse on my watch.
Wait.<eos> Should we just give her some more time?<eos> I've been down this road before.<eos> This heart is toast.<eos> What... what if we zap it?
But I have enjoyed listening to you all.<eos> To be honest, though, I find this label sexual addiction to be shaming.<eos> When it comes to desire, I mean, desire, what you call acting out, it would be wise to remind ourselves of how Elizabeth Taylor lived.<eos> And what Oscar Wilde said.<eos> "The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it."
You could have been arrested, and then what would have happened to us?<eos> I had to.<eos> Juice, please.<eos> Have milk, son.<eos> It'll help you grow big and strong.
Hey, uh, guys, listen, I owe you both an apology.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My ambition got the best of me.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I've let it turn me into a bad hall monitor and an even worse sister.
- And happy.<eos> You know, a responsible guardian would try and stop you...<eos> But?<eos> But, believe it or not, you're actually an adult now, and you found your purpose.<eos> So might as well pursue it.
It's gonna be a great month.<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> All I'm saying is, when that baby comes, all bets are off.<eos> You haven't slept in three days.<eos> You got this creature screaming at you, won't tell you what it wants.
Mr. Crider said that being in prison actually prevents Erica James from contributing to society in a positive way, so, he, uh, - gave me a "C". - Come on, Jace.<eos> I mean, it's an admirable point, but you had to know you were poking the bear.<eos> Okay. So, what, civil disobedience isn't important?<eos> Well, it is.<eos> And it will often get you a "C" in your civics class.
You mean, besides the car trouble I've already told you about?<eos> For one thing, I used to be the proud owner of a bar I built from scratch.<eos> Now it is owned by a man I despise.<eos> I barely know who I am some days.<eos> And I would have thought that you of all people would understand how difficult it can be to have a calling and not be able to follow it.
I know you.<eos> You're the sexy, charming guy who tried to tempt me with a drink earlier.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Ooh.<eos> The only way to get of temptation is to yield to it.
I don't think we're gonna have to wait that long.<eos> But you were so good at what you did. Worked so hard with such dedication.<eos> Why would you turn on the agency?<eos> I didn't turn on the agency.<eos> I gave my life to it.
I can't see who it is or who it was.<eos> Where are you taking it?<eos> A clearing.<eos> There's a huge tree in the middle of it.<eos> You'd think it was 1,000 years old.
The question is, why does he want it?<eos> Er, who precisely is asking that question?<eos> The Honourable Hugh Atkins.<eos> The trial judge?<eos> So the Crown's contention, if you can credit it, is that he wrote the poisonous letters himself.
And the police went on and on about how "cadaver" is the wrong... you know, most people wouldn't say "cadaver," they'd say "body."<eos> They would conclude that that meant that the person had something to do with medical or ambulance services, somebody who is involved in that and would know and use the word "cadaver" for a body.<eos> I think that word is so telling.<eos> Kathie had a cadaver in medical school.<eos> She didn't give it a name. You know, she had respect for the fact that it was a human being, a living human being at one time.
Oh, really?<eos> You got a cause?<eos> Justice.<eos> From a corrupt government.<eos> A government which has imprisoned me for decades because I stood up to it.
Well, I'll see what Thumbs can dig out.<eos> Pun intended.<eos> Do you have an idea where the shelter might be located?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we're having a little fun establishing where it... won't be.
Because you abandoned me to it.<eos> Why should I be responsible for you?<eos> You made me immortal!<eos> I saved your life.<eos> I didn't know that your heart would rust because I kept it beating.
You of all people should know that.<eos> Look, I get that you're trying to build a life here...<eos> Yes, a normal life, so stay out of it, please.<eos> But our heritage...<eos> Let it die.
There's nowhere for us to run, Lieutenant.<eos> This creature will surely find us.<eos> We must find a way to defeat it.<eos> A weakness we can exploit so we can escape unscathed.<eos> That's it... it wants secrets.
Carl Nash?<eos> I don't know his name, but he said the place was "a blight on the neighborhood."<eos> That's a direct quote.<eos> The city wasn't doing anything.<eos> The people were pissed off, so that's why they let it burn.
You trying to push my buttons?<eos> This woman could be the key to an international criminal enterprise.<eos> I don't want to do this alone but I will if I have to.<eos> BROWN: Do what, exactly?<eos> I don't trust it.
Ponzi scheme guy that went off the grid two years ago?<eos> He's a big-game hunter.<eos> - Of course he is.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> Landry has a passion, and he's got a lot of stolen money to indulge it.
It is fair.<eos> And you are way over the line.<eos> - Your Honor, I am asking... - Ms. Lockhart, I have made my ruling!<eos> You're welcome to proceed with your case.<eos> And I assure you I will give it all the consideration it deserves.
So you had the drop on our bad guy, and somehow, with him dead to rights, you let him get away?<eos> Look at me when I'm talking to ya.<eos> What happened to your fearless desire to die, officer?<eos> It--it's totally still there.<eos> Oh, it better be.
Call yourselves ostriches?<eos> I'm a lion!<eos> So this came out of a ostrich's bottom?<eos> That's why they're so bad tempered.<eos> Could you get an ostrich egg and push it back up its bottom?
What did you make of them... the Blaise-Hamiltons?<eos> They were... of their time.<eos> My father says that the Raj was a long injustice.<eos> But if it had not existed, then neither would I.<eos> The past can only hurt us if we let it.
The pillar's in the way.<eos> A little more this way.<eos> Her head will be here.<eos> That's a giant banyan.<eos> It's 400 or 500 years old.
I'm not a psychiatrist, Dr. Bloom.<eos> I'm curious, Mr. Ingram.<eos> Why did you become a social worker?<eos> Society needs caring people.<eos> It also needs a few psychopaths to keep the rest of us on our toes.
Dorm A, C and F, report to the cafeteria.<eos> Wet-nap?<eos> What the fuck am I supposed to do with this, eat it?<eos> Probably tastes better than this.<eos> Butter pecan, and it's from, like, two years ago.
Where he died, I think it's his own land.<eos> Have you got details of the probate?<eos> Yeah, it's just here.<eos> There.<eos> Yeah, it comes with a few hundred acres of scrub.
-Right. Coffee with milk.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Ponce-a-ccino with gingerbread.<eos> And an application for a restraining order for our Mr. Campion.<eos> It wasn't processed?
How are you doing it?<eos> Well, I closed me eyes, I tried counting sheep.<eos> But you two... you're like that.<eos> The spell!<eos> You're resisting it.
I know about your father.<eos> That's one of the reasons I came to you with this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Look, I'm FBI.<eos> I love the agency, I'm fiercely loyal to it.
Ahh!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Make his a double dose.<eos> Everyone, we've had a breakthrough.<eos> Ruffnut has determined that if you boil yak milk, you can freeze it on a stick and dip it in a variety of tasty flavorings, - including coconut.
I...<eos> I had something to do with that.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> I lent it to my brother when he got divorced.<eos> - If it makes any difference, it really helped.
I need some space, see if there's actually a future with Gabe.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind, right?<eos> Yeah, well, that's easier said than done with all of us trying to bust Sam.<eos> And, of course, with Gabe dead...<eos> Gabriel Lowan was a man of peace, a man who stood up to evil and faced it head-on.
Are you worried I plan to take the credit?<eos> I'm disappointed, Watson.<eos> I warned you repeatedly over the course of our partnership...<eos> There is no partnership!<eos> You ended it in that note you left me eight months ago.
But is there any way to prove it?<eos> No.<eos> It was, literally, the perfect crime.<eos> Then why do you look so happy?<eos> Because while this crime is perfect, the one that preceded it... was not.
Previously, on Reign...<eos> He heard them talk of a creature that resides in the woods.<eos> They give it blood.
And then what, he'll wear a necklace in jail?<eos> I mean...<eos> We'll take it off the chain.<eos> And then what?<eos> Sew it into his jumpsuit?
A Hundjager.<eos> He was kind of surprised.<eos> That's why I had time to get the machete.<eos> He thought I was just a girl.<eos> I wish I could have seen his face before you cut it off.
This is the oldest Eldanica pine in Natesville.<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - I do.<eos> I watched this tree grow up my whole life.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt it.
Boyfriend?<eos> You met him and you liked him.<eos> Mm-hmm. [♪♪♪] Wow.<eos> Look at this letter.<eos> It's 10 years old.
And you're not like Samson.<eos> He was kind of a mess.<eos> Not following you.<eos> Well, his story goes... that one day when a lion attacked him,<eos> God gave him strength and he tore it apart.
Yeah.<eos> I don't really like the taste, to be honest.<eos> First you hate it, then you love it.<eos> It's called beer.<eos> I won't let it go to waste, though.
I'll find Jason.<eos> I'll take it to him myself.<eos> You were the smartest guy in the neighborhood, and you've been a smart cop for a long time.<eos> Vince, all I'm asking is that you just ... take a look at my case.<eos> Give it two or three hours, and if you're not convinced, then just walk away.
We don't know what it's going to do, we don't know what's going to happen when it hatches... if it will hurt us, help us, or just leave us alone.<eos> We have to decide together.<eos> This is the last time we'll be able to speak to you, but you can send us a message.<eos> If you think we should kill the creature, turn your lights off.<eos> If you think we should take the chance let it live leave your lights on.
As each of you comes to your senses and takes my offer, I will destroy your vampire bodies.<eos> Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.<eos> Yes, but not in their current bodies.<eos> Once they accept my offer, I will be righting two wrongs... No.<eos> Having brought this evil into the world and having subjected my own children to it.
If you look closely at the physical evidence, you'll see that Hall wasn't killed by a sniper.<eos> He was shot close-range with a 9mm handgun.<eos> Really?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because after my wife died, I couldn't get Travis' face out of my mind, so I blew it off his head!
Mm.<eos> Well, the question is do we have you back?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> And I'm not gonna find out by hanging out with you.<eos> Well then, I guess you have to go out and find some wesen butt and kick it.
It's glorious, isn't it?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Are there just no laws in koreatown?<eos> Uh, well, uh,<eos> CeCe's agent saw Schmidt's portfolio and loved it.
Awake or asleep?<eos> Your choice.<eos> May be a few minutes before Lamashtu arrives, but she'll sniff out the blood.<eos> Now, do you remember the words?<eos> Take this child into your dark womb and give it eternal life.
Fine, 30 days.<eos> How does it work?<eos> You have a child, so for her sake, you two will live in the house as parents, but with separate lives, separate rooms.<eos> Boundaries are vital.<eos> Make a schedule for child-care responsibilities, and stick to it.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...<eos> [Siren]<eos> I promised you a confession.<eos> I didn't say it would be the one you wanted to hear.<eos> Morgan: "Our moral responsibility "is not to stop the future, "but to shape it.
Stuck-up bitch. Everybody liked you.<eos> Yeah, the real problem's Prady.<eos> His brand is just as strong.<eos> And he's announcing this week.<eos> Truth is, he'll get a big bump - from his announcement, so, we have to step on it.
But, Dara, just as my father once swore.<eos> I, too, was made to swear that I would not intervene in this affair of yours.<eos> Forgive me for being unable to help when you tried to save Angin.<eos> Now I see, why Cempaka asked Angin to come when she was going to teach me that move.<eos> Angin was to learn it, too, because the move can only be done in pairs.
But when we took the soul out of that body, she never woke up.<eos> The body was dying.<eos> The only way to save her was to put you inside.<eos> You haven't killed a body.<eos> You've given it life.
But that lady's a whore.<eos> Yeah, you, you fucking bitch.<eos> - No further questions.<eos> The state was very thorough.<eos> frankly, it had a Iot to make up for.
Thanks, bye.<eos> 'He's only human, isn't he?<eos> Knocking around that house every day, alone with your nanny.<eos> What is it they say?<eos> The best way to rid yourself of temptation is to yield to it?
- Who the hell are you?<eos> - It's obviously his son.<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's got Martin's face.<eos> Maybe that's why I wanna punch it.
He met a great girl named Allison down at the co-op.<eos> I don't know who loved her more...<eos> Kit or those kids.<eos> Kit always believed the kids were destined for great things.<eos> They grew up with that message, and they lived up to it.
Detectives Ryan and Esposito. NYPD.<eos> You were supposed to have eyes on Beau.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Beau told me to wait outside with the car.<eos> When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it.
Until one of us blinks.<eos> Deron signed it.<eos> You said it was great.<eos> I'm not interested in great.<eos> I want it to know who its daddy is.
It stood as sacrifice.<eos> For Spartacus.<eos> You believe him a God now?<eos> It was made on his behalf.<eos> To plead for his cause... and all those devoted to it.
And how dare you betray me like...<eos> Sheesh, if it were only that easy to shut him up after seeing The Help.<eos> I get it, Stan, you want a black maid.<eos> Wait, Klaus, why didn't you just switch into your body?<eos> 'Cause your idiot father let it sit and rot.
It's Leocritus's.<eos> I was with him enough to know.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> Not from Leocritus.<eos> A merchant gave it to me. He got it from a woman buying fabric. "For her wedding," she said.
Wikipedia.<eos> My God.<eos> Come on, Millsy - me and you, square go.<eos> Winner keeps the picture.<eos> Give it back, it's his sister.
Where have you been?<eos> At the station.<eos> I remembered Duke telling me about some riot gear the Feds sent us after 9/11.<eos> This is it?<eos> This stuff's... it's ten years old-- it loses effectiveness.
And now she's molesting him, right in front of us.<eos> Yeah, I guess that's a little weird.<eos> And here's the worst of all.<eos> This guy must have actually spoken his mind.<eos> Not only do they emasculate him with a muzzle, but they mask the obvious rights violation by making it a comical distraction.
Well, everything would have been planted at roughly the same time when the lot was converted into a park.<eos> So everything's of uniform age.<eos> Well, except for this oak tree.<eos> This tree's the same age as the others, just taller and lusher and healthier.<eos> Maybe it got more food than the other ones.
I'm worried about you, Harold.<eos> You can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.<eos> But we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.<eos> The future is coming.<eos> You started it... and I'll finish it.
Always smiling, hugging strangers.<eos> You'd sit in the backyard for hours just eating dirt.<eos> You let me, you let me eat dirt?<eos> Like, like dirt dirt?<eos> The body knows what it needs.
- I was a little enhanced.<eos> - Your body<eos> - should be able to do it again.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We just need to remind it how.
I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.<eos> You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.<eos> Howard, the medicine's not working!<eos> You just took it.<eos> At least let it reach your first stomach!
When I returned to the cabin, I... I could still feel its presence.<eos> It followed me back.<eos> I was afraid something like this would happen.<eos> I warned you not to tempt fate.<eos> Even if you're right, why would it kill this witch?
This drug is infused with the program to completely terminate it.<eos> which prevents us from entering.<eos> you can get close to it without being suspected.<eos> ARX II-13 requires repairs right now.<eos> and inject it with this drug when you power it up.
You could at least have knocked.<eos> Right, my results.<eos> No beating around the bush.<eos> I can't bear it. You have polyarteritis nodosa of the heart.<eos> Your heart is being enclosed in a fatty shell which protects it but stifles it.
Hi, Mr. Peterson. What can I do for you?<eos> What room was my fiancée in again?<eos> Let me check. 641.<eos> You're a fucking stud.<eos> Hey, when the legendary Donny Berger comes in here using a fake name, you go with it!
I just feel like I've let everyone down.<eos> Not everyone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can't fight this feeling any longer<eos> And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
You got to go after your dreams, Eric.<eos> I mean, if you don't make an effort, nothing's ever gonna change.<eos> You think?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You got to find your passion and then let it guide you, let it envelop...
The first plane.<eos> Fear not, brother Myron.<eos> I know my girls can lay it down.<eos> And, sister, the singing - it ain't the half of it.<eos> The show - it better be right on.
Ames killed her, right?<eos> Dumped her in discovery park.<eos> Where did he stow the girl on the ferry?<eos> In the hat rack?<eos> Ames could have gotten somebody to help clean it up, but we won't know that unless we can talk to him again!
You have, how should I put it?<eos> Desexed the creature.<eos> It is a bull, surely, Madam.<eos> It looks like a bull, it stands like a bull.<eos> But it lacks something of the male vigour.
So you are not turning yourself in.<eos> Here's your ring, Ric.<eos> Put it on.<eos> That ring is the reason I've killed people.<eos> It's also the reason you're alive.
Primitive, but it worked.<eos> Now there's over a hundred, hundred different ways to say the same thing.<eos> Does it make any sense to you?<eos> Change is the nature of life.<eos> Mankind will always do what it needs to ensure its own survival.
Lady, as you are mine, I am yours.<eos> I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.<eos> Speak, cousin, or if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.<eos> In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.<eos> Yea, my lord, I thank it. Poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.
Terry?<eos> There's an oik outside...<eos> I'm a clerk, and I'm a man.<eos> My name is Billy Lamb.<eos> When he gets down here, you tell your clerk that you're dropping it against my boy, or I will end your life.
Dust and food...<eos> For worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
This one's on the house, Cleave.<eos> Oh, Tom!<eos> Mate!<eos> And here's the Canadian survey on mandatory sentencing.<eos> It's a few years old.
I didn't.<eos> I put it on the counter, and people put the bereavement food around it.<eos> Pfft. Whatever.<eos> I think I did you a favor, anyway.<eos> It needed sugar.
I put it on the counter, and people put the bereavement food around it.<eos> Pfft. Whatever.<eos> I think I did you a favor, anyway.<eos> It needed sugar.<eos> It didn't have sugar, Axl, 'cause it wasn't food.
Humility is for humans.<eos> Do you know what I admire the most about you?<eos> Clearly not my ability to take orders.<eos> Your heart.<eos> You still let it rule you.
Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Where's the murder weapon?<eos> Chimney...<eos> Top of my grandma's building.<eos> It better be.
Oh, you should try it, Andrew.<eos> It feels good.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> All I know is that the wounds to the good father's neck are up-close and personal.<eos> You ask me, some angry dad found out about the love nest and put an end to it.
Hm.<eos> I was just starting to enjoy myself.<eos> Ah!<eos> A couple of chaps are going to have a drink at their suite.<eos> First rule with temptation, yield to it slowly.
Dust and food...<eos> For worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
Move the wedding cake.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> - And I did.<eos> Tamara had singlehandedly saved my sanity all day, and I needed to return the favor.<eos> If she couldn't escape her past, then I would recount it.
I can tell you that it's as hopeless as everything else around here.<eos> What is that?<eos> It injects a tiny microchip under the skin, allowing the carrier to interact and control the building.<eos> E- mail, heating and lighting. Security too.<eos> If we are to solve this case, we must become one with the technology that surrounds it.
Olivia.<eos> I saw how you were with our little girl.<eos> I know how much you love her.<eos> And I'm not telling you to forget it, but... the past is the past.<eos> Don't let it get in the way of this.
Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you, sir. Well done, Mr. Taylor.<eos> Maybe you'll have better luck this time.<eos> Oh, the Liz and Dick show doesn't need luck, no.<eos> No, what it needs is a new script.
I'd need to do some research.<eos> I want you to tell Lord and Lady Grantham what you have almost admitted to me.<eos> But...<eos> But there WAS a chance.<eos> Dr Clarkson, you have created a division between my son and his wife, when the only way they can conceivably bear their grief is if they face it together.
Yes, please.<eos> Close your eyes. Yes.<eos> My eyes are now closed.<eos> Now I want you to just let your mind wander.<eos> Let it wander wherever it wants to go.
Thirty-two grand a year, to start with?<eos> (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)<eos> Dad, Dad, come on, just consider it, please?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, well, I've planted the seed and now I'll just let it grow.
Just keep an eye on the clock.<eos> If we don't leave in 20, we're gonna be late.<eos> Thank you, Bruce.<eos> Good luck with the new hive.<eos> This body-- when's it being autopsied?
What's his beef with Chaya?<eos> Two summers ago,<eos> Dell interned at Chaya's company.<eos> While he was there, he pitched an idea for a file-sharing application.<eos> He was told it wasn't feasible, but later Chaya had his attorneys patent it in the company's name.
So it is really builder's tea ?<eos> Yes.<eos> We dunk biscuits into it.<eos> You " dunk " ?<eos> Well, it means lowering the biscuit into the tea... and letting it soak in there... and trying to calculate the exact moment before the biscuit dissolves... when you can whip it up into your mouth... and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined.
I hope so.<eos> All right, let's check it out.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Ta-da. (sighs)<eos> You didn't leave enough room in the dish to let it rise.
That's not true.<eos> You haven't always made the right choices, and you once gave up on yourself and those around you.<eos> I'm not giving up on you, Oliver.<eos> You have a good heart.<eos> Let it guide you.
I brought this for you.<eos> Did you buy me a plant?<eos> It's an epiphyte.<eos> It's perfect for you.<eos> It doesn't require soil.
Did you buy me a plant?<eos> It's an epiphyte.<eos> It's perfect for you.<eos> It doesn't require soil.<eos> You don't need to water it.
It's perfect for you.<eos> It doesn't require soil.<eos> You don't need to water it.<eos> It absorbs moisture from the air.<eos> It doesn't even need roots.
What I know is that if we don't change this and begin helping him, we will all pay the price.<eos> But Nelec won't listen.<eos> He wasn't trying to kill it.<eos> He'll have me discharged.<eos> He was trying to help it escape.
I don't know what happened.<eos> It's all just going away.<eos> Daddy.<eos> You built that place.<eos> You gave it every ounce of blood and sweat that you had in you.
And... hell, he'd walk into a store, seen something he liked, he'd buy the store out of every goddamn item he wanted and give the shit away.<eos> And that's crazy.<eos> But that Bernie, he liked to make people smile.<eos> He wanted friends.<eos> Acceptance, I guess, is what you call it.
What's radical is logging 95%.<eos> This is radical.<eos> This is a piece of a big old tree.<eos> This tree probably sprouted just about the time... Columbus sailed the ocean blue.<eos> It looks about 500 years old, somewhere in there.
But it always came back to one thing...<eos> Good...<eos> And evil...<eos> How the righteous need to see evil<eos> And resist it with everything that they have.
You started to praise it, didn't you?<eos> Rita, come back.<eos> Please. We'll find a way to stop it, I swear to you.<eos> No, I need to get as far away from you all as possible.<eos> The creature only wants whoever's praising it.
Hey.<eos> What, did something happen already?<eos> And we're off.<eos> Let the awkward silence begin.<eos> I thought that would break the tension, but clearly it just... Shines a light on it.
I thought I would not be cardinal for today.<eos> Then my heart is in danger.<eos> Would you endanger it, Cardinal Borgia?<eos> I would put it in fear of its life.<eos> But I would never harm it.
Yes!<eos> To the victor, the spoils.<eos> Did you plant that tree?<eos> Steady on.<eos> It must be 40 years old.
- You didn't give us anything.<eos> How high does this go?<eos> How involved are you in this?<eos> I will not be tried by the press.<eos> I'm going to use the same legal system that's being turned against me and I'm gonna put this business where it belongs-- in the trash.
The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it.<eos> If you don't understand...<eos> I think I can avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.<eos> I don't wanna find out you're wrong by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.<eos> I'm a big believer that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit and pour lye on it.
So, uh...<eos> Hi.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> Um, Brick asked me to look for loopholes in his partnership agreement with Harley.<eos> It's 25 years old, so I hadn't seen it.
Where'd you get it?<eos> They were all destroyed.<eos> It's wrong of you to strip us of our power.<eos> There was a time for witchcraft. Time is long gone.<eos> There's no place for it in this world anymore.
But it can be risky, feeding like that, especially for a kid.<eos> Jacob got sick.<eos> He was dying, and the only way to fight it off was --<eos> He needed fresh meat.<eos> It worked.
I don't...<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> He's right.<eos> Your body... it's like a dolphin.<eos> Give it a little spank.
A word of caution, if you will. Of course.<eos> Our government is deep in this affair.<eos> It touches closely upon the personal interests of several of its members.<eos> Who enjoy their own properties in the West Indies, no doubt.<eos> They cannot now prevent the prosecution, too late for that, but they can hinder it, and perhaps grievously. Is that so?
Duck, I wish I had that Yogi Berra book of quotes for any occasion.<eos> You know, Jethro, psychotic behavior is so bizarre, yet I just can't understand how I could have missed it.<eos> I'll never trust my judgment again.<eos> You won't have to, Duck.<eos> We'll trust it for you.
If I wasn't here, would you have chosen him?<eos> There was never choice.<eos> The girls are here.<eos> If I wasn't going to let fate influence my decisions, I wouldn't let some vile letter do it either.<eos> It was time to put my past where it belonged.
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Look at the edges...<eos> they're smooth, defined.<eos> They're easier to cut around.<eos> Yes, if I can keep my entire dissection inside and never let it drift outside...
Ruby.<eos> It's wonderful watching Ruby starting to speak.<eos> I want to know more about how children manage this miraculous process, so I've come to see a bit of a hero of mine - the renowned academic and author, Professor Steven Pinker.<eos> I wondered if you could explain to me what current thinking might be about language acquisition.<eos> Presumably, it needs society, it needs encouraging.
Because you made it up.<eos> It's not even a good picture.<eos> That isn't even a good spider.<eos> It's a heart-shaped thing.<eos> You started off doing a heart, it was probably a love letter, then you went, "I'll put some legs on it".
He's my old boss, your wife is his new... employee.<eos> So you think we should dump it?<eos> I think if Will Gardner were anybody else, we wouldn't go forward, and that's the rule you've used until now.<eos> I know, which is why we have to go forward, unfortunately.<eos> If it were just anyone else, we'd pursue it.
It's just the way it has to be.<eos> Arthur... don't let anyone tell you what to do.<eos> You said you are your own man.<eos> You've a good heart.<eos> Be true to it.
For Galvani, what was going on there was that there's a strange, special kind of entity in the animal muscle, which he calls animal electricity.<eos> It's not like any other electricity.<eos> It's intrinsic to living beings.<eos> But for Volta, animal electricity smacked of superstition and magic.<eos> It had no place in rational and enlightened science.
That one there or that one there or that one there...<eos> That's the point, that allows you to use the Roman alphabet to find the characters, otherwise it would be impossible.<eos> 'So, it is the simplicity of the alphabet, 'and the ability easily to rearrange letters, 'that gives it its potency as a tool for spreading the word.'<eos> Johannes Gutenberg's great innovation was to combine the Chinese invention - block printing - with typography - the art and technique of arranging type moveably.<eos> Movable type freed the written word from the drudgery of hand-scribing and allowed it to take flight in printed texts.
- Did I?<eos> - You certainly did!<eos> I did!<eos> I know I did, and I'm sorry, Lyle, and you.<eos> But I'm an actress, and when I see a word, I bring it to life, just like I did in not so well-received production of "Wood for Laney" - story of Hawaiian mother with wooden arms, who desperately wanted to dance hula.
Okay, I'll get you a beer.<eos> Awesome, thanks.<eos> Can I get one, too?<eos> No.<eos> He needs it; it's an emergency.
Evil can sometimes be hard to recognize.<eos> It hides in normal things.<eos> People you think you know.<eos> But recognizing evil isn't the hardest part.<eos> It's standing up to it, even when nobody else will.
Why does this keep happening to me?<eos> - Just relax.<eos> Take your medicine.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Why does it have balls?
I had the same necklace years ago from his father.<eos> I don't have a father.<eos> She sold it to keep a roof over my head.<eos> She's a good egg, your mom.<eos> I promised you I'd replace it, didn't I?
- Don't you?<eos> Try, go on. The spaceship that could never fly, no vibration on deck.<eos> This creature - this poor, trapped, terrified creature.<eos> It's not infesting you, it's not invading - it's what you have instead of an engine.<eos> And this place down here is where you hurt it, where you torture it, day after day, just to keep it moving.
Rustic faith.<eos> Something handed down.<eos> I wonder... Perhaps it might cause offence.<eos> Do you suppose we ought to remove the... implement from the tree?<eos> Powers of the North, Guardians of the Earth, consecrate this tree and charge it with your vitalities.
- How so?<eos> - I'm your husband.<eos> I own 50% of whatever comes out of that uterus.<eos> Oh! So you think you own my body.<eos> I pay for the clothes it wears, the massages it receives and the implants it will one day require.
Monica felt bad after the first bunk, so she made a bit of an effort to get onside, right?<eos> Yeah, then she fucked off again.<eos> Meaning, Liam's seen it all before.<eos> It's all about trust, yeah?<eos> I've had to earn it, time and again.
What are you talking about?<eos> To take in Lucifer, it would be more than you've ever drunk.<eos> But... why?<eos> It strengthens the vessel.<eos> Keeps it from exploding.
We fixed up the guest room on the third floor.<eos> He has a nice TV, a DVD player, cable.<eos> We even put an orthopedic handrail in the shower for him.<eos> My father has arthritis in his left knee.<eos> So when it flares up, Standing becomes difficult for him.
Warden, please.<eos> Ma'am, I live in a world of rules.<eos> I don't try to cut corners.<eos> I don't try to bend the truth.<eos> I make an agreement, and I stick to it.
Been dead at least 24 hours.<eos> This looks like a hatchet job.<eos> Tissue's necrotic.<eos> No contusions on the wounds caused by the hatchet.<eos> Yeah, this animal was dead before someone separated it from its head.
Don't what?<eos> Don't overthink it, okay?<eos> That feeling in your gut... you gotta learn to listen to it.<eos> It's telling you what you need to do.<eos> You gotta learn to trust it.
It's time to move on.<eos> You know, I don't think you' supposed to loiter out here.<eos> I have a feeling this building is supposed to blend in.<eos> People smoke outside of buildings, Will.<eos> I'm helping it blend.
And this menu - this twanging laminated card - big as a riot policeman's shield.<eos> Hmm. At first glance, pizzas by the yard.<eos> More pizzas than there should be.<eos> And too much designer pizzazz.<eos> Choose the right wine and have it ready breathing for when she arrives.
Beautiful!<eos> Great-looking.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> And the transparency made everything seem light and luxurious.<eos> He really gave it everything, and it was special.
- Dream conundrum.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The bad memory is manifesting itself.<eos> It didn't want to be exposed.<eos> Our dream bullets don't hurt it.
I really...<eos> I'm really liking more is more.<eos> You know?<eos> I mean, let's not try to tame this space, okay?<eos> Let's just let it be like lush, overgrown, fecund.
Well, perhaps I have a stronger conscience.<eos> Conscience is just a polite term for cowardice.<eos> No civilised man regrets a pleasure.<eos> You see?<eos> The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.
She was right.<eos> I wasn't there anymore.<eos> I'd become addicted to a lifestyle of money, sex and power that was light years away from family or anything I'd ever experienced.<eos> You see, the biggest problem with my addiction, was that like all addictions, it sneaks up on you slowly.<eos> You give into it incrementally, in an almost imperceptible way.
We could hold him on the gun, But there's no match with ballistics on Mrs. Delgado.<eos> And without other evidence to link him to the other homicide-<eos> I'll find something, sir.<eos> Not if his alibi checks out.<eos> Sir, it's just pots and kettles.
Look, let's meet and talk about this.<eos> The time for talking passed the time you put those ski masks on, don't you think?<eos> So here's what I'm gonna do, Michael.<eos> I'm gonna shoot Lincoln through the right rib cage just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung.<eos> It'll slowly collapse, making it very difficult to breathe.
I... admire it.<eos> And...my stockings?<eos> Oh I adore them.<eos> And my dress?<eos> I worship it.
Just wait for me... I'm the man who will become the Emperor of Xing Ling Yao!<eos> What the hell is a brat doing here?<eos> Ah, well.<eos> Let me have your body.<eos> I'll put it to good use.
This show is about helping people.<eos> No, no, it's not.<eos> You know what I see when I watch it?<eos> I see a lot of miserable people and you taking their money.<eos> Just try to give it a chance.
I have to get ahold of roth.<eos> - Look, g-g-give me till 5:00.<eos> - I'm coming back at 4:00.<eos> And when I come back, I want good newsor you're my next dead-ee.<eos> And that's why I like to saythat trust is a bridge, and it needsa strong foundation.
- Unless there was another false image.<eos> - Hang on, hang on.<eos> Everything about her was a lie.<eos> All of her vital signs were a false image.<eos> She can fool the equipment, tell it what we're expecting to see, so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate, we try and freeze it and it does the opposite.
Using this telepathic power to conceal itself.<eos> What, by making itself invisible?<eos> Or by posing as one of us.<eos> It can make us see things that aren't even real.<eos> But why would it hang around?
No, you're not going to die, Eric.<eos> AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment.<eos> Not a big deal?<eos> Is that how everyone feels?<eos> People need to understand the seriousness of this illness and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
R uairi MacLeish has killed every witness that could tie him to a criminal charge.<eos> R uairi MacLeish beat and killed M r. Smith at least five days ago, possibly a week.<eos> Which makes it at least two days before the body in the field was murdered.<eos> We still have no idea who the burned body is.<eos> But, for some reason, he swallowed a ring with Wanda's name on it.
Are you sure you want...<eos> Bad Horse! Bad Horse! Bad Horse!<eos> He rides across the nation the thoroughbred of sin.<eos> He got the application that you just sent in.<eos> It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
Not for me.<eos> I'm finally free.<eos> I'm not haunted anymore.<eos> Your heart had six years to rest,<eos> Which is... Probably enough time for it to repair itself,
Andr? Leon talley is raving About the finale dress, loved it.
I've waited nine years.<eos> I think that merits dinner.<eos> You didn't eat that ring, did you?<eos> No, not yet. Good.<eos> It's nine years old.
Just tell him.<eos> Tonight.<eos> So tell us.<eos> Two of your triplets are sharing the same blood vessels and circulation system.<eos> This baby's heart is pumping too hard because it's not getting enough blood.
Who knows what it's like in here now?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Send someone to get Gavin's body.<eos> I don't want it lying in the road.
Moss can't do it, he's slightly concussed.<eos> Yeah, all right, I'll go.<eos> Er, I won't be here this afternoon, I've... I've got a job interview.<eos> Oh, OK, good for you, Jen.<eos> Seriously, we don't need a manager, it's a non-job.
It's that bonkers a choice, it's that terrible a car.<eos> The thing is about the Infinity...<eos> Can we see the Infinity again?<eos> That is actually just a Nissan with a posh name.<eos> It's like people who buy a normal house in the middle of a road, number 22, but then give it a name.
On the opening page the document states its objective.<eos> "The purpose of this booklet is to describe the basic process of money creation in a 'fractional reserve' banking system."<eos> It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process through various banking terminology.<eos> A translation of which goes something like this:<eos> The United States government decides it needs some money.
If you can.<eos> You did what I could.<eos> The family besides you fall to pieces In the next few hours.<eos> Mother ...<eos> At the end of the period of mourning We usually serve it to the poor and to the monks.
Milk? Honey?<eos> A bit of honey, please.<eos> I hope you like flies in your honey.<eos> Oh, perhaps not.<eos> Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.
The tango originated in 1883 in a bordello somewhere and Jorge Luis Borges calls it dance of grieving husbands.<eos> The tango introduced the idea of utter solemnity as the dancers move backwards and forwards.<eos> The tango is the dance which most obviously suggests the union between Thanatos and Eros.<eos> It is in this ram-tam-tam-tam movement, as elegant as death, as powerful as birth, that the basic elements of life are united, and changes in form are the best indicators of how time corrects thoughts and how we all risk speaking nonsense whenever we open our mouths.<eos> The fact that the tango originated in the bordello of yesteryear gives it an innocence that could never be found in the bordello of today.
As with all things Fletcher, it's impossible to prove anything.<eos> Still, if Carney's good Christian wife ever comes to the same conclusion as yourself,<eos> Fletcher's chances of marrying their daughter would be dashed. I'm going to the authorities and I will be telling them...<eos> Carney is the authority here.<eos> Are you suggesting I let him steal my cattle and buy my property for a fraction of what it's worth?
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.<eos> We really have to get this shot.<eos> The video doesn't make sense without it.<eos> It's a fucking video, Martin.<eos> It doesn't need to make sense.
That's all we've ever had in this country is a bill of temporary privileges.<eos> And if you read the news even badly you know that every year the list gets shorter and shorter and shorter. You see how silly that is. Yeah.<eos> Sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government does not give a fuck about them.<eos> The government doesn't care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety.<eos> It simply doesn't give a fuck about you.
In the mud in France.<eos> A good, solid man.<eos> You would call him dull, no doubt, but he smiled whenever he saw me, and we could've built a life on that.<eos> Your heart knows the truth, Delysia.<eos> Trust it, for life is short.
Freedom.<eos> Imagination.<eos> I think your imagination is a little over-excited.<eos> Not excited enough.<eos> I intend to excite it a great deal more.
Is she your wife?<eos> I don't know you well enough to have this conversation.<eos> Chief, you paged?<eos> Close the door.<eos> You had the nerve to tell a patient you would perform awake open-heart surgery without running it past me?
Previously on Studio 60:<eos> Jack, the show's not going to be good on Friday.<eos> It can't be. Doesn't have to be good.
He's gonna be stationed in Bermuda.<eos> Jack...<eos> The show's not gonna be good this week.<eos> It can't be.<eos> It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be on.
However, to be fair, that doesn't mean defenders of the Historical Jesus haven't claimed the contrary.<eos> Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus's existence.<eos> Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Tacitus are the first three. Each one of their entries consists of only a few sentences at best and only refer to the Christus or the Christ, which in fact is not name but a title.<eos> It means the "Anointed one".<eos> The fourth source is Josephus and this source has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years. Sadly, it is still sited as truth.
Are you insane?<eos> "That fucking number. "<eos> "When I circled every 23rd letter of her note... It became clear. "<eos> "The number had gone after me.<eos> And now it wanted her. "
They found his car in a motel in Fresno.<eos> Now, either he was in a hurry, or he got taken.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Taken?<eos> - Your life may be in danger, yours and Lucy's.

Slutty, but artful.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is she yours?

- FOXP2. Yes, that's how gene names are. They are strange letters and numbers.<eos> FOXP2 is currently the biggest foot we have in this door.<eos> What the genetic make-up is and how we evolved language and how language or speech, at least, functions.<eos> The FOXP2 gene is what's called a forkhead box protein, found on human chromosome 7.<eos> All mammals have it and, in fact, there are only two amino acids different between ours and the chimps' and just three between us and mice.

Nerthin.<eos> Listen.<eos> When I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated and your skin flushed.<eos> And I'm assuming a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.<eos> A little bit of blood rushed into mine as well. So where does that leave us?

- I need something else to do, man.<eos> - Ricky, let's go.<eos> I need to go bowling or something.<eos> So sorry.<eos> We've got to get you a bus like mine.

Couldn't have put it better myself, master.<eos> I don't think you could.<eos> Ha!<eos> Agree.<eos> Possibility of your explanation being better than mine, less than 1%.

Not only do you love pigeons, but you sound like one.<eos> Listen, I'm not gonna make fun of Mike Tyson, because if he--<eos> That's right. 'Cause I'm gonna shit on you tonight.<eos> That's right. I know, I know.<eos> If you're willing to do that to your face, imagine what he would do to mine.

Your duty is to obey.<eos> Brother, there is a great war being fought all around us.<eos> Our enemy is the devil himself, and in this war.<eos> He waits a life time and an eternity for a single moment of weakness.<eos> Such as yours.

You just couldn't stand to let me shine.<eos> Your nostrils are flaring so much right now, it's distracting.<eos> I'm done letting you run the court.<eos> I'm building my own court.<eos> And it's gonna be bigger and yummier than yours.

Captain's moving me over to Western.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Calling it a promotion, which is what they called it when they split us up.<eos> I figure they don't want my desk anywhere near yours.

No, you're not.<eos> Hey!<eos> Chuck, sword!<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Mine's bigger than yours.
No, you're not.<eos> Hey!<eos> Chuck, sword!<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Mine's bigger than yours.
I'm really tired this time, a complete idiot.<eos> "Yes, I put myself at your knees<eos> "And do you want that I had it for you?<eos> "Our mouths touch, it's nothing<eos> "My laughter will depend on yours

Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.<eos> But I still want one.<eos> Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.<eos> They are called phil<eos> Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.

Now, which brings us to our last item, and again please excuse the language in Mr. Kowalski's will.<eos> I'm simply reading it the way it was written.<eos> "And I'd like to leave my 1 972 Gran Torino to my friend Thao Vang Lor on the condition that you don't chop-top the roof like one of those beaners don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads' cars.<eos> It just looks like hell.<eos> If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours."

Yeah, and you, uh...<eos> You think your, uh, new buddy is still in there?<eos> Alive or dead.<eos> Mother... Come on!<eos> This shit isn't mine.
It may help my husband more off my finger.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was a very beautiful thing to do.<eos> Here.<eos> You can have mine too.
It's the job.<eos> Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a...<eos> It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...<eos> "Connections"?<eos> He owns it.
Grave dirt?<eos> I thought maybe diamonds, or that gold ring she stole from Cleopatra's tomb.<eos> So we're excited about a box of dirt.<eos> Anyone wanna clue me in?<eos> If you have a vampire's grave dirt, you can use it to summon them.
You mean, you blackmailed him.<eos> - Well... - For this data cache to have exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it has to be huge.<eos> I think the term is "beyond massive."<eos> What?<eos> One of the last things my dad said to me when he gave me the rags was that they hold a power most people could never even imagine and that I needed to respect and guard that power, not abuse it.
Prove me wrong.<eos> All that pain and anger... you think it's strength.<eos> It's not.<eos> You think can harness it... you can't.<eos> You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be.
- Hey, you know what, Judy?<eos> We were tryin' to keep a low profile here, so, you might wanna go somewhere to hose off and leave us be.<eos> Still mad at me after all these years, aren't you?<eos> - You stole my turntable.<eos> - You weren't using it.
You are mistaken, my lord.<eos> I do not endorse bloodshed and lawlessness.<eos> But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?
You would find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you run from it.<eos> Well, that's comforting.<eos> Is there nothing else you desire?<eos> Everything I've ever wanted, I've got.<eos> Magic is real, and it can fix anything except what I need.
She died rushing from her job to pick up our children.<eos> What the hell does any of this have to do with smoking?<eos> It shouldn't have anything to do with it, but this company is not in the business of helping people.<eos> It's in the business of making money.<eos> So if they can find any reason not to honor a claim, they'll take it.
I saw your interview.<eos> And I heard about your interest in the Minority Trade Commission.<eos> Stern and Councilman Leonard are pushing you into it, right?<eos> No, no, you know, I just got to a place in my life where I felt I should give back.<eos> Well, a development loan can be a good thing if it's used properly.
Our universe is dying.<eos> We've watched the progress of a billion years' worth of entropy and fed off the slow disintegration into the chaos of our world.<eos> Now there's nothing left to sustain us.<eos> This universe is younger.<eos> We can feed off of it for over a billion years.
An act of God.<eos> I mean, this stuff was staggeringly effective.<eos> But then, they banned it under the Brussels Act.<eos> And yet, here we are, using it.<eos> You give a monkey a stick, inevitably he'll beat another monkey to death with it.
Ask yourself a question:<eos> What will a Magician need if dark days come?<eos> Answer: magic.<eos> But if it is gone, it is gone, you say.<eos> Not so, if you store it like a battery.
- I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.<eos> - I always thought I had some kind of... God-level good luck.<eos> - True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.
I'm listening.<eos> We have money... a lot of it.<eos> And we're willing to spend it in any way that makes our lives easier, including lining the right pockets in Caracas.<eos> I was just waiting to hear what your goal was.<eos> Even if I had that information, I wouldn't share it with two men who represent a firm that doesn't exist.
- Yes, but I barely have a team in place.<eos> Well, you can run it by the former president...<eos> The former president is just that.<eos> - An opportunity has presented itself.<eos> - And I'm trying to take advantage of it.
Right.<eos> Yes, well, we both know that I don't have a sense of humor at times.<eos> But, uh, yes, I am taking my leave.<eos> What do you mean, "leave"?<eos> This team has functioned far better in my absence than it ever did under my leadership.
You see, I do give a shit about how prisoners are treated, which means you are gonna tell the court exactly what you just told us.<eos> Did you not hear what I just said?<eos> It came back down on me like a concrete block.<eos> This is my career. I...<eos> I am not gonna go on record and jeopardize it.

You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> If it doesn't work, we can just swing it around and break stuff, so it's kind of a win-win.
Any interest in goin' to a weddin', no?<eos> I'll see ya around, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dates.<eos> No matter how great life is, it's always better when you have someone special to share it with.
What does that mean, Mr. Bailey?<eos> That means arresting drunk and disorderlies.<eos> Sorry, Your Honor.<eos> Slipped into some. Marine-to-Marine talk there.<eos> Detective, did you take a glove from the Bundy scene and then wipe it on the interior of the Bronco?
You do.<eos> I'm done with fighting.<eos> Even if it's to protect yourself?<eos> Violence is a disease.<eos> You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
Try and find out why he's been so bloody sour lately.<eos> Shouldn't go looking through other people's private things.<eos> He's my son.<eos> The bullet was mine.<eos> I never got a chance to fire it.
Makes me sick just looking at all three of you.<eos> Sick to my stomach.<eos> You see that paddle over there?<eos> That paddle used to belong to my father when he was a principal.<eos> You wanna throw punches in the hallway? I will pull that paddle down and it will swing.
According to the Gospel of Matthew, when John the Baptist baptized Christ, the sky opened and a voice called out those exact words.<eos> Christ was supposedly baptized when he turned 30.<eos> It was my 30th birthday the day she grabbed me.<eos> And you were covered in her blood, weren't you?<eos> Baptized in it.
It seems that at his wife's request, Spector now has a solicitor.<eos> Sean Healy.<eos> To my mind, he is an arrogant, manipulative, too-clever-by-half bastard.<eos> But he's a winner.<eos> If there is a loophole, he's going to exploit it.
No.<eos> A dollar barely used to be enough for the jukebox in here.<eos> I could get used to these prices.<eos> I know how they got to Justin and the armory so quickly.<eos> They have this huge database of information, and, more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to manipulate it.
There's a woman running a unit.<eos> I've seen her type before when I was deployed.<eos> Ex-CIA, if I had to guess.<eos> Tell Katie her intel needs to outweigh the damage that her husband is doing to us.<eos> They have this huge database of information and more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to manipulate it.
In the 13th century he provoked a war between two great empires.<eos> The Ottomans and the Holy Romans.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he wanted the world to be wet with blood.<eos> The peasants believed that he fed upon it.
The French police found five shell casings but only three bullets.<eos> One in Sabine, two in the wall behind her.<eos> And what exactly piqued your interest in a case two years old and almost 4,000 miles away?<eos> Mason left his facial recognition software on our computers.<eos> I used it to search for pictures of your father online.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> I told you I needed the car after school today.<eos> Uh, I don't remember that, and actually I need it to get to work after rehearsal.<eos> Well, the car doesn't belong to you.<eos> We all have to share it and you have it most of the time anyway.
S-So?<eos> You're gripping it so tight, your knuckles are white.<eos> And what would happen if you dropped it right now on the dirty floor?<eos> I would pick it up and move on.<eos> You'd never use it again, and you'd throw it away.
- Oh, you're a bad man.<eos> - I'm a bad man.<eos> Oh, you run it.<eos> I run this cellblock.<eos> - Yeah, you run it.
Lovers of Liberty, we are back.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Ah, power.<eos> Power, my dear lovers of Liberty, is the beating heart of our nation's bosom.<eos> The high and mighty members of the political elite feed on it, breed on it, for power is the host, the enormous teat off which this entire town suckles.
Sorry in advance. Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Have at it, assholes.<eos> Hey, Dinesh, nice chain.<eos> Do you choke your mother with it when you put your penis in her butthole?
Is there a point here?<eos> You're gonna miss it.<eos> The wars.<eos> The fights.<eos> Crafting an agenda and seeing it through, going toe-to-toe with Senate Dems, rallying Tea Party support for a judicial nominee.
You didn't know you plagiarized your paper?<eos> From a famous paper, by the way.<eos> In fact, when I was in college,<eos> I wrote a paper about this very paper.<eos> Well, I was, like, inspired by it.
I've been wondering for a long time now... what's your plan for me?<eos> To be a shepherd to your flock.<eos> To tend to them and the church.<eos> But I failed at that.<eos> So why did you give me this power if... if I can't use it to save them?
Ain't she a beaut?<eos> Is that for you and Gabi tonight?<eos> Oh, this tent?<eos> Oh, ah... it's not just for me and Gabi.<eos> Anyone can use it, really.
- A Lycanthrope.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Like a Blutbad on steroids.<eos> Make sure the isolation cell is available.<eos> We're gonna use it.
Hell, we even played trivia.<eos> What do Nancy Sinatra, Freddie Mercury, and Brittany Spears all have in common?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You people turn their music into a misery.<eos> Use it to torture prisoners.
There's much work to do, great work.<eos> As each second passes, I push myself to keep moving.<eos> You're making me think I should invest in a decent watch.<eos> Now, if I may ask, how does a young woman from New Jersey find her way into the FBI?<eos> I was... I am... disgusted by the selfish brutality of the world, but at the same time, I'm utterly fascinated by it.
we've ever encountered, so, if that's all you got, you should go... but I'm a father now, and if these bombs make it here and, God forbid, they, "rain fire on our cities and bring death to millions," I at least want to know that<eos> I did everything we could to stop it, even when it was hard and seemed hopeless.<eos> That's very moving, Jay.<eos> But I repeat:<eos> If Hizb Al-Shahid terrorists have a bomb, they'll want to use it, and that is an idea we can actually work with.
This is my rifle.<eos> There are many like it; this one is mine.<eos> My rifle is my best friend.<eos> It is my life.<eos> I must master it as I must master my life.
Roza. You look so smart.<eos> Once a secretary, always a secretary.<eos> 'Roza Mphaphane was appointed clinic administrator, which gave her 'dignity and purpose, and the hospital the chance to thrive.<eos> 'Clean water and renewed and increased funding from 'the mission made Hope Clinic viable again.<eos> 'It could at last look to the future with the woman who served it 'for so many years restored to her place as its beating heart.'
You know what?<eos> This book, it intrigues me.<eos> It's the only reason you are still breathing.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> I'm waiting to use it.
Your body is beginning to reject the changes we made to your DNA.<eos> You feel it every time you use... your ability.<eos> How do I fix it?<eos> Stop using the power.<eos> Every time you use it, new cells are activated, and your body rejects them.
Don't laugh-- she wasn't joking. Play with your phone.<eos> Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology. I don't have a mythology.<eos> I have the unerring Word of God. But that's very interesting.<eos> Oh.<eos> I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
- Can they do this?<eos> - Of course.<eos> She pushed too far.<eos> Or they couldn't handle having a strong woman in power.<eos> Power only works if you know how to not abuse it.
When you first appeared on the scene six years ago, the evidence suggests it was the work of a single man.<eos> It was a uniquely destructive force.<eos> Other serial bombers-- like Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky-- they were motivated by a misguided grudge against society, but the Bensonhurst Bomber was driven by something darker.<eos> He's not seeking revenge, he just has a passion for making things go bang.<eos> But the thing about passion is it can be taught, it can be learned.
If I can get used to the idea of you being with my brother, then you can get used to the idea of me being with Sam.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, I'm sorry.<eos> And here. You're taking Emma tonight.<eos> Since I spent all day setting up a campsite, I'm actually gonna go use it.
- You have a gun.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why?<eos> Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?
Drink a couple of beers with buddies after.<eos> Rent videos on the weekend with your wildly underwhelming wife.<eos> Forget you ever met me.<eos> Pretend that you have exorcised all of your demons.<eos> Son, I have prepared you for this life, but I-I cannot make you want it.
Even now, caught red-handed, and you still can't admit it.<eos> No, that would be you.<eos> You broke into my place.<eos> So if you can't be nice, Valerie, you know where the door is.<eos> Use it.
You were kind to me, even after you found out I was not human.<eos> I don't want you to die.<eos> - Then deactivate the bomb.<eos> - I can't.<eos> It's inside me, but I have no control over it.
Holy shit, Dirk,<eos> I get it.<eos> I get everything.<eos> Listen, before we go into the hotel, now is the time for us to take a moment, and think, really think about how we're going to do this.<eos> We have a unique opportunity here, and we need to be careful how we use it.
All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Confess.<eos> If you're arrested, tried and convicted, I might be able to persuade them that justice has been done.<eos> If Jimmy Koslow was offered the same opportunity, I think he'd have taken it.
You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> If it doesn't work, we can just swing it around and break stuff, so it's kind of a win-win.

Don't laugh-- she wasn't joking. Play with your phone.<eos> Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology. I don't have a mythology.<eos> I have the unerring Word of God. But that's very interesting.<eos> Oh.<eos> I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
- Can they do this?<eos> - Of course.<eos> She pushed too far.<eos> Or they couldn't handle having a strong woman in power.<eos> Power only works if you know how to not abuse it.
When you first appeared on the scene six years ago, the evidence suggests it was the work of a single man.<eos> It was a uniquely destructive force.<eos> Other serial bombers-- like Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky-- they were motivated by a misguided grudge against society, but the Bensonhurst Bomber was driven by something darker.<eos> He's not seeking revenge, he just has a passion for making things go bang.<eos> But the thing about passion is it can be taught, it can be learned.
If I can get used to the idea of you being with my brother, then you can get used to the idea of me being with Sam.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, I'm sorry.<eos> And here. You're taking Emma tonight.<eos> Since I spent all day setting up a campsite, I'm actually gonna go use it.
- You have a gun.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why?<eos> Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?
Drink a couple of beers with buddies after.<eos> Rent videos on the weekend with your wildly underwhelming wife.<eos> Forget you ever met me.<eos> Pretend that you have exorcised all of your demons.<eos> Son, I have prepared you for this life, but I-I cannot make you want it.
Even now, caught red-handed, and you still can't admit it.<eos> No, that would be you.<eos> You broke into my place.<eos> So if you can't be nice, Valerie, you know where the door is.<eos> Use it.
You were kind to me, even after you found out I was not human.<eos> I don't want you to die.<eos> - Then deactivate the bomb.<eos> - I can't.<eos> It's inside me, but I have no control over it.
Holy shit, Dirk,<eos> I get it.<eos> I get everything.<eos> Listen, before we go into the hotel, now is the time for us to take a moment, and think, really think about how we're going to do this.<eos> We have a unique opportunity here, and we need to be careful how we use it.
All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Confess.<eos> If you're arrested, tried and convicted, I might be able to persuade them that justice has been done.<eos> If Jimmy Koslow was offered the same opportunity, I think he'd have taken it.
-Just use it.<eos> -Why?<eos> -'Cause!<eos> Augie.<eos> Augie, just use it.
Can I see his room?<eos> Of course.<eos> I know you have doubts.<eos> Skepticism can be contagious.<eos> I wouldn't have known either before I saw the new truth and shared it with you.
(Is she from the Government?<eos> ) This is Nurse Gilbert.<eos> She's with us at Nonnatus.<eos> I was just explaining to Mrs Mills about the council's new laundry service.<eos> Nurse Crane is very keen that anyone entitled should make good use of it.
Finest fellows in the world, the British Army.<eos> I heard Your Lordship refers to them as "the scum of the earth".<eos> Well, they're both.<eos> At one and the same time.<eos> We've been talking - arguing, rather - about magic, how it's done.
That's what public service is all about--<eos> Small, incremental change every day.<eos> Teddy Roosevelt once said,<eos> "Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."<eos> And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.
The fire?<eos> Well, I've already taken care of that.<eos> It's only your word against mine and no one's gonna listen to the rantings of a distraught housewife.<eos> Neely... you have an easy, comfortable life.<eos> Go live it.
We found a RAT. You found a RAT.<eos> Remote Access Trojan.<eos> Spy software.<eos> Available anywhere on the surface net.<eos> Basically, anybody with half a brain can use it.
You knew what was happening.<eos> Why didn't you help me?<eos> I took terrible chances to protect you.<eos> I felt your pain.<eos> I lived it.
VIOLETTE: The seaside.<eos> GEORGE: Yeah?<eos> - (VIOLETTE GIGGLES) - GEORGE: The seaside?<eos> GEORGE: I'm surprised that thing made it round the block.<eos> It drives rather well, actually.
Bo, please.<eos> Keeping me in the dark does not protect me, it makes me want to scream.<eos> I don't know who to believe, I don't know what to believe.<eos> Jack told me that he saved her from the Dark Dungeons, that he tried to save her from insanity.<eos> He did not save her from her illness, he took advantage of it!
I... just...<eos> - Hi. Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this because you...?<eos> I think so, but, hey, if I have the power to heal, I might as well use it, right?
Someone got hurt.<eos> Someone died...<eos> Hey!<eos> I didn't start those fires, all right?<eos> I just pointed out a major security flaw, and then handed them the bad guy using it.
And that heavy burden is a defense attorney's best weapon, and you got to milk it for all it's worth.<eos> About 10:00, I come through to light a candle for my wife, who passed last year.<eos> I come around this pew here, and I see father Bernard laying there with his head cracked open.<eos> You never seen so much blood.<eos> The wall was sprayed with it.
And now Stark is public enemy number one.<eos> Yeah, we're not railroading him.<eos> We got evidence.<eos> Yeah, what you don't have is the whole story.<eos> Somebody does, but they're keeping it to themselves.
Because, for some reason, you feel this guilt.<eos> - So you always let him back in.<eos> - Please take the kids and go.<eos> This drama between you?<eos> - You want it, need it, feed off of it.
They came over, I said you'd gone to the loo.<eos> ~ You won't be called for days.<eos> Are you there yet?<eos> ~ I'm not sure about this.<eos> We have got one opportunity and we need to be all over it.
Henry, what's so important, it can't wait?<eos> My truck has been stolen.<eos> When?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I have not used it since the night before last.
"Abc news" has repeatedly requested interviews with Mr. Hubbard.<eos> We have been told that he is unavailable.<eos> It was very exciting.<eos> It was that heady mix of emotion and belief, and it's...<eos> You get stuck to it.
Threesomes, bondage, S and M.<eos> That's my book.<eos> Okay, well, just, uh, delete it.<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Molly, you should only send your book in when you're completely happy with it.
Mona, what are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about exposing "A" and finally bringing that person down.<eos> Is that your blood?<eos> Yes.<eos> And soon it's going to be smeared all over this house.
I don't need it anymore.<eos> So what do you have planned for the rest of the day?<eos> A video conference with the Palmer Tech board, who still question whether I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.<eos> Hey, how'd you like the company back as an early Christmas gift?<eos> You're doing a better job of running it than I would.
Mary, I know better than anyone how loyal you are to those who are loyal to you.<eos> And it's true that none of these things is damning enough to detain Louis.<eos> Which is why you want me to get him to stay.<eos> I have a lead on the valet.<eos> I just need time to follow it.
And that's just the beginning.<eos> This department would be an incubator for a large-scale operation.<eos> We can turn this juggernaut into one massive, forward-thinking entity and you, you'll be on a first-name basis with Jacob Wheeler.<eos> All we have to do is imagine it, trust it, and flip the switch.<eos> If you believe so much in this vision for Westgroup, why don't you share it with your future father-in-law?
Hey, man, I'm not...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> We've got an escape!<eos> Looks like Miko had a razor blade sewn in the waistband of his tracksuit.<eos> He used it to slice off the wristband and swapped it and his clothes with the other prisoner after he snapped his neck.
The truth isn't "this happened"<eos> or "that happened," the truth to me is about doing good.<eos> And the only way to put yourself in a position to do good is by getting elected.<eos> That's the greater truth.<eos> And if you don't get elected, somebody else is gonna take that position, and they're gonna do bad things with it.
Late 30s?<eos> - Not that kind of vibe.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I'm like a vessel.<eos> I walk the earth, and I breathe it in, and I absorb it.
Okay, look, I think he wants to talk about... what you could do for him.<eos> Yeah, okay, tell him to come on in.<eos> I'm fine, thank you, Kalinda.<eos> Alicia, did you knock over a cheese and wine store?<eos> What's the point in having power if you can't use it?
Oh.<eos> _<eos> John and I would like to cover the donation.<eos> _<eos> Our daughter loves this program, we love this program, and we need you running it.
This life is wrong.<eos> There is no other life.<eos> This is it.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I lived it!
What if there are innocent lives at risk?<eos> There's always lives at risk!<eos> You were there... when Bobbi was bleeding out in my arms.<eos> Ward did that.<eos> If I have a shot at finding him, I'm taking it.
Have you thought about opening it?<eos> Your citizenship test is at the end of the month.<eos> Lieutenant, if I have not yet belabored the point, allow me to endeavor.<eos> I do not need to study history.<eos> I lived it.
Thank you.<eos> Pramila, listen to me.<eos> Very soon after you return home, your time as a Kumari will be finished.<eos> But you still have time to help your people.<eos> You still have great power, and I want to help you use it.
It just tracks cell phones?<eos> This is state-of-the-art surveillance, with horizontal and vertical mapping.<eos> We can ping any cell phone around here, on or off.<eos> Cool. Well, you obviously vibe with the machine.<eos> You know how it works.
Because I'm not done asking you questions just... yet.<eos> Do you always eat kale for breakfast?<eos> 'Cause that is just wrong.<eos> How did you know that I had kale this morning?<eos> You reek of it.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.<eos> I fear he's not coming.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We had the reading of Father's will.<eos> He bequeathed Arthur only a portion of the brewery with instructions to manage it.
And what this... engineer is suggesting - is complete balderdash.<eos> - If you don't mind, Mr. Dudewitz...<eos> I do mind.<eos> I do mind mediocrity.<eos> It has a taint, like burned toast, and you stink of it.

Now if in your fear you seek only love's peace and love's pleasure<eos> Better cover your nakedness And pass out of love's threshing-floor Into a seasonless world where you shall laugh But not all your laughter<eos> And weep and weep, but not all of your tears<eos> Love gives naught but itself And takes naught but from itself<eos> Love possesses not nor would it be possessed
Life was given to us a billion years ago.<eos> What have we done with it?
You looked me in the eyes and lied to my face, pretended you wanted to help me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You call yourself the noble one, but you're a killer just like your brother.<eos> For 1,000 years, you fed on innocent blood.<eos> Why don't you choke on it?
Is it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Saw "the front page."<eos> Lively comedy about the newspaper game.<eos> Enjoyed it tremendously.
We go public as soon as possible.<eos> You said that was a last resort.<eos> Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.<eos> If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.<eos> Not if we spin it right.

No idea what it means.<eos> Once we destroy the spirit magic in this town, the witches' curse will finally be broken.<eos> From there, the spell will ripple outward, unraveling spirit magic as it spreads.<eos> Only pure magic, our magic, will remain.<eos> My people will be free to go wherever they choose, and when witch magic and all that it has ever created is gone from this earth, you will be, too.

And, yeah.<eos> And it hurt, but I didn't wanna look dumb, so I try it again.<eos> Next time I stick it in my thumb.<eos> Now I'm so flustered that I go to take my mask off.<eos> But I'm still holding the needle, jab it right in my face.
Unless Dekker didn't put him down here.<eos> What are you thinking, Steve?<eos> Dekker's been working with ATF for months now, right?<eos> What if somebody he helped to put away found that out and used it against him?<eos> Right, so Dekker gets a fake tip about a gun deal, he passes it on.
Well, I don't know what he's doing here, but I'm here on business.<eos> I need you to sign this important document.<eos> Oh, oh, Mama, you gave him daddy's favorite pen?<eos> The one when you turn the bikini falls off?<eos> You said the pen was silly and you didn't want to use it.

Why bother asking?<eos> You and me, we ain't even close to the same.<eos> Mm, I don't know about that.<eos> I got a hunch you can take the pain.<eos> You might even enjoy it.
A lot.<eos> When he was in his 20s, he was a rounder.<eos> That's how he scraped together enough cash to buy this place.<eos> But I know for a fact that he quit playing before I was born.<eos> He might have had that card, but I don't believe he ever used it.

Joe's gone, this is over, you and I can finally--<eos> No, he's always gonna be there, Ryan.<eos> Claire.<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna go see my son, and I'm gonna stop looking over my shoulder all the time, and I'm gonna tell Joey that-- that we can actually have a life now and maybe even someday enjoy it,
And, yeah.<eos> And it hurt, but I didn't wanna look dumb, so I try it again.<eos> Next time I stick it in my thumb.<eos> Now I'm so flustered that I go to take my mask off.<eos> But I'm still holding the needle, jab it right in my face.
Unless Dekker didn't put him down here.<eos> What are you thinking, Steve?<eos> Dekker's been working with ATF for months now, right?<eos> What if somebody he helped to put away found that out and used it against him?<eos> Right, so Dekker gets a fake tip about a gun deal, he passes it on.
Well, I don't know what he's doing here, but I'm here on business.<eos> I need you to sign this important document.<eos> Oh, oh, Mama, you gave him daddy's favorite pen?<eos> The one when you turn the bikini falls off?<eos> You said the pen was silly and you didn't want to use it.

Wow, where would you even put something so big?<eos> I'd make room for that.<eos> Guys, put the bathtub catalog down.<eos> I've already picked out the tub for upstairs and before you ask, no, you may not.<eos> It's a surprise for Caroline, she's gonna be the first one to use it.
"Mind you, there is still much to be done,<eos> "but our campaign of pacification<eos> "has begun.<eos> "Sadly, I have found Thomas Durant<eos> "more enamored with being leader of the railway than actually leading it."
I know, Charlie.<eos> I'm joking.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You cool?<eos> Fatah sets up this entire terrorist network from scratch, blindsides us with it, and then we're stuck here while the rest of the team is back hunting Al Moosari at Langley.
I thought everything would feel like it did before.<eos> But it doesn't.<eos> Em... after what happened with Nate, did you, like, find yourself wanting to know everything about him?<eos> I received the package from Nate's mom.<eos> I was kind of obsessed with it.
Spare me, and I'll disappear.<eos> To where?<eos> You're an eight-ball.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> It's what you are, and always will be.
Why bother asking?<eos> You and me, we ain't even close to the same.<eos> Mm, I don't know about that.<eos> I got a hunch you can take the pain.<eos> You might even enjoy it.
A lot.<eos> When he was in his 20s, he was a rounder.<eos> That's how he scraped together enough cash to buy this place.<eos> But I know for a fact that he quit playing before I was born.<eos> He might have had that card, but I don't believe he ever used it.
Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> What is this song, and why is everyone sharing it with me?
You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped and raised by fools.<eos> Are you done with your rambling, or do the guards need to encourage you to continue your work?<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> The last time we ran the current through the vine, we couldn't control the power.<eos> So I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it.
Well, what about the numbers station?<eos> We can warn the others.<eos> I checked it.<eos> Already corrupted.<eos> Rowan's using it to call unsuspecting agents home, then killing them.
He held his gun to my throat..<eos> Then he moved it down between my legs..<eos> Then he pushed it inside of me.<eos> I could feel the cold steel in me.<eos> While he moved it, in and out.
You got a problem with the gates?<eos> Here, smoke a cigarette.<eos> It is a great honor for you.<eos> This is the last cigarette of humanity.<eos> Go enjoy it.
Get in bed and I'll read you a story.<eos> Pick one out.<eos> We put the house on the market... once we found out the water was eating away at the enamel in Taylor's teeth, but... unfortunately, no one wants to buy a house in a town with poisoned water.<eos> My husband's work gets a great deal on bottled water.<eos> We use it to brush our teeth.
It doesn't matter.<eos> She's not doing your song.<eos> See you at Joe's pub in three years.<eos> I want to end with a new song tonight.<eos> It's never been sung in front of an audience before, but I had to share it with you because it touched my heart.
- Why?<eos> What's wrong? - Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> I like my place, OK?<eos> I'm proud of it, I like to take care of it.
Sir, respectfully, I do not think you should give him the satisfaction.<eos> Well, give me a reason.<eos> Makes us appear weak.<eos> There's an opportunity for you to establish your supremacy.<eos> We should seize it.
In addition, we are in love.<eos> I never cared that it was awarded a scholarship in One of the most prestigious schools in the country.<eos> Actually I do not even mind the scholarship.<eos> I mean, of course my parents could not afford to send me here.<eos> But the real reason we need this school, even though it is governed as a dictatorship with silly Narcissistic and abusive rules, the real reason is because It has the most crazy and insane vandals worldwide.
So now you decide which laws are worth enforcing?<eos> That's why they gave me the badge.<eos> - Yeah, but the rules are different out here.<eos> - No. Same rules.<eos> Same rules they had since the first man picked up the first stick and beat the second man's ass with it.
- Yay! - Yay.<eos> I know what it is. - It's an "s."<eos> - Mm-hmm. Ha.<eos> Damn it. I wish there was a way I could check on you guys.<eos> Let's make a signal. If your electric toothbrush goes off when you're not using it,
Are you sure it wasn't some form of mercy killing?<eos> He wasn't killed immediately.<eos> We have reason to believe he was kept alive for some time.<eos> The whole point of euthanasia is to prevent prolonged suffering.<eos> It sounds like your murderer knew the technique and callously abused it.
I'm afraid I won't.<eos> Now, if Drew Thompson is alive and in Harlan, that is a story for the ages.<eos> But the only thing I know for certain is that Josiah Cairn is a parolee gone missing, making it my responsibility to find him.<eos> Now, your Drew Thompson agenda aside, I brought you to Roz.<eos> If you think you got a line on what happened to Josiah, you're gonna share it with me.
Yeah, but what's a raw food guy doing with charcoal on his hands?<eos> He doesn't cook.<eos> All right, well, let's see if they've got a barbecue.<eos> Bingo.<eos> This thing doesn't look like it's been used in years.
Spinach, guac, pecans.<eos> It's not my fault that you didn't want to liven up your meal and also, you know what, that's what a boyfriend does.<eos> - They pay for things.<eos> - And I paid for our butt plug.<eos> Well, you're probably still using it, so maybe you should pay me.
In May of 2011, Rhys stole exactly that amount from his Dominican suppliers.<eos> He's been hiding out in Thailand ever since.<eos> Like I said, ex-dealer.<eos> They got sloppy with some transactions.<eos> I saw an opportunity for early retirement, and took it.
Hold up, hold up.<eos> I got a name.<eos> Tico Bettis.<eos> Out of Bed-Stuy.<eos> If he's the one who tweaked that gun, he might know who used it.
Why?<eos> I mean, that-that's got to be deliberate.<eos> What did you find out about our card?<eos> I ran the blood.<eos> Confirmed that it did kill Peter Coe.
None.<eos> None?<eos> Well, that boat didn't take itself off-shore.<eos> It was found abandoned.<eos> HPD suspects that whoever was piloting it must have jumped overboard before the explosion.
Perhaps the centerpiece was a bit much.<eos> You should know better than anyone magic always comes with a price.<eos> So does stealing it.<eos> I'm not going to steal your magic, genie.<eos> I'm simply three wishes away from owning it.
A girl can have her secrets.<eos> Carm, in the least amount of nerd possible, tell me what happened with that comet.<eos> The force from Jupiter's orbit made the comet disintegrate, altering the coefficient of friction, which changed its path.<eos> That ends the rally for the inning. You know, if Dr. Douche is gonna use science to save the planet...<eos> We'll use it to save Denny's rock.
Every night before bed, I read a poem.<eos> It is a way to shake dirt of the day, like a shower.<eos> And you'll learn it by memory?<eos> Memory is a muscle.<eos> If you don't exercise it, it atrophies.
Well, we need to fake a medical emergency.<eos> So, your appendix just exploded, you're in incredible pain.<eos> Go.<eos> Oh! Oh! Oh, my...<eos> Uh, it's like someone, uh, took a red hot fork and just dug it into the right side of my abdomen.
It would mean the world to her.<eos> She respects you, and you have such a great eye for spotting fine art.<eos> Yeah, spotting it, but not creating it.<eos> Hey...<eos> We all have our gifts, Maryellen, and the owners of that gallery recognized yours when they hired you to manage it at 25 years old.
We go after the bad guys and take them off the street, by any means, whatever it takes, so am I a real cop?<eos> Is what I do right?<eos> Give me a call if you figure it out.<eos> It was bang out of order, you get me?<eos> Using the red love and then spiking me with it.
I was giving up what I had saved for my kids' college education to a drug addict.<eos> I had to protect my children.<eos> No, you had to protect your stolen identity.<eos> So what?<eos> Nobody else was using it.
Hey, you two!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, thanks again for that coffeemaker.<eos> We use it all the time.
All right.<eos> It's so much better being single.<eos> No commitment, no long hair in the drain.<eos> No finding my toothbrush wet because someone used it and thought I wouldn't notice.<eos> But Danny, if you rinse a toothbrush after you use it, it's like no one used it.
This is incredible.<eos> Whoo!<eos> You are a beautiful angel -- you know that?<eos> Your power is an amazing gift.<eos> And s.H.I.E.L.D. Wouldn't let me use it.
Thapa's a stranger in this city.<eos> How would he know where to go?<eos> Because I told him.<eos> I, um... mentioned the Armenian Mob franchise in Glendale.<eos> It's run by a woman named Talita Pambakian.
Or hold on to the things that make life worth living?<eos> Liberty, friendship, love...<eos> I'll raise a glass to that.<eos> Enough of my story!<eos> Tell it to your daughters, to scare them into obedience.
There's more to life than work.<eos> And maybe that's why you feel dissatisfied.<eos> I'm not dissatisfied.<eos> I love my life.<eos> Well, what's the point if you've got no one to share it with?
Then I drilled a hole in the stage, and underneath I planted the splatter-master saliva keg!<eos> The what?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it insane to collect the spit of every patient who's passed through my office for the past six months and put it in a pony keg?
He held his gun to my throat..<eos> Then he moved it down between my legs..<eos> Then he pushed it inside of me.<eos> I could feel the cold steel in me.<eos> While he moved it, in and out.

Please.<eos> All right, ladies and gentlemen. This meeting will now come to order.<eos> I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here which is highly irregular, even if his family name is above the door.<eos> Bruce Wayne's family built this company.<eos> And he himself has run it.
Get off your soapbox.<eos> It was for your own good.<eos> The Indians wanted to expand off the island.<eos> Ames was looking for a way out.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
I'm not even gonna ask you to fill me in.<eos> Instead, I'm just gonna assume there's a long royal explanation.<eos> You know me well, and Blair, but the point is as long as it seems like Serena and I are together, my editor's not gonna let me write a second novel I'd actually care about.<eos> Well, sacrificing your career for the people you love, I understand.<eos> But sacrificing it for fake love, I... I think it's counterintuitive.
- No, he didn't. He didn't say that.<eos> - He is seizing his moment.<eos> And that's why this is the greatest country on earth.<eos> I am gonna throw up a leg.<eos> And then I'm gonna take that leg and I'm gonna beat Scott to death with it.
I thought that he was... unhealthy.<eos> Unhealthy?<eos> Manipulative.<eos> Calculating.<eos> He had power and he used it.
All right.<eos> I want out of here.<eos> Temporarily, of course.<eos> You have no idea what this is like, Patrick, living in a cage, knowing I'll be here for years.<eos> The truth is, this may be my last chance at freedom while I'm young enough to enjoy it.
Does that sound like self-defense to you?<eos> - Give me some gloves.<eos> - By the sink.<eos> The Guardian wanted Nan followed to make sure she carried out his orders.<eos> I saw an opportunity to save Eric, so I took it.
If I go in there, am I gonna get my penis stolen?<eos> Why would anyone want to steal your puny cock?<eos> He's got a point, actually.<eos> I can't have anyone stealing my fanny.<eos> I'm gonna be using it very soon.
Well, I heard they let you go not long thereafter.<eos> I'm a greeter now.<eos> I don't think I could say "hello" to that many people.<eos> Are you enjoying the work?<eos> Way I understand it, they're paying me to do it, not to like it.
Well, we can pack two bags, bring the kids with us.<eos> Besides, when Conrad finds out about us, I'm gonna be finished on Wall Street.<eos> I'm gonna be packing my bags regardless.<eos> Well, that's why no one can find out about us, David.<eos> I've lived that life before, and I can't live it again.
The sooner the better.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> Right here, baby.<eos> You know, your car's fixed now.<eos> You're gonna have to start using it.
From what I hear, you guys went through hell to make this happen.<eos> Look, I got to get going, but, um, just call me if you need anything, okay?<eos> He's right.<eos> The job was hell.<eos> But you probably could have managed it without me.
We found the gas station where D'Stefano and his passenger got gas and sodas.<eos> We got an I.D. on the passenger.<eos> Her name's Holly Danvers.<eos> Paid for the drinks using a credit card.<eos> Hasn't used it since.
I'll open a bottle of wine.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> Pizza's getting cold.<eos> You are gonna have to enjoy it without me.
- Weird.<eos> As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?<eos> Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> When we dated, he made me do it every week.
They prefer I go by Glenn here. And act like Glenn.<eos> A funeral cosmetologist.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Even a diva needs a day job.<eos> I've always loved makeup. But, uh, wearing it wasn't an option for a boy in Sacramento. So I chose a career in death care.
Patrol found a car matching the description of one fleeing the scene where Ecklie was shot.<eos> This was in the backseat.<eos> Where's the car now?<eos> It's in the garage.<eos> Mandy's on it.
That's it?<eos> That's all you remember?<eos> I found out online that some people forget things because they don't want to remember.<eos> And if this is selective, then anything can trigger it... sights, smells, sounds.<eos> So the car that you saw, it just looked like the car from that night, or it was the car?
- I get it.<eos> - Manny!<eos> I get it.<eos> Now you're not even making any noise.<eos> Okay, this is way too many grapes, and this spoon is modern day, so if we use it, everyone at the table has to react in shock at the spoon from the future.
There you go.<eos> Is there at least something to drink?<eos> There's beer in the cooler.<eos> What about for the children?<eos> You can get water from that water fountain and use it to water down the beer.
Sorry, I-I don't, uh--<eos> I'm--I'm just-- Wait.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> - Spin it around and back it on up.
The only place I'm gonna put you is in a prison cell.<eos> That's if the ADTs don't put you in the ground first.<eos> All right, this is weird.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, we flagged Johnny's credit card in case one of the ADTs tried to use it.
The decline and demolishment of EMI is a sad 21st century story of failure.<eos> He was running a whole company that categorically he was incapable of running.<eos> Obviously, it turned out to be a tremendous mistake. He bought it at the wrong time.<eos> He really believed he was going to transform it and then sell it.<eos> I don't think he thought that he would own it and then lose it.
On behalf of my agency and myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> New information has come to light since last we spoke.<eos> And, um...<eos> I would like to share it with you in an effort to repair the damage that has been done.
Did you think for a moment that you had transcendent purpose or that somehow you were worthy of being remembered?<eos> A sanitation clerk who had the audacity to fuck the mayor's daughter.<eos> How dare you think that you should ever have been put in the position to decide the fate of others?<eos> That is a mantle to be worn only by the great, not by a man who wormed his way into City Hall for a period of time.<eos> You're a chapter, a portrait, a handful of legislation, a thousand lies, and yet you cling to power, falsely believing you actually possess it.
You took my pen, didn't you?<eos> A pen? What are you talking about...?<eos> A pen, looking like a fountain pen, which was on my desk.<eos> Why would I take it?<eos> You used it to write the memo.
A pen? What are you talking about...?<eos> A pen, looking like a fountain pen, which was on my desk.<eos> Why would I take it?<eos> You used it to write the memo.<eos> You're the last one who used it.
Why would Tyr want Arthur dead?<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Perhaps he harboured some grudge, some festering resentment.<eos> What grudge could he bear?<eos> He loved his work, he was deeply proud of it.
Uh, I saw him leave with his costume bag.<eos> I figured he was going on a job.<eos> Ed was a professional Santa.<eos> Looks like he took his job pretty seriously.<eos> Oh, he lived it, really.

On behalf of my agency and myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> New information has come to light since last we spoke.<eos> And, um...<eos> I would like to share it with you in an effort to repair the damage that has been done.
Did you think for a moment that you had transcendent purpose or that somehow you were worthy of being remembered?<eos> A sanitation clerk who had the audacity to fuck the mayor's daughter.<eos> How dare you think that you should ever have been put in the position to decide the fate of others?<eos> That is a mantle to be worn only by the great, not by a man who wormed his way into City Hall for a period of time.<eos> You're a chapter, a portrait, a handful of legislation, a thousand lies, and yet you cling to power, falsely believing you actually possess it.
You took my pen, didn't you?<eos> A pen? What are you talking about...?<eos> A pen, looking like a fountain pen, which was on my desk.<eos> Why would I take it?<eos> You used it to write the memo.
A pen? What are you talking about...?<eos> A pen, looking like a fountain pen, which was on my desk.<eos> Why would I take it?<eos> You used it to write the memo.<eos> You're the last one who used it.
Why would Tyr want Arthur dead?<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Perhaps he harboured some grudge, some festering resentment.<eos> What grudge could he bear?<eos> He loved his work, he was deeply proud of it.
Uh, I saw him leave with his costume bag.<eos> I figured he was going on a job.<eos> Ed was a professional Santa.<eos> Looks like he took his job pretty seriously.<eos> Oh, he lived it, really.
And possible was enough.<eos> Hey, Eddie.<eos> Now you know I want more, so why would you upset me?<eos> I don't like being down to this last one.<eos> You don't even know how to use it.
Did they ask about me at all?<eos> The little fellow did.<eos> What did he say about me?<eos> He had this cigarette lighter.<eos> He kept flashing it about for me to see it.
I programmed a virtual trap door in the system to get you out of this maniacal maze.<eos> So, where is this emergency exit out of narnia?<eos> 800 feet above Broadway.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Hey, I had no control over where the door materialized, but anyone can access it.
Yes, call Agent Dunham, please.<eos> So they all say essentially the same thing.<eos> Not essentially.<eos> Precisely. Despite being attributed to different authors.<eos> A fantastical idea and I have yet to uncover why William was pursuing it.
Thank you, Mac.<eos> Hold on now.<eos> I wanted to bring Uganda up to New York.<eos> You know, New Orleans infect music.<eos> It reconstutionalates it.
Guy was passed out on the sidewalk.<eos> A real eyesore.<eos> So it's your civic duty to steal his wallet, take his cash, and swipe his credit card?<eos> I had that plastic for a whole day.<eos> I only used it once.
- Margaret:<eos> Um, now-- - The washing machine's fucked.<eos> Thank you, Dale.<eos> That darn washing machine.<eos> I'll tell you, we-- We use it so much, as you can imagine, with all of our members.
- The yarmulke.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can't go in wearing this yarmulke?<eos> - No.<eos> - You're shoving it in their faces.
I'm delighted to see that you've learnt my name already and I hope I shall have learnt all of yours by the end of the Autumn term.<eos> Now, I'd like to extend a special welcome to the first years, who are new to the school, like me,<eos> I hope you'll have a very happy time here, achieve some wonderful things, and make me proud of you.<eos> I'd also like to welcome two new girls to the Lower Fourth.<eos> Lydia Holly, who won a scholarship here three years ago, but has only just been able to take it up, and Midge Carne, who has been privately educated.
I'll bet it was.<eos> Hey, Chuck, what happened to your shirt?<eos> Well, as Bree's already pointed out, it was very smoky in the kitchen.<eos> And I couldn't find a towel to wave it away.<eos> So I, um, I used my shirt, and... and I waved it so... vigorously that, um, all... all the... all the buttons came off.
I understand there is a problem with the jedi prisoner.<eos> An incursion team attempted a rescue, but the situation is taken care of.<eos> Are you in possession of the information the prisoner is carrying?<eos> Not yet, but we will soon have it.<eos> You are aware that this information will tip the scale of the war to the side that controls it.
How long have they known each other?<eos> I loved my husband for 25 years.<eos> Your husband had a golf club in his hand, didn't he?<eos> No.<eos> He was swinging it wildly at my client.
There you go.<eos> What are fish fingers?<eos> When do I say that?<eos> Any second.<eos> Of course! House feeds on rift energy and Tardises are bursting with it.
My desk?<eos> You're done with training, you sick, twisted...<eos> Yeah.<eos> That sexual harassment suit you had quashed?<eos> I got a water cooler, and I'm not afraid to use it.
I never kid about safety.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> In my bed?<eos> Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family.
Now, you tell me.. what you told me to do and what I have not done?<eos> This is the point Rajat.<eos> I always have to tell you to do it.<eos> Why can't you do anything by yourself?<eos> I don't enjoy all this work, but I still do it as it is important.
The blacks became their slaves.<eos> But how superior their flowing rhythm, compared with the crude shuffles of the forest tribes.<eos> In reality, there was no evidence for this at all.<eos> The Tutsis were a ruling elite, but the two groups had always shared the same land and did not see each other as separate races and many Hutus shared equally in government.<eos> But the Belgians who ran Rwanda took the myth and used it ruthlessly.
Smuts used ecological ideas to develop a philosophy he called holism.<eos> Holism said that the whole world was one giant organic system in which everything had its natural place.<eos> So long as everyone stayed in their proper place, this global system would be stable.<eos> Smuts had a vision of a new global world order where artificial distinctions like nations would disappear, and his model for this world system was the British Empire.<eos> And it would be managed by the white European races because that was their natural place in the whole.
Uh, no, it's fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - A hockey stick?<eos> - Part of one.<eos> It was snapped off at the handle, and the blade was splintered, like somebody used it to hit something hard.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.<eos> Is he now trying to say that he lied?<eos> He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.<eos> How did I mislead?<eos> Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
The same can be said with important changes that happen in life.<eos> If one ever comes across such a defining 'break-shot' moment, your once-peaceful world will shatter into pieces.<eos> Facing such changes, most young people will panic and wonder if they could return to the past.<eos> I want to say this to those friends.<eos> Since the game has already started, don't be afraid to enjoy it.
I rode steeplechase when I was in boarding school at Montpellier.<eos> I'm curious what else we have in common.<eos> What are some of your other interests?<eos> History for one.<eos> I'm practically obsessed with it.
Come on, really squeeze that wad!<eos> Feels good in your Hands, right?<eos> - Feels pretty good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now slap it and say, "this is my wad!"
But Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I'm not.<eos> Greendale is the best school in the entire world, and I'm so sorry what I've done to it.<eos> And I'm sorry what I've done to the ice cream machine.<eos> Aah!<eos> Please, no one eat out of it until you clean the nozzles.
It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.<eos> Call the CDC.<eos> Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.<eos> Diphtheria?<eos> We didn't guess it because nobody gets it.
Are you okay?<eos> - Ow! - What happened?<eos> Your wrist?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Just hold it still.
I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness.<eos> I have never felt so low.<eos> Well, you're radiating pure joy.<eos> I went to my herbalist and got two B-12 shots.<eos> And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St. John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums.
- I keep telling...<eos> - Dr. Helen.<eos> She's here every night.<eos> Walks up and down the halls with a black stick.<eos> She blinds you with it, that's what she does.
Based on bulb placement and light source, there are only a few on the market that could produce this heat pattern, but I'd say based on size and design of the head chassis, there's really only one.<eos> The Powerstream 4800.<eos> JANINE: I keep this hidden... 'cause sometimes he cuts out the lights.<eos> GORDON: She walks up and down the hall with a black stick.<eos> She blinds you with it.
Salutations, o sage.<eos> Praise be to narayana!<eos> Sage narada visits a demon's palace... i'm shocked!<eos> Tarakasura... it's my duty to bode well to all.<eos> I received a good news so i thought i should share it with you, too.

- OK, why not?<eos> I never thought about that before but your eyes have an unusual colour.<eos> I know, some kind of green that very few people have.<eos> Did you borrow my safety razor?<eos> I think someone used it.
- Black Hurt.<eos> - that's cool. Thanks, Uncle Russ.<eos> I'm not giving you a compliment, you arrogant bastard.<eos> What a load of bullshit.<eos> I wouldn't wipe my an with It.
- I'll get the box set.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> Duncan's taking me to the opera.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm gonna be really into it.
I hear tell you won't be Master of the Marchers comes tomorrow, Thomas Brown.<eos> A man may come to see himself for what he is.<eos> Your trouble is you take this world in earnest.<eos> Why does a trumpet sound so glorious?<eos> So that we might glory in it.
Everybody runs up and seconds later, as if by magic,<eos> Josh in his leather jacket.<eos> Mm-hmm. He's cold.<eos> He puts on a jacket, it happens.<eos> Or he uses it to cover the gunshot residue off his hands.
Hello?<eos> No, look.<eos> There's a shorthand that exists between us experience together at a level that, quite frankly, I'm just never going to reach with Gale.<eos> Look, Mr. Fring when I accepted your offer, I was told the lab is mine.<eos> And I know best how to run it.
Give up my job, my house, my savings?<eos> You answer this, lady... you're so smart. Why should I be punished<eos> Because my wife and best friend had an affair? Why should I be made to pay for their bad behavior?<eos> How is that right?<eos> You stole that rifle months before you ever used it,
What happened to her lip?<eos> She bit it.<eos> The skull fracture didn't kill her.<eos> She was smothered to death with this pillow.<eos> It left blood transfer on her face.
- Opened a door she couldn't close.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now anyone in town who asks aloud for the truth invokes Veritas.<eos> And she doesn't just give it to you.<eos> She slams you with it until you kill yourself and she gets her tribute.
That magic comb was our only chance of winning, the only thing keeping me from totally screwing it up.<eos> I didn't want to let you down, Artie.<eos> That wasn't a magic comb.<eos> I just found it on the floor and ran into you on the way to tossing it in the trash.<eos> And you let me comb my hair with it?
Just wanna make you proud, Dad.<eos> Thank you, son.<eos> About the box.<eos> Queen has it.<eos> His family had possession of it when Veritas was dissolved.
Although governed by the same universal set of rules, our planet is not too big, not too small, not too hot, not too cold.<eos> Earth has been called the Goldilocks planet because everything is just right.<eos> Our world is unique but it doesn't exist in splendid isolation.<eos> It is intimately connected with its cosmic neighbors.<eos> Earth is not the master of its own destiny, and it never has been.
Is he any good?<eos> One of the few I like on this side.<eos> Well, he's easy on the eyes.<eos> Careful.<eos> Their side may be alluring, But don't be taken in by it.
You know, there's a saying in bengali... ( Speaks bengali )<eos> I don't want to hear the saying, okay?<eos> I want us to speak clearly in English.<eos> I want to get to the bottom of what you are trying to say to me.<eos> You've just asked me to hold onto a cricket bat because you're afraid you're gonna turn it on your daughter-in-law, that you're gonna use it against her.
They are, my Lord.<eos> Are you going to investigate further?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I am most grateful to Your Grace for this information.<eos> I trust that someday you will use it.
And obviously, this is a decision we have to make together. 'Cause if I retire, our life is gonna change.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I made it to the league, you know?<eos> I had a dream, and I lived it, and that is more than most people ever get.
Why?<eos> Because he'd recently had a boosterjab. Hep-B, probably.<eos> Difficult to tell at that distance.<eos> Conclusion - he'd just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia.<eos> Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance, and she splits it with Janus Cars.
I mean, usually, he's so careful.<eos> But that night, after a few pints, he really opened up.<eos> He told me about these missile plans.<eos> Beyond top secret.<eos> He showed me the memory stick, he waved it in front of me.
It's far beyond what we're able to do.<eos> Physicists like Gott don't claim they can build working time machines today.<eos> They're trying to figure out whether the laws of physics permit time travel at all.<eos> There are several inherent problems in all scenarios for building time machines.<eos> And that is that nature appears to have a driving force that may always cause a time machine to self-destruct at the moment you try to activate it.
Dad!<eos> Ewan's using the nit comb as a weapon!<eos> Dad! Dad, stop him!<eos> Ewan!<eos> They were just scratching me with it.
We need to give her time to stop the other wave.<eos> We don't all have to.<eos> It only takes one person to control the ship, Doesn't it?<eos> And I'm a dead man, right?<eos> There's a launch below, so you guys need to get on it.
Is there ever a good one?<eos> We, uh, we separated last year.<eos> Do you mind telling us why?<eos> Her work. It...<eos> She was consumed with it.
Come on, Just a few more.<eos> You're not telling me. You're just answering questions.<eos> Uh, Is our family really 1/16 Pequot Indian?<eos> That one is true.<eos> When I was four, did I really choke on a potato chip and when I coughed it up, it had Jesus' face on it?
I am now officially terminated.<eos> So how's your day?<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Don't want your pity.<eos> Good, then... 30 years of putting bad guys away, this is what them cocksuckers upstairs do to me... take my pension, wipe their ass with it, and just flush it right on.
With all this pain, what kind of life have you had with me? oh. I want the surgery.<eos> That's an interesting choice of t-shirt.<eos> It's anime.<eos> "takao's turn.<eos> " genius kid finds a pen, And anyone whose name he writes with it dies.
Or perhaps, it is BECAUSE I investigate it.<eos> I have never laid with Mr Garrow.<eos> And I will gladly sign THAT affidavit.<eos> I would not eat the horse.<eos> I wished to shame the kitchen with it.
Like a tiger, attacking forward.<eos> Sis.<eos> I have real men now.<eos> I'll leave this hunting rifle for you.<eos> Your Sis doesn't know how to use it.
Nothing. - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> How is your skin?<eos> Fine.<eos> - Are you leaving it alone? - Mm-hmm.
Mr... oh.<eos> Mr Lipwig, sir.<eos> Mr Groat.<eos> I imagine Gilt's demanding the hat.<eos> You're not gonna let them have it, are you?
There's a battle on the boards with both teams really digging for the puck.<eos> Now it squirts loose, and the Ice Wolves have it.
Percy, go!<eos> You're safe inside the gate!<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Listen, use the pen! - What?<eos> - Use Brunner's pen and click it!
- OK, why not?<eos> I never thought about that before but your eyes have an unusual colour.<eos> I know, some kind of green that very few people have.<eos> Did you borrow my safety razor?<eos> I think someone used it.

Trees defy gravity.<eos> They are the only natural element in perpetual movement toward the sky.<eos> They grow unhurriedly toward the sun that nourishes their foliage.<eos> They have inherited from those minuscule cyanobacteria... the power to capture light's energy.<eos> They store it and feed off it, turning it into wood and leaves, which then decompose into a mixture ofwater, mineral, vegetable and living matter.
- Only the four of us, I think.<eos> d Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring d d If that diamond ring turns brass d d Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass d<eos> - Please leave a message.<eos> - Welcome to your new life.<eos> I hope you're enjoying it.
Now imagine it being used on you.<eos> Everything you believe, gone.<eos> Everyone you love, strangers, maybe enemies.<eos> Every part of you that makes you more than a walking cluster of neurons dissolved at someone else's whim.<eos> If that technology exists, it'll be used. It'll be abused.
And when I'm all done, I wanna retire to, like, Miami.<eos> South Beach.<eos> Live a nice, comfortable life, you know.<eos> Retire?<eos> Man, you'll be too old to enjoy it.
So what are you gonna do about the collegiate party tomorrow?<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't play the innocent.<eos> You wanted queen, you've got it.
Very classy.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Well, you're welcome.<eos> There's go energy in here.<eos> It'll be nice to share it.
The only way to get to it is to lay charges here and here<eos> - and blast through and take a look...<eos> - Under no circumstances.<eos> This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe is a limitless energy.<eos> And that energy, once we can harness it correctly, it's going to allow us to manipulate time.
I can't just look the other way.<eos> Liz, please...<eos> Don't go near that witness box.<eos> You have lovely life.<eos> Don't put it on the line for me.
You'd be saving thousands, clark.<eos> The only way any of us are ever gonna be safe again is if doomsday is destroyed... for good.<eos> Doomsday is my problem, and i will handle it.<eos> Just, please, take care of chloe.<eos> I'm down to my last card, emil, and i really don't want to play it, so please take another look at the samples.
Barney planned on being a violinist.<eos> Don't tell me things.<eos> You can't design your life like a building.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> You just have to live it, and it will design itself.
- Yeah.<eos> I've been doing awful stuff for Kathleen.<eos> I had to identify the body.<eos> - You know, Ash-- ...life is short.<eos> We should enjoy it.
I'm building a roof garden, and I need a super energy-efficient way to light it at night.<eos> - Have you considered a plove?<eos> - No, forget the plove.<eos> What about bioluminescence?<eos> Fireflies have been using it for 200 million years.
And this new bike doesn't rais a lot of embarrassing questions, Like why I had it Or who boosted who through a bedroom window.<eos> So, everybods happy.<eos> Uh-oh. Oh, son of a --<eos> You gave me the wrong screwdriver.<eos> Maybe you're just using it wrong.
People change, Chuck.<eos> Not you, not about this.<eos> The Jenny Humphrey who used to sit in Brooklyn and watch the lights across the water, who went toe-to-toe with Blair Waldorf And actually won her respect...<eos> You can't tell me that girl isn't still in there.<eos> Now that the dream is coming true, you owe it to her to live it.
Out of your bed.<eos> Be late for work.<eos> I`m not going to hurt you.<eos> You've hurt your leg.<eos> Try not to move it.
- You look exactly like Liz.<eos> - What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You've just never seen my reading glasses before, which I have to wear to read your dumb sketches.<eos> And I lost my hat after I threw it at a bus that wouldn't stop for me,
Shoulda come clean from the start.<eos> Fink wanted the painting.<eos> He told me to buy it from Preswick, but the guy wouldn't sell.<eos> So Fink had me paint a fake.<eos> And, yeah, I-I bribed the super to... Switch it with the real thing.
In the treasury department, but not this.<eos> It sounds like Harold's pretty angry.<eos> You're damn right he's pissed.<eos> They took his family farm.<eos> Three generations, they had it.

I bet you never learnt Spanish, neither.<eos> I bought a book, though!<eos> Oh, are you made of money?<eos> I haven't had time.<eos> You talk about your life like you've got no control over it.
- that there is no such missing weapon?<eos> - Categorically.<eos> What we're talking about here, back in the day, the KGB call "dezinformatsia".<eos> Disinformation and it's gonna cause trouble.<eos> So don't let them capitalise on it.
Kids, the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me.<eos> Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work, so I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.<eos> A new car!<eos> Ted, this is New York City, you're never gonna drive it.
What?<eos> This potato skin.<eos> It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head.<eos> Even though this potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size...<eos> I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.
Everything,Abby.<eos> It's a tradition.<eos> That coin has been baked, well,steamed actually, into every Mallard Christmas pudding since the 1850s.<eos> It brings good fortune and luck in the coming year to whoever finds it on their plate.<eos> Assuming they don't choke to death on it.
So...you think it's wednesday.<eos> Come on.<eos> I plead the 5th.<eos> Of vodka.<eos> I can smell it on you.
You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it.<eos> You can make high-fructose corn syrup.<eos> You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid.<eos> All those obscure ingredients on the processed food... it's remarkable how many of them can be made from corn.<eos> Plus, you can feed it to animals.
Don't you cry!<eos> Go to Belgrade.<eos> I have some stuff to do.<eos> Come on, get in the car.<eos> It's easy to use it.
Congratulations!<eos> Your name in the papers and with Seldom!<eos> Knock off the old lady to attract attention, did you?<eos> Yourfriend is lucky.<eos> Always close to death, but nevertouched by it.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Look, Mommy.<eos> Look what Daddy got me.<eos> It looks great. You'll have to show me how it works later, okay?
That Bond is legally blind?<eos> No, Minister.<eos> I don't think I need to tell you how upset the PM is.<eos> With respect, the PM has my direct line.<eos> And he'd have used it if he'd wanted to speak to you.
I try to take care of things myself.<eos> That can be an error.<eos> You are answerable to me, I to the monsignor, he to the bishop, and so on up to the Holy Father.<eos> There is a chain.<eos> Make use of it.
I want to show you something.<eos> Do you want to go play golf?<eos> No, I hate golf.<eos> There's a story behind that club, though.<eos> What, you, like, beat somebody to death with it or something?

I wanted... to thank you for saving my life.<eos> Oh. Well, you're welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A nail file?<eos> Yes, well, I figured, you know, you didn't have one; otherwise, you would have used it.

World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.
The more roses you get on cupid day, the more popular you are, right?<eos> Thanks for the tip, Kent.<eos> Noted.<eos> I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?
Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> No, I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.
Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> It stands out in front of all the others.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I-i never said that it was from me.

Look at us, Wilson!<eos> We're something out of a horror movie!<eos> We're all pasty and bald and bitter and... lonely and... they're all fancy and...<eos> I would rather have our daughter than that creepy little kid any day of the week.<eos> It's not really our daughter!
Oh, no.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Can you see my soul?<eos> Is it still there?
I saw this boy across the room.<eos> And I loved...<eos> I just... loved him the first moment I saw him.<eos> And we had a life.<eos> And it was beautiful, and it was difficult.
I mean...<eos> - Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Hey.<eos> That thing's safe, right?<eos> Is it safe?
- Ready, Hefty?<eos> - Roger that.<eos> It works!<eos> This thing really gets me.<eos> It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.
You're just in time to witness scientific history.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> None of your business, Nosey.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.
Long have you searched for these creatures of blue.<eos> But this hat comes from somewhere new.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> Where does it come from?
Now!<eos> Stop that, Azrael.<eos> I can't calibrate my machine with all your incessant yammering.<eos> Yes, Azrael, listen to it.<eos> It purrs like a kitten.
Williamsburg Savings Bank<eos> good morning sir, Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me give you a call, We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee. Once someone is available.<eos> What will this device do?<eos> It will shine and shake.
"Or Josh Kush".<eos> How are these things legal?<eos> Dear Sir, The embargo period is over.<eos> Marijuana has extraordinary medical benefits.<eos> It is useful in all situations.
Okay.<eos> Keep your breathing slow.<eos> Just focus on the flashlight.<eos> Lisa, I can see the shark!<eos> It's coming towards you!
We just had rain last night.<eos> We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.<eos> Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- A long time ago.<eos> And the Holy Land?<eos> Jerusalem?<eos> He says that water is no good.<eos> It runs through there.
Where is he?<eos> I need to see him, now!<eos> Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> It was our insurance.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
No, really.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you, are you actually serious?<eos> I've played along with this joke.<eos> It's not funny any more.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> Parting gift.<eos> Aww, that's nice.<eos> A walking stick.<eos> Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.
That is my boss.<eos> Big Boss Baby.<eos> What is she screaming about?<eos> Well, see this pie chart?<eos> Wow, it looks like a giant pie.
Isn't it?<eos> It was, until you brought me the key ingredient.<eos> My secret formula.<eos> It's mine! It's mine!<eos> It's all mine.
Who's ticklish?<eos> Here you go.<eos> So, that's my story.<eos> Our story.<eos> Luckily for me and my little brother, it had a happy ending.
And while black people may not feel like it, it's kind of tough out there right now for everybody.<eos> I mean, really, our lives aren't all that different.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Did we get struck by lightning?<eos> Uh, I think it came through the electric blankets.
Stolen.<eos> All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car?<eos> Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?<eos> Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please?<eos> Ah, it's a terrible car, always in the shop...
One of which is a liver.<eos> Which is a perfect match for Terence.<eos> Exactly.<eos> His liver will never go to the national list.<eos> It will go directly to your nephew.
The other Iron Fists I've known were fierce, unrelenting in their mission to protect K'un-Lun from the Hand.<eos> They would never have backed down from a grand duel just to save the life of one girl.<eos> How did you know my father?<eos> I've been alive long enough to watch the world change in many ways.<eos> But this change now, it feels significant.
What if she won't talk?<eos> She'll talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you stopped to consider that this idea totally sucks?<eos> It doesn't suck, okay?
I think Gandhi might disagree with you.<eos> Okay, I'm not special... but I've seen enough people die to understand the value of a life.<eos> What about all the lives that Gao destroys?<eos> Hey...<eos> Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.
Healing through chi.<eos> Reiki is thought of as a pseudoscience, but there are stories of it healing tumors and curing disease.<eos> So, maybe it's more real than I thought.<eos> You know, chi is the breath of life.<eos> It's what powers the Iron Fist.
Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm through with you, Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.<eos> You're going to prison.<eos> Only this time, it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.
- What?<eos> This...<eos> Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.<eos> You have got to get rid of that shit.<eos> It was Dean's.
In the boardroom...<eos> Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.<eos> This time, for good.<eos> This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.
Potential... yeah?<eos> Promise.<eos> The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh?<eos> - And that hope belongs to me.<eos> It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!
It's trash that somebody left behind.<eos> Hey, but if it's mystery you want, you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?<eos> What the hell is that thing, you know?<eos> Why won't it dry up?<eos> Why won't it harden?
- All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing, - I wanted to give you a valentine. - Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?<eos> - You did? - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Well... - Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,
I..<eos> I mean it's complicated but I have never been happier.<eos> - Hey Mia, whassup?<eos> - Did you hear about Jose's show?<eos> It was incredible.
How much did she comprehend?<eos> So, Mary...<eos> I see you're looking at our little problem.<eos> Little?<eos> It's big.
But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.<eos> When you first arrived I was going to crush you.<eos> But I knew that if only you could see what the other gods could not then you would join me, and with our powers combined we could finally end all the pain, all the suffering destruction they bring.<eos> And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.<eos> We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.<eos> You see, that's the funny thing about fate.<eos> It's cunning.<eos> It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
That's a million-dollar show car.<eos> The point is to not draw attention.<eos> It's reverse psychology.<eos> Dom would never see it coming.<eos> It's neon orange.
Boom, baby!<eos> Goin' for a ride.<eos> Back in a sec.<eos> Where's that smile?<eos> Ah. There it is.
Now... the moment of truth.<eos> As you see, the flame has formed a reflective surface on the glass, what is known as an arsenic mirror.<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> From the density of the mirror,<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period, and, yes, it would have affected his mind in the later stages.
Oi! Get it loaded!<eos> How is your religion these days, Coop?<eos> My what?<eos> Your religion, your faith.<eos> After many years in your service, it is in rags and tatters, Your Highness.
Depends, depends upon the intention,<eos> The intention behind the fire.<eos> The major also gave us a date,<eos> Day after tomorrow.<eos> If you read these stars, You find that same date, And it refers you to here.
This is a real occasion.<eos> So you really can't take that thing off, huh?<eos> Nah, I can't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's, uh, part of me.
Spencer gave me this the day Yvonne and I were supposed to leave town.<eos> And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss which I felt it was an odd thing for Spencer to do.<eos> Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra?<eos> I didn't look at the book until today.<eos> It's not hers.

It's a lost cause.<eos> This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.<eos> It's strategically meaningless.<eos> I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.<eos> The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
The lightning strikes the rod, which sends the bolt down into the tunnel.<eos> We grab the Ghost Rider push him into the bunker, and we trap him there.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you keep him from riding the lightning back out of the tunnels before you get him into the trap?<eos> Well, if the lightning strikes again, it'll just hit our rod.
Three of them.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> The Ghost Rider's whip didn't go deep enough to take him, but left a gash on his back.<eos> He was thrown into the tank and the wound infected the water.<eos> It mixed with the fluid from the vat and actually made him stronger.
Well, you should have sent someone else.<eos> So many soldiers here...<eos> we tend to lose a few, especially when they're afraid.<eos> There's rumors of magic.<eos> If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
Do you?<eos> I'm glad you banned it.<eos> I'm glad not to use it.<eos> Magic was a drug even worse than the poppy.<eos> Lot of good it did us against The Beast Forever.
The wagon will pass without being stopped.<eos> And no one will follow them.<eos> Clever plan.<eos> It was Dorothy's.<eos> When she gets to Glinda's, she'll stop this war before it even starts.
This vortex chamber can send you home.<eos> One thing they asked you first to stop Glinda.<eos> She gave me the only weapon that could have killed the witch.<eos> - Not the only one.<eos> - When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it even starts.
Nothing.<eos> I died and came back to life.<eos> Surely I can cast a stupid spell.<eos> You don't summon magic.<eos> It comes for you.
But if we could dramatically increase those numbers...<eos> Increase them how?<eos> The Underhill plantation.<eos> It's the largest and richest of the interior estates, and it's home to well over 200 slaves.<eos> It's well-defended.
When the queen was done with you... you were gone.<eos> Worse ways to go...<eos> Clothes and hair change with the times, but this queen, ha ha, she kept the party going.<eos> But the kings, they kept coming after her.<eos> Our queen's power... which is the power of all women, the power of rebirth, and creation... it makes some men kneel in awe and give gifts.
Starve them into submission?<eos> They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.
I'm fine, really.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I told you, bike, branch, skin.<eos> That's all?<eos> Mom, I tell you everything about my life because it is so fascinating, I promise.
Duran?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.
She looks it.<eos> Tell him call her today or don't bother coming home.<eos> It's chaos theory.<eos> But, see, chaos theory isn't exactly about chaos.<eos> It's about how a tiny change in a big system can affect everything.
- Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What am I supposed to be seeing?<eos> Just a shadow over the moon.<eos> Look, it's growing slowly.
- Yeah.<eos> I think I'm just gonna... pass the project on to the next student.<eos> Sounds very collaborative.<eos> A colleague of mine is studying collaborative learning theory.<eos> It actually strengthens your synapses.
Be careful!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Well...<eos> I love this car.<eos> It has that new car smell.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.
And if you are... and if you want to talk to someone about them, someone who doesn't share your DNA...<eos> I'll... I'll let you know.<eos> Look, I hated high school.<eos> I couldn't wait to get out.<eos> It was hell for me.
Every culture since earliest antiquity has survived this way, defining itself by the things it excludes.<eos> So long as there is progress, there will always be human debris in its wake, on the outside looking in.<eos> And sooner or later, one must answer the question... what becomes of them?<eos> In London, the solution is to call them criminals.<eos> To throw them in a deep, dark hole and hope it never runs over.
And sooner or later, one must answer the question... what becomes of them?<eos> In London, the solution is to call them criminals.<eos> To throw them in a deep, dark hole and hope it never runs over.<eos> I would argue that justice demands we do better than that.<eos> That a civilization is judged not by who it excludes, but by how it treats the excluded.
Well, Dr. Wong... By the way, racist name...<eos> Obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.<eos> Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction.<eos> I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic.<eos> I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability.

MUM!<eos> Where's the head?<eos> - What?<eos> - My head.<eos> Where is it?
- What?<eos> - My head.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.
Where is it?<eos> It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.<eos> - I'll ask the questions.<eos> - First you tell me where it is.
It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.<eos> - I'll ask the questions.<eos> - First you tell me where it is.<eos> It's here. In a fridge.
And they know that.<eos> That's why they're so terrified of you and I.<eos> If we were able to take Nassau, if we are able to expose the illusion that England is not inevitable, if we are able to incite a revolt that spreads across the New World... then, yeah...<eos> I imagine people are gonna notice.<eos> "Too much sanity may be madness, "and the maddest of all, "to see life as it is and not as it should be."
Can we just take a moment here?<eos> You don't even know what it is you're asking for.<eos> Am I in it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it about my life?
It's perfectly natural.<eos> You see it all the time in the wild.<eos> The smaller animal going limp in the jaws of the larger.<eos> Genetic instinct.<eos> At some level, food knows it's food.
You cover the Israelis like paint.<eos> Technical glitch.<eos> So?<eos> There's a-a Russian traveling carnival that features a squirrel that's running on a wire wheel.<eos> The squirrel thinks it's turning the wheel, but if it stops running, its feet get caught in the wires and the squirrel breaks its paws.
You have to sing?<eos> For the last two years, I've been working my way down the songline.<eos> I don't have to tell you every community has a different part, so I've had to learn it piece by piece... Every sacred site, every ceremony, every word.<eos> You want my song?<eos> It's the last one.
Honey, I don't know where he is.<eos> And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.
That doesn't matter.<eos> You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?<eos> Who else? Matt?<eos> 'Cause if you're having visions, he's gonna wanna put it in your fucking book.<eos> It's not my fucking book!
I think you like it.<eos> I think you wanna be Jesus Christ fucking Superstar because it makes you feel important.<eos> Like it?<eos> I fucking love it!<eos> It's riveting!
Let's be honest, you have a better story.<eos> My story is true.<eos> - Come on, Matt.<eos> - It's all true.<eos> It's... It's based on fact.
I'm happy to keep helping here.<eos> You already helped by finding me the address.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're not gonna let me see this suicide machine for myself?<eos> - It's not a suicide machine.
You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
You may experience nausea or discomfort as you pass by the undulating laser array while it cycles up.<eos> Do not touch the array.<eos> Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left.<eos> Hard to the left.<eos> It'll stick.
When you're ready, we will start the ignition sequence.<eos> You will hear three tones.<eos> After the third tone, the chamber will fill up with fluid.<eos> The fluid will have the same consistency as water, but it is not water.<eos> It contains metals that will be irradiated.
- She is.<eos> And she sent a note.<eos> She sent it?<eos> She's taken charge of them all already?<eos> It's an offer of an exchange.
A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.<eos> It's mostly law books, but there are sections on everything from Italian cuisine to the world's most threatening fungus.<eos> I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...
Is this war more important than her life?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> I wanna hear you say it.<eos> Is this war more important than her life?<eos> Right now with what's at stake... yes, it is more important.
But I'm through wagering with her life now.<eos> If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us.<eos> We had it.<eos> We had it in our hands.<eos> This war was breathing air, it was alive.
So it's likely you've just sent one of those two groups to their death.<eos> As long as they expose his position.<eos> I wonder if he knows... just how much you learned from him.<eos> Your opponent's wrist is from whence the attack is born.<eos> It is its past tense from which it cannot separate itself.
And this, arguably one of his greatest paintings.<eos> An iconic work of individuals setting aside their differences for a common good.<eos> Yet, in its day, this painting was ridiculed, called "a mess," "the work of an amateur."<eos> There were stories about the gents who hired Rembrandt refusing to pay because they were unhappy with their likenesses.<eos> The painting was so unappreciated that when they moved from one hall to another, they decided it was too big, so they just slashed chunks off the bottom and the side.
- Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - We saw your speech.<eos> - It was beautiful.
Just one.<eos> I mean, it didn't come anywhere near us.<eos> I don't think he intended to, but still.<eos> Anyway, he takes one look at Lonnie and practically shits himself.<eos> I mean, he tosses away the gun like it was on fire.
A girl can't just be friends with a chap.<eos> It's has to be sex.<eos> Or love.<eos> In my experience, as many kill for love as desire.<eos> It stirs up the mud, requited or not.
Ah!<eos> I see you've met my muse.<eos> Haunting, isn't she?<eos> Disturbing, certainly.<eos> Who is it?
I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.<eos> I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".<eos> Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard.<eos> FBI.<eos> Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.
New station trajectory, negative.32.<eos> The capsule will miss us. Just.<eos> - Rory?<eos> - I'm still downrange.<eos> And it's coming in shallow.
I thought your parents went up to see you.<eos> They did, but, uh... oh, it's a long story.<eos> I read your book.<eos> We all have.<eos> It caused quite a stir around here.
Hey, Hodgins, slow down, man.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope. I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> She wasn't at the wards, and when I went to her room before breakfast, it was empty.
Well, did Ezra say he wanted to postpone the wedding?<eos> We didn't talk about it.<eos> So then proceed with plan A.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Aria, you're gonna plan this wedding and it's going to be waiting for him while he says goodbye to Nicole.
- Of course.<eos> - I support you.<eos> - Whatever you decide.<eos> - This isn't your problem.<eos> Aria, you're gonna plan this wedding, and it's going to be waiting for him while he says goodbye to Nicole.
He's probably more torn up inside than you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No sweat.<eos> Try the pizza.<eos> It's good.
- How long has that been here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Is there any chance this thing's broken?<eos> It's not broken.<eos> It's deciding.
Literally.<eos> Wait, do you hear that?<eos> It's like a hum and then a bunch of clicks.<eos> Yeah, trust me that thing makes all kinds of noise.<eos> I know, I just, I can't even tell if it's mechanical or electrical.
One that was done much later.<eos> It turned the idea of vengeance into a game.<eos> A game?<eos> But I came back tonight because I didn't want whoever sent that note to have it.<eos> Where is it?
No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?
Were you drunk?<eos> - No. Butterflies are classic.<eos> - They're retarded.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I didn't have your artistic eye to advise me, so I got a retarded butterfly.<eos> I mean, it's pretty.
- Go! ... or I'll punch you in the dick.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Okay, there's a real simple way out of this.<eos> - Not now. - The farm's worth a lot of money.<eos> They just found out it's sitting on top of a massive uranium deposit.
I know, Howard, and I regret misleading you.<eos> It's just that a certain... Vérité had to be established.<eos> I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me.<eos> Chuck, this tape --<eos> I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes.
I won't tell anyone.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - But I do not approve.<eos> You broke up with Meggy like five minutes ago, and now you're already buying jewelry for some other girl?<eos> It's not just some other girl.
Thank you.<eos> It is safe here.<eos> I use when I come.<eos> Lincoln: You got any food for him?<eos> Come, it's in the boat.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
Let's just take some time and try to figure out what we're actually dealing with here.<eos> It's not doing anything dangerous.<eos> And we're not going to give it a chance to.<eos> That thing is a living weapon, it's a killing machine.<eos> - It's not a machine
It's not doing anything dangerous.<eos> And we're not going to give it a chance to.<eos> That thing is a living weapon, it's a killing machine.<eos> - It's not a machine<eos> - It's not human.
Meneither. Naomi?<eos> We just lost sight of it behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, aft.<eos> There's no good camera on that position.<eos> Keep moving to your left.<eos> It has to be down there.
We just lost sight of it behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, aft.<eos> There's no good camera on that position.<eos> Keep moving to your left.<eos> It has to be down there.<eos> We would have seen it if it moved.
It's not some dumb animal.<eos> The device it tore out of its chest was a Fail Safe Regulator, some kind of command and control module.<eos> Control module, my ass.<eos> That was an incendiary device, you understand?<eos> A bomb probably designed to destroy that thing in case it got out of control, all right?
I bet you I can bounce that thing out one of the holes.<eos> Out of the question.<eos> A maneuver like that would snap him in two.<eos> That thing is strong as hell.<eos> I doubt it's gonna just trip out and fall into space.
Your suit can only filter out so much of that, then your heart stops.<eos> You know a lot about how people die.<eos> Yeah, I guess I do.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Whatever that thing is now, it used to be human.
Stand by for zero-G.<eos> It's working.<eos> It stopped digging.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It's heading back for Holden.
Naomi said that the creature gets energy<eos> - from radiation, right?<eos> - Yeah, sure. It sucks radiation the way a tick sucks blood.<eos> First time we found the protomolecule, it was wrapped around a reactor core, so what?<eos> It's following a nutrient gradient.
When I give the word, you pull the core. Now.<eos> Pull it now!<eos> It's out the door.<eos> It's headed your way!<eos> Okay, here it comes!
Guns.<eos> Railguns.<eos> Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.
Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.<eos> It's already scattered too far to ever be sure it'll all be gone.<eos> It's part of the equation now, and it will be from now on.
He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.<eos> But it also made him... evil.
If she can accept you for all that,<eos> I'm pretty sure she can accept you for who you are.<eos> Okay?<eos> You know, mustard is actually high in antioxidants.<eos> It's actually pretty good for you.
I Portaled to freakin' India and had to face off with a cobra!<eos> And all I got was this stupid box of hers!<eos> This stupid box is sacred.<eos> You know why?<eos> It contains Camille's grave dirt.
Magnus, tell me, can it be done?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Sure, there are warlocks who've done this sort of thing.<eos> But what you're talking about is dark, dark magic.<eos> It's wildly unpredictable.
Wait.<eos> Do you sleep in a coffin?<eos> No, it's a canoe.<eos> And, Mom, the blood wasn't fake.<eos> It was real.
For the answers you seek, we must go inside the Citadel.<eos> But we cannot allow any demonic impurities to pass.<eos> The adamas is too fragile.<eos> So, the heavenly energy in the water will help us determine if you may enter.<eos> It will destroy any contaminant upon contact.
- Really?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.<eos> Or saw it.<eos> I just kind of thought that's what it was about.
We agree.<eos> One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?<eos> Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.<eos> A piece of the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Where is it?
No.<eos> We're good.<eos> Thank you, Ida.<eos> I wanted to thank you in person for your support.<eos> I doubt it made much of a difference.
It should.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Come on, Harry.<eos> That tattoo.<eos> It's an SF tattoo.
My son honored that commitment.<eos> He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.<eos> Wear it with pride.<eos> Respect what it represents: To serve and protect the citizens of Los Angeles.
No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior project.<eos> Oh, yeah, I heard it was a huge success.
Everything all right?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior project.<eos> Oh, yeah, I heard it was a huge success.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was, and it's really great.
He was terrified.<eos> Felicity, what's really going on?<eos> The NSA file that exonerated John, it was part of a cache of information given to me by a hacker group, and that cache includes Intel that I used to pressure the Detralink exec.<eos> You mean, you blackmailed him.<eos> - Well... - For this data cache to have exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it has to be huge.
He knew how to avoid them.<eos> And before he opened fire, he upgraded to a ski mask.<eos> That looks like a utility jumpsuit.<eos> Forefather Repair.<eos> It went belly up 6 years ago.
Why don't you like us talking about this?<eos> I just don't like you guys arguing while I'm trying to work.<eos> I mean, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy debate, Felicity.<eos> It's not healthy if it doesn't accomplish anything, and it's not going to accomplish anything.<eos> Actually, I--I disagree not about the part of it not accomplishing anything but this idea that it's not healthy.
Hasn't made a dent yet.<eos> What's that thing made of anyway?<eos> Keltium.<eos> It's a proprietary alloy developed by the U.S. government to repel nuclear blasts.<eos> So you're saying even if we had a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?
We shouldn't have left Nick.<eos> He gave us no choice.<eos> This fight's not over.<eos> It is for Nick.<eos> It would have been for us if we had stayed.
Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.<eos> It's really old.
The protomolecule was frozen around the reactor core.<eos> It was starving.<eos> Did you turn the power back on?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> It started moving.
Day-to-day operations are handled by Protogen executives, with full autonomy.<eos> With such a small project, my team would only be notified if the company exceeded its budget allotment.<eos> So, these "rogue" employees managed to make a profit and a war without even going over budget?<eos> God, maybe we should get these people on our payroll.<eos> Protogen is a bio-tech research company, and it had a government contract on Phoebe Station.
Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> You know those voices I'm hearing,<eos> I think this thing has taken the, I don't know, consciousness, some part of whatever it is makes us human.<eos> It's eating it, spitting it back out in some other configuration.
And they're beaming the data here.<eos> Naomi: It's an abandoned communications relay.<eos> Miller: At least some of the people responsible for Eros are gonna be there.<eos> If we want answers, we have to take that station.<eos> It's floating dark, barely registers on radar but it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.
I mean, somebody's gotta keep these idiots from shooting each other.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I'll go clean out my cabin.<eos> Leave it.<eos> It'll be waiting for you when you get back.
Curiosity is not a crime.<eos> More's the pity or you'd be serving life without probation.<eos> Shopping lists and household accounts.<eos> Er... have you seen the last entry?<eos> Now I suppose you're going to tell us what it means.
There has been an Ibis and Jacquel in business here for 200 years.<eos> Pins for the bones.<eos> Threads for the muscles.<eos> Paint for the skin.<eos> We need to tend to your flesh as best we can as it can't tend to itself anymore.
The power of fire is firepower.<eos> Not God.<eos> But godlike.<eos> And they believe.<eos> It fills their spirits every time they pull the trigger.
Just please don't make me go back there!<eos> Give me your money!<eos> No!<eos> I have so much to teach you, Bruce.<eos> But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.
Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> No.<eos> Your rage, Bruce.<eos> It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.
- K-9s stay with me.<eos> - Harvey, at 5:00 p.m., Union Station is gonna be packed.<eos> Even with an evacuation, thousands will be infected.<eos> Not if we find the bomb first.<eos> But I'm guessing it's not gonna be sitting out in the open.
I'm just being realistic, Wally.<eos> I get to do that.<eos> Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or as a sister or as a girlfriend, but as a reporter.<eos> This story can do that.<eos> It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.
Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or as a sister or as a girlfriend, but as a reporter.<eos> This story can do that.<eos> It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.<eos> You know, my life was a lot easier before I had a sister.<eos> But it's a lot better now, isn't it?
Wait, that's the opposite of how my blood causes cells to regenerate.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Can we use my blood to save her?<eos> Listen, I don't think that your blood is the key to saving Iris.<eos> But I do think it might be exactly what we need to take down Yorkin.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> I don't have it in me right now.<eos> I need you to get your blood into him.<eos> It'll counteract his cells and negate his powers.
We sent Grodd there when he went after Fay Wray here.<eos> - Grodd's there? - Mm.<eos> Why on Earth, any Earth, would your father want to go there?<eos> I mean, we received a mathematical cryptogram at our S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> It was highly complex.
We can.<eos> You've seen the future.<eos> You know there's an attack.<eos> If we just figure out where that attack happens, we can launch a preemptive strike against Grodd.<eos> We can stop the attack before it ever starts.
- or the freaking "Peanuts"? - It's not "The Peanuts." It's just "Peanuts."<eos> You have been studying this thing for hours. Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?<eos> Okay, all right, wind it in.<eos> As far as we can tell, the shard is made of near-frictionless material that's in a constant state of flux.<eos> So while it's utterly motionless on the outside... It's constantly moving on the inside.
Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.
Look... I'll admit, it's been hard not to wonder what it would have been like to have a daughter instead of a son, but this is less about what happened than why it happened.<eos> I made a big mistake.<eos> Exactly my concern.<eos> Barry, this is the kind of tech that wars are fought over.<eos> If something happens and it gets into the wrong hands, people could die.
I'd love to.<eos> By all means, you first.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Reminds me of "Jaws."<eos> They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.
I know.<eos> It's tough. But we'll get through this, buddy.<eos> No. No, that photo.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Where is it?
What about it?<eos> We need to know the amounts of each ingredient he used.<eos> If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.<eos> The professor kept the formula all to himself.<eos> He liked to brag about how the only place it existed was in his head.
Film her. Well, the song isn't just about love at first sight.<eos> It's about... a lifetime, about the risks two people take when their lives and their destinies cross.<eos> It was always about the music.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.
Yes.<eos> Girl, we saw the teaser, When Cookie Met Lucious.<eos> It's lit.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.
She recommended him?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Lucious, this company belongs to me and...<eos> No, it's our company.<eos> It belongs to me and my family.
Stay away from my daughter!<eos> Cass, you, um...<eos> We completed a mission.<eos> Some mission.<eos> It was horrific, but it was necessary.
But if... if I could go back and change it, three years, then I would.<eos> Cos he's out there, isn't he?<eos> Still living... and free.<eos> You know?<eos> And, after all the talking, all the counselling, this anger, it's not going anywhere, it's getting worse.
What you doing?<eos> Yes.<eos> There.<eos> The figure on the CCTV runs into a field on the edge of Flintcombe Farm with a public footpath through it.<eos> You go down that footpath and it leads to this road here which means...
This is the Reptile Room.<eos> Feel free to explore.<eos> Here is the lizard wing... and here... is a winged lizard.<eos> Now, see his yellow-striped belly, a sign of camouflage and cowardice.<eos> Can it really fly?
- Stephano!<eos> Stephano.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, there's a spare room upstairs.<eos> It's small, but like I said, I have three young children living with me,
I really appreciate your doing this, Dad.<eos> You don't appreciate it.<eos> You expect it. You take it for granted.<eos> You hardly notice it, truth be told, but in its absence, you will, like God's fucking grace.<eos> The whole point, too, of God's grace, as I understand it, is that it asks nothing in return, but love and devotion.
The universe is 14 billion years old.<eos> No one knows what came before.<eos> No one knows how big the universe actually is.<eos> It...<eos> It could be infinite."
I... I'm sorry, did you say...<eos> - Mulberry or Mott?<eos> - I said it's on Mott.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's right around the corner.
I have to ask...<eos> When you got there and you realized you were in over your heads, why didn't you just turn around and come home?<eos> We were too ashamed to fail.<eos> E-Especially when people started laughing at us, like, when we tried to build a school out of... out of mud blocks...<eos> We built one wall, and then... and then it just fell down.
Thanks, anyway.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm calling about an appointment for Charles McGill.<eos> Well, that's why I'm calling.<eos> I think it's for this week, but...
- Great.<eos> We'll talk strategy... We move on Colorado or Utah first?<eos> See ya at 7:00.<eos> This McGill thing.<eos> You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?
These things take time to unravel, even for doctors.<eos> Would you say that your illness affects your ability to think clearly?<eos> No.<eos> It affects me physically.<eos> It causes me great pain.
Potato, po-tah-to.<eos> It comes down to this...<eos> In order to understand what I was thinking, you need to see Chuck through my eyes.<eos> You need to know if I believed that tape was evidence.<eos> And I say it was evidence of only one thing...
Ooh, did I tell you I think I found an apartment?<eos> You promised me that we were going to<eos> - stand in awkward silence.<eos> - You're funny.<eos> It's in this up-and-coming neighborhood called Mu-To.
And now that I've had time to think about it, I decided that the right thing to do is to give you and not them this tape.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.<eos> Bye, Tracy.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.
The steering locked up.<eos> The thing veered off the road.<eos> - Can you get it started?<eos> - No, it's shut down.<eos> It's not going anywhere.
- Until Kuznikov showed up at his home at exactly the right time.<eos> Gretchen waited until she wasn't the only suspect. She's smart.<eos> So why isn't she pointing the finger at you?<eos> Treason is front page stuff, Brant.<eos> It doesn't just end your career. It ruins your family for generations.
That's all you can do.<eos> And don't despair.<eos> I don't think your story with Betty is over.<eos> Your room's so sweet.<eos> It's too pink.
I don't think your story with Betty is over.<eos> Your room's so sweet.<eos> It's too pink.<eos> It doesn't feel right anymore.<eos> No, I like how girly it is.
- Hey, what's up?<eos> - Hey. He used to be on the football team.<eos> But I quit.<eos> When I saw Chuck's playbook.<eos> And I may know where it is.
Who the hell is Jennifer Gibson?<eos> That's not the only thing.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't tell me you're still on this crazy witch hunt.<eos> It's not a witch hunt, and it's not crazy.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.<eos> And there's nothing I can do to stop that.<eos> Betty, don't do that.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Get out!<eos> Go on!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> The party's done.<eos> It's over!
But I lied.<eos> And instead I threw you this party that you didn't even want.<eos> Why did you?<eos> Something is very, very wrong with me.<eos> Like there's this darkness in me that's overwhelming sometimes, and I don't know where it comes from.
And given recent events, it's not inconceivable that he might've hired him to do other jobs.<eos> Like go after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him.<eos> I want to help with your investigation.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> Whatever it is.
This is outrageous.<eos> I'm writing an article about this, and not just for The Blue and Gold, for The Register.<eos> This is a town story.<eos> Okay, as long as the article doesn't include my dad.<eos> No, it is going to be about your dad, Jug.
The night Amy was murdered,<eos> Gail Meyers called me about 3:00 a.m. to say Amy hadn't come home yet.<eos> I went to ask Billy if he knew where she was.<eos> The cat was sleeping beside him.<eos> When he rolled over, it got mad and scratched him on the cheek.
I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.<eos> What I want to know is how Nasiri slipped under everybody's radar.<eos> That's the funny thing about freedom.<eos> It gives our enemies the freedom to destroy us.
Bile flow is good.<eos> Most beautiful purple you ever saw.<eos> Right.<eos> How's the hepatic artery?<eos> Just look at it, it's practically dancing.
The truly rich never have to worry about it all getting away from them.<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, Goofo.<eos> You're the best selling author of the year, and no one's taking that away from you.<eos> Lawrence, tell us what you like most about Scott's book.<eos> Well, uh... - it captures youth. - Mm-hm.
I don't know what you're talkin' about, Goofo.<eos> You're the best selling author of the year, and no one's taking that away from you.<eos> Lawrence, tell us what you like most about Scott's book.<eos> Well, uh... - it captures youth. - Mm-hm.<eos> And it takes a hatchet to everything else.
You're confused?<eos> I've been confused ever since this one popped out of my vagina.<eos> Oh, my God, Mom, do not talk about your vagina.<eos> Why?<eos> It's perfectly good.
Reason?<eos> They're garbage.<eos> I cannot show these to my father, all right?<eos> If he's gonna give us this client, we need to step up our game.<eos> Our work needs to be Ivy League, and right now, it's Arizona State.
Magnesium in the laxative caused hypomagnesaemia -- respiratory distress, low blood pressure, arrhythmia...<eos> - That would explain the blood, would it?<eos> - It would explain the vomiting.<eos> However, he was also suffering from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.<eos> The rest of it put such a strain on his system that it ruptured.
Trixie, I've been jumping through hoops all night for Sister Douglas.<eos> I don't need any more exercise, thank you.<eos> Nurse Crane.<eos> Early bird catches the worm.<eos> Or, at least, it gets all the worms lined up and identifies which is likely to cause the most trouble.
Why can't you find anything?<eos> - Because our room's a mess.<eos> - Then tidy it.<eos> I do.<eos> Then it gets untidy again.
Young man, may I enquire what you are doing?<eos> Pulling weeds.<eos> That is not a weed.<eos> That is common fleabane.<eos> It grows freely and thus it flourishes.
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?<eos> 'The brain?<eos> 'Where in the body does it hide?
May I give her your regards?<eos> Of course you may, but I'd rather you gave her my love.<eos> These are frightening times.<eos> Why do we need to paint our windows?<eos> Well, the idea of the white paint is it deflects the heat from the initial blast.
Make merry.<eos> I'd think I'd quite like to sit here with you... doing not much at all and just see what happens.<eos> What if this happens?<eos> Did the electric shock treatment help at all?<eos> It was... cleansing.
- Here's your change.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Noah's getting an RC car for the first day of school.<eos> - Sounds like it would cost a lot.
If you can stick around for, oh, another 20 minutes you'll see how strong.<eos> I can't wait for you to meet the new and improved Rebecca.<eos> The question is do you have it in you to kill her?<eos> My army of the dead will change the world for the better.<eos> It will correct the imbalance caused by recent wars.
What time did you leave the club yesterday?<eos> Six-thirty?<eos> Seven?<eos> Last minute training?<eos> It can make all the difference.
I'm sorry.<eos> So what're we looking for?<eos> The main event is Mercury in retrograde.<eos> It'll look like the planet is actually moving backwards.<eos> But it's... not?
Do you know that I collect military memorabilia?<eos> Two years ago, I got my hands on an original 1916 proclamation issued by the Irish volunteers in the Irish Citizen Army.<eos> During the Easter rebellion.<eos> Did I say it was an original? Signed by Patrick Pierce?<eos> Do this for me, and it's yours.
We had a deal.<eos> I think I'd like us to have more deals.<eos> If you think I'm gonna be working for you...<eos> But you are... because we found your weakness.<eos> It's standing right next to you.
They didn't need any.<eos> Shaun was black.<eos> And from the same part of town as that church.<eos> Guys, I think there might be something wrong with our justice system.<eos> It gets worse.
Fred Johnson has proven himself to be a true friend to the Belt.<eos> But as much as I fear war between Earth and Mars, I fear the peace more.<eos> For that is when they will turn their sights back on all of us.<eos> The Inners are not like us.<eos> Earthers cannot look upon a thing but wonder who it belongs to, huh?
Soon enough, sir.<eos> My mother was Foreign Secretary took me there on a Dip tour when I was 15.<eos> I trained in one-G since I could walk, but it's different when you're there.<eos> This oppressive pull down.<eos> It pulls the spirits down with it.
It's slipping away.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It's still there.
Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.
I'm a medical doctor, and that's privileged information, as you well know.<eos> So if you're trying to trip me up, try harder.<eos> You can come back with a court order, lock me up, and I'd still never tell you a goddamn thing about my patients.<eos> I just wonder what could have been said in such a session to justify such an enormous sum.<eos> It was commensurate with other bonuses at Axe Capital.
You already know how to do it.<eos> Mary.<eos> What color is the wall?<eos>  White.<eos>  What color do you want it to be?
 So make it so.<eos> Change it.<eos> Turn the wall red, Mary.<eos> Just turn it red.<eos>  It's red.
 I do.<eos> It's summer to me.<eos> Has been my whole life.<eos>  But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.<eos> Someplace so cold and forbidding, so utterly devoid of life, you can't know how precious it is, how vulnerable.
 I know it looks like a lot, but the meds are going to help ease the panic attacks, dysphoria, anxiety, fear you've been feeling from the PTSD.<eos>  Cults work to control your mind, and your mind has been controlled for a long time.<eos>  Right, right, right.<eos>  I spoke with a colleague who gave me information about a support group.<eos> It's for people who have been victims of mind control.
And the blood... smeared on it.<eos> Could that radio, Mike, have housed a bomb capable of this kind of damage?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I didn't look inside.<eos> If that's where the bomb had been, and it had gone off while you were checking out the body...
The course is pretty immaculate.<eos> Dr. Palmer, are you asking me on a date?<eos> No, no, I just... I just want to work on my short game.<eos> Okay, well, you know I'm gonna crush you.<eos> I appreciate your confidence, but we'll see how it holds up to the windmill on the 12th hole.
Can you imagine having a baby in Georgia?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You have to pick someone you know that you trust.<eos> Why don't you use Gary's sperm?<eos> It's just sitting there gathering dust.
I got one theory.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> - This Helen thing is exploding.<eos> It's everywhere.
I think I'm falling in love.<eos> With who?<eos> Florida.<eos> Florida?<eos> If you had a good idea, it would die of loneliness.
We shall see.<eos> But for now,<eos> Quentin, Alice, Penny, and Margo need Battle Magic.<eos> We're going to teach Battle Magic now?<eos> It was once a required course.
Well, come on, then.<eos> No interference here, as far as I can see.<eos> The vault's secure.<eos> So your box can move?<eos> It can go anywhere it likes?
Hang on.<eos> The room's still inside the box.<eos> - This isn't a knock-through.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Doctor! It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside!
TARDIS.<eos> If you're from another planet, why would you name your box in English?<eos> Those initials wouldn't work in any other language!<eos> - People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.
Those initials wouldn't work in any other language!<eos> - People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.<eos> Yes, well, that's the cloaking device.<eos> It sort of hides itself.
That should tell you something.<eos> Since when have County done a textbook anything?<eos> There is one oddity.<eos> They didn't speak to anyone at Bramford power station.<eos> It's just four miles up the road from where Laxman disappeared.
I'm on the run.<eos> I need a place to hide.<eos> They know about Bud.<eos> They put a BOLO out on his truck.<eos> It's in front of his shop.
Why?<eos> After everything that happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from.<eos> The answer might be on the cloth.<eos> I'm not sure that it is.<eos> We need to find out where its power comes from before it kills one of us.
Nick!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> So you felt the arm come through the mirror in the spice shop?<eos> I saw it first, and then I felt it.<eos> It choked her.
It was all covered in leaves and moss and mud, and it had vines for arms, and it picked him up.<eos> - It picked him right up. - What did you do?<eos> I...<eos> I shot it, but it didn't do nothing.<eos> And then... And then I ran, you know, 'cause I thought - it was coming after me.
- Me either. Well, maybe there's something we can do to make it seem like we're harming the forest.<eos> Like fake toxic sludge?<eos> Oh, wait, I think I have an idea.<eos> - What? - My brother and I, we used to have so much fun with this book when we were kids.<eos> Where is it?
Oh, yeah.<eos> We used to make this strange goop.<eos> "Humano-Reptiliana: Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle Di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.
- Please.<eos> There might be something in them that could help us fight this thing.<eos> Those books could be just as dangerous.<eos> Waiting for this thing to come after me, or us, would be more dangerous, and Adaline,<eos> I think one of the reasons it is connecting to me is because I can see those symbols.
What if you can't find her?<eos> Or what if you find her but you can't get back?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.
Or what if you find her but you can't get back?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.<eos> It doesn't belong there.
You shouldn't have come after me.<eos> Eve...<eos> You don't owe anything to anybody, and I don't know what you're trying to prove, but you're...<eos> I'm not trying to prove anything.<eos> I am trying to kill this thing before it kills us, and we can't stay here;
They buried a stick?<eos> Gets that reaction a lot.<eos> But there's more to it than that.<eos> Not just any stick.<eos> For one thing, it can heal.
It took Hexenbiest blood to cross over.<eos> A stick?<eos> It's how Nick was able to follow Eve.<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> - They said you were dead.<eos> - I think I was.<eos> I hope that stick does what we think it does.<eos> - It's healing her.
Oh, my God.<eos> He killed everybody.<eos> Except me, and I don't know why.<eos> Maybe he thought you were dead, or... Maybe the stick protected you.<eos> Well, if the stick protected me, why didn't it do anything to help Hank or Wu?
- You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... It's inside you.
With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... It's inside you.<eos> It's what makes us who we are...
Ross.<eos> Ross!<eos> Allez, cherchez partout!<eos> "Young Cap'n Ross d' most sincerely regret?"<eos> Oh, he'll regret ever sending' home his hat, for it won't fit his head when I've done with him!
A dozen or so others escaped but we all separated.<eos> They are headed for the coast.<eos> I abandoned my posting.<eos> The thought of freedom was too much for me.<eos> It was too much for us all.
Madam President, let me tell you little story about growing up in the Gurjaani countryside.<eos> You thought you caught a fish, it turned out to be a tire.<eos> The tire was full of fish.<eos> It's a great story.<eos> It's a very valuable lesson, but I really gotta go.
It was just that kind of thing, you know?<eos> He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on.<eos> A friendship like that?<eos> I don't how to describe it.<eos> - Was it legendary? - Yes.
I don't.<eos> Are we gonna have to listen to this one song over and over the whole drive?<eos> I'm just trying to figure it out.<eos> Tammy said "A Walk To The Peak" was God's favorite.<eos> It is kinda catchy.
Or you.<eos> Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?
Who are you, and what have you done with Carisi?<eos> You really feel that way?<eos> Talk to me in 20 years.<eos> I will.<eos> And you'll realize that... the job doesn't change you, it makes you more of who you already are.
It's okay.<eos> I just did it last week.<eos> I was at the 7-Eleven, and I was, you know, buying stuff for the house.<eos> Naturally, that's where black people get our groceries.<eos> I hear the squad car pull up, I heard it pull up.
The sooner we start fighting back...<eos> Emergency radiation.<eos> Yeah, a single dose intended only to stabilize.<eos> It'll give the pancreatitis a few more days to heal, And it'll give you and your dad more time. To decide on a treatment.<eos> And if I still choose surgery after, It'll be safer, right?
Yeah. My wife, kate, has this necklace, and, I think it was a gift from her mother.<eos> And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.<eos> And I know she'd want to have it with her. I just...<eos> I understand.<eos> It can be in her hand through the surgery.
I mean, medications, social skills training. To help you recognize body language.<eos> There's also a new therapy called tms, But I'd probably recommend you going. The traditional routes first.<eos> Tms?<eos> Transcranial magnetic stimulation.<eos> It's so far fda approved only for depression, But there is anecdotal evidence. That it can benefit people with spectrum disorders.
At considerable expense.<eos> No one could find anything wrong with her.<eos> It's not my stomach this time, mom,<eos> It's my head.<eos> It's throbbing.
He always has been.<eos> Wow.<eos> A few years ago, He realized that rock faces weren't enough.<eos> He loved his life.<eos> It's not over.
I'll give you some time.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> Even if he was having trouble, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you ever see Jason do that trick where you'd pull a card out of the deck and it turns out it's in his pocket?
Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine ...<eos> No. No.<eos> No one's touching it.<eos> When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.<eos> Because it's dangerous, yeah.
- software programming you to die.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> But I have something you will never have ... a soul... that will continue long after I'm gone.<eos> How can you be so sure I don't have one?<eos> If a soul doesn't come from your flesh and blood or my ones and zeroes, then it has to come from somewhere else, somewhere unrelated to our physical bodies.
- Yes, sir.<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> Agent Simmons?<eos> It's not good news, I'm afraid.<eos> The serum that's been giving you your strength... it... is... potentially lethal.
- What is it?<eos> Glioblastoma multiforme.<eos> I know, it's boring.<eos> Just your garden variety brain tumor.<eos> But at least it's in a really interesting place,
They stole you from his life.<eos> What if he never knew me?<eos> What if he can't remember?<eos> This... This reality is flawless.<eos> - It lures you in.
You know what?<eos> I'm not gonna go there.<eos> Just -- just keep moving.<eos> The resistance must have a base of operation.<eos> Where is it?
On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.<eos> And now I know what it will do.
Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.<eos> Destroy this body, sure.<eos> It was designed only for killing.<eos> My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.
- I'm as surprised as you.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The Darkhold.<eos> My arm still hurts.<eos> Why won't it heal?
OK.<eos> I'm your long-lost twin sister.<eos> I look just like you.<eos> I even have a tiny teeny beard right on the end of my chin.<eos> It's your doppelganger.
Neither shot could have originated from the car.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> That the shots were fired before.<eos> I don't know when exactly, but certainly before the accident.<eos> Helen, they were fired by someone standing outside the vehicle whilst it was stationary.
A storage area?<eos> In Osaka.<eos> What about a soul that doesn't match?<eos> It's like organ donation.<eos> The body will reject say, a kidney if it wasn't the right type.
Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.<eos> Our car was that color.<eos> We bought it off Craigslist.<eos> It smelled like maple syrup.
It's nice.<eos> I don't want to forget this.<eos> Fuck.<eos> A rose is a rose, except here.<eos> Here it has to mean something.
And at the exact moment that hope is abandoned, our Savior will reveal Himself to the frightened masses.<eos> Ingenious.<eos> The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.<eos> Your uniform.<eos> Some of the men find it a bit... flamboyant.
Ingenious.<eos> The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.<eos> Your uniform.<eos> Some of the men find it a bit... flamboyant.<eos> It's... spectacular.
It was where we first met.<eos> Newton believed light to be made of particles.<eos> Professor Godfrey was lecturing on the wave theory of light.<eos> And you came through the door.<eos> Well, a wave needs something to push against, does it not?
Well, I better not keep my partner waiting.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um, I just wanted to give you a gift, um, to thank you for your candor.<eos> It was invaluable.
I stretch out my arms to him, but he slips away.<eos> Like a ghost at daybreak.<eos> And I am left here.<eos> I wish this story were different.<eos> I wish it showed me in a better light.
You enjoying yourself, Dad?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Good! - They could turn the music down a bit, though.<eos> - What?<eos> - The music -- it's very loud.
Uh, hopefully you can hear me.<eos> Please tell Daddy and Sahar that I'm okay...<eos> Oh, Jonesy! Thank God!<eos> Don't "Jonesy" me!<eos> We know about your special panic room. Where is it?
Yeah, nice try and all, but I can't help you here.<eos> I got my own fish to fry.<eos> You get service here?<eos> Maybe I'll get the fried fish.<eos> Mmm. It's beer battered. Not halal.
Soup sounds wonderful.<eos> - Uh, cold soup.<eos> - Oh, yes. I never cook anything hot.<eos> I'm afraid to turn on the stove.<eos> It... it might burst into flames.
And no doubt taller in heels.<eos> Are you arresting me?<eos> !<eos> Unfortunately, due to the lack of evidence, that's not possible.<eos> So I'm going to get this blood tested, and if it matches that of the victim, then I'm going to arrest you.
- Pardon the interruption...<eos> - Excellent timing, Gideon.<eos> Your daughter Lily's algorithm has identified a location for another piece of the Spear.<eos> Well, when it rains, it pours.<eos> Where is it, Gideon?
About time.<eos> You know what that power makes me?<eos> A bad guy?<eos> Evil?<eos> It makes me a god.
Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.<eos> It was always cold.
So, what you're telling me is that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long lost father has returned from Cadmus custody with news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's other-worldly heat vision radiation,<eos> and that they're going to drop that on National City and just kill us all?<eos> Ha! Is... Is this...<eos> You could run a trace on Kara's heat vision radiation signature.<eos> Right, yeah well, if the bomb is armed, then yes, I might be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.
No!<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> No! - The painting.<eos> Where is it?
Hey, hey! How you doing, buddy?<eos> Getting there.<eos> I got a little something to perk you up.<eos> So I just finished running diagnostics on this little beauty.<eos> And it, my friend, is in tip top shape.
That's all that matters.<eos> As long as they don't use the Supergirl defense.<eos> The what?<eos> It's a thing some criminals use to get their charges dropped.<eos> It's a perfect storm for a defense attorney.
You're gonna have a shitload of FBI at your disposal, and this is how I suggest you deploy them.<eos> Axelrod.<eos> Bobby Axelrod's moves will be almost impossible to track.<eos> So, in addition to monitoring all his trades, follow everyone he touches and everyone they touch.<eos> The pattern won't be easy to spot, but it will be there.
Dr Fagan can hardly expect all those things for the salary he's offering.<eos> Das ware lacherlich...<eos> Ja?<eos> Ja.<eos> Oh, well, I think you'll find it very suitable.
You don't need to know.<eos> And neither does Dominique, a'ight?<eos> Two bottles go on the receipt, but only one bottle gets pulled from inventory.<eos> What happens to the extra bottle?<eos> It just magically disappears and our receipts match up.
They get it wrong... don't they?<eos> Sometimes, they make mistakes.<eos> You stopped returning Christmas cards.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My career, it sort of becomes all-consuming.
- The boy's the one with your magic wand.<eos> - Sonic screwdriver.<eos> - How is that a screwdriver?<eos> - In a very broad sense.<eos> - How's it sonic?
You're insane.<eos> No.<eos> I'm quite rational, actually.<eos> Monogamy is not natural.<eos> It is a construct of religious authority.
They run in a tube.<eos> They tend to... They rise because of what is termed the capillary effect...<eos> I've got a physics question.<eos> So, I was in my bathtub this morning, and I dunk my head at the same time as I knock my hairbrush in with my toe.<eos> And it hits the cast iron, and it sounds quite loud underwater.
Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, - then how do we know it's there?
Can't blame you.<eos> She's a beauty.<eos> Lethal, but a beauty.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Take care of your rifle, it'll take care of you.
But you... you have a special sight.<eos> Here, what do you think of this public art?<eos> I don't know, it's just art.<eos> Focus, Liz, focus.<eos> It sucks.
Mileva's got a wonderful mind.<eos> I can see why you were drawn to her.<eos> That feels like eons ago.<eos> Love is a chemical reaction.<eos> Sometimes, it burns itself out.
I'll contact B.R.A.D.<eos> Hoover here will take care of the professional.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'm going to leave the tarp out.<eos> If you fail again, it'll be waiting.
And we intend to unruffle them. By offering up something that the critics can't argue against, proof.<eos> In the form of astronomical photographs.<eos> Consider Mercury, the closest planet to the sun.<eos> Unlike the other seven planets, Mercury's orbit doesn't conform to Newtonian laws.<eos> It's off.
I can assure you that rumors remain at the speculation stage, yet I would tread carefully.<eos> A scandal once unleashed is difficult to reign in and always ends up much worse for the woman than the man.<eos> Thank you, Bertha. But I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.<eos> And so clearly the deflection should be precisely. .83 seconds of arc.<eos> And to get here, we employed riemannian geometry, since it contains certain invariants under coordinate transformations that.
Gotta pull over and check it out.<eos> Older cars, you know how it is.<eos> Hey, Ruiz! Get me my flashlight in the glove box?<eos> I used to work on my dad's car.<eos> If it's overheating, you're gonna have to...
Needs work.<eos> And exhale.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The good news is the fluid currently in his lungs is draining.<eos> But it will return with a vengeance.
I'm into Claire.<eos> I thought you knew that.<eos> I like Diaz and all, but we can't all go down for what she did.<eos> You can't pull the lever.<eos> You got to let fate take its course, or it comes back to haunt you.
And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know?<eos> Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
- But what are they saying? - Uh, uh, uh...<eos> The comments are mostly skewing positive.<eos> "Squash the system." "Give the ladies what they want."<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I guess you can't deny cruelty when it shows up on your Facebook feed.
Because we won.<eos> We fought back and we won.<eos> And you are a blind cow.<eos> And you are a...<eos> I lost my humanity in the dirt here for a while... but it's slowly coming back.
- No, come on, get one.<eos> Another one, where, you know, in a place where people can see it this time.<eos> It's not... My tattoo is not for me.<eos> It's...<eos> It's for other people.
It's a very long story.<eos> You have taught me... that...<eos> love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life...<eos> It hurts.
There is a hope that people think soberly.<eos> Dear.<eos> Do not hammer your bright head with gloomy thoughts.<eos> The war is finally over.<eos> I do not leave the feeling that it has only just begun.
- Yeah.<eos> I think this is how they did it.<eos> That was heavy cooperative magic.<eos> Yeah, well, there are notes for version 2.0 here.<eos> I mean, it's more efficient.
Of course.<eos> David, come in.<eos> I've just read your paper.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> Well, hopefully it'll give you some ammunition to fire back at the quantum contingent.
David, come in.<eos> I've just read your paper.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> Well, hopefully it'll give you some ammunition to fire back at the quantum contingent.<eos> It does, and it came at just the right moment.
I have no special talent, but I am very, very curious, Alice.<eos> All I do is ask questions, just like you do.<eos> That's the most important thing.<eos> Anybody can do that.<eos> You know, I was looking up at the moon last night and wondering, why doesn't it come crashing down?
You want to have kids.<eos> What would you do if it was your son, Shahir?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Enucleating the tumor now.<eos> Billy: It's in a tricky spot, right on the pancreatic duct.
All my life, I was good, polite, never got in anyone's way.<eos> You know what I got for it?<eos> Dog crap in my locker, gum on bike seat... running the punch gauntlet when I walk out of school.<eos> - And you don' t want to go back to that.<eos> - [sighs] This tumor may have made me crazy, but it made things better in my life, too.
Gar...<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Maybe my uterus is just wonky.<eos> No, Catherine. It's porcelain and perfect.
I ran back for him, and he was...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you see what it was?<eos> And the radio?<eos> It wasn't working.
If they're working with spies, I'll find them.<eos> I imagine you are highly motivated.<eos> It's healing well.<eos> Sabine will be pleased.<eos> I could protect marigold better if I knew what it was,
Alec?<eos> What are you doing in my father's study?<eos> You mentioned his model train.<eos> He doesn't use it much anymore.<eos> I think it reminds him. Too much of what life was like before.
Transfer if you need to, krystina, I understand.<eos> Or you can stay, Take the next flight into the field. I won't...<eos> I won't hold you back.<eos> The intelligence has been sent to berlin.<eos> It lines up with the whispering. They've been hearing from oslo, bergen.
With one dick, you're just jerking yourself off, but with three dicks, suddenly you've got six people having sex.<eos> Which is more powerful?<eos> I think your metaphor literally doesn't make any fucking sense.<eos> It doesn't have to.<eos> It just distracted you long enough for Alice to power up the spell, which is all the shield charm has to do.
Everything all right, gentlemen?<eos> We know your game, Philbrick.<eos> We've being comparing stories.<eos> One day, I'll tell you the truth and you won't believe that, either.<eos> Because it's more extraordinary than any of your tiny little minds could ever comprehend.
It's been okay.<eos> My heart is broken.<eos> But we'll be fine, won't we?<eos> Get back on track and we'll find a new date for the wedding.<eos> Oh, how beautiful it's going to be.
♪ And I'll make it wake ♪<eos> ♪ Your heart lies in my eyes ♪<eos> ♪ Your heart lies in my eyes ♪<eos> ♪ I have your lionheart ♪<eos> ♪ It has made me be ♪
Only a demon would harm a child.<eos> You are your mother's daughter.<eos> God will judge you for your sin.<eos> There is sickness then.<eos> It will play in our favor.
When that car was launched in 1990, it was considered remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari, but unlike a Ferrari of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very, very easy to drive.<eos> Honda killed that car off 12 years ago. But finally, they've come up with a replacement.<eos> So I've been down to our track to see what it's like.<eos> This is it.<eos> It costs £138,000.
There is no physical connection to the pedal.<eos> That's because they have to harvest energy to recharge the battery system.<eos> It's a much cleverer version of that than you get on the Porsche 918, a car that costs five times as much.<eos> Then there's the hybrid system.<eos> It uses not one electric motor, as you might expect, but three.
Highly-trained men are now removing its skin which will then be mated in a delicate two-hour operation... to the internal organs of the mud-plugging V8.<eos> The following morning my incredible car was ready.<eos> It is incredible that in a shed I have created something which has... eluded the combined might of the motor industry.<eos> It is a proper sports utility vehicle.<eos> I call it the MGD, and now I'm going to find out how well it works on a road.
No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it.<eos> - What reserve?<eos> £100,000.<eos> - So it didn't sell at all, which means you cost us £14,000?
Operate the pumps. They send the results up, across, and into the water purification system.<eos> It emerges from that as purest drinking water.<eos> Food. I'm gonna need it.<eos> I've got a chicken.<eos> It lays eggs. They go in there.
That's my own urine!<eos> - Are you two doing this?<eos> - Yes, he is!<eos> I'd get out of the way if I were you.<eos> The trouble with the chicken is, it moves around, making this a...
They put the door in the wrong place.<eos> It should be... It should be further back.<eos> That is brilliant.<eos> There's more, too.<eos> It's not a particularly handsome car.
It was like watching an ape return to its cage and finding there was an apple and a banana.<eos> "I like apple, but I like bananas.<eos> So do I want the apple or a banana?"<eos> You would have had both, obviously.<eos> Hammond, that car is brilliant, and it only costs £60,000.
If you make a car that is excellent for doing a fast lap of the Nürburgring, it would be useless as a car everywhere else in your life.<eos> It's like... It's like setting your house up to play Laser Quest.<eos> It will be brilliant for playing Laser Quest, but it'll be rubbish for a dinner party because it's full of lasers, darkness, fog and music that goes... and people running around thinking that they're in Star Wars.<eos> Or you could get a dog... You could train a dog as an attack dog, which is fantastic if you own a scrapyard and you need the dog to guard it, but take it home as a pet, it will eat your children.<eos> It's completely useless.
We were coming through the airport here the other day, coming through Chicago, and he went, "Jeremy, smell my jacket."<eos> He said what? ! - Yeah.<eos> - He did.<eos> He said, "Smell my jacket." I said, "Why?"<eos> He said, "Because it smells of old record players."
And then we had to secure it in place.<eos> I don't understand ratchet straps. Er...<eos> There's water coming into the boat.<eos> - No, there was some in when I bought it.<eos> - It's leaking.
Let's go catch that sailing boat!<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Watch this, sunshine.<eos> That is the fastest thing I've...<eos> Why is it faster than me?
You see, we liked it in the Caribbean.<eos> Our crews liked it in the Caribbean.<eos> So we thought it would be a good idea, next week, to make a film comparing the motoring cultures of the French, the Dutch and the British Islands.<eos> - Yeah, it was a great idea. - Brilliant idea.<eos> But Mr Wilman, our producer, he decided it wasn't a brilliant idea, and that, instead, we should go to northern France with three old cars and drive around in the rain.
Chicken is a vegetable.<eos> - It isn't. - It is.<eos> Scientifically, chicken is a vegetable.<eos> If you cut a chicken's head off it still runs around. There you go.<eos> Thereby proving it's not a sentient being, it's a higher-order vegetable.
Yes!<eos> No May?<eos> No, and there wouldn't be, because I was in another part of the port with my own travel plans.<eos> Last night, after the other two had gone to bed, I arranged for our company yacht to be waiting for me in the harbour.<eos> And there it is!
Let's get to the point which is, James May, you lost and you broke the company yacht.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Hang on a minute.<eos> My car got closer to England than yours did.<eos> Yes, but the other thing it got closest to was the bottom of the sea.
All of that is irrelevant because my car was the best, cos it didn't go wrong at all.<eos> Mine was perfectly reliable.<eos> Mine was as reliable as James's arms.<eos> And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.<eos> It fell off the back of a lorry.
Mine was perfectly reliable.<eos> Mine was as reliable as James's arms.<eos> And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.<eos> It fell off the back of a lorry.<eos> No-one can work out what fault it had that caused it to be on the lorry in the first place.
This is a new way of understanding the condition of being human.<eos> It is the last word in luxury.<eos> It's a very expensive statement, though.<eos> I mean, if you've got the money to buy that, you could buy the Jag and still have £130,000 to spend on a PR agent to put you on breakfast TV talking about how great you are.<eos> It costs £130,000 more for a reason.
Underneath is the same basic aluminium structure you find under a Jaguar XE, which is a fantastic car, so that's good.<eos> I do only get a 3L supercharged V6, which means 375 brake horsepower. That's 225 less than James's, let's be honest, leather-lined Audi Q7.<eos> But this is light, so it ain't no slouch.<eos> I like the way this thing handles itself.<eos> I like the way, when you change direction, when you turn, it controls its weight, what there is of it, across the axles. That makes it feel nimble, eager.
We're not that stupid.<eos> Just as if you leave the gate unlocked at the lion closure at a safari park, we don't all run in and have a picnic.<eos> In the last 15 years, Britain's economy has grown by 58%, whereas Germany's has grown by 102%.<eos> And that's because we're all doing 20 miles an hour and they're doing 200.<eos> Speed is good for business, and it saves lives as well.
The reboot completely wiped my memory stores.<eos> Android, can I try something? Okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Her neural link is a huge asset.<eos> It allows for total control over the ship, shields, navigation, weapons...
I've got an idea.<eos> --Six, over.<eos> --Yeah, go ahead.<eos> Jake says to top up the back tire.<eos> It might be a bit flat.
How much longer until it breaches the outer edges of the station?<eos> If the current rate of collapse continues, less than 30 minutes.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've doublechecked the reading.<eos> Whatever that white wall out there is, it's coming towards us.
Are you sure?<eos> I've doublechecked the reading.<eos> Whatever that white wall out there is, it's coming towards us.<eos> Well, we've got to move.<eos> Get the Blink Drive and get the hell outta here before it hits.
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
Why the hell would he go there?<eos> We're on our way.<eos> You should know.<eos> The anomaly is growing in intensity.<eos> It appears to be drawing power from the facility's fusion reactor.
My crewman, Boone, when he came to, he said it was a gateway.<eos> He also said he could hear voices in his head.<eos> I think maybe he can.<eos> He's had those things in him before.<eos> We managed to get it out, but what if it affected him?
Do you think you lost your faith, Father?<eos> Lose my faith?<eos> How could I?<eos> I've just seen a demon appear and the smoke rising from the pit to torment mankind just as it's written in Gospel.<eos> I'm not scared because I'm losing my faith. I'm scared because it's stronger than ever.
I've adjusted the grid fins.<eos> I reversed the thrusters.<eos> Damn it, what am I missing?<eos> Meditating isn't gonna help me land this stupid ship.<eos> No, but it might keep your brain from blowing up.
Great, so Cassandra and I will head to New York and you guys can go to South Carolina.<eos> No. I should probably go on my own.<eos> He can be a little touchy.<eos> Eve can't go anyway.<eos> I have a mission of my own and it takes precedence.
- Oh, yes.<eos> Last time we spoke, you were at the anger stage of grief.<eos> Now you've moved to bargaining.<eos> You can't really bargain with a tumor.<eos> So what if... it could remain a part of you but you could go on living?
You have to believe me.<eos> Let me prove it to you.<eos> - How?<eos> - The secret lab.<eos> If it's there, then we're telling the truth.
A butterfly will squeeze its way out of there soon.<eos> When I was a little boy, I was about your age, I saw one trying to get out.<eos> But it was having trouble, so I tried to help.<eos> Really carefully, I split open the casing and the butterfly came right out!<eos> But it couldn't fly.
A lot of people around here... Sacker, me... we were born with a place at the table.<eos> But you came to this job knowing what it means to be an outsider, and with the desperate fury of one.<eos> But you are still letting that fury use you instead of you using it.<eos> Right now, it's directed at me, which doesn't serve you at all.<eos> But refocused, channeled, it'll become a weapon... instead of a liability.
Axelrod lacks five of the eight virtues of the Bushido.<eos> Six.<eos> Oftentimes, he wasn't even polite.<eos> Under these circumstances, honor doesn't demand silence or self-harm.<eos> It demands vengeance.
Now, is that gonna come back and bite me?<eos> If you hadn't told me, could've ended your campaign, but I know how to spin it as a strong anti-bullying stance. By the time I'm finished with you, you'll be signing baseball bats every time you appear in public.<eos> Okay.<eos> My biggest potential vulnerability.<eos> Now it's in your hands.
No, it was a purposeful desecration of the man who beat and raped me.<eos> Well, they go with everything.<eos> Under Colonel Al-Saleh, the oppression of women has been growing year after year.<eos> Absolutely, and that is why this photo opportunity is so vital.<eos> - It sends a "Po-ent" message...
I suppose you'll be needing my plane?<eos> - Pretty please?<eos> - Well, when you say it like that.<eos> I wanna say something about my paella.<eos> Now, it is so good, when you taste it, what's gonna happen, Will?
- I do!<eos> Oh, well, there you go.<eos> So, what did you think of the manuscript?<eos> - It's rough, of course, but...<eos> - I think it's really interesting.
Thank you.<eos> - That was amazing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> As my father used to say,<eos> "If that speech was a horse, it'd be a unicorn."
- Absolutely.<eos> I mean, you should be honored that I would think your story was special enough to even consider using it.<eos> Did you really like it?<eos> It's actually... it's like what my daddy used to say.<eos> He used to say, "If that story was like a horse, it'd be a unicorn.

Listen, I've been down this road before.<eos> With a stroller?<eos> I'm just asking because that's how I push him around.<eos> This wedding isn't making it to the banquet hall.<eos> I don't even think it's making it to the car.
I'm-I'm always ending up there too.<eos> We want to formally invite you to a raging party.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You should invite them.<eos> It might be a raging party.
Got it.<eos> You know, I had this whole speech planned.<eos> It was funny and heartfelt, profound.<eos> But it feels like a waste if you're just gonna forget it anyway.<eos> Let's just agree it was brilliant.
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.
Sunny wants us to snatch the azra book from the widow.<eos> - Bajie... - Now, this is gonna be no easy task, my friend, but if we ever see azra... Bajie, I, I know where the book is.<eos> No shit.<eos> You should've just chipped in earlier.<eos> It's in the conservatory.
I won't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> Your blood is the one thing that can save us.<eos> My blood is a curse.<eos> It will, however, keep you from following me into the rain.
I have to put you under.<eos> What if you don't?<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> His liver just needs time.<eos> I mean, we're keeping him here as a precaution, but, uh, it should heal itself.
You've got to forgive yourself.<eos> Forgive yourself, Charlie.<eos> N-No. No!<eos> They should be alive!<eos> All your life, Charlie, you've been surrounded by death, and it's still coming for you.
The package of yours...<eos> it's squeaking or whistling.<eos> Who?<eos> The box.<eos> It's alive.
I hope so.<eos> Look at us pulling the truth out of each other, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you. Your aura...<eos> I think it is... sparkly, rainbows, pastels...
I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.<eos> I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days.<eos> You been working on this leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm left it off of Jane's body because it is a dud.<eos> Or maybe they realized it left them exposed.
- Place is nice, man.<eos> I saw the knife that killed Jones.<eos> The knife isn't yours, it's Freddy's.<eos> Patterson solved the leopard tattoo.<eos> It leads to Kat Jarrett.
So, all this for a dead end?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> We just need to show this photo to Roman.<eos> I'm not sure that's a good idea.<eos> No, the tattoo didn't point to Farrell, it points to Kat.
But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.<eos> Like becoming a dark web kingpin.<eos> Let he who is without sin...<eos> Please focus, Rich.<eos> This version of the formula... what's it for?
Him?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.
I want to know deliverance!<eos> Syphilis.<eos> The great pox.<eos> For a time I covered the guilty rash. And became quite artful with stage makeup, But now...<eos> Now it has his mind.
Get a house like this.<eos> Live the american dream.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't really cut out for suburban bliss.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No matter how you might have felt about your old life... It was better than this.
How's the mental state?<eos> She's good. Calm.<eos> I meant the husband.<eos> What the hell could this thing possibly be for?<eos> It's for rectal examinations.
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.<eos> Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play.<eos> It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good-- it is.
When?<eos> You know, 'cause they just, they... they make this too hard, man.<eos> It's just too damn hard.<eos> Next week, we're going back to that bar, and one way or another, we're getting our money back.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna take the life that I was supposed to have, instead of waiting for it to come and find me.
The artist initially agreed to let us run her photographs, but reneged at the last minute.<eos> Why did she decide to pull out?<eos> Okay, I just... I think this story is worth fighting for.<eos> It's click gold for us.<eos> It hits all of our boxes, no pun intended.
It's not what we discussed.<eos> I know. I, uh...<eos> I took a swing.<eos> You certainly did.<eos> It's excellent.
No, I'm not that hungry.<eos> And for you guys?<eos> Um, is there any specialties of the kitchen?<eos> The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our most popular dish.<eos> It's fantastic.
L-A-K-E...'<eos> Mr Huntley, are you refusing to 'cooperate with a lawful police investigation? '<eos> 'This is DS Arnott, please leave a message.'<eos> Sarge, we got a reg on the car.<eos> It belongs to a Nicholas Huntley - - Roz's husband.
Cottan's dying declaration, I want the full recording handed over to me.<eos> - Morning, Jan.<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Sir, my department operates under the protection of no reciprocity, as well you know.<eos> That part of the recording was released because it pertained to court proceedings.
Failing to break it.<eos> Roz Huntley's proved you're an ineffectual organisation.<eos> - A corrupt organisation.<eos> - Sir, I must protest!<eos> Do you know, Ted, my guess is that we don't know the half of Matthew Cottan's activities and the real reason you're keeping that full recording secret is because of the ammunition it'll give AC-12's critics.
The younger self. Is in dark contemplation about his future, About who he'll become.<eos> If you're interested, There are further examples of the same period. In the next room.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where can I find the abyssinian-ceramics collection?<eos> "I'm afraid it's out on loan."
I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.
There's still stuff to do before we shoot.<eos> - Are we shooting it here?<eos> - In this gray, depressing shithole?<eos> No. I'm going with Bash to look at a venue.<eos> It's expensive, but I'm not the one signing the checks, so...
- Yes.<eos> - Are you able to eat what you want to eat?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> They sometimes bring us airline food and they sometimes bring us, uh, Lebanese food,<eos> - and it's different, but it's delicious.
- I did not invite you.<eos> - I wanted to support women's sports.<eos> They gave me a new parking spot at work.<eos> My car's filthy.<eos> It's under a fig tree.
Oh, this is gonna be so awesome.<eos> Who would throw something like this away?<eos> Well, the net's a little ratty.<eos> What, are you kidding?<eos> It's in great shape.
I am still who I am!<eos> For now.<eos> All that power you had, Margaret.<eos> All that hard fought for power.<eos> Can you feel it all slipping through your fingers?
Is this... Am I dreaming?<eos> I, uh... I-I saw an ice cube, like a huge... Can you take me there?<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe what?<eos> Well, I was thinking about that door, and how it's there sometimes and not other times.
Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.
She didn't say she found her life unbearable, with a U.<eos> She said she found her life inbearable, with an I.<eos> That's not a word.<eos> Our situation isn't inbearable.<eos> It's unbearable.
What would you do?<eos> Send James back to kill him?<eos> He has an awful habit of creating the very problems he sets out to solve.<eos> Why did you abandon the Witness?<eos> He gave me a purpose, but it was a lie.
_<eos> Here.<eos> Finally putting in that pool?<eos> Do we need this wall?<eos> It's load bearing, so yes.
Anyone we know?<eos> And more to the point... any that look like me?<eos> That's the problem with being Primary.<eos> You're connected to time, but it won't let you see the whole puzzle.<eos> It just keeps moving and changing.
He said every german. Needs to see the city of lights at least once,<eos> So he arranged me an invitation.<eos> We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.<eos> I don't like vodka...<eos> It burns my throat.
It's just how I've come to think about it, if anyone can just come and go.<eos> Isn't that a little sad?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> It's like the soul, you know?<eos> No one knows for sure. Does it exist?
I've been looking everywhere.<eos> You shouldn't be here, Monty.<eos> None of us should be here.<eos> You know why that moon's red?<eos> It's really red?
Doesn't get more legitimate than that.<eos> Mossad carried out a black op on American soil.<eos> If the FBI finds out about it, it will be an international incident.<eos> - Where's the system?<eos> - It's here.
Mr. Maddox was just convenient.<eos> The NMB's money bought them someone much higher up the food chain.<eos> I promised them a teleguidance system capable of getting past the Iron Dome.<eos> After six months of work, I do not intend to start over.<eos> So... where is it?
What about Mossad? You guys know Arkani's building a bomb, but you don't know whether he's got a safe house nearby?<eos> No.<eos> And it's not a bomb.<eos> It's a missile guidance system designed to defeat the Iron Dome.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could jeopardize the lives of thousands.
No.<eos> And it's not a bomb.<eos> It's a missile guidance system designed to defeat the Iron Dome.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could jeopardize the lives of thousands.<eos> Then I'll feel better when it's in my hands.
I'm sure it'll get ironed out.<eos> I'll admit it, I'm surprised.<eos> Not much shocks me, but this is a right old turn-up for the books.<eos> We've retrieved a bullet from the body.<eos> It matches the calibre of revolver that you had in your possession - a revolver that was recently fired.
Thank you, sir.<eos> And, er, once again... ..congratulations.<eos> Are you sure you want me to pursue this?<eos> Perhaps it's better left to someone else.<eos> I want to follow the truth, no matter where it leads.
But there's nothing here that suggests Florence Lesser was murdered.<eos> What?<eos> The miniature newspaper.<eos> Whatever's in there is the key.<eos> And I think I know where it is.
And I think I know where it is.<eos> My umbrella!<eos> What do you hope to find?<eos> The miniature newspaper, sir.<eos> Where is it?
Victim of a broken heart.<eos> But then that idiot husband of mine started to play the protective house owner.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you all right back there?<eos> When a butterfly needs to break out of its chrysalis, it needs to find the weakest point.
I'm stuck, and I'm having trouble moving forward.<eos> What do you think is holding you back? What do you think is holding you back?<eos> I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.
What do you think is holding you back? What do you think is holding you back?<eos> I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.<eos> It weakens us.
No.<eos> Better yet... no more suspensions.<eos> I am doing my best here, but you are not helping.<eos> Well, I can't just allow insubordination.<eos> No. You can't make my job even more difficult than it already is.
No, no. I'm...<eos> I'm holding it, I'm holding it.<eos> Put it back on ice.<eos> The mom's remaining kidney thrombosed.<eos> It's dead.
And they shouldn't.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> You busy?<eos> Yes, I was just about to paint a wall and watch it dry.
A flash drive.<eos> Did it look like this?<eos> It did.<eos> And when we inserted this flash drive into our computers, what happened?<eos> It introduced the malware into our system.
How did I not see this in the bank statements?<eos> Why would I put money that I might need to run away with in the middle of night in the bank?<eos> I put it in my disappear bag.<eos> It's hard not to take that personally, but, um, where is this bag?<eos> It's in... in...
They would like to have it destroyed.<eos> Let-let me, uh, see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like.<eos> Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, rather than see it driven by its rightful owner, they want to bring it to the dump and flatten it.<eos> Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.<eos> It's half his.
- Yeah.<eos> Well... free to stand trial for murdering Margaret.<eos> Oh. We also need to find that trekking pole.<eos> If we don't, the prosecutor is going to claim that you got rid of it after you used it to kill Margaret.<eos> Any idea where it could be?
- Let's start there.<eos> - Here's what we know.<eos> Rutger ate Josh's whitefish.<eos> Wait. That squiggle is the fish?<eos> Put waves up above so we know it's underwater.
Come on.<eos> I'm listening, I promise.<eos> No more earbuds.<eos> Okay, Trixie might get into this private school, and it could be really, really good for her.<eos> But it's super exclusive, and I'm not sure that I want her in that kind of environment.
- Right.<eos> It's misshapen. That's all that matters.<eos> All right, here's the plan...<eos> We stage a fight.<eos> It escalates, and I flip over the table in dramatic fashion.
I'd like an MRI next.<eos> Do you have any idea how expensive that scan is?<eos> I have Obamacare, I have a year left, and I'm us...<eos> Look, an MRI wouldn't hurt.<eos> It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.
If it's in her esophagus, the chances are it's also invaded her spine.<eos> You'd risk paralysis if you tried to take it out.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can at least remove the tumor from the heart itself... relieve some of the symptoms.<eos> I mean, it'll grow back, but it'll be slow-growing... buy her some time.
Daddy!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Nathalie showed me a snake!<eos> - It was a larva.<eos> - She said that it's gonna turn into a beautiful moth someday.
Look, no matter what happens, you don't let me out of these things, okay, no matter how bad it gets.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you, Link.<eos> I want to thank you for your sacrifice.<eos> I want you to know it will not be in vain.
She just laughed, and she said, "We'll see about that."<eos> That night, she took the boy in the cell across from mine.<eos> She dragged him to her tower, where she whipped him.<eos> I could hear his cries echo through the halls, begging for someone to stop her.<eos> I reached out to the door of my cell, and it was open.
People suck.<eos> What I'm saying is, Koreatown has both a rich complex history and unique political challenges.<eos> That's what you've been saying, and saying.<eos> And, look, I could listen to you talk about redistricting all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us, it's not gonna track down itself, so if we could just...<eos> Point is, I requested some help for you guys, and it just came through.
Don't you get it, man?<eos> Your impulse was a reality scar working on your subconscious.<eos> Reality scar.<eos> So, what does this fun gun do?<eos> Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.
So, what does this fun gun do?<eos> Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.<eos> "Control-Z"?<eos> Like an undo command on a computer.<eos> Well, I was gonna try the new version on my latest test subject, but then I was worried it might melt his brain.
A Sumerian alabaster statue.<eos> 5000 years old.<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> I leave it on your table.<eos> It is very beautiful.
With a Trojan to infect the system files.<eos> I'm clumsy, but I learn fast.<eos> And the negative view?<eos> Some day we will not have luck.<eos> It will crack and spoil everything.
I repeat the question.<eos> What doctor?<eos> In the endocrine.<eos> I have a brain tumor.<eos> It is not a malignant tumor, but...
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go get the clothes and go down to the laundry room.<eos> Follow-up question.<eos> It's in the basement.
- I don't know how this thing works.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's more of a...<eos> It's more of a sweeping motion.
What's that?<eos> That... is my theme tune.<eos> Otherwise known as a distress call.<eos> You like distress calls?<eos> You only really see the true face of the universe when it's asking for your help.
Dying well.<eos> No... - No! - What is it?<eos> Our life signs.<eos> He's wired them to the coolant system.<eos> If we die, it vents.
Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".
The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!
So stupid.<eos> It's this.<eos> I make that sound a lot 'cause no one will high-five me.<eos> Sure, but philosophy's so much more than that.<eos> It teaches you how to really think.
Last year, I went climbing in Canada...<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> But your card is not welcome.<eos> What?<eos> It is reject. Bad.
"carved in the trenches of Arras." £300!<eos> 300?<eos> Well, I have always said I thought that oil lamp rather... ugly.<eos> Clearly, you don't love her enough!<eos> Be careful with that, it's Roman.
Be careful with that, it's Roman.<eos> I was wondering if it mightn't date from around the same time they found all those coins at Chedworth?<eos> We're engravers, not an auction house.<eos> If you want it cleaned, it's one and six.<eos> It's in lovely condition.
We're like The Flintstones.<eos> There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3.<eos> It would save you a lot of time.<eos> M-Maybe I could pitch that to my boss, if I knew what I was talking about.<eos> I can show you how it works.
The public is ordered to stay off the roads and take cover.<eos> Hey, there's, uh... there's flooding.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - In the kitchen. Uh, there's water everywhere.<eos> It's spreading.
Death is a big turnoff for me.<eos> I like them young and alive.<eos> Don't forget this.<eos> You're sure the stuff is good?<eos> Well, I didn't test it, because that would defeat the purpose of recovery, but yeah, it's good;
No, I'm not gonna sign this!<eos> Jesus! You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.

You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> The rocket, it's not going to explode with us in it.
Not yet.<eos> Who knows what the AIC is gonna do with whatever you gave them.<eos> You think it's just information.<eos> It could be complete misdirection.<eos> Who knows what doors it's gonna unlock.
Caving a security guard's skull in for a baseball card is grotesque, if you ask me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> Please, Mr. Charles, if you keep swearing you're innocent, it's only gonna be worse for you when we find the stolen merchandise in your car, in your house or wherever.<eos> So why don't you just tell us where it is?
Come here, come here.<eos> There, you all right?<eos> You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.
You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.<eos> We were wrong.<eos> It was Ryan's.
I can't stop thinking about M.K.<eos> and Cosima out there all alone.<eos> Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.<eos> Hey, your life isn't ruined.<eos> It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
You've been wonderful.<eos> I'm just happy to have this choice.<eos> Edward was a scientist.<eos> He always used to tell me, Energy is not created or destroyed.<eos> It just is.
There is beauty in the inevitable.<eos> This car smells like cherries.<eos> Can we keep it?<eos> No, honey.<eos> It's a rental.
Hi, naomi.<eos> My mom just wanted to say thank you. For letting me stay over this weekend.<eos> No problem.<eos> Sweet ride.<eos> It's a rental.
I don't want to look at you.<eos> I don't... I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because I want to help you, because I love you.<eos> I'm so sick of people talking about love when they have no idea what it means.
Caspar's been known to change hotels if the carpet upsets him.<eos> Er, what are you working on?<eos> A redesign of a perfect flat in Limehouse.<eos> All my work gets undone.<eos> I mean, if you heal a dog, right, it stays healed.
The home-filtration system your department is now buying for everyone in the city.<eos> Strange you didn't disclose you own the patent.<eos> Your Ph.D. is in materials engineering.<eos> Before entering the public sector, you tried your hand at entrepreneurship.<eos> The water-filtration system that you developed, however, failed to find a niche. It was, it was too pricey for the average consumer, and it was not quite the high-end system which attracts larger institutions.
- That's...<eos> - Stupid, is it stupid?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Brilliant, Josh.<eos> I think you just invented democracy, and it's going to save Fillory.
Definitely.<eos> Um, Mitchell is on a diet, speaking of hunger.<eos> What can you eat now?<eos> less.<eos> Sweetie, I see what you're doing, but this whole controlling thing... it's challenging.
My minister murdered.<eos> His wife slain.<eos> The killer dead by her own hand.<eos> And still the contagion spreads.<eos> It is in my walls.
His wife slain.<eos> The killer dead by her own hand.<eos> And still the contagion spreads.<eos> It is in my walls.<eos> It is in my blood and in my mind.
Say it.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> Certainly.<eos> ♪ Ma tu davvero puoi... ♪ Song's really pretty.<eos> Mm-hmm. Can you tell me what it means?
Don't.<eos> What?<eos> The little shrinky smile thing that you do; Don't do it.<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.
What's dormant?<eos> The pyramid.<eos> We are keeping it under observation.<eos> Why?<eos> What's it been doing?
Just jump straight to all the explaining.<eos> It's the Doctor.<eos> 'OK found it, lab in Yorkshire.'<eos> Long story, short - misplaced decimal point, resulting in a bacteria that turns any living thing it touches into gunk.<eos> So why is it going to end the world?
We give him two minutes and we're heading in.<eos> Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.
Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.<eos> It's going to pump the bacteria into the atmosphere.
I hope to make it there sometime in the future, too.<eos> _<eos> That's right.<eos> A wonderful day... all planned.<eos> The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of... I think... very great.
We're leaving.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You lied.<eos> You hijacked our vacation.<eos> This family has a tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.
Dr. Smith, you may remember Dr. Chakrabarti, our pathologist.<eos> He's former CDC, we asked him to sit in and translate any science-speak.<eos> I don't think you'll need much translating.<eos> In a month's time, Seattle is looking at a death toll in the tens of thousands.<eos> The strain has mutated rapidly, and it's resistant to antivirals.
With over a billion intelligent species active in this galaxy alone, it is an ever-greater challenge to know how to kill all of them.<eos> On this planet, we are proud to serve as executioners to every living thing.<eos> The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.

Mr. McDuck...<eos> An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.<eos> Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?<eos> That bauble?<eos> That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
Guy needed a moment to say goodbye to his entire comic book collection.<eos> We just had a few more questions.<eos> Starting with, why is Dan's missing cover art here, for sale?<eos> This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, hero of the Ogden Twiddlyhut series, has ever appeared in print.<eos> And who says it's missing?
Assuming he's got a CD player.<eos> He's probably got a cassette player in his Golf GTI.<eos> Actually, May couldn't have been more wrong.<eos> This car may be from the past, but check this out.<eos> It's accelerating now, you can probably hear that, but I'm not doing it.
- You only get £4,500.<eos> - How will people cope?<eos> I think what we've done there is prove his car is not really worth buying just yet.<eos> - Don't argue. It isn't.<eos> It's not quite finished.
- It's not that now, is it?<eos> - It is unbelievable, that.<eos> Do you know, this shirt is older than everything you can see out of that window.<eos> James, that shirt is older than Carthage, mate. Look at it.<eos> It is getting on a bit.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - But do it first thing in the morning.<eos> It's getting on.<eos> We should call it a day.<eos> I'd also like to pop into the library before it closes, get a copy of The Flame Tree to read, but if anyone fancies a beer after I've done that...
Me?<eos> Yes, what did you make of it when you first read it?<eos> Well...<eos> You know...<eos> It's... richly evocative.
For someone so practised at forging signatures, it wouldn't be difficult to forge Esther's handwriting.<eos> I'm sure it would've been easy enough to lay your hands on a copy of Esther's signature.<eos> And then, all you had to do was slip the faked suicide note into her handbag -- after you'd killed her.<eos> But as clever as it was, that suicide note was also your undoing.<eos> That it was a typed note meant that it somehow lacked credibility.
None of us will be leaving without the clearance codes to this ship.<eos> I hadn't thought of that.<eos> And I'm afraid there's another complication.<eos> I've just learned that Thrawn is very close to locating your base.<eos> - You have to tell me where it is.
No way!<eos> You'll find out when we get there.<eos> Not if Thrawn destroys it first.<eos> I need to know its location so I can remove it from his database.<eos> If it's even on his list.
Look, Emily.<eos> I trust you.<eos> If you really think that I should do this commercial, I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> Because it's terrible.
All right, but seriously, she can't ride in my chopper.<eos> Jackie, can you come in here, please?<eos> You wanted something?<eos> No... but an overweight man in Ohio wants that shirt back.<eos> It's from Talbots.
And I understood, Claire, that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.<eos> Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House... it's about who owns the White House.<eos> This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.
Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House... it's about who owns the White House.<eos> This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.<eos> It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.
Actually, don't tell me.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> So, did you wind up sending that machine back?<eos> I did.<eos> You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.
I want to be surprised.<eos> So, did you wind up sending that machine back?<eos> I did.<eos> You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.<eos> I took it to the train store-- it said everyone was sad.
You know, this lot are a tenacious bunch, they're sure to find out.<eos> All right - - I haven't got anything to hide.<eos> Tom was a brilliant sailor, he really was, but one day, he went out when a storm was forecast.<eos> And he took his son. His eight-year-old son.<eos> And when the storm hit, it was much bigger than he expected.
Sir?<eos> So... the Inspector was right.<eos> After he killed Tom Lewis, Frank Henderson made his way down here and hid in that compartment.<eos> And stayed there all the time we were searching the boat.<eos> Until it was back in the harbour and safe to make his escape.
We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> This magic can reunite anyone who shares true love.<eos> It can open a door to Hook.
James Weckler had a safe deposit box.<eos> I convinced Tatum to let me come along when she opened it.<eos> Guess what was inside?<eos> The memory card Weckler stole from Roxanne's hidden camera.<eos> It was recording when he killed her.
In cold blood.<eos> Leaving your son to set the scene to make it look like a suicide.<eos> I imagine that's when Steve took Frank's cufflink.<eos> But your plan required one final flourish.<eos> After all, why would a passing cleaner say that a room was locked when it wasn't?
- Damn it.<eos> - No sign of the laptop.<eos> What were we doing here?<eos> - Look, there's Jake's shirt.<eos> - It looks burnt.
- Workout your legs, Jeffrey.<eos> - Not your mouth.<eos> You are hilarious.<eos> I am so psyched for your presentation to the board.<eos> - I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.
- Fast forward.<eos> - Did you guys see that?<eos> He put the bag down behind the plant.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Is it there?
He put the bag down behind the plant.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Is it there?<eos> Is it there?<eos> - It's here! - We did it!
Wait, are you saying he put the gun...<eos> You don't need an interrogation to prove that he's guilty.<eos> You, uh, just need a pair of these.<eos> God, we thank you for the life that you give us.<eos> It is full of work and of responsibility, of sorrow and of joy.
I wanted you to know that I'm getting married.<eos> Well, that's wonderful.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I would love for you to come to the wedding.<eos> When is it?
For the longest time, I've been perfectly comfortable knowing I could die at any moment. I could walk out of this room and be shot in the street.<eos> I've always been fine with that.<eos> But lately, I can smell it in the air around me.<eos> Like death is... slouching towards me from the corners of the room.<eos> And I cannot tell if it is here for me.
He had some trouble in the woods last night.<eos> Nothing life threatening.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> But that thing is attacking us.<eos> It's attacking us near our home now.
Lock the door behind me.<eos> - The roof...<eos> Red. Roof, red.<eos> - What?<eos> It was red.
I can't say that, Nathaniel.<eos> Because I don't want to go back to 1942.<eos> I know that I'm supposed to.<eos> I know I have a destiny and that we shouldn't damage time any more than we already have, but I have to believe that time is stronger than that.<eos> And that if I have a destiny, it'll wait for me.
When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Our friend Calvin was trying to jump up and pull down a fire escape ladder.<eos> He grabbed it, but it, like, shot down on him.
- Doc, we have.<eos> In blood.<eos> Black Badge owns us, and if they find Dolls, they'll shoot him on sight.<eos> Wynonna, I was supposed to make the drop two days ago.<eos> It ain't ready.
They can be, so much more.<eos> My magic?<eos> What about yours?<eos> Darling, don't you see?<eos> Your magic is useful because it's unstable.
So, what now?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Ready? Yes.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That thing... It was draining my magic.
Overload.<eos> It was initiated last September.<eos> We got over 1,000 hours of manpower on this case so far.<eos> So I understand, the ATF didn't deconflict this operation with CPD or any other agency?<eos> No-no-no, it's classified deep cover.
Uh, actually, Commander Crowley wants you to report to the 27th District.<eos> They need bodies for their third shifts.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> - Are you being serious right now?<eos> - It's what's open.
Really?<eos> How'd that go?<eos> - It went.<eos> Did you notice these tire marks?<eos> And this little scrape on the ground; It's almost like it came from something on the vehicle.
Let's just go over your expenses.<eos> How much is your rent?<eos> I don't want to say.<eos> Is it really that high?<eos> I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
That's exactly what they expect.<eos> I mean, you gotta fight it with kittens or mercury or the concept of time.<eos> Caleb's right.<eos> These people are unpredictable.<eos> Your strategy was helpful for a while, but if it isn't helpful anymore, then we should change tack.
Thank you, todd.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now, would anybody else like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, i'd like to.<eos> Every time hope comes into my life, it dies.
Hello?<eos> Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.
Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.<eos> You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla.<eos> Maybe I was onto something.<eos> Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.<eos> Unless it was singing "Be Our Guest," I doubt it.
Are we still talking about the spoon?<eos> It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.<eos> Well, don't get me wrong.<eos> Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff.<eos> But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.
I don't know, check your body for tattoos?<eos> Leonard, would you be a lamb... She's kidding!<eos> Wait, wait. Where's my bag?<eos> My phone and my wallet are in my bag.<eos> It's right here.
Great.<eos> Um, did you miss anything this weekend?<eos> What?<eos> The conference.<eos> It seemed like it was important to you.
Voicemail?<eos> Lucado, pick up the phone!<eos> Maybe try Jeremy again?<eos> How long before this thing eats its way out of the can?<eos> Pretty sure if I get off, it's gonna eat its way through me!
Bag that thing and, well, Jeremy knows what to do. Okay?<eos> She... she didn't have any questions.<eos> Yes, I have one.<eos> Did smashing all those demon eggs make you wet?<eos> Well, I like my job, but it hasn't bought me dinner in a really long time.
- Fight it.<eos> - It... it... it won't... won't let me.<eos> - Waverly...<eos> - Wynonna!<eos> Remember when you made me drink grape soda 'til it came out of my nose?
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?<eos> Oh, don't worry about it. I'm fine.<eos> Monty:<eos> I got that thing as a gift, and I'm trying to find some use for it.<eos> Let me tell you, it's not even useful as a doorstop.
Yeah.<eos> You know all your stuff's getting damp?<eos> The people who had the house before me said they damp-proofed it in the '90s.<eos> That's the problem with water, especially under the ground, you know, in a house like this.<eos> - It finds a way of getting back in.
The point is, Helen knew that the Deutschemark meant I was with her.<eos> She wasn't alone.<eos> It's a coin, Owen.<eos> That no one, not Maxwell Fletcher or Alice Winter, would notice.<eos> And it will remind you you're not alone until the day you won't need it anymore.
Sandstorm, they might be controlling the building, but they don't know it as well as I do.<eos> There's a sub-basement beneath the bottom floor.<eos> In a maintenance elevator.<eos> Back in the '80s, the city started construction to extend the N line.<eos> It went underneath what's now the NYO.
- No.<eos> It was part of it.<eos> Shepherd is putting each and every one of us in this room to become the successors to a government she believes is corrupt, a government that she's about to destroy.<eos> The attack on this country isn't over.<eos> It's just beginning.
It's a matter of national security, sir.<eos> It is our sworn duty to remain in this bunker until otherwise notified.<eos> We alone become the successors to the United States government.<eos> The attack on this country isn't over.<eos> It's just beginning.
- They're all just taking a break.<eos> Why is nobody breaking in the new break room?<eos> - 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.
Whoa, look at that map work.<eos> Sick as heck.<eos> - Oh an attempt at flattery.<eos> - Well, it won't work.<eos> This was Boyle's map, and it was adequate at best.
- Oh. You still changed a tire.<eos> Counting this as a win.<eos> - Okay, you're right about the break room.<eos> - Nuh doy.<eos> - Nobody liked it, and it wasn't functional.
- So based on these phone records, we think Ocampo is definitely still in Brooklyn.<eos> Is it true you still have a bullet lodged in your hip from your shootout with the Canarsie Killer?<eos> - No.<eos> - Darn.<eos> - It's in my jaw.
- And it was a real jerk move!<eos> - Santiago!<eos> You did it!<eos> - And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.<eos> It's too loud!
Where'd you find a steering wheel?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> I had a Frisbee in the trunk, and I taped it on.<eos> That's right.<eos> I MacGyvered the donk out of this thing, and it worked flawlessly.
Do not be ashamed, okay?<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> What you are doing is proactive. - Checking to see if you can reproduce even when you have no intention of doing so anytime in the near future, that shows maturity.<eos> Yeah, listen, honey, I gotta tell you,<eos> I really appreciate the support. It means a lot to me.
Were you raised in a prison?<eos> Van, did you know I'm the only Senior Vice President in this building who doesn't have a real office?<eos> Emily, you thrive in the cubicles.<eos> You're like a tropical fish that lives in the coral reef, but if you took that fish out, and gave it its own office...<eos> - it would die.
This does not concern you.<eos> There is no hope.<eos> No!<eos> Hope lives.<eos> It is everywhere.
'Cause she knows I have a writing staff and a focus group.<eos> There should be credits at the end of this fucking e-mail.<eos> Approved by mother and sister.<eos> I don't know. Love is worth it, though. It really is.<eos> It's worth it. It is.
I'd like to have a big, tall boyfriend.<eos> That's my boyfriend.<eos> I'm mad at my boyfriend. [audience laughing]<eos> I get to wear his jacket.<eos> It's all big on me.
Had a little bit of an accident, truth be told.<eos> I was a bit sick... if truth be told, but I'm fine.<eos> She threw up over it, she couldn't wear it.<eos> Was better out than in, love.<eos> - It went right down...
Any word from Black Badge lately?<eos> Eventually you and your boys are going to have to get in the game, because neutral men are the devil's allies.<eos> And brother .the devil's coming.<eos> Highway 62, there's an abandoned chapel.<eos> It's right near Juan Carlo's chop shop.
There's no time.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sooner than expected, damn her.<eos> She's looking for the third seal.<eos> I don't have it, nor do I know where it is.
When they raise their dead demon husband, she would be there to help us put him back where he belongs.<eos> After everything Wynonna's done to get that seal... how could I?<eos> You can say I made you.<eos> I ordered you.<eos> I don't even know where it is.
God damn it, Oliver, I told you-- - Mike, relax.<eos> It's over.<eos> The bluff worked.<eos> What do you mean, it worked?<eos> I got a number, and it's good.
World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.
The more roses you get on cupid day, the more popular you are, right?<eos> Thanks for the tip, Kent.<eos> Noted.<eos> I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?
Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> No, I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.
Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> It stands out in front of all the others.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I-i never said that it was from me.
It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> It stands out in front of all the others.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I-i never said that it was from me.<eos> But whoever it was from, they put a lot of thought into it, so...
Look at us, Wilson!<eos> We're something out of a horror movie!<eos> We're all pasty and bald and bitter and... lonely and... they're all fancy and...<eos> I would rather have our daughter than that creepy little kid any day of the week.<eos> It's not really our daughter!
Oh, no.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Can you see my soul?<eos> Is it still there?
I saw this boy across the room.<eos> And I loved...<eos> I just... loved him the first moment I saw him.<eos> And we had a life.<eos> And it was beautiful, and it was difficult.
I mean...<eos> - Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Hey.<eos> That thing's safe, right?<eos> Is it safe?
- Ready, Hefty?<eos> - Roger that.<eos> It works!<eos> This thing really gets me.<eos> It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.
You're just in time to witness scientific history.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> None of your business, Nosey.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.
Long have you searched for these creatures of blue.<eos> But this hat comes from somewhere new.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> Where does it come from?
Now!<eos> Stop that, Azrael.<eos> I can't calibrate my machine with all your incessant yammering.<eos> Yes, Azrael, listen to it.<eos> It purrs like a kitten.
Williamsburg Savings Bank<eos> good morning sir, Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me give you a call, We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee. Once someone is available.<eos> What will this device do?<eos> It will shine and shake.
"Or Josh Kush".<eos> How are these things legal?<eos> Dear Sir, The embargo period is over.<eos> Marijuana has extraordinary medical benefits.<eos> It is useful in all situations.
Okay.<eos> Keep your breathing slow.<eos> Just focus on the flashlight.<eos> Lisa, I can see the shark!<eos> It's coming towards you!
We just had rain last night.<eos> We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.<eos> Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- A long time ago.<eos> And the Holy Land?<eos> Jerusalem?<eos> He says that water is no good.<eos> It runs through there.
Where is he?<eos> I need to see him, now!<eos> Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> It was our insurance.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?
No, really.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you, are you actually serious?<eos> I've played along with this joke.<eos> It's not funny any more.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> Parting gift.<eos> Aww, that's nice.<eos> A walking stick.<eos> Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.
That is my boss.<eos> Big Boss Baby.<eos> What is she screaming about?<eos> Well, see this pie chart?<eos> Wow, it looks like a giant pie.
Isn't it?<eos> It was, until you brought me the key ingredient.<eos> My secret formula.<eos> It's mine! It's mine!<eos> It's all mine.
Who's ticklish?<eos> Here you go.<eos> So, that's my story.<eos> Our story.<eos> Luckily for me and my little brother, it had a happy ending.
And while black people may not feel like it, it's kind of tough out there right now for everybody.<eos> I mean, really, our lives aren't all that different.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Did we get struck by lightning?<eos> Uh, I think it came through the electric blankets.
Stolen.<eos> All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car?<eos> Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?<eos> Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please?<eos> Ah, it's a terrible car, always in the shop...
One of which is a liver.<eos> Which is a perfect match for Terence.<eos> Exactly.<eos> His liver will never go to the national list.<eos> It will go directly to your nephew.
The other Iron Fists I've known were fierce, unrelenting in their mission to protect K'un-Lun from the Hand.<eos> They would never have backed down from a grand duel just to save the life of one girl.<eos> How did you know my father?<eos> I've been alive long enough to watch the world change in many ways.<eos> But this change now, it feels significant.
What if she won't talk?<eos> She'll talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you stopped to consider that this idea totally sucks?<eos> It doesn't suck, okay?
I think Gandhi might disagree with you.<eos> Okay, I'm not special... but I've seen enough people die to understand the value of a life.<eos> What about all the lives that Gao destroys?<eos> Hey...<eos> Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.
Healing through chi.<eos> Reiki is thought of as a pseudoscience, but there are stories of it healing tumors and curing disease.<eos> So, maybe it's more real than I thought.<eos> You know, chi is the breath of life.<eos> It's what powers the Iron Fist.
Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm through with you, Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.<eos> You're going to prison.<eos> Only this time, it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.
- What?<eos> This...<eos> Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.<eos> You have got to get rid of that shit.<eos> It was Dean's.
In the boardroom...<eos> Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.<eos> This time, for good.<eos> This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.
Potential... yeah?<eos> Promise.<eos> The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh?<eos> - And that hope belongs to me.<eos> It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!
It's trash that somebody left behind.<eos> Hey, but if it's mystery you want, you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?<eos> What the hell is that thing, you know?<eos> Why won't it dry up?<eos> Why won't it harden?
- All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing, - I wanted to give you a valentine. - Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?<eos> - You did? - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Well... - Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,
I..<eos> I mean it's complicated but I have never been happier.<eos> - Hey Mia, whassup?<eos> - Did you hear about Jose's show?<eos> It was incredible.
How much did she comprehend?<eos> So, Mary...<eos> I see you're looking at our little problem.<eos> Little?<eos> It's big.
But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.<eos> When you first arrived I was going to crush you.<eos> But I knew that if only you could see what the other gods could not then you would join me, and with our powers combined we could finally end all the pain, all the suffering destruction they bring.<eos> And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.<eos> We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.<eos> You see, that's the funny thing about fate.<eos> It's cunning.<eos> It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
That's a million-dollar show car.<eos> The point is to not draw attention.<eos> It's reverse psychology.<eos> Dom would never see it coming.<eos> It's neon orange.
Boom, baby!<eos> Goin' for a ride.<eos> Back in a sec.<eos> Where's that smile?<eos> Ah. There it is.
Now... the moment of truth.<eos> As you see, the flame has formed a reflective surface on the glass, what is known as an arsenic mirror.<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> From the density of the mirror,<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period, and, yes, it would have affected his mind in the later stages.
Oi! Get it loaded!<eos> How is your religion these days, Coop?<eos> My what?<eos> Your religion, your faith.<eos> After many years in your service, it is in rags and tatters, Your Highness.
Depends, depends upon the intention,<eos> The intention behind the fire.<eos> The major also gave us a date,<eos> Day after tomorrow.<eos> If you read these stars, You find that same date, And it refers you to here.
This is a real occasion.<eos> So you really can't take that thing off, huh?<eos> Nah, I can't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's, uh, part of me.
Spencer gave me this the day Yvonne and I were supposed to leave town.<eos> And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss which I felt it was an odd thing for Spencer to do.<eos> Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra?<eos> I didn't look at the book until today.<eos> It's not hers.
And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss which I felt it was an odd thing for Spencer to do.<eos> Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra?<eos> I didn't look at the book until today.<eos> It's not hers.<eos> It's not Spencer's.
It's a lost cause.<eos> This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.<eos> It's strategically meaningless.<eos> I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.<eos> The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
The lightning strikes the rod, which sends the bolt down into the tunnel.<eos> We grab the Ghost Rider push him into the bunker, and we trap him there.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you keep him from riding the lightning back out of the tunnels before you get him into the trap?<eos> Well, if the lightning strikes again, it'll just hit our rod.
Three of them.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> The Ghost Rider's whip didn't go deep enough to take him, but left a gash on his back.<eos> He was thrown into the tank and the wound infected the water.<eos> It mixed with the fluid from the vat and actually made him stronger.
Well, you should have sent someone else.<eos> So many soldiers here...<eos> we tend to lose a few, especially when they're afraid.<eos> There's rumors of magic.<eos> If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
Do you?<eos> I'm glad you banned it.<eos> I'm glad not to use it.<eos> Magic was a drug even worse than the poppy.<eos> Lot of good it did us against The Beast Forever.
The wagon will pass without being stopped.<eos> And no one will follow them.<eos> Clever plan.<eos> It was Dorothy's.<eos> When she gets to Glinda's, she'll stop this war before it even starts.
This vortex chamber can send you home.<eos> One thing they asked you first to stop Glinda.<eos> She gave me the only weapon that could have killed the witch.<eos> - Not the only one.<eos> - When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it even starts.
Nothing.<eos> I died and came back to life.<eos> Surely I can cast a stupid spell.<eos> You don't summon magic.<eos> It comes for you.
But if we could dramatically increase those numbers...<eos> Increase them how?<eos> The Underhill plantation.<eos> It's the largest and richest of the interior estates, and it's home to well over 200 slaves.<eos> It's well-defended.
When the queen was done with you... you were gone.<eos> Worse ways to go...<eos> Clothes and hair change with the times, but this queen, ha ha, she kept the party going.<eos> But the kings, they kept coming after her.<eos> Our queen's power... which is the power of all women, the power of rebirth, and creation... it makes some men kneel in awe and give gifts.
Starve them into submission?<eos> They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.
I'm fine, really.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I told you, bike, branch, skin.<eos> That's all?<eos> Mom, I tell you everything about my life because it is so fascinating, I promise.
Duran?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.
She looks it.<eos> Tell him call her today or don't bother coming home.<eos> It's chaos theory.<eos> But, see, chaos theory isn't exactly about chaos.<eos> It's about how a tiny change in a big system can affect everything.
- Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What am I supposed to be seeing?<eos> Just a shadow over the moon.<eos> Look, it's growing slowly.
- Yeah.<eos> I think I'm just gonna... pass the project on to the next student.<eos> Sounds very collaborative.<eos> A colleague of mine is studying collaborative learning theory.<eos> It actually strengthens your synapses.
Be careful!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Well...<eos> I love this car.<eos> It has that new car smell.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.
And if you are... and if you want to talk to someone about them, someone who doesn't share your DNA...<eos> I'll... I'll let you know.<eos> Look, I hated high school.<eos> I couldn't wait to get out.<eos> It was hell for me.
Every culture since earliest antiquity has survived this way, defining itself by the things it excludes.<eos> So long as there is progress, there will always be human debris in its wake, on the outside looking in.<eos> And sooner or later, one must answer the question... what becomes of them?<eos> In London, the solution is to call them criminals.<eos> To throw them in a deep, dark hole and hope it never runs over.
And sooner or later, one must answer the question... what becomes of them?<eos> In London, the solution is to call them criminals.<eos> To throw them in a deep, dark hole and hope it never runs over.<eos> I would argue that justice demands we do better than that.<eos> That a civilization is judged not by who it excludes, but by how it treats the excluded.
Well, Dr. Wong... By the way, racist name...<eos> Obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.<eos> Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction.<eos> I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic.<eos> I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability.

MUM!<eos> Where's the head?<eos> - What?<eos> - My head.<eos> Where is it?
- What?<eos> - My head.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.
Where is it?<eos> It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.<eos> - I'll ask the questions.<eos> - First you tell me where it is.
It's not really your head, is it?<eos> I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else.<eos> - I'll ask the questions.<eos> - First you tell me where it is.<eos> It's here. In a fridge.
And they know that.<eos> That's why they're so terrified of you and I.<eos> If we were able to take Nassau, if we are able to expose the illusion that England is not inevitable, if we are able to incite a revolt that spreads across the New World... then, yeah...<eos> I imagine people are gonna notice.<eos> "Too much sanity may be madness, "and the maddest of all, "to see life as it is and not as it should be."
Can we just take a moment here?<eos> You don't even know what it is you're asking for.<eos> Am I in it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it about my life?
It's perfectly natural.<eos> You see it all the time in the wild.<eos> The smaller animal going limp in the jaws of the larger.<eos> Genetic instinct.<eos> At some level, food knows it's food.
You cover the Israelis like paint.<eos> Technical glitch.<eos> So?<eos> There's a-a Russian traveling carnival that features a squirrel that's running on a wire wheel.<eos> The squirrel thinks it's turning the wheel, but if it stops running, its feet get caught in the wires and the squirrel breaks its paws.
You have to sing?<eos> For the last two years, I've been working my way down the songline.<eos> I don't have to tell you every community has a different part, so I've had to learn it piece by piece... Every sacred site, every ceremony, every word.<eos> You want my song?<eos> It's the last one.
Honey, I don't know where he is.<eos> And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.
That doesn't matter.<eos> You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?<eos> Who else? Matt?<eos> 'Cause if you're having visions, he's gonna wanna put it in your fucking book.<eos> It's not my fucking book!
I think you like it.<eos> I think you wanna be Jesus Christ fucking Superstar because it makes you feel important.<eos> Like it?<eos> I fucking love it!<eos> It's riveting!
Let's be honest, you have a better story.<eos> My story is true.<eos> - Come on, Matt.<eos> - It's all true.<eos> It's... It's based on fact.
I'm happy to keep helping here.<eos> You already helped by finding me the address.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're not gonna let me see this suicide machine for myself?<eos> - It's not a suicide machine.
You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
You may experience nausea or discomfort as you pass by the undulating laser array while it cycles up.<eos> Do not touch the array.<eos> Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left.<eos> Hard to the left.<eos> It'll stick.
When you're ready, we will start the ignition sequence.<eos> You will hear three tones.<eos> After the third tone, the chamber will fill up with fluid.<eos> The fluid will have the same consistency as water, but it is not water.<eos> It contains metals that will be irradiated.
- She is.<eos> And she sent a note.<eos> She sent it?<eos> She's taken charge of them all already?<eos> It's an offer of an exchange.
A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.<eos> It's mostly law books, but there are sections on everything from Italian cuisine to the world's most threatening fungus.<eos> I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...
Is this war more important than her life?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> I wanna hear you say it.<eos> Is this war more important than her life?<eos> Right now with what's at stake... yes, it is more important.
But I'm through wagering with her life now.<eos> If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us.<eos> We had it.<eos> We had it in our hands.<eos> This war was breathing air, it was alive.
So it's likely you've just sent one of those two groups to their death.<eos> As long as they expose his position.<eos> I wonder if he knows... just how much you learned from him.<eos> Your opponent's wrist is from whence the attack is born.<eos> It is its past tense from which it cannot separate itself.
And this, arguably one of his greatest paintings.<eos> An iconic work of individuals setting aside their differences for a common good.<eos> Yet, in its day, this painting was ridiculed, called "a mess," "the work of an amateur."<eos> There were stories about the gents who hired Rembrandt refusing to pay because they were unhappy with their likenesses.<eos> The painting was so unappreciated that when they moved from one hall to another, they decided it was too big, so they just slashed chunks off the bottom and the side.
- Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - We saw your speech.<eos> - It was beautiful.
Just one.<eos> I mean, it didn't come anywhere near us.<eos> I don't think he intended to, but still.<eos> Anyway, he takes one look at Lonnie and practically shits himself.<eos> I mean, he tosses away the gun like it was on fire.
A girl can't just be friends with a chap.<eos> It's has to be sex.<eos> Or love.<eos> In my experience, as many kill for love as desire.<eos> It stirs up the mud, requited or not.
Ah!<eos> I see you've met my muse.<eos> Haunting, isn't she?<eos> Disturbing, certainly.<eos> Who is it?
I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.<eos> I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".<eos> Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard.<eos> FBI.<eos> Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.
New station trajectory, negative.32.<eos> The capsule will miss us. Just.<eos> - Rory?<eos> - I'm still downrange.<eos> And it's coming in shallow.
I thought your parents went up to see you.<eos> They did, but, uh... oh, it's a long story.<eos> I read your book.<eos> We all have.<eos> It caused quite a stir around here.
Hey, Hodgins, slow down, man.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope. I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> She wasn't at the wards, and when I went to her room before breakfast, it was empty.
Well, did Ezra say he wanted to postpone the wedding?<eos> We didn't talk about it.<eos> So then proceed with plan A.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Aria, you're gonna plan this wedding and it's going to be waiting for him while he says goodbye to Nicole.
- Of course.<eos> - I support you.<eos> - Whatever you decide.<eos> - This isn't your problem.<eos> Aria, you're gonna plan this wedding, and it's going to be waiting for him while he says goodbye to Nicole.
He's probably more torn up inside than you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No sweat.<eos> Try the pizza.<eos> It's good.
- How long has that been here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Is there any chance this thing's broken?<eos> It's not broken.<eos> It's deciding.
Literally.<eos> Wait, do you hear that?<eos> It's like a hum and then a bunch of clicks.<eos> Yeah, trust me that thing makes all kinds of noise.<eos> I know, I just, I can't even tell if it's mechanical or electrical.
One that was done much later.<eos> It turned the idea of vengeance into a game.<eos> A game?<eos> But I came back tonight because I didn't want whoever sent that note to have it.<eos> Where is it?
No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?
Were you drunk?<eos> - No. Butterflies are classic.<eos> - They're retarded.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I didn't have your artistic eye to advise me, so I got a retarded butterfly.<eos> I mean, it's pretty.
- Go! ... or I'll punch you in the dick.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Okay, there's a real simple way out of this.<eos> - Not now. - The farm's worth a lot of money.<eos> They just found out it's sitting on top of a massive uranium deposit.
I know, Howard, and I regret misleading you.<eos> It's just that a certain... Vérité had to be established.<eos> I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me.<eos> Chuck, this tape --<eos> I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes.
I won't tell anyone.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - But I do not approve.<eos> You broke up with Meggy like five minutes ago, and now you're already buying jewelry for some other girl?<eos> It's not just some other girl.
Thank you.<eos> It is safe here.<eos> I use when I come.<eos> Lincoln: You got any food for him?<eos> Come, it's in the boat.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
Let's just take some time and try to figure out what we're actually dealing with here.<eos> It's not doing anything dangerous.<eos> And we're not going to give it a chance to.<eos> That thing is a living weapon, it's a killing machine.<eos> - It's not a machine
It's not doing anything dangerous.<eos> And we're not going to give it a chance to.<eos> That thing is a living weapon, it's a killing machine.<eos> - It's not a machine<eos> - It's not human.
Meneither. Naomi?<eos> We just lost sight of it behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, aft.<eos> There's no good camera on that position.<eos> Keep moving to your left.<eos> It has to be down there.

It's not some dumb animal.<eos> The device it tore out of its chest was a Fail Safe Regulator, some kind of command and control module.<eos> Control module, my ass.<eos> That was an incendiary device, you understand?<eos> A bomb probably designed to destroy that thing in case it got out of control, all right?
I bet you I can bounce that thing out one of the holes.<eos> Out of the question.<eos> A maneuver like that would snap him in two.<eos> That thing is strong as hell.<eos> I doubt it's gonna just trip out and fall into space.
Your suit can only filter out so much of that, then your heart stops.<eos> You know a lot about how people die.<eos> Yeah, I guess I do.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Whatever that thing is now, it used to be human.
Stand by for zero-G.<eos> It's working.<eos> It stopped digging.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It's heading back for Holden.
Naomi said that the creature gets energy<eos> - from radiation, right?<eos> - Yeah, sure. It sucks radiation the way a tick sucks blood.<eos> First time we found the protomolecule, it was wrapped around a reactor core, so what?<eos> It's following a nutrient gradient.
When I give the word, you pull the core. Now.<eos> Pull it now!<eos> It's out the door.<eos> It's headed your way!<eos> Okay, here it comes!
Guns.<eos> Railguns.<eos> Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.
Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.<eos> It's already scattered too far to ever be sure it'll all be gone.<eos> It's part of the equation now, and it will be from now on.
He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.<eos> But it also made him... evil.
If she can accept you for all that,<eos> I'm pretty sure she can accept you for who you are.<eos> Okay?<eos> You know, mustard is actually high in antioxidants.<eos> It's actually pretty good for you.
I Portaled to freakin' India and had to face off with a cobra!<eos> And all I got was this stupid box of hers!<eos> This stupid box is sacred.<eos> You know why?<eos> It contains Camille's grave dirt.
Magnus, tell me, can it be done?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Sure, there are warlocks who've done this sort of thing.<eos> But what you're talking about is dark, dark magic.<eos> It's wildly unpredictable.
Wait.<eos> Do you sleep in a coffin?<eos> No, it's a canoe.<eos> And, Mom, the blood wasn't fake.<eos> It was real.
For the answers you seek, we must go inside the Citadel.<eos> But we cannot allow any demonic impurities to pass.<eos> The adamas is too fragile.<eos> So, the heavenly energy in the water will help us determine if you may enter.<eos> It will destroy any contaminant upon contact.
- Really?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.<eos> Or saw it.<eos> I just kind of thought that's what it was about.
We agree.<eos> One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?<eos> Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.<eos> A piece of the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Where is it?
No.<eos> We're good.<eos> Thank you, Ida.<eos> I wanted to thank you in person for your support.<eos> I doubt it made much of a difference.
It should.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Come on, Harry.<eos> That tattoo.<eos> It's an SF tattoo.
My son honored that commitment.<eos> He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.<eos> Wear it with pride.<eos> Respect what it represents: To serve and protect the citizens of Los Angeles.
No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior project.<eos> Oh, yeah, I heard it was a huge success.
Everything all right?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior project.<eos> Oh, yeah, I heard it was a huge success.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was, and it's really great.
He was terrified.<eos> Felicity, what's really going on?<eos> The NSA file that exonerated John, it was part of a cache of information given to me by a hacker group, and that cache includes Intel that I used to pressure the Detralink exec.<eos> You mean, you blackmailed him.<eos> - Well... - For this data cache to have exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it has to be huge.
He knew how to avoid them.<eos> And before he opened fire, he upgraded to a ski mask.<eos> That looks like a utility jumpsuit.<eos> Forefather Repair.<eos> It went belly up 6 years ago.
Why don't you like us talking about this?<eos> I just don't like you guys arguing while I'm trying to work.<eos> I mean, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy debate, Felicity.<eos> It's not healthy if it doesn't accomplish anything, and it's not going to accomplish anything.<eos> Actually, I--I disagree not about the part of it not accomplishing anything but this idea that it's not healthy.
Hasn't made a dent yet.<eos> What's that thing made of anyway?<eos> Keltium.<eos> It's a proprietary alloy developed by the U.S. government to repel nuclear blasts.<eos> So you're saying even if we had a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?
We shouldn't have left Nick.<eos> He gave us no choice.<eos> This fight's not over.<eos> It is for Nick.<eos> It would have been for us if we had stayed.
Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.<eos> It's really old.
The protomolecule was frozen around the reactor core.<eos> It was starving.<eos> Did you turn the power back on?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> It started moving.
Day-to-day operations are handled by Protogen executives, with full autonomy.<eos> With such a small project, my team would only be notified if the company exceeded its budget allotment.<eos> So, these "rogue" employees managed to make a profit and a war without even going over budget?<eos> God, maybe we should get these people on our payroll.<eos> Protogen is a bio-tech research company, and it had a government contract on Phoebe Station.
Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> You know those voices I'm hearing,<eos> I think this thing has taken the, I don't know, consciousness, some part of whatever it is makes us human.<eos> It's eating it, spitting it back out in some other configuration.
And they're beaming the data here.<eos> Naomi: It's an abandoned communications relay.<eos> Miller: At least some of the people responsible for Eros are gonna be there.<eos> If we want answers, we have to take that station.<eos> It's floating dark, barely registers on radar but it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.
I mean, somebody's gotta keep these idiots from shooting each other.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I'll go clean out my cabin.<eos> Leave it.<eos> It'll be waiting for you when you get back.
Curiosity is not a crime.<eos> More's the pity or you'd be serving life without probation.<eos> Shopping lists and household accounts.<eos> Er... have you seen the last entry?<eos> Now I suppose you're going to tell us what it means.
There has been an Ibis and Jacquel in business here for 200 years.<eos> Pins for the bones.<eos> Threads for the muscles.<eos> Paint for the skin.<eos> We need to tend to your flesh as best we can as it can't tend to itself anymore.
The power of fire is firepower.<eos> Not God.<eos> But godlike.<eos> And they believe.<eos> It fills their spirits every time they pull the trigger.
Just please don't make me go back there!<eos> Give me your money!<eos> No!<eos> I have so much to teach you, Bruce.<eos> But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.
Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> No.<eos> Your rage, Bruce.<eos> It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.
- K-9s stay with me.<eos> - Harvey, at 5:00 p.m., Union Station is gonna be packed.<eos> Even with an evacuation, thousands will be infected.<eos> Not if we find the bomb first.<eos> But I'm guessing it's not gonna be sitting out in the open.
I'm just being realistic, Wally.<eos> I get to do that.<eos> Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or as a sister or as a girlfriend, but as a reporter.<eos> This story can do that.<eos> It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.
Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or as a sister or as a girlfriend, but as a reporter.<eos> This story can do that.<eos> It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.<eos> You know, my life was a lot easier before I had a sister.<eos> But it's a lot better now, isn't it?
Wait, that's the opposite of how my blood causes cells to regenerate.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Can we use my blood to save her?<eos> Listen, I don't think that your blood is the key to saving Iris.<eos> But I do think it might be exactly what we need to take down Yorkin.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> I don't have it in me right now.<eos> I need you to get your blood into him.<eos> It'll counteract his cells and negate his powers.
We sent Grodd there when he went after Fay Wray here.<eos> - Grodd's there? - Mm.<eos> Why on Earth, any Earth, would your father want to go there?<eos> I mean, we received a mathematical cryptogram at our S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> It was highly complex.
We can.<eos> You've seen the future.<eos> You know there's an attack.<eos> If we just figure out where that attack happens, we can launch a preemptive strike against Grodd.<eos> We can stop the attack before it ever starts.
- or the freaking "Peanuts"? - It's not "The Peanuts." It's just "Peanuts."<eos> You have been studying this thing for hours. Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?<eos> Okay, all right, wind it in.<eos> As far as we can tell, the shard is made of near-frictionless material that's in a constant state of flux.<eos> So while it's utterly motionless on the outside... It's constantly moving on the inside.
Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.
Look... I'll admit, it's been hard not to wonder what it would have been like to have a daughter instead of a son, but this is less about what happened than why it happened.<eos> I made a big mistake.<eos> Exactly my concern.<eos> Barry, this is the kind of tech that wars are fought over.<eos> If something happens and it gets into the wrong hands, people could die.
I'd love to.<eos> By all means, you first.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Reminds me of "Jaws."<eos> They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.
I know.<eos> It's tough. But we'll get through this, buddy.<eos> No. No, that photo.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Where is it?
What about it?<eos> We need to know the amounts of each ingredient he used.<eos> If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.<eos> The professor kept the formula all to himself.<eos> He liked to brag about how the only place it existed was in his head.
Film her. Well, the song isn't just about love at first sight.<eos> It's about... a lifetime, about the risks two people take when their lives and their destinies cross.<eos> It was always about the music.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.
Yes.<eos> Girl, we saw the teaser, When Cookie Met Lucious.<eos> It's lit.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.
She recommended him?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Lucious, this company belongs to me and...<eos> No, it's our company.<eos> It belongs to me and my family.
Stay away from my daughter!<eos> Cass, you, um...<eos> We completed a mission.<eos> Some mission.<eos> It was horrific, but it was necessary.
But if... if I could go back and change it, three years, then I would.<eos> Cos he's out there, isn't he?<eos> Still living... and free.<eos> You know?<eos> And, after all the talking, all the counselling, this anger, it's not going anywhere, it's getting worse.
What you doing?<eos> Yes.<eos> There.<eos> The figure on the CCTV runs into a field on the edge of Flintcombe Farm with a public footpath through it.<eos> You go down that footpath and it leads to this road here which means...
This is the Reptile Room.<eos> Feel free to explore.<eos> Here is the lizard wing... and here... is a winged lizard.<eos> Now, see his yellow-striped belly, a sign of camouflage and cowardice.<eos> Can it really fly?
- Stephano!<eos> Stephano.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, there's a spare room upstairs.<eos> It's small, but like I said, I have three young children living with me,
I really appreciate your doing this, Dad.<eos> You don't appreciate it.<eos> You expect it. You take it for granted.<eos> You hardly notice it, truth be told, but in its absence, you will, like God's fucking grace.<eos> The whole point, too, of God's grace, as I understand it, is that it asks nothing in return, but love and devotion.
The universe is 14 billion years old.<eos> No one knows what came before.<eos> No one knows how big the universe actually is.<eos> It...<eos> It could be infinite."
I... I'm sorry, did you say...<eos> - Mulberry or Mott?<eos> - I said it's on Mott.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's right around the corner.
I have to ask...<eos> When you got there and you realized you were in over your heads, why didn't you just turn around and come home?<eos> We were too ashamed to fail.<eos> E-Especially when people started laughing at us, like, when we tried to build a school out of... out of mud blocks...<eos> We built one wall, and then... and then it just fell down.
Thanks, anyway.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm calling about an appointment for Charles McGill.<eos> Well, that's why I'm calling.<eos> I think it's for this week, but...
- Great.<eos> We'll talk strategy... We move on Colorado or Utah first?<eos> See ya at 7:00.<eos> This McGill thing.<eos> You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?
These things take time to unravel, even for doctors.<eos> Would you say that your illness affects your ability to think clearly?<eos> No.<eos> It affects me physically.<eos> It causes me great pain.
Potato, po-tah-to.<eos> It comes down to this...<eos> In order to understand what I was thinking, you need to see Chuck through my eyes.<eos> You need to know if I believed that tape was evidence.<eos> And I say it was evidence of only one thing...
Ooh, did I tell you I think I found an apartment?<eos> You promised me that we were going to<eos> - stand in awkward silence.<eos> - You're funny.<eos> It's in this up-and-coming neighborhood called Mu-To.
And now that I've had time to think about it, I decided that the right thing to do is to give you and not them this tape.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.<eos> Bye, Tracy.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.
The steering locked up.<eos> The thing veered off the road.<eos> - Can you get it started?<eos> - No, it's shut down.<eos> It's not going anywhere.
- Until Kuznikov showed up at his home at exactly the right time.<eos> Gretchen waited until she wasn't the only suspect. She's smart.<eos> So why isn't she pointing the finger at you?<eos> Treason is front page stuff, Brant.<eos> It doesn't just end your career. It ruins your family for generations.
That's all you can do.<eos> And don't despair.<eos> I don't think your story with Betty is over.<eos> Your room's so sweet.<eos> It's too pink.
I don't think your story with Betty is over.<eos> Your room's so sweet.<eos> It's too pink.<eos> It doesn't feel right anymore.<eos> No, I like how girly it is.
- Hey, what's up?<eos> - Hey. He used to be on the football team.<eos> But I quit.<eos> When I saw Chuck's playbook.<eos> And I may know where it is.
Who the hell is Jennifer Gibson?<eos> That's not the only thing.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't tell me you're still on this crazy witch hunt.<eos> It's not a witch hunt, and it's not crazy.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.<eos> And there's nothing I can do to stop that.<eos> Betty, don't do that.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
Get out!<eos> Go on!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> The party's done.<eos> It's over!
But I lied.<eos> And instead I threw you this party that you didn't even want.<eos> Why did you?<eos> Something is very, very wrong with me.<eos> Like there's this darkness in me that's overwhelming sometimes, and I don't know where it comes from.
And given recent events, it's not inconceivable that he might've hired him to do other jobs.<eos> Like go after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him.<eos> I want to help with your investigation.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> Whatever it is.
This is outrageous.<eos> I'm writing an article about this, and not just for The Blue and Gold, for The Register.<eos> This is a town story.<eos> Okay, as long as the article doesn't include my dad.<eos> No, it is going to be about your dad, Jug.
The night Amy was murdered,<eos> Gail Meyers called me about 3:00 a.m. to say Amy hadn't come home yet.<eos> I went to ask Billy if he knew where she was.<eos> The cat was sleeping beside him.<eos> When he rolled over, it got mad and scratched him on the cheek.
I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.<eos> What I want to know is how Nasiri slipped under everybody's radar.<eos> That's the funny thing about freedom.<eos> It gives our enemies the freedom to destroy us.
Bile flow is good.<eos> Most beautiful purple you ever saw.<eos> Right.<eos> How's the hepatic artery?<eos> Just look at it, it's practically dancing.
The truly rich never have to worry about it all getting away from them.<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, Goofo.<eos> You're the best selling author of the year, and no one's taking that away from you.<eos> Lawrence, tell us what you like most about Scott's book.<eos> Well, uh... - it captures youth. - Mm-hm.

You're confused?<eos> I've been confused ever since this one popped out of my vagina.<eos> Oh, my God, Mom, do not talk about your vagina.<eos> Why?<eos> It's perfectly good.
Reason?<eos> They're garbage.<eos> I cannot show these to my father, all right?<eos> If he's gonna give us this client, we need to step up our game.<eos> Our work needs to be Ivy League, and right now, it's Arizona State.
Magnesium in the laxative caused hypomagnesaemia -- respiratory distress, low blood pressure, arrhythmia...<eos> - That would explain the blood, would it?<eos> - It would explain the vomiting.<eos> However, he was also suffering from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.<eos> The rest of it put such a strain on his system that it ruptured.
Trixie, I've been jumping through hoops all night for Sister Douglas.<eos> I don't need any more exercise, thank you.<eos> Nurse Crane.<eos> Early bird catches the worm.<eos> Or, at least, it gets all the worms lined up and identifies which is likely to cause the most trouble.
Why can't you find anything?<eos> - Because our room's a mess.<eos> - Then tidy it.<eos> I do.<eos> Then it gets untidy again.
Young man, may I enquire what you are doing?<eos> Pulling weeds.<eos> That is not a weed.<eos> That is common fleabane.<eos> It grows freely and thus it flourishes.
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?
'No-one knows where the soul resides.<eos> 'Does it inhabit the heart?<eos> 'The brain?<eos> 'Where in the body does it hide?
May I give her your regards?<eos> Of course you may, but I'd rather you gave her my love.<eos> These are frightening times.<eos> Why do we need to paint our windows?<eos> Well, the idea of the white paint is it deflects the heat from the initial blast.
Make merry.<eos> I'd think I'd quite like to sit here with you... doing not much at all and just see what happens.<eos> What if this happens?<eos> Did the electric shock treatment help at all?<eos> It was... cleansing.
- Here's your change.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Noah's getting an RC car for the first day of school.<eos> - Sounds like it would cost a lot.
If you can stick around for, oh, another 20 minutes you'll see how strong.<eos> I can't wait for you to meet the new and improved Rebecca.<eos> The question is do you have it in you to kill her?<eos> My army of the dead will change the world for the better.<eos> It will correct the imbalance caused by recent wars.
What time did you leave the club yesterday?<eos> Six-thirty?<eos> Seven?<eos> Last minute training?<eos> It can make all the difference.
I'm sorry.<eos> So what're we looking for?<eos> The main event is Mercury in retrograde.<eos> It'll look like the planet is actually moving backwards.<eos> But it's... not?
Do you know that I collect military memorabilia?<eos> Two years ago, I got my hands on an original 1916 proclamation issued by the Irish volunteers in the Irish Citizen Army.<eos> During the Easter rebellion.<eos> Did I say it was an original? Signed by Patrick Pierce?<eos> Do this for me, and it's yours.
We had a deal.<eos> I think I'd like us to have more deals.<eos> If you think I'm gonna be working for you...<eos> But you are... because we found your weakness.<eos> It's standing right next to you.
They didn't need any.<eos> Shaun was black.<eos> And from the same part of town as that church.<eos> Guys, I think there might be something wrong with our justice system.<eos> It gets worse.
Fred Johnson has proven himself to be a true friend to the Belt.<eos> But as much as I fear war between Earth and Mars, I fear the peace more.<eos> For that is when they will turn their sights back on all of us.<eos> The Inners are not like us.<eos> Earthers cannot look upon a thing but wonder who it belongs to, huh?
Soon enough, sir.<eos> My mother was Foreign Secretary took me there on a Dip tour when I was 15.<eos> I trained in one-G since I could walk, but it's different when you're there.<eos> This oppressive pull down.<eos> It pulls the spirits down with it.
It's slipping away.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> It's still there.
Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.
I'm a medical doctor, and that's privileged information, as you well know.<eos> So if you're trying to trip me up, try harder.<eos> You can come back with a court order, lock me up, and I'd still never tell you a goddamn thing about my patients.<eos> I just wonder what could have been said in such a session to justify such an enormous sum.<eos> It was commensurate with other bonuses at Axe Capital.
You already know how to do it.<eos> Mary.<eos> What color is the wall?<eos>  White.<eos>  What color do you want it to be?
 So make it so.<eos> Change it.<eos> Turn the wall red, Mary.<eos> Just turn it red.<eos>  It's red.
 I do.<eos> It's summer to me.<eos> Has been my whole life.<eos>  But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.<eos> Someplace so cold and forbidding, so utterly devoid of life, you can't know how precious it is, how vulnerable.
 I know it looks like a lot, but the meds are going to help ease the panic attacks, dysphoria, anxiety, fear you've been feeling from the PTSD.<eos>  Cults work to control your mind, and your mind has been controlled for a long time.<eos>  Right, right, right.<eos>  I spoke with a colleague who gave me information about a support group.<eos> It's for people who have been victims of mind control.
And the blood... smeared on it.<eos> Could that radio, Mike, have housed a bomb capable of this kind of damage?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I didn't look inside.<eos> If that's where the bomb had been, and it had gone off while you were checking out the body...
The course is pretty immaculate.<eos> Dr. Palmer, are you asking me on a date?<eos> No, no, I just... I just want to work on my short game.<eos> Okay, well, you know I'm gonna crush you.<eos> I appreciate your confidence, but we'll see how it holds up to the windmill on the 12th hole.
Can you imagine having a baby in Georgia?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You have to pick someone you know that you trust.<eos> Why don't you use Gary's sperm?<eos> It's just sitting there gathering dust.
I got one theory.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> - This Helen thing is exploding.<eos> It's everywhere.
I think I'm falling in love.<eos> With who?<eos> Florida.<eos> Florida?<eos> If you had a good idea, it would die of loneliness.
We shall see.<eos> But for now,<eos> Quentin, Alice, Penny, and Margo need Battle Magic.<eos> We're going to teach Battle Magic now?<eos> It was once a required course.
Well, come on, then.<eos> No interference here, as far as I can see.<eos> The vault's secure.<eos> So your box can move?<eos> It can go anywhere it likes?
Hang on.<eos> The room's still inside the box.<eos> - This isn't a knock-through.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Doctor! It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside!
TARDIS.<eos> If you're from another planet, why would you name your box in English?<eos> Those initials wouldn't work in any other language!<eos> - People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.
Those initials wouldn't work in any other language!<eos> - People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.<eos> Yes, well, that's the cloaking device.<eos> It sort of hides itself.
That should tell you something.<eos> Since when have County done a textbook anything?<eos> There is one oddity.<eos> They didn't speak to anyone at Bramford power station.<eos> It's just four miles up the road from where Laxman disappeared.
I'm on the run.<eos> I need a place to hide.<eos> They know about Bud.<eos> They put a BOLO out on his truck.<eos> It's in front of his shop.
Why?<eos> After everything that happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from.<eos> The answer might be on the cloth.<eos> I'm not sure that it is.<eos> We need to find out where its power comes from before it kills one of us.
Nick!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> So you felt the arm come through the mirror in the spice shop?<eos> I saw it first, and then I felt it.<eos> It choked her.
It was all covered in leaves and moss and mud, and it had vines for arms, and it picked him up.<eos> - It picked him right up. - What did you do?<eos> I...<eos> I shot it, but it didn't do nothing.<eos> And then... And then I ran, you know, 'cause I thought - it was coming after me.
- Me either. Well, maybe there's something we can do to make it seem like we're harming the forest.<eos> Like fake toxic sludge?<eos> Oh, wait, I think I have an idea.<eos> - What? - My brother and I, we used to have so much fun with this book when we were kids.<eos> Where is it?
Oh, yeah.<eos> We used to make this strange goop.<eos> "Humano-Reptiliana: Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle Di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.
- Please.<eos> There might be something in them that could help us fight this thing.<eos> Those books could be just as dangerous.<eos> Waiting for this thing to come after me, or us, would be more dangerous, and Adaline,<eos> I think one of the reasons it is connecting to me is because I can see those symbols.
What if you can't find her?<eos> Or what if you find her but you can't get back?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.
Or what if you find her but you can't get back?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.<eos> It doesn't belong there.
You shouldn't have come after me.<eos> Eve...<eos> You don't owe anything to anybody, and I don't know what you're trying to prove, but you're...<eos> I'm not trying to prove anything.<eos> I am trying to kill this thing before it kills us, and we can't stay here;
They buried a stick?<eos> Gets that reaction a lot.<eos> But there's more to it than that.<eos> Not just any stick.<eos> For one thing, it can heal.
It took Hexenbiest blood to cross over.<eos> A stick?<eos> It's how Nick was able to follow Eve.<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> - They said you were dead.<eos> - I think I was.<eos> I hope that stick does what we think it does.<eos> - It's healing her.
Oh, my God.<eos> He killed everybody.<eos> Except me, and I don't know why.<eos> Maybe he thought you were dead, or... Maybe the stick protected you.<eos> Well, if the stick protected me, why didn't it do anything to help Hank or Wu?
- You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... It's inside you.
With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> The strength of your blood, the blood of your Grimm ancestors, all of us... It's inside you.<eos> It's what makes us who we are...
Ross.<eos> Ross!<eos> Allez, cherchez partout!<eos> "Young Cap'n Ross d' most sincerely regret?"<eos> Oh, he'll regret ever sending' home his hat, for it won't fit his head when I've done with him!
A dozen or so others escaped but we all separated.<eos> They are headed for the coast.<eos> I abandoned my posting.<eos> The thought of freedom was too much for me.<eos> It was too much for us all.
Madam President, let me tell you little story about growing up in the Gurjaani countryside.<eos> You thought you caught a fish, it turned out to be a tire.<eos> The tire was full of fish.<eos> It's a great story.<eos> It's a very valuable lesson, but I really gotta go.
It was just that kind of thing, you know?<eos> He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on.<eos> A friendship like that?<eos> I don't how to describe it.<eos> - Was it legendary? - Yes.
I don't.<eos> Are we gonna have to listen to this one song over and over the whole drive?<eos> I'm just trying to figure it out.<eos> Tammy said "A Walk To The Peak" was God's favorite.<eos> It is kinda catchy.
Or you.<eos> Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?
Who are you, and what have you done with Carisi?<eos> You really feel that way?<eos> Talk to me in 20 years.<eos> I will.<eos> And you'll realize that... the job doesn't change you, it makes you more of who you already are.
It's okay.<eos> I just did it last week.<eos> I was at the 7-Eleven, and I was, you know, buying stuff for the house.<eos> Naturally, that's where black people get our groceries.<eos> I hear the squad car pull up, I heard it pull up.
The sooner we start fighting back...<eos> Emergency radiation.<eos> Yeah, a single dose intended only to stabilize.<eos> It'll give the pancreatitis a few more days to heal, And it'll give you and your dad more time. To decide on a treatment.<eos> And if I still choose surgery after, It'll be safer, right?
Yeah. My wife, kate, has this necklace, and, I think it was a gift from her mother.<eos> And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.<eos> And I know she'd want to have it with her. I just...<eos> I understand.<eos> It can be in her hand through the surgery.
I mean, medications, social skills training. To help you recognize body language.<eos> There's also a new therapy called tms, But I'd probably recommend you going. The traditional routes first.<eos> Tms?<eos> Transcranial magnetic stimulation.<eos> It's so far fda approved only for depression, But there is anecdotal evidence. That it can benefit people with spectrum disorders.
At considerable expense.<eos> No one could find anything wrong with her.<eos> It's not my stomach this time, mom,<eos> It's my head.<eos> It's throbbing.
He always has been.<eos> Wow.<eos> A few years ago, He realized that rock faces weren't enough.<eos> He loved his life.<eos> It's not over.
I'll give you some time.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> Even if he was having trouble, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you ever see Jason do that trick where you'd pull a card out of the deck and it turns out it's in his pocket?
Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine ...<eos> No. No.<eos> No one's touching it.<eos> When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.<eos> Because it's dangerous, yeah.
- software programming you to die.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> But I have something you will never have ... a soul... that will continue long after I'm gone.<eos> How can you be so sure I don't have one?<eos> If a soul doesn't come from your flesh and blood or my ones and zeroes, then it has to come from somewhere else, somewhere unrelated to our physical bodies.
- Yes, sir.<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> Agent Simmons?<eos> It's not good news, I'm afraid.<eos> The serum that's been giving you your strength... it... is... potentially lethal.
- What is it?<eos> Glioblastoma multiforme.<eos> I know, it's boring.<eos> Just your garden variety brain tumor.<eos> But at least it's in a really interesting place,
They stole you from his life.<eos> What if he never knew me?<eos> What if he can't remember?<eos> This... This reality is flawless.<eos> - It lures you in.
You know what?<eos> I'm not gonna go there.<eos> Just -- just keep moving.<eos> The resistance must have a base of operation.<eos> Where is it?
On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.<eos> And now I know what it will do.
Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.<eos> Destroy this body, sure.<eos> It was designed only for killing.<eos> My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.
- I'm as surprised as you.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The Darkhold.<eos> My arm still hurts.<eos> Why won't it heal?
OK.<eos> I'm your long-lost twin sister.<eos> I look just like you.<eos> I even have a tiny teeny beard right on the end of my chin.<eos> It's your doppelganger.
Neither shot could have originated from the car.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> That the shots were fired before.<eos> I don't know when exactly, but certainly before the accident.<eos> Helen, they were fired by someone standing outside the vehicle whilst it was stationary.
A storage area?<eos> In Osaka.<eos> What about a soul that doesn't match?<eos> It's like organ donation.<eos> The body will reject say, a kidney if it wasn't the right type.
Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.<eos> Our car was that color.<eos> We bought it off Craigslist.<eos> It smelled like maple syrup.
It's nice.<eos> I don't want to forget this.<eos> Fuck.<eos> A rose is a rose, except here.<eos> Here it has to mean something.
And at the exact moment that hope is abandoned, our Savior will reveal Himself to the frightened masses.<eos> Ingenious.<eos> The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.<eos> Your uniform.<eos> Some of the men find it a bit... flamboyant.
Ingenious.<eos> The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.<eos> Your uniform.<eos> Some of the men find it a bit... flamboyant.<eos> It's... spectacular.
It was where we first met.<eos> Newton believed light to be made of particles.<eos> Professor Godfrey was lecturing on the wave theory of light.<eos> And you came through the door.<eos> Well, a wave needs something to push against, does it not?
Well, I better not keep my partner waiting.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um, I just wanted to give you a gift, um, to thank you for your candor.<eos> It was invaluable.
I stretch out my arms to him, but he slips away.<eos> Like a ghost at daybreak.<eos> And I am left here.<eos> I wish this story were different.<eos> I wish it showed me in a better light.
You enjoying yourself, Dad?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Good! - They could turn the music down a bit, though.<eos> - What?<eos> - The music -- it's very loud.
Uh, hopefully you can hear me.<eos> Please tell Daddy and Sahar that I'm okay...<eos> Oh, Jonesy! Thank God!<eos> Don't "Jonesy" me!<eos> We know about your special panic room. Where is it?
Yeah, nice try and all, but I can't help you here.<eos> I got my own fish to fry.<eos> You get service here?<eos> Maybe I'll get the fried fish.<eos> Mmm. It's beer battered. Not halal.
Soup sounds wonderful.<eos> - Uh, cold soup.<eos> - Oh, yes. I never cook anything hot.<eos> I'm afraid to turn on the stove.<eos> It... it might burst into flames.
And no doubt taller in heels.<eos> Are you arresting me?<eos> !<eos> Unfortunately, due to the lack of evidence, that's not possible.<eos> So I'm going to get this blood tested, and if it matches that of the victim, then I'm going to arrest you.
- Pardon the interruption...<eos> - Excellent timing, Gideon.<eos> Your daughter Lily's algorithm has identified a location for another piece of the Spear.<eos> Well, when it rains, it pours.<eos> Where is it, Gideon?
About time.<eos> You know what that power makes me?<eos> A bad guy?<eos> Evil?<eos> It makes me a god.
Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.<eos> It was always cold.
So, what you're telling me is that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long lost father has returned from Cadmus custody with news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's other-worldly heat vision radiation,<eos> and that they're going to drop that on National City and just kill us all?<eos> Ha! Is... Is this...<eos> You could run a trace on Kara's heat vision radiation signature.<eos> Right, yeah well, if the bomb is armed, then yes, I might be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.
No!<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> No! - The painting.<eos> Where is it?
Hey, hey! How you doing, buddy?<eos> Getting there.<eos> I got a little something to perk you up.<eos> So I just finished running diagnostics on this little beauty.<eos> And it, my friend, is in tip top shape.
That's all that matters.<eos> As long as they don't use the Supergirl defense.<eos> The what?<eos> It's a thing some criminals use to get their charges dropped.<eos> It's a perfect storm for a defense attorney.
You're gonna have a shitload of FBI at your disposal, and this is how I suggest you deploy them.<eos> Axelrod.<eos> Bobby Axelrod's moves will be almost impossible to track.<eos> So, in addition to monitoring all his trades, follow everyone he touches and everyone they touch.<eos> The pattern won't be easy to spot, but it will be there.
Dr Fagan can hardly expect all those things for the salary he's offering.<eos> Das ware lacherlich...<eos> Ja?<eos> Ja.<eos> Oh, well, I think you'll find it very suitable.
You don't need to know.<eos> And neither does Dominique, a'ight?<eos> Two bottles go on the receipt, but only one bottle gets pulled from inventory.<eos> What happens to the extra bottle?<eos> It just magically disappears and our receipts match up.
They get it wrong... don't they?<eos> Sometimes, they make mistakes.<eos> You stopped returning Christmas cards.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My career, it sort of becomes all-consuming.
- The boy's the one with your magic wand.<eos> - Sonic screwdriver.<eos> - How is that a screwdriver?<eos> - In a very broad sense.<eos> - How's it sonic?
You're insane.<eos> No.<eos> I'm quite rational, actually.<eos> Monogamy is not natural.<eos> It is a construct of religious authority.
They run in a tube.<eos> They tend to... They rise because of what is termed the capillary effect...<eos> I've got a physics question.<eos> So, I was in my bathtub this morning, and I dunk my head at the same time as I knock my hairbrush in with my toe.<eos> And it hits the cast iron, and it sounds quite loud underwater.
Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, - then how do we know it's there?
Can't blame you.<eos> She's a beauty.<eos> Lethal, but a beauty.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Take care of your rifle, it'll take care of you.
But you... you have a special sight.<eos> Here, what do you think of this public art?<eos> I don't know, it's just art.<eos> Focus, Liz, focus.<eos> It sucks.
Mileva's got a wonderful mind.<eos> I can see why you were drawn to her.<eos> That feels like eons ago.<eos> Love is a chemical reaction.<eos> Sometimes, it burns itself out.
I'll contact B.R.A.D.<eos> Hoover here will take care of the professional.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'm going to leave the tarp out.<eos> If you fail again, it'll be waiting.
And we intend to unruffle them. By offering up something that the critics can't argue against, proof.<eos> In the form of astronomical photographs.<eos> Consider Mercury, the closest planet to the sun.<eos> Unlike the other seven planets, Mercury's orbit doesn't conform to Newtonian laws.<eos> It's off.
I can assure you that rumors remain at the speculation stage, yet I would tread carefully.<eos> A scandal once unleashed is difficult to reign in and always ends up much worse for the woman than the man.<eos> Thank you, Bertha. But I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.<eos> And so clearly the deflection should be precisely. .83 seconds of arc.<eos> And to get here, we employed riemannian geometry, since it contains certain invariants under coordinate transformations that.
Gotta pull over and check it out.<eos> Older cars, you know how it is.<eos> Hey, Ruiz! Get me my flashlight in the glove box?<eos> I used to work on my dad's car.<eos> If it's overheating, you're gonna have to...
Needs work.<eos> And exhale.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The good news is the fluid currently in his lungs is draining.<eos> But it will return with a vengeance.
I'm into Claire.<eos> I thought you knew that.<eos> I like Diaz and all, but we can't all go down for what she did.<eos> You can't pull the lever.<eos> You got to let fate take its course, or it comes back to haunt you.
And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know?<eos> Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
- But what are they saying? - Uh, uh, uh...<eos> The comments are mostly skewing positive.<eos> "Squash the system." "Give the ladies what they want."<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I guess you can't deny cruelty when it shows up on your Facebook feed.
Because we won.<eos> We fought back and we won.<eos> And you are a blind cow.<eos> And you are a...<eos> I lost my humanity in the dirt here for a while... but it's slowly coming back.
- No, come on, get one.<eos> Another one, where, you know, in a place where people can see it this time.<eos> It's not... My tattoo is not for me.<eos> It's...<eos> It's for other people.
It's a very long story.<eos> You have taught me... that...<eos> love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life...<eos> It hurts.
There is a hope that people think soberly.<eos> Dear.<eos> Do not hammer your bright head with gloomy thoughts.<eos> The war is finally over.<eos> I do not leave the feeling that it has only just begun.
- Yeah.<eos> I think this is how they did it.<eos> That was heavy cooperative magic.<eos> Yeah, well, there are notes for version 2.0 here.<eos> I mean, it's more efficient.
Of course.<eos> David, come in.<eos> I've just read your paper.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> Well, hopefully it'll give you some ammunition to fire back at the quantum contingent.
David, come in.<eos> I've just read your paper.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> Well, hopefully it'll give you some ammunition to fire back at the quantum contingent.<eos> It does, and it came at just the right moment.
I have no special talent, but I am very, very curious, Alice.<eos> All I do is ask questions, just like you do.<eos> That's the most important thing.<eos> Anybody can do that.<eos> You know, I was looking up at the moon last night and wondering, why doesn't it come crashing down?
You want to have kids.<eos> What would you do if it was your son, Shahir?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Enucleating the tumor now.<eos> Billy: It's in a tricky spot, right on the pancreatic duct.
All my life, I was good, polite, never got in anyone's way.<eos> You know what I got for it?<eos> Dog crap in my locker, gum on bike seat... running the punch gauntlet when I walk out of school.<eos> - And you don' t want to go back to that.<eos> - [sighs] This tumor may have made me crazy, but it made things better in my life, too.
Gar...<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Maybe my uterus is just wonky.<eos> No, Catherine. It's porcelain and perfect.
I ran back for him, and he was...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you see what it was?<eos> And the radio?<eos> It wasn't working.
If they're working with spies, I'll find them.<eos> I imagine you are highly motivated.<eos> It's healing well.<eos> Sabine will be pleased.<eos> I could protect marigold better if I knew what it was,
Alec?<eos> What are you doing in my father's study?<eos> You mentioned his model train.<eos> He doesn't use it much anymore.<eos> I think it reminds him. Too much of what life was like before.
Transfer if you need to, krystina, I understand.<eos> Or you can stay, Take the next flight into the field. I won't...<eos> I won't hold you back.<eos> The intelligence has been sent to berlin.<eos> It lines up with the whispering. They've been hearing from oslo, bergen.
With one dick, you're just jerking yourself off, but with three dicks, suddenly you've got six people having sex.<eos> Which is more powerful?<eos> I think your metaphor literally doesn't make any fucking sense.<eos> It doesn't have to.<eos> It just distracted you long enough for Alice to power up the spell, which is all the shield charm has to do.
Everything all right, gentlemen?<eos> We know your game, Philbrick.<eos> We've being comparing stories.<eos> One day, I'll tell you the truth and you won't believe that, either.<eos> Because it's more extraordinary than any of your tiny little minds could ever comprehend.
It's been okay.<eos> My heart is broken.<eos> But we'll be fine, won't we?<eos> Get back on track and we'll find a new date for the wedding.<eos> Oh, how beautiful it's going to be.

Only a demon would harm a child.<eos> You are your mother's daughter.<eos> God will judge you for your sin.<eos> There is sickness then.<eos> It will play in our favor.
When that car was launched in 1990, it was considered remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari, but unlike a Ferrari of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very, very easy to drive.<eos> Honda killed that car off 12 years ago. But finally, they've come up with a replacement.<eos> So I've been down to our track to see what it's like.<eos> This is it.<eos> It costs £138,000.
There is no physical connection to the pedal.<eos> That's because they have to harvest energy to recharge the battery system.<eos> It's a much cleverer version of that than you get on the Porsche 918, a car that costs five times as much.<eos> Then there's the hybrid system.<eos> It uses not one electric motor, as you might expect, but three.
Highly-trained men are now removing its skin which will then be mated in a delicate two-hour operation... to the internal organs of the mud-plugging V8.<eos> The following morning my incredible car was ready.<eos> It is incredible that in a shed I have created something which has... eluded the combined might of the motor industry.<eos> It is a proper sports utility vehicle.<eos> I call it the MGD, and now I'm going to find out how well it works on a road.
No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it.<eos> - What reserve?<eos> £100,000.<eos> - So it didn't sell at all, which means you cost us £14,000?
Operate the pumps. They send the results up, across, and into the water purification system.<eos> It emerges from that as purest drinking water.<eos> Food. I'm gonna need it.<eos> I've got a chicken.<eos> It lays eggs. They go in there.
That's my own urine!<eos> - Are you two doing this?<eos> - Yes, he is!<eos> I'd get out of the way if I were you.<eos> The trouble with the chicken is, it moves around, making this a...
They put the door in the wrong place.<eos> It should be... It should be further back.<eos> That is brilliant.<eos> There's more, too.<eos> It's not a particularly handsome car.
It was like watching an ape return to its cage and finding there was an apple and a banana.<eos> "I like apple, but I like bananas.<eos> So do I want the apple or a banana?"<eos> You would have had both, obviously.<eos> Hammond, that car is brilliant, and it only costs £60,000.
If you make a car that is excellent for doing a fast lap of the Nürburgring, it would be useless as a car everywhere else in your life.<eos> It's like... It's like setting your house up to play Laser Quest.<eos> It will be brilliant for playing Laser Quest, but it'll be rubbish for a dinner party because it's full of lasers, darkness, fog and music that goes... and people running around thinking that they're in Star Wars.<eos> Or you could get a dog... You could train a dog as an attack dog, which is fantastic if you own a scrapyard and you need the dog to guard it, but take it home as a pet, it will eat your children.<eos> It's completely useless.
We were coming through the airport here the other day, coming through Chicago, and he went, "Jeremy, smell my jacket."<eos> He said what? ! - Yeah.<eos> - He did.<eos> He said, "Smell my jacket." I said, "Why?"<eos> He said, "Because it smells of old record players."
And then we had to secure it in place.<eos> I don't understand ratchet straps. Er...<eos> There's water coming into the boat.<eos> - No, there was some in when I bought it.<eos> - It's leaking.
Let's go catch that sailing boat!<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Watch this, sunshine.<eos> That is the fastest thing I've...<eos> Why is it faster than me?
You see, we liked it in the Caribbean.<eos> Our crews liked it in the Caribbean.<eos> So we thought it would be a good idea, next week, to make a film comparing the motoring cultures of the French, the Dutch and the British Islands.<eos> - Yeah, it was a great idea. - Brilliant idea.<eos> But Mr Wilman, our producer, he decided it wasn't a brilliant idea, and that, instead, we should go to northern France with three old cars and drive around in the rain.
Chicken is a vegetable.<eos> - It isn't. - It is.<eos> Scientifically, chicken is a vegetable.<eos> If you cut a chicken's head off it still runs around. There you go.<eos> Thereby proving it's not a sentient being, it's a higher-order vegetable.
Yes!<eos> No May?<eos> No, and there wouldn't be, because I was in another part of the port with my own travel plans.<eos> Last night, after the other two had gone to bed, I arranged for our company yacht to be waiting for me in the harbour.<eos> And there it is!
Let's get to the point which is, James May, you lost and you broke the company yacht.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Hang on a minute.<eos> My car got closer to England than yours did.<eos> Yes, but the other thing it got closest to was the bottom of the sea.
All of that is irrelevant because my car was the best, cos it didn't go wrong at all.<eos> Mine was perfectly reliable.<eos> Mine was as reliable as James's arms.<eos> And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.<eos> It fell off the back of a lorry.
Mine was perfectly reliable.<eos> Mine was as reliable as James's arms.<eos> And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.<eos> It fell off the back of a lorry.<eos> No-one can work out what fault it had that caused it to be on the lorry in the first place.
This is a new way of understanding the condition of being human.<eos> It is the last word in luxury.<eos> It's a very expensive statement, though.<eos> I mean, if you've got the money to buy that, you could buy the Jag and still have £130,000 to spend on a PR agent to put you on breakfast TV talking about how great you are.<eos> It costs £130,000 more for a reason.
Underneath is the same basic aluminium structure you find under a Jaguar XE, which is a fantastic car, so that's good.<eos> I do only get a 3L supercharged V6, which means 375 brake horsepower. That's 225 less than James's, let's be honest, leather-lined Audi Q7.<eos> But this is light, so it ain't no slouch.<eos> I like the way this thing handles itself.<eos> I like the way, when you change direction, when you turn, it controls its weight, what there is of it, across the axles. That makes it feel nimble, eager.
We're not that stupid.<eos> Just as if you leave the gate unlocked at the lion closure at a safari park, we don't all run in and have a picnic.<eos> In the last 15 years, Britain's economy has grown by 58%, whereas Germany's has grown by 102%.<eos> And that's because we're all doing 20 miles an hour and they're doing 200.<eos> Speed is good for business, and it saves lives as well.
The reboot completely wiped my memory stores.<eos> Android, can I try something? Okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Her neural link is a huge asset.<eos> It allows for total control over the ship, shields, navigation, weapons...
I've got an idea.<eos> --Six, over.<eos> --Yeah, go ahead.<eos> Jake says to top up the back tire.<eos> It might be a bit flat.
How much longer until it breaches the outer edges of the station?<eos> If the current rate of collapse continues, less than 30 minutes.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've doublechecked the reading.<eos> Whatever that white wall out there is, it's coming towards us.
Are you sure?<eos> I've doublechecked the reading.<eos> Whatever that white wall out there is, it's coming towards us.<eos> Well, we've got to move.<eos> Get the Blink Drive and get the hell outta here before it hits.
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
Why the hell would he go there?<eos> We're on our way.<eos> You should know.<eos> The anomaly is growing in intensity.<eos> It appears to be drawing power from the facility's fusion reactor.
My crewman, Boone, when he came to, he said it was a gateway.<eos> He also said he could hear voices in his head.<eos> I think maybe he can.<eos> He's had those things in him before.<eos> We managed to get it out, but what if it affected him?
Do you think you lost your faith, Father?<eos> Lose my faith?<eos> How could I?<eos> I've just seen a demon appear and the smoke rising from the pit to torment mankind just as it's written in Gospel.<eos> I'm not scared because I'm losing my faith. I'm scared because it's stronger than ever.
I've adjusted the grid fins.<eos> I reversed the thrusters.<eos> Damn it, what am I missing?<eos> Meditating isn't gonna help me land this stupid ship.<eos> No, but it might keep your brain from blowing up.
Great, so Cassandra and I will head to New York and you guys can go to South Carolina.<eos> No. I should probably go on my own.<eos> He can be a little touchy.<eos> Eve can't go anyway.<eos> I have a mission of my own and it takes precedence.
- Oh, yes.<eos> Last time we spoke, you were at the anger stage of grief.<eos> Now you've moved to bargaining.<eos> You can't really bargain with a tumor.<eos> So what if... it could remain a part of you but you could go on living?
You have to believe me.<eos> Let me prove it to you.<eos> - How?<eos> - The secret lab.<eos> If it's there, then we're telling the truth.
A butterfly will squeeze its way out of there soon.<eos> When I was a little boy, I was about your age, I saw one trying to get out.<eos> But it was having trouble, so I tried to help.<eos> Really carefully, I split open the casing and the butterfly came right out!<eos> But it couldn't fly.
A lot of people around here... Sacker, me... we were born with a place at the table.<eos> But you came to this job knowing what it means to be an outsider, and with the desperate fury of one.<eos> But you are still letting that fury use you instead of you using it.<eos> Right now, it's directed at me, which doesn't serve you at all.<eos> But refocused, channeled, it'll become a weapon... instead of a liability.
Axelrod lacks five of the eight virtues of the Bushido.<eos> Six.<eos> Oftentimes, he wasn't even polite.<eos> Under these circumstances, honor doesn't demand silence or self-harm.<eos> It demands vengeance.
Now, is that gonna come back and bite me?<eos> If you hadn't told me, could've ended your campaign, but I know how to spin it as a strong anti-bullying stance. By the time I'm finished with you, you'll be signing baseball bats every time you appear in public.<eos> Okay.<eos> My biggest potential vulnerability.<eos> Now it's in your hands.
No, it was a purposeful desecration of the man who beat and raped me.<eos> Well, they go with everything.<eos> Under Colonel Al-Saleh, the oppression of women has been growing year after year.<eos> Absolutely, and that is why this photo opportunity is so vital.<eos> - It sends a "Po-ent" message...
I suppose you'll be needing my plane?<eos> - Pretty please?<eos> - Well, when you say it like that.<eos> I wanna say something about my paella.<eos> Now, it is so good, when you taste it, what's gonna happen, Will?
- I do!<eos> Oh, well, there you go.<eos> So, what did you think of the manuscript?<eos> - It's rough, of course, but...<eos> - I think it's really interesting.
Thank you.<eos> - That was amazing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> As my father used to say,<eos> "If that speech was a horse, it'd be a unicorn."
- Absolutely.<eos> I mean, you should be honored that I would think your story was special enough to even consider using it.<eos> Did you really like it?<eos> It's actually... it's like what my daddy used to say.<eos> He used to say, "If that story was like a horse, it'd be a unicorn.
I mean, you should be honored that I would think your story was special enough to even consider using it.<eos> Did you really like it?<eos> It's actually... it's like what my daddy used to say.<eos> He used to say, "If that story was like a horse, it'd be a unicorn.<eos> 'Cause it was magical."
Listen, I've been down this road before.<eos> With a stroller?<eos> I'm just asking because that's how I push him around.<eos> This wedding isn't making it to the banquet hall.<eos> I don't even think it's making it to the car.
I'm-I'm always ending up there too.<eos> We want to formally invite you to a raging party.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You should invite them.<eos> It might be a raging party.
Got it.<eos> You know, I had this whole speech planned.<eos> It was funny and heartfelt, profound.<eos> But it feels like a waste if you're just gonna forget it anyway.<eos> Let's just agree it was brilliant.
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.
Sunny wants us to snatch the azra book from the widow.<eos> - Bajie... - Now, this is gonna be no easy task, my friend, but if we ever see azra... Bajie, I, I know where the book is.<eos> No shit.<eos> You should've just chipped in earlier.<eos> It's in the conservatory.
I won't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> Your blood is the one thing that can save us.<eos> My blood is a curse.<eos> It will, however, keep you from following me into the rain.
I have to put you under.<eos> What if you don't?<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> His liver just needs time.<eos> I mean, we're keeping him here as a precaution, but, uh, it should heal itself.
You've got to forgive yourself.<eos> Forgive yourself, Charlie.<eos> N-No. No!<eos> They should be alive!<eos> All your life, Charlie, you've been surrounded by death, and it's still coming for you.
The package of yours...<eos> it's squeaking or whistling.<eos> Who?<eos> The box.<eos> It's alive.
I hope so.<eos> Look at us pulling the truth out of each other, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you. Your aura...<eos> I think it is... sparkly, rainbows, pastels...
I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.<eos> I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days.<eos> You been working on this leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm left it off of Jane's body because it is a dud.<eos> Or maybe they realized it left them exposed.
- Place is nice, man.<eos> I saw the knife that killed Jones.<eos> The knife isn't yours, it's Freddy's.<eos> Patterson solved the leopard tattoo.<eos> It leads to Kat Jarrett.
So, all this for a dead end?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> We just need to show this photo to Roman.<eos> I'm not sure that's a good idea.<eos> No, the tattoo didn't point to Farrell, it points to Kat.
But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.<eos> Like becoming a dark web kingpin.<eos> Let he who is without sin...<eos> Please focus, Rich.<eos> This version of the formula... what's it for?
Him?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.
I want to know deliverance!<eos> Syphilis.<eos> The great pox.<eos> For a time I covered the guilty rash. And became quite artful with stage makeup, But now...<eos> Now it has his mind.
Get a house like this.<eos> Live the american dream.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't really cut out for suburban bliss.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No matter how you might have felt about your old life... It was better than this.
How's the mental state?<eos> She's good. Calm.<eos> I meant the husband.<eos> What the hell could this thing possibly be for?<eos> It's for rectal examinations.
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.<eos> Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play.<eos> It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good-- it is.
When?<eos> You know, 'cause they just, they... they make this too hard, man.<eos> It's just too damn hard.<eos> Next week, we're going back to that bar, and one way or another, we're getting our money back.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna take the life that I was supposed to have, instead of waiting for it to come and find me.
The artist initially agreed to let us run her photographs, but reneged at the last minute.<eos> Why did she decide to pull out?<eos> Okay, I just... I think this story is worth fighting for.<eos> It's click gold for us.<eos> It hits all of our boxes, no pun intended.
It's not what we discussed.<eos> I know. I, uh...<eos> I took a swing.<eos> You certainly did.<eos> It's excellent.
No, I'm not that hungry.<eos> And for you guys?<eos> Um, is there any specialties of the kitchen?<eos> The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our most popular dish.<eos> It's fantastic.
L-A-K-E...'<eos> Mr Huntley, are you refusing to 'cooperate with a lawful police investigation? '<eos> 'This is DS Arnott, please leave a message.'<eos> Sarge, we got a reg on the car.<eos> It belongs to a Nicholas Huntley - - Roz's husband.
Cottan's dying declaration, I want the full recording handed over to me.<eos> - Morning, Jan.<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Sir, my department operates under the protection of no reciprocity, as well you know.<eos> That part of the recording was released because it pertained to court proceedings.
Failing to break it.<eos> Roz Huntley's proved you're an ineffectual organisation.<eos> - A corrupt organisation.<eos> - Sir, I must protest!<eos> Do you know, Ted, my guess is that we don't know the half of Matthew Cottan's activities and the real reason you're keeping that full recording secret is because of the ammunition it'll give AC-12's critics.
The younger self. Is in dark contemplation about his future, About who he'll become.<eos> If you're interested, There are further examples of the same period. In the next room.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where can I find the abyssinian-ceramics collection?<eos> "I'm afraid it's out on loan."
I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.
There's still stuff to do before we shoot.<eos> - Are we shooting it here?<eos> - In this gray, depressing shithole?<eos> No. I'm going with Bash to look at a venue.<eos> It's expensive, but I'm not the one signing the checks, so...
- Yes.<eos> - Are you able to eat what you want to eat?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> They sometimes bring us airline food and they sometimes bring us, uh, Lebanese food,<eos> - and it's different, but it's delicious.
- I did not invite you.<eos> - I wanted to support women's sports.<eos> They gave me a new parking spot at work.<eos> My car's filthy.<eos> It's under a fig tree.
Oh, this is gonna be so awesome.<eos> Who would throw something like this away?<eos> Well, the net's a little ratty.<eos> What, are you kidding?<eos> It's in great shape.
I am still who I am!<eos> For now.<eos> All that power you had, Margaret.<eos> All that hard fought for power.<eos> Can you feel it all slipping through your fingers?
Is this... Am I dreaming?<eos> I, uh... I-I saw an ice cube, like a huge... Can you take me there?<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe what?<eos> Well, I was thinking about that door, and how it's there sometimes and not other times.
Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.
She didn't say she found her life unbearable, with a U.<eos> She said she found her life inbearable, with an I.<eos> That's not a word.<eos> Our situation isn't inbearable.<eos> It's unbearable.
What would you do?<eos> Send James back to kill him?<eos> He has an awful habit of creating the very problems he sets out to solve.<eos> Why did you abandon the Witness?<eos> He gave me a purpose, but it was a lie.
_<eos> Here.<eos> Finally putting in that pool?<eos> Do we need this wall?<eos> It's load bearing, so yes.
Anyone we know?<eos> And more to the point... any that look like me?<eos> That's the problem with being Primary.<eos> You're connected to time, but it won't let you see the whole puzzle.<eos> It just keeps moving and changing.
He said every german. Needs to see the city of lights at least once,<eos> So he arranged me an invitation.<eos> We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.<eos> I don't like vodka...<eos> It burns my throat.
It's just how I've come to think about it, if anyone can just come and go.<eos> Isn't that a little sad?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> It's like the soul, you know?<eos> No one knows for sure. Does it exist?
I've been looking everywhere.<eos> You shouldn't be here, Monty.<eos> None of us should be here.<eos> You know why that moon's red?<eos> It's really red?
Doesn't get more legitimate than that.<eos> Mossad carried out a black op on American soil.<eos> If the FBI finds out about it, it will be an international incident.<eos> - Where's the system?<eos> - It's here.
Mr. Maddox was just convenient.<eos> The NMB's money bought them someone much higher up the food chain.<eos> I promised them a teleguidance system capable of getting past the Iron Dome.<eos> After six months of work, I do not intend to start over.<eos> So... where is it?
What about Mossad? You guys know Arkani's building a bomb, but you don't know whether he's got a safe house nearby?<eos> No.<eos> And it's not a bomb.<eos> It's a missile guidance system designed to defeat the Iron Dome.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could jeopardize the lives of thousands.
No.<eos> And it's not a bomb.<eos> It's a missile guidance system designed to defeat the Iron Dome.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could jeopardize the lives of thousands.<eos> Then I'll feel better when it's in my hands.
I'm sure it'll get ironed out.<eos> I'll admit it, I'm surprised.<eos> Not much shocks me, but this is a right old turn-up for the books.<eos> We've retrieved a bullet from the body.<eos> It matches the calibre of revolver that you had in your possession - a revolver that was recently fired.
Thank you, sir.<eos> And, er, once again... ..congratulations.<eos> Are you sure you want me to pursue this?<eos> Perhaps it's better left to someone else.<eos> I want to follow the truth, no matter where it leads.
But there's nothing here that suggests Florence Lesser was murdered.<eos> What?<eos> The miniature newspaper.<eos> Whatever's in there is the key.<eos> And I think I know where it is.
And I think I know where it is.<eos> My umbrella!<eos> What do you hope to find?<eos> The miniature newspaper, sir.<eos> Where is it?
Victim of a broken heart.<eos> But then that idiot husband of mine started to play the protective house owner.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you all right back there?<eos> When a butterfly needs to break out of its chrysalis, it needs to find the weakest point.
I'm stuck, and I'm having trouble moving forward.<eos> What do you think is holding you back? What do you think is holding you back?<eos> I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.
What do you think is holding you back? What do you think is holding you back?<eos> I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.<eos> It weakens us.
No.<eos> Better yet... no more suspensions.<eos> I am doing my best here, but you are not helping.<eos> Well, I can't just allow insubordination.<eos> No. You can't make my job even more difficult than it already is.
No, no. I'm...<eos> I'm holding it, I'm holding it.<eos> Put it back on ice.<eos> The mom's remaining kidney thrombosed.<eos> It's dead.
And they shouldn't.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> You busy?<eos> Yes, I was just about to paint a wall and watch it dry.
A flash drive.<eos> Did it look like this?<eos> It did.<eos> And when we inserted this flash drive into our computers, what happened?<eos> It introduced the malware into our system.
How did I not see this in the bank statements?<eos> Why would I put money that I might need to run away with in the middle of night in the bank?<eos> I put it in my disappear bag.<eos> It's hard not to take that personally, but, um, where is this bag?<eos> It's in... in...
They would like to have it destroyed.<eos> Let-let me, uh, see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like.<eos> Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, rather than see it driven by its rightful owner, they want to bring it to the dump and flatten it.<eos> Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.<eos> It's half his.
- Yeah.<eos> Well... free to stand trial for murdering Margaret.<eos> Oh. We also need to find that trekking pole.<eos> If we don't, the prosecutor is going to claim that you got rid of it after you used it to kill Margaret.<eos> Any idea where it could be?
- Let's start there.<eos> - Here's what we know.<eos> Rutger ate Josh's whitefish.<eos> Wait. That squiggle is the fish?<eos> Put waves up above so we know it's underwater.
Come on.<eos> I'm listening, I promise.<eos> No more earbuds.<eos> Okay, Trixie might get into this private school, and it could be really, really good for her.<eos> But it's super exclusive, and I'm not sure that I want her in that kind of environment.
- Right.<eos> It's misshapen. That's all that matters.<eos> All right, here's the plan...<eos> We stage a fight.<eos> It escalates, and I flip over the table in dramatic fashion.
I'd like an MRI next.<eos> Do you have any idea how expensive that scan is?<eos> I have Obamacare, I have a year left, and I'm us...<eos> Look, an MRI wouldn't hurt.<eos> It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.
If it's in her esophagus, the chances are it's also invaded her spine.<eos> You'd risk paralysis if you tried to take it out.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can at least remove the tumor from the heart itself... relieve some of the symptoms.<eos> I mean, it'll grow back, but it'll be slow-growing... buy her some time.
Daddy!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Nathalie showed me a snake!<eos> - It was a larva.<eos> - She said that it's gonna turn into a beautiful moth someday.
Look, no matter what happens, you don't let me out of these things, okay, no matter how bad it gets.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you, Link.<eos> I want to thank you for your sacrifice.<eos> I want you to know it will not be in vain.
She just laughed, and she said, "We'll see about that."<eos> That night, she took the boy in the cell across from mine.<eos> She dragged him to her tower, where she whipped him.<eos> I could hear his cries echo through the halls, begging for someone to stop her.<eos> I reached out to the door of my cell, and it was open.
People suck.<eos> What I'm saying is, Koreatown has both a rich complex history and unique political challenges.<eos> That's what you've been saying, and saying.<eos> And, look, I could listen to you talk about redistricting all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us, it's not gonna track down itself, so if we could just...<eos> Point is, I requested some help for you guys, and it just came through.
Don't you get it, man?<eos> Your impulse was a reality scar working on your subconscious.<eos> Reality scar.<eos> So, what does this fun gun do?<eos> Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.
So, what does this fun gun do?<eos> Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.<eos> "Control-Z"?<eos> Like an undo command on a computer.<eos> Well, I was gonna try the new version on my latest test subject, but then I was worried it might melt his brain.
A Sumerian alabaster statue.<eos> 5000 years old.<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> I leave it on your table.<eos> It is very beautiful.
With a Trojan to infect the system files.<eos> I'm clumsy, but I learn fast.<eos> And the negative view?<eos> Some day we will not have luck.<eos> It will crack and spoil everything.
I repeat the question.<eos> What doctor?<eos> In the endocrine.<eos> I have a brain tumor.<eos> It is not a malignant tumor, but...
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go get the clothes and go down to the laundry room.<eos> Follow-up question.<eos> It's in the basement.
- I don't know how this thing works.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's more of a...<eos> It's more of a sweeping motion.
What's that?<eos> That... is my theme tune.<eos> Otherwise known as a distress call.<eos> You like distress calls?<eos> You only really see the true face of the universe when it's asking for your help.
Dying well.<eos> No... - No! - What is it?<eos> Our life signs.<eos> He's wired them to the coolant system.<eos> If we die, it vents.
Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".
The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!
So stupid.<eos> It's this.<eos> I make that sound a lot 'cause no one will high-five me.<eos> Sure, but philosophy's so much more than that.<eos> It teaches you how to really think.
Last year, I went climbing in Canada...<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> But your card is not welcome.<eos> What?<eos> It is reject. Bad.
"carved in the trenches of Arras." £300!<eos> 300?<eos> Well, I have always said I thought that oil lamp rather... ugly.<eos> Clearly, you don't love her enough!<eos> Be careful with that, it's Roman.
Be careful with that, it's Roman.<eos> I was wondering if it mightn't date from around the same time they found all those coins at Chedworth?<eos> We're engravers, not an auction house.<eos> If you want it cleaned, it's one and six.<eos> It's in lovely condition.
We're like The Flintstones.<eos> There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3.<eos> It would save you a lot of time.<eos> M-Maybe I could pitch that to my boss, if I knew what I was talking about.<eos> I can show you how it works.
The public is ordered to stay off the roads and take cover.<eos> Hey, there's, uh... there's flooding.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - In the kitchen. Uh, there's water everywhere.<eos> It's spreading.
Death is a big turnoff for me.<eos> I like them young and alive.<eos> Don't forget this.<eos> You're sure the stuff is good?<eos> Well, I didn't test it, because that would defeat the purpose of recovery, but yeah, it's good;
No, I'm not gonna sign this!<eos> Jesus! You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.
Jesus! You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It actually does work now. - It does.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> The rocket, it's not going to explode with us in it.
Not yet.<eos> Who knows what the AIC is gonna do with whatever you gave them.<eos> You think it's just information.<eos> It could be complete misdirection.<eos> Who knows what doors it's gonna unlock.
Caving a security guard's skull in for a baseball card is grotesque, if you ask me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> Please, Mr. Charles, if you keep swearing you're innocent, it's only gonna be worse for you when we find the stolen merchandise in your car, in your house or wherever.<eos> So why don't you just tell us where it is?
Come here, come here.<eos> There, you all right?<eos> You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.
You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.<eos> We were wrong.<eos> It was Ryan's.
I can't stop thinking about M.K.<eos> and Cosima out there all alone.<eos> Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.<eos> Hey, your life isn't ruined.<eos> It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
You've been wonderful.<eos> I'm just happy to have this choice.<eos> Edward was a scientist.<eos> He always used to tell me, Energy is not created or destroyed.<eos> It just is.
There is beauty in the inevitable.<eos> This car smells like cherries.<eos> Can we keep it?<eos> No, honey.<eos> It's a rental.
Hi, naomi.<eos> My mom just wanted to say thank you. For letting me stay over this weekend.<eos> No problem.<eos> Sweet ride.<eos> It's a rental.
I don't want to look at you.<eos> I don't... I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because I want to help you, because I love you.<eos> I'm so sick of people talking about love when they have no idea what it means.
Caspar's been known to change hotels if the carpet upsets him.<eos> Er, what are you working on?<eos> A redesign of a perfect flat in Limehouse.<eos> All my work gets undone.<eos> I mean, if you heal a dog, right, it stays healed.
The home-filtration system your department is now buying for everyone in the city.<eos> Strange you didn't disclose you own the patent.<eos> Your Ph.D. is in materials engineering.<eos> Before entering the public sector, you tried your hand at entrepreneurship.<eos> The water-filtration system that you developed, however, failed to find a niche. It was, it was too pricey for the average consumer, and it was not quite the high-end system which attracts larger institutions.
- That's...<eos> - Stupid, is it stupid?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Brilliant, Josh.<eos> I think you just invented democracy, and it's going to save Fillory.
Definitely.<eos> Um, Mitchell is on a diet, speaking of hunger.<eos> What can you eat now?<eos> less.<eos> Sweetie, I see what you're doing, but this whole controlling thing... it's challenging.
My minister murdered.<eos> His wife slain.<eos> The killer dead by her own hand.<eos> And still the contagion spreads.<eos> It is in my walls.
His wife slain.<eos> The killer dead by her own hand.<eos> And still the contagion spreads.<eos> It is in my walls.<eos> It is in my blood and in my mind.
Say it.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> Certainly.<eos> ♪ Ma tu davvero puoi... ♪ Song's really pretty.<eos> Mm-hmm. Can you tell me what it means?
Don't.<eos> What?<eos> The little shrinky smile thing that you do; Don't do it.<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.
What's dormant?<eos> The pyramid.<eos> We are keeping it under observation.<eos> Why?<eos> What's it been doing?
Just jump straight to all the explaining.<eos> It's the Doctor.<eos> 'OK found it, lab in Yorkshire.'<eos> Long story, short - misplaced decimal point, resulting in a bacteria that turns any living thing it touches into gunk.<eos> So why is it going to end the world?
We give him two minutes and we're heading in.<eos> Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.
Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> We have an air filtration system to take toxins out of the air.<eos> It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.<eos> It's going to pump the bacteria into the atmosphere.
I hope to make it there sometime in the future, too.<eos> _<eos> That's right.<eos> A wonderful day... all planned.<eos> The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of... I think... very great.
We're leaving.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You lied.<eos> You hijacked our vacation.<eos> This family has a tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.
Dr. Smith, you may remember Dr. Chakrabarti, our pathologist.<eos> He's former CDC, we asked him to sit in and translate any science-speak.<eos> I don't think you'll need much translating.<eos> In a month's time, Seattle is looking at a death toll in the tens of thousands.<eos> The strain has mutated rapidly, and it's resistant to antivirals.
With over a billion intelligent species active in this galaxy alone, it is an ever-greater challenge to know how to kill all of them.<eos> On this planet, we are proud to serve as executioners to every living thing.<eos> The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.

Mr. McDuck...<eos> An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.<eos> Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?<eos> That bauble?<eos> That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
Guy needed a moment to say goodbye to his entire comic book collection.<eos> We just had a few more questions.<eos> Starting with, why is Dan's missing cover art here, for sale?<eos> This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, hero of the Ogden Twiddlyhut series, has ever appeared in print.<eos> And who says it's missing?
Assuming he's got a CD player.<eos> He's probably got a cassette player in his Golf GTI.<eos> Actually, May couldn't have been more wrong.<eos> This car may be from the past, but check this out.<eos> It's accelerating now, you can probably hear that, but I'm not doing it.
- You only get £4,500.<eos> - How will people cope?<eos> I think what we've done there is prove his car is not really worth buying just yet.<eos> - Don't argue. It isn't.<eos> It's not quite finished.
- It's not that now, is it?<eos> - It is unbelievable, that.<eos> Do you know, this shirt is older than everything you can see out of that window.<eos> James, that shirt is older than Carthage, mate. Look at it.<eos> It is getting on a bit.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - But do it first thing in the morning.<eos> It's getting on.<eos> We should call it a day.<eos> I'd also like to pop into the library before it closes, get a copy of The Flame Tree to read, but if anyone fancies a beer after I've done that...
Me?<eos> Yes, what did you make of it when you first read it?<eos> Well...<eos> You know...<eos> It's... richly evocative.
For someone so practised at forging signatures, it wouldn't be difficult to forge Esther's handwriting.<eos> I'm sure it would've been easy enough to lay your hands on a copy of Esther's signature.<eos> And then, all you had to do was slip the faked suicide note into her handbag -- after you'd killed her.<eos> But as clever as it was, that suicide note was also your undoing.<eos> That it was a typed note meant that it somehow lacked credibility.
None of us will be leaving without the clearance codes to this ship.<eos> I hadn't thought of that.<eos> And I'm afraid there's another complication.<eos> I've just learned that Thrawn is very close to locating your base.<eos> - You have to tell me where it is.
No way!<eos> You'll find out when we get there.<eos> Not if Thrawn destroys it first.<eos> I need to know its location so I can remove it from his database.<eos> If it's even on his list.
Look, Emily.<eos> I trust you.<eos> If you really think that I should do this commercial, I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> Because it's terrible.
All right, but seriously, she can't ride in my chopper.<eos> Jackie, can you come in here, please?<eos> You wanted something?<eos> No... but an overweight man in Ohio wants that shirt back.<eos> It's from Talbots.
And I understood, Claire, that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.<eos> Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House... it's about who owns the White House.<eos> This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.
Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House... it's about who owns the White House.<eos> This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.<eos> It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.
Actually, don't tell me.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> So, did you wind up sending that machine back?<eos> I did.<eos> You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.
I want to be surprised.<eos> So, did you wind up sending that machine back?<eos> I did.<eos> You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.<eos> I took it to the train store-- it said everyone was sad.
You know, this lot are a tenacious bunch, they're sure to find out.<eos> All right - - I haven't got anything to hide.<eos> Tom was a brilliant sailor, he really was, but one day, he went out when a storm was forecast.<eos> And he took his son. His eight-year-old son.<eos> And when the storm hit, it was much bigger than he expected.
Sir?<eos> So... the Inspector was right.<eos> After he killed Tom Lewis, Frank Henderson made his way down here and hid in that compartment.<eos> And stayed there all the time we were searching the boat.<eos> Until it was back in the harbour and safe to make his escape.
We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> This magic can reunite anyone who shares true love.<eos> It can open a door to Hook.
James Weckler had a safe deposit box.<eos> I convinced Tatum to let me come along when she opened it.<eos> Guess what was inside?<eos> The memory card Weckler stole from Roxanne's hidden camera.<eos> It was recording when he killed her.
In cold blood.<eos> Leaving your son to set the scene to make it look like a suicide.<eos> I imagine that's when Steve took Frank's cufflink.<eos> But your plan required one final flourish.<eos> After all, why would a passing cleaner say that a room was locked when it wasn't?
- Damn it.<eos> - No sign of the laptop.<eos> What were we doing here?<eos> - Look, there's Jake's shirt.<eos> - It looks burnt.
- Workout your legs, Jeffrey.<eos> - Not your mouth.<eos> You are hilarious.<eos> I am so psyched for your presentation to the board.<eos> - I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.
- Fast forward.<eos> - Did you guys see that?<eos> He put the bag down behind the plant.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Is it there?
He put the bag down behind the plant.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Is it there?<eos> Is it there?<eos> - It's here! - We did it!
Wait, are you saying he put the gun...<eos> You don't need an interrogation to prove that he's guilty.<eos> You, uh, just need a pair of these.<eos> God, we thank you for the life that you give us.<eos> It is full of work and of responsibility, of sorrow and of joy.
I wanted you to know that I'm getting married.<eos> Well, that's wonderful.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I would love for you to come to the wedding.<eos> When is it?
For the longest time, I've been perfectly comfortable knowing I could die at any moment. I could walk out of this room and be shot in the street.<eos> I've always been fine with that.<eos> But lately, I can smell it in the air around me.<eos> Like death is... slouching towards me from the corners of the room.<eos> And I cannot tell if it is here for me.
He had some trouble in the woods last night.<eos> Nothing life threatening.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> But that thing is attacking us.<eos> It's attacking us near our home now.
Lock the door behind me.<eos> - The roof...<eos> Red. Roof, red.<eos> - What?<eos> It was red.
I can't say that, Nathaniel.<eos> Because I don't want to go back to 1942.<eos> I know that I'm supposed to.<eos> I know I have a destiny and that we shouldn't damage time any more than we already have, but I have to believe that time is stronger than that.<eos> And that if I have a destiny, it'll wait for me.
When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Our friend Calvin was trying to jump up and pull down a fire escape ladder.<eos> He grabbed it, but it, like, shot down on him.
- Doc, we have.<eos> In blood.<eos> Black Badge owns us, and if they find Dolls, they'll shoot him on sight.<eos> Wynonna, I was supposed to make the drop two days ago.<eos> It ain't ready.
They can be, so much more.<eos> My magic?<eos> What about yours?<eos> Darling, don't you see?<eos> Your magic is useful because it's unstable.
So, what now?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Ready? Yes.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That thing... It was draining my magic.
Overload.<eos> It was initiated last September.<eos> We got over 1,000 hours of manpower on this case so far.<eos> So I understand, the ATF didn't deconflict this operation with CPD or any other agency?<eos> No-no-no, it's classified deep cover.
Uh, actually, Commander Crowley wants you to report to the 27th District.<eos> They need bodies for their third shifts.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> - Are you being serious right now?<eos> - It's what's open.
Really?<eos> How'd that go?<eos> - It went.<eos> Did you notice these tire marks?<eos> And this little scrape on the ground; It's almost like it came from something on the vehicle.
Let's just go over your expenses.<eos> How much is your rent?<eos> I don't want to say.<eos> Is it really that high?<eos> I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.
That's exactly what they expect.<eos> I mean, you gotta fight it with kittens or mercury or the concept of time.<eos> Caleb's right.<eos> These people are unpredictable.<eos> Your strategy was helpful for a while, but if it isn't helpful anymore, then we should change tack.
Thank you, todd.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now, would anybody else like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, i'd like to.<eos> Every time hope comes into my life, it dies.
Hello?<eos> Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.
Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.<eos> You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla.<eos> Maybe I was onto something.<eos> Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.<eos> Unless it was singing "Be Our Guest," I doubt it.
Are we still talking about the spoon?<eos> It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.<eos> Well, don't get me wrong.<eos> Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff.<eos> But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.
I don't know, check your body for tattoos?<eos> Leonard, would you be a lamb... She's kidding!<eos> Wait, wait. Where's my bag?<eos> My phone and my wallet are in my bag.<eos> It's right here.
Great.<eos> Um, did you miss anything this weekend?<eos> What?<eos> The conference.<eos> It seemed like it was important to you.
Voicemail?<eos> Lucado, pick up the phone!<eos> Maybe try Jeremy again?<eos> How long before this thing eats its way out of the can?<eos> Pretty sure if I get off, it's gonna eat its way through me!
Bag that thing and, well, Jeremy knows what to do. Okay?<eos> She... she didn't have any questions.<eos> Yes, I have one.<eos> Did smashing all those demon eggs make you wet?<eos> Well, I like my job, but it hasn't bought me dinner in a really long time.
- Fight it.<eos> - It... it... it won't... won't let me.<eos> - Waverly...<eos> - Wynonna!<eos> Remember when you made me drink grape soda 'til it came out of my nose?
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?<eos> Oh, don't worry about it. I'm fine.<eos> Monty:<eos> I got that thing as a gift, and I'm trying to find some use for it.<eos> Let me tell you, it's not even useful as a doorstop.
Yeah.<eos> You know all your stuff's getting damp?<eos> The people who had the house before me said they damp-proofed it in the '90s.<eos> That's the problem with water, especially under the ground, you know, in a house like this.<eos> - It finds a way of getting back in.
The point is, Helen knew that the Deutschemark meant I was with her.<eos> She wasn't alone.<eos> It's a coin, Owen.<eos> That no one, not Maxwell Fletcher or Alice Winter, would notice.<eos> And it will remind you you're not alone until the day you won't need it anymore.
Sandstorm, they might be controlling the building, but they don't know it as well as I do.<eos> There's a sub-basement beneath the bottom floor.<eos> In a maintenance elevator.<eos> Back in the '80s, the city started construction to extend the N line.<eos> It went underneath what's now the NYO.
- No.<eos> It was part of it.<eos> Shepherd is putting each and every one of us in this room to become the successors to a government she believes is corrupt, a government that she's about to destroy.<eos> The attack on this country isn't over.<eos> It's just beginning.
It's a matter of national security, sir.<eos> It is our sworn duty to remain in this bunker until otherwise notified.<eos> We alone become the successors to the United States government.<eos> The attack on this country isn't over.<eos> It's just beginning.
- They're all just taking a break.<eos> Why is nobody breaking in the new break room?<eos> - 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.
Whoa, look at that map work.<eos> Sick as heck.<eos> - Oh an attempt at flattery.<eos> - Well, it won't work.<eos> This was Boyle's map, and it was adequate at best.
- Oh. You still changed a tire.<eos> Counting this as a win.<eos> - Okay, you're right about the break room.<eos> - Nuh doy.<eos> - Nobody liked it, and it wasn't functional.
- So based on these phone records, we think Ocampo is definitely still in Brooklyn.<eos> Is it true you still have a bullet lodged in your hip from your shootout with the Canarsie Killer?<eos> - No.<eos> - Darn.<eos> - It's in my jaw.
- And it was a real jerk move!<eos> - Santiago!<eos> You did it!<eos> - And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.<eos> It's too loud!
Where'd you find a steering wheel?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> I had a Frisbee in the trunk, and I taped it on.<eos> That's right.<eos> I MacGyvered the donk out of this thing, and it worked flawlessly.
Do not be ashamed, okay?<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> What you are doing is proactive. - Checking to see if you can reproduce even when you have no intention of doing so anytime in the near future, that shows maturity.<eos> Yeah, listen, honey, I gotta tell you,<eos> I really appreciate the support. It means a lot to me.
Were you raised in a prison?<eos> Van, did you know I'm the only Senior Vice President in this building who doesn't have a real office?<eos> Emily, you thrive in the cubicles.<eos> You're like a tropical fish that lives in the coral reef, but if you took that fish out, and gave it its own office...<eos> - it would die.
This does not concern you.<eos> There is no hope.<eos> No!<eos> Hope lives.<eos> It is everywhere.
'Cause she knows I have a writing staff and a focus group.<eos> There should be credits at the end of this fucking e-mail.<eos> Approved by mother and sister.<eos> I don't know. Love is worth it, though. It really is.<eos> It's worth it. It is.
I'd like to have a big, tall boyfriend.<eos> That's my boyfriend.<eos> I'm mad at my boyfriend. [audience laughing]<eos> I get to wear his jacket.<eos> It's all big on me.
Had a little bit of an accident, truth be told.<eos> I was a bit sick... if truth be told, but I'm fine.<eos> She threw up over it, she couldn't wear it.<eos> Was better out than in, love.<eos> - It went right down...
Any word from Black Badge lately?<eos> Eventually you and your boys are going to have to get in the game, because neutral men are the devil's allies.<eos> And brother .the devil's coming.<eos> Highway 62, there's an abandoned chapel.<eos> It's right near Juan Carlo's chop shop.
There's no time.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sooner than expected, damn her.<eos> She's looking for the third seal.<eos> I don't have it, nor do I know where it is.
When they raise their dead demon husband, she would be there to help us put him back where he belongs.<eos> After everything Wynonna's done to get that seal... how could I?<eos> You can say I made you.<eos> I ordered you.<eos> I don't even know where it is.
God damn it, Oliver, I told you-- - Mike, relax.<eos> It's over.<eos> The bluff worked.<eos> What do you mean, it worked?<eos> I got a number, and it's good.
Here's your company ID.<eos> Make sure they spelled everything correctly.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Company credit card.<eos> Company telephone. Keys to your company car.<eos> It's a Honda, in Section H, Westside of the lot.
Who the fuck are these people?<eos> I don't know, Leandra.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> This job...<eos> What is it?
Your corn.<eos> Where's your corn?<eos> Field's picked clean.<eos> Oh, yeah. We picked it.<eos> So where is it?
And the apnea reflex test.<eos> I think I found the problem, doctor Palmer.<eos> You left a bullet in his head.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's impinging on the medulla.
How do we do that?<eos> Where do we start?<eos> - Don't like that map?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> It's really good.
Well, it's not really a...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Kevin. Hi, can you answer the phone, please?<eos> -I can't.<eos> It's in the fish tank.
Please, follow me.<eos> Right away. Please, all of you.<eos> Fernando was down here when something crawled out of a wall vent, and...<eos> I heard him screaming, so I went to check, and that's when the "thing" was tossing Fernando all around the room.<eos> I thought it was gonna kill him.
What's "ley lines"?<eos> It's a hidden network of energy lines that run across the Earth.<eos> It's a current of supernatural energy.<eos> Supposedly, if you look at sacred sites and weird events all over the world, and connect them with lines where they intersect, it's an unusually powerful spot.<eos> Abby and I just dismissed this theory because it just seemed too random to have any merit.
You know what?<eos> I want to make a toast.<eos> -Here we go.<eos> -Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.
I want to make a toast.<eos> -Here we go.<eos> -Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it cannot answer the essential question of what is our purpose here.
The slider guy.<eos> Please blink, so I know you're in there.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - God.<eos> I just have blood pumping through my body in an uncomfortable way and it feels like it's all accumulating right here.
Sorry, "the Prince."<eos> "Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..."<eos> Oh, that's rich.<eos> How does the story end?<eos> I'll tell you how it ends.
I don't feel alone.<eos> We weren't supposed to find each other.<eos> But we did.<eos> He makes me feel like my life isn't over.<eos> Like it's just beginning.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself... into men of extraordinary abilities.<eos> But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly...<eos> Wrong.<eos> I'm injecting you with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.<eos> For it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress.
I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.<eos> You sadistic fuck!<eos> I've cured you, Wade.<eos> Now your mutated cells can heal anything.<eos> It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form.
He wants me to clear my conscience and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.<eos> Robert. What I did to you at that rally in senior year was a cowardly act.<eos> It's something that I've regretted every single day.<eos> Yeah. I mean, bullying is a national crisis.<eos> It can leave people with a lifetime of pain.
Okay, listen, listen.<eos> I've been a fool.<eos> All right?<eos> I thought that my life was a failure.<eos> I thought that it wasn't special.
- No, wait a minute.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Dude, where'd you get this from?<eos> Well, I sleep in it most nights, but it's clean now, totally good.
It just feels like it's really deep and it hurts.<eos> No, it's not bad at all.<eos> I just gotta clean it.<eos> Lisa, do you mind gettin' my first-aid kit?<eos> - It's in my bag over there.
You know, that's what Jack called all this.<eos> When he saw what we were spending, he said,<eos> "your little vanity project "is going to bankrupt the federal government."<eos> People need their history.<eos> It gives them strength.
Every quote out of Jack's mouth was either Greek or Roman.<eos> And that last song, that last side of Camelot, is all that keeps running through my mind.<eos> "Don't let it be forgot, "that for one brief, "shining moment there was a Camelot."<eos> Jack loved history.<eos> It's what made him what he was.
And you?<eos> Do you believe you did him justice?<eos> I believe that the characters we read about on the page end up being more real than the men who stand beside us.<eos> I should have guessed it was too much to ask that we grow old together, see our children grow up.<eos> The darkness may never go away, but it won't always be this heavy.
- Just stay calm and don't panic.<eos> This thing is trying to eat me, and your advice is not to panic!<eos> Looks like they're mobilizing.<eos> David, please tell me this isn't some kind of a Trojan horse.<eos> I don't think it's a danger to us.
This thing is trying to eat me, and your advice is not to panic!<eos> Looks like they're mobilizing.<eos> David, please tell me this isn't some kind of a Trojan horse.<eos> I don't think it's a danger to us.<eos> But it must be to them.
- I got you! Hold on!<eos> Hold on!<eos> - I can't hold on!<eos> My little glove!<eos> It's slipping off!
I'm a badass motherfucker, dude.<eos> I'm going to take a piss.<eos> Do you know what this song is about, Michael?<eos> Then I will tell you.<eos> It is about two lovers betrayed by the secrets they keep for others. And they must choose. Exile or death.
Nadine.<eos> Nadine. Hmm? Hmm?<eos> Hey, wake up.<eos> You had a brain operation.<eos> It worked.
Everyone just wants to feel important in life.<eos> Thing is, no matter how important they are, there's always gonna be someone more important.<eos> People get so uptight about that. Oh, no, they're better than me.<eos> It's like, god, they don't realize important doesn't matter.<eos> It's confidence. When confidence breaks into the room... It wins every single time.
The insurgency is mostly remnants of the military dictatorship that ran this place until about two months ago.<eos> And their popular support is primarily in the north part of the country... near the Russian border, and here in the capital.<eos> The problem is their forces are well-trained. They're threatening to turn this whole thing into a civil war.<eos> [indistinct chattering] Moldova.<eos> Russians had it, lost it. It became independent, but it's struggling internally.
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.<eos> - I almost forgot.<eos> Here. - Do I need a crowbar?<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> It's mine.
Our future.<eos> The best and brightest vision of who we are and what we're fighting for.<eos> Our intelligence tells us the Others are readying themselves for a final attack.<eos> The 5th Wave.<eos> What form it will take, we do not know.
I saved you.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> They're wrong.<eos> Love's not a trick.<eos> It's real.
- You're in good hands.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna wanna keep your hands away from the head, 'cause it can actually still bite you.
Father...<eos> I noticed the tower.<eos> Impressive.<eos> I built it for you.<eos> If it were any taller, it would be in my way.
I used to think this was the beginning of your story.<eos> Memory is a strange thing.<eos> It doesn't work like I thought it did.
Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> How is it more complicated than that?<eos> Colonel, the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you.<eos> We need to sit on this information till we know what it means.
They've made no act of aggression towards us.<eos> Maybe this is their way of being aggressive.<eos> That's not the question.<eos> Well, what is the question?<eos> How do we get you back in that room when it's half a mile straight up?
Give him a chance to catch his breath.<eos> It should be noted in the logbook.<eos> I report everything immediately.<eos> What if the boat belongs to a boat?<eos> It is a boat, not a lifeboat.
-So brave.<eos> -I knew she'd help us.<eos> Where exactly is this chronosphere?<eos> In the hands of time.<eos> It's his.
Rose wants to hold on to you all.<eos> She loves you.<eos> Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.<eos> Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.<eos> Where's it at?
I done learned a whole heap of things about life watching you.<eos> I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.<eos> How to tell it from the alfalfa.<eos> You done learned me a lot of things.<eos> Showed me how to not make the same mistakes. To take life as it come along, keep putting one foot in front of the other.
Throw it with your arm, you lazy weirdo!<eos> I would not fetch that.<eos> I'm old-school.<eos> Thanks a lot, Duke.<eos> I don't like to use this phrase because it's offensive to our kind, but you are a bad dog!
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!<eos> You laid it all out beautifully.<eos> What?<eos> Are you looking for the serum?<eos> Well, it's right here.
What do you want with this girl and her family?<eos> It says it won't talk, if you all are looking at me like this.<eos> Strange!<eos> I wonder why not?<eos> It hasn't been shy of talking up until now.
Do you think you could give me a ride home?<eos> I don't live too far away.<eos> But it was kind of a scary walk in the dark.<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> It doesn't run.
Mama.<eos> How does this story begin?<eos> It begins like so many stories
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?<eos> There's still loads of time.<eos> As destruction goes, that was remarkably pitiful.<eos> Now, I've come to tell you the second tale.<eos> Is it as bad as the last one?
There's still loads of time.<eos> As destruction goes, that was remarkably pitiful.<eos> Now, I've come to tell you the second tale.<eos> Is it as bad as the last one?<eos> It ends with proper destruction, if that's what you mean.
And she still is.<eos> And we were in love.<eos> I mean, I still love her.<eos> But you will see that... love isn't enough.<eos> It doesn't carry you through.
The universe A vast expanse of space and matter.<eos> It includes everything we see and everything we know.
The universe A vast expanse of space and matter.<eos> It includes everything we see and everything we know.<eos> Since the beginning of time, we wonder how it came to be...
It is jaundiced, but it will be fine.<eos> Go, yes!<eos> I think I'll call...<eos> Bronwyn!<eos> Friend, we have to save the world while it still exists.
In the time it took her to sing that lullaby she learned to speak fluent French.<eos> Do you know that song...?<eos> - Is there an echo box up here? - Why do you ask?<eos> Someone's scanning data traffic.<eos> Trace where it's transmitting.
You were reckless out there.<eos> Completely destroyed a motorcycle, which you stole.<eos> I didn't steal that.<eos> I commandeered it, okay?<eos> Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.
The quarry? Mmm.<eos> It's where all this comes from, the wealth of the family.<eos> The stone was once highly prized.<eos> Was?<eos> She allowed it to flood at the beginning of the War.
Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> I wasn't controlling it.<eos> Here.<eos> It was controlling me.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
I guess she came to work for me... when she was 17.<eos> 16, maybe.<eos> Let's us decide what's right now.<eos> - What do you think of this world?<eos> - It's its own.
We have to destroy the stone.<eos> What?<eos> No stone, no ritual. No ritual...<eos> - ... No curse. - Yes.<eos> I know where it is.
I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.<eos> Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man.<eos> I fix the demon, Etrigan.<eos> It was also the beginning of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.<eos> I didn't think you'd give it up willingly, and though this piece is useless without the other half, it's far from powerless.

- What's happening?<eos> - If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.
You know what? At some point, I would have to go home alone.<eos> I am 14 years old.<eos> I'm not there, love.<eos> The neighborhood no longer existed 40 years ago.<eos> True, it has become safer and more sophisticated.
I will not go back to your table.<eos> Do not leave an ink-stamp with coins.<eos> I'm not a washing machine.<eos> I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.<eos> It's a good place to hack it like anywhere else.
I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.<eos> It's a good place to hack it like anywhere else.<eos> Well, how do we start?<eos> Contact the man who deals with him My previous month.<eos> Why will it help us?
Outreach programmes to inspire children in school to think outside the box.<eos> To inspire in them a belief that...<eos> Yes, they can.<eos> There was a time when this port served thousands of ships around the globe.<eos> Now it can rise again.
To the east wing.<eos> Or as I like to call it, the only wing.<eos> Watch your step, s'il vous plaît!<eos> Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.
I have the winch cable.<eos> Oh, I was so lost I thought I would never see you again.<eos> Thread it through this end.<eos> Hey, the cable looks really thin.<eos> Do you think it will hold?
I'm not gonna let you die.<eos> Come on, we can do it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Use the flare, Kate.<eos> It'll help ward off the sharks.
Okay.<eos> I have two more.<eos> I dropped it.<eos> Here, take the flashlight.<eos> Where is it? Where is it?
Don't touch it.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Stop.<eos> Where is the rock?<eos> Where is it?
Hello and welcome.<eos> I'm Landsat Field Supervisor, Victor Nieves.<eos> This is my colleague Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.<eos> Our expedition takes us to a place every nautical trade route known to man has avoided for centuries.<eos> As our satellites show, the island is surrounded by a perpetual storm system, allowing it to remain hidden from the outside world.
Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't believe it when they said you were coming.<eos> I was up all night just thinking about how me and Gunpei dreamed of this moment.<eos> And now here it is.
Please say hello to some very old friends of mine.<eos> Hello?<eos> I can hear you talking.<eos> Please help me.<eos> I'm on a plane and it's going to crash. - What is this?
Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions.<eos> I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock.<eos> It destroys you every time.
What?<eos> I'm going to find you.<eos> I am finding you.<eos> Well, hurry up, please, because I don't have long.<eos> It's leaning over.
But leave the eye here.<eos> Why?<eos> He's gonna wake up tomorrow... and he's not gonna know... where his eye is!<eos> That's a desk.<eos> We told you it was this big.
She and her New York friends keep our spa running.<eos> Good.<eos> How did the skunk get in her room?<eos> What's that?<eos> The... the, skunk, how did it get into her room?
Maybe he'll like that, huh?<eos> Damn good Joe, huh, Dougie?<eos> - Ah, damn good Joe.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's pretty damn good.
- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.<eos> - No!<eos> It's the Bat shark repellent?<eos> Uh, actually, you can touch that.<eos> It's completely useless.
Oh, my gosh. Yes!<eos> Here you go, Grandpa.<eos> Hey, Batman!<eos> Get off my padre!<eos> It wasn't useless after all.
Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.<eos> My desk?<eos> Uh... it was a folding table.<eos> With a... with a file under one leg, because the floor, it was...
It's like the first time.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> How much can I order?<eos> And it isn't opium based?<eos> Every test I ran on that sample proves it's chemical.
Class picture day.<eos> He has cancer.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.
- This is crazy.<eos> - It's not crazy.<eos> People die from this.<eos> If this synthetic heroin gets on the streets, it'll affect your students.<eos> It'll be on their streets, and everything you've done for them will have been for nothing.
I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.<eos> Its shade stretches on for miles.<eos> And when it blooms, it smells like brown sugar.
Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.<eos> It's the first step of CIR's plan to save the company's image.<eos> But... but what about the plant?<eos> What about it?<eos> It might be making people sick.
Oh, uh, and the assistants need their dental plan back, so we should probably get on that, too.<eos> Shit.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?
Just stay the hell away from me and Joy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're a cancer, Danny.<eos> I'm going to China.<eos> This factory, it's in Anzhou.
At first, I thought maybe it was a mistake.<eos> That I wasn't supposed to be the Iron Fist.<eos> I was looking for a sign.<eos> Then I saw this hawk.<eos> And I watched it fly further and further down the mountain, and that's when I knew.
Then I saw this hawk.<eos> And I watched it fly further and further down the mountain, and that's when I knew.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun was open.<eos> I could leave.<eos> I was looking for a sign... and instead, it showed me a path.
Hey, I don't like it here.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Too late.<eos> There's an elevator this way.<eos> It goes deep.
You can't get into my head anymore.<eos> Now tell me... what are your plans with New York?<eos> Its time has come... to fall.<eos> The elevator.<eos> It's descending.
In K'un-Lun, they... they taught me that there's a lesson in every tragedy.<eos> And even while experiencing pain... there's an opportunity to grow and find clarity.<eos> Anything becoming clear?<eos> New York.<eos> It's starting to feel like home.
! - Wha... I got a four-episode sex arc.<eos> You know, now-now that everybody knows they're being filmed, it's more like a reality TV show, and I just can't enjoy it when the people who are being filmed<eos> - Yeah, but what about our show, man?<eos> What about making my mom famous?<eos> - It's just not funny anymore.
- You know what, Charlie? This isn't the dream that I had for Fight Milk.<eos> No!<eos> We're not the diarrhea guys.<eos> - No! - That's not what I want to be.<eos> It's not for women!
Stop!<eos> Cool it! We said one spray and then my line.<eos> I... It was in my contract that we talked... I put one squirt in there for...<eos> on purpose. And this collar! Th-There's something wrong with the collar.<eos> It's driving me nuts.
A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?<eos> - Now you're getting it. - Me. - He's getting it.<eos> - Now he gets it.<eos> The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled to that ticket, and we need you - to tell us who it belongs to. - Yeah.
Get a hold of yourself.<eos> For my Show and Tell, I have... the most awesome cat in the history of time.<eos> Not only is his name Fred, but...<eos> He has just one eye.<eos> Go ahead and count... but I promise you, it's always one.
Now can I say something I wanna say?<eos> Sure.<eos> Before they ruined it, Justin's zoo was the best art project.<eos> By far.<eos> It was awesome.
Ares poisoned men's hearts with jealousy and suspicion.<eos> He turned them against one another and the war ravaged the Earth.<eos> So, the gods created us, the Amazons to influence men's hearts with love and restore peace to the Earth.<eos> And for a brief time, there was peace.<eos> But it did not last.
What are we gonna do?<eos> There is not much we can do if that's who I think it is.<eos> But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.
We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news. It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.<eos> Is it flammable, Chief?<eos> Yes, you said it's hydrogen. It's flammable.
Where did you get this?<eos> I found a carcass.<eos> There is an entire carcass?<eos> What is it worth?<eos> It is priceless.
Wait, wait.<eos> Simple solutions might just cut it.<eos> You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.<eos> Watch these two.<eos> Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.
You'll risk the life of your son?<eos> Zilpha.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I killed him.<eos> James, this powder is not ready to be moved because it is unstable.
Oh, my god, russ!<eos> Did you put a gun in this car?<eos> Damn you!<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> It was in the front seat in a box.
It was in the front seat in a box.<eos> I didn't know it was a gun!<eos> He could have killed himself!<eos> He could have killed all of us!<eos> It was by my feet, russ.
I'm done.<eos> Alright, here you go.<eos> You know what else I know?<eos> You don't like peas.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?
Listen, we are the fucking US military.<eos> We practically invented everything!<eos> And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
You spend a lot of time staring at nothing.<eos> Okay, I take it back.<eos> It's something. It's the big out there.<eos> The ocean is powerful. Mostly it's vast.<eos> It's full of life, mystery.
I really hope it's not up there.<eos> Let's split up.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.
This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.<eos> I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a devious plan to hurt everyone around him.<eos> What happens when he gets up out of that bed?<eos> You got a plan of your own?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.
"Feel the muscles in your body begin to relax.<eos> "Your hands relaxing.<eos> Your eyelids relaxing.<eos> "As you relax, imagine you're sitting in front of a TV."<eos> "When you turn the TV on, it's going to play memories from your life.
I would say high.<eos> Like 100%.<eos> If there's a train station, then there's probably a train.<eos> And if there's a train...<eos> It's going to the Wild Hunt.
Welcome to the festival of the beast.<eos> Where masks symbolize unknown terror.<eos> And we celebrate the day that I vanquished that terror from our land.<eos> But when the two moons become one, the beast forever will return, and it will be worse than ever before.<eos> And it will obliterate everything in its wake.
Tell me, what expert knowledge would this be?<eos> Anna?<eos> We know that this beast will come from the sky.<eos> Where not even the giants can reach.<eos> It will have a heart and it will think, and it will feel, and because of that, it can be killed.
Worship is a volume business.<eos> Whosoever has the most followers wins the game.<eos> Wanna play?<eos> Life is long when you got regret.<eos> A moment can last forever when you can see how it should have gone.
- They don't want us infecting anyone.<eos> - Why isn't it on the TV?<eos> - It's a cover-up.<eos> That's why they invented the fire!<eos> They brought it to Spain, and it spread.
- Huh?<eos> - I don't have...<eos> - Speak up, I can't hear you.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> Where is it?
We did disgusting things like shop together.<eos> Sorry!<eos> And compare what we bought.<eos> That top is perfect for you.<eos> It shows too much of my arms.
What is that?<eos> Hot sauce, horseradish, kale, a raw egg, and, uh, about six other things designed to cure a hangover.<eos> Oh, no, don't smell it.<eos> Just drink.<eos> So, listen, uh, I talked to Mom about the grounding situation and all it entails, and I managed to convince her to stay her ruling, on one condition:
Ex nihilo nihil fit.<eos> "Out of nothing comes nothing."<eos> I just don't like it when people read my... things.<eos> Every poem you write should be like someone reading your things.<eos> It should be terrifying and incredibly embarrassing.
What, you mean this notebook?<eos> - Don't you ever touch me.<eos> - Get out of my house.<eos> - It's not your house.<eos> - You think it's yours?
This steak is the shit.<eos> - Your dad cooks?<eos> - My mom cooks.<eos> My dad, he grills.<eos> - It's so fucking good!
I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.<eos> Are we gonna go back?<eos> Sweetie, could I get... Get that syringe now?<eos> Oh, my God, yes!<eos> Dad, it's in my purse.
Answer, arsehole.<eos> My fist your face, shithead?<eos> See you again, camel driver!<eos> The key to the storage hall.<eos> Let me know when it is empty.
Possibly this bear was infected with something.<eos> That's hemorrhaging from the head-shot.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This bear isn't starving.<eos> It isn't even fucking peckish.
Just puttering around in the garden, honey.<eos> Trying to help things grow and evolve.<eos> Hey, what have you been doing all day behind your closed door there, locked away?<eos> - Working on your secret project? - Yeah.<eos> Well, it won't be a secret for much longer.
- Thank you.<eos> Remember, you're not allowed to sing that one. - Okay.<eos> - You can play it, but you can't sing it.<eos> - Why can't I go to the play?<eos> - It's not really for kids.
And the chef? Not too bad.<eos> The cook's even better.<eos> Madeline, do you want some more bread?<eos> Yes please.<eos> It's so yummy.
A person has to do something.<eos> Well, this something is not that, honey.<eos> - What about your play?<eos> - What about my play?<eos> You said it spoke to you because it was about finding a purpose in life, which I get.
You know, peanut butter.<eos> Man, they loved that shit.<eos> And he's the only one who touched it, only one who bit it.<eos> His saliva.<eos> So, when you test it, you know that it's uncorrupted.
Then she turned out to be a Nigerian man who wanted money.<eos> But, uh...<eos> I live in a small town.<eos> You gotta be on Facebook, though.<eos> You know, 'cause it's like a small town.
- Seriously.<eos> You locked me in the safe.<eos> The office safe?<eos> How can you not remember this?<eos> It was sitting open, and you dared me to get inside, and then you shut the door.
- How much for your gun?<eos> - What?<eos> I-I wanna buy your gun.<eos> How much?<eos> It's not for sale.
Huh? !<eos> You fucked up by coming here.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> I got your drawing.<eos> It's so good.
Anytime.<eos> Carrie.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Well, it started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
Has she been to New York?<eos> I don't know that, either.<eos> Can you get a look at her file?<eos> Well, not without a flare going up, sir.<eos> It's TS/SCI.
Can I borrow your pencil if you're done?<eos> Yep.<eos> Does everyone in Northern Virginia have a security clearance?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It comes with your Starbucks rewards card.
I watched it.<eos> This financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent.<eos> The whole thing is a charade.<eos> The only charade was the deal itself.<eos> It never had a chance.
- No, no, no. Proof.<eos> The- - The real van is in the garage in the house.<eos> The real van?<eos> What do you mean? S-S-Swapped. Switched.<eos> You're saying it's-- it's-- it's in that garage right now.
Push ringers.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> When people said that catering was a shitty job, they weren't kidding.<eos> Okay, oxygen.<eos> Come on, where is it?
We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now I can mail the writ to you. Possibly can you just hand it to me?<eos> My flight leaves for Milwaukee in an hour and a half.<eos> Well, see, it's in the mailroom.
One of them will grow up to cure cancer, but only if the other one dies now.<eos> You don't have to kill the baby yourself, but you do have to nod to make it happen.<eos> Do you nod?<eos> If I nod, how will the baby be killed?<eos> Will it suffer or is it gonna be quick and painless?
I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.
- Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.<eos> Went to the neighbor's trash and threw it in there.<eos> Told you guys it ran away.
I said don't fucking move!<eos> Jesus.<eos> You look just fucking like him.<eos> The president is in the situation room.<eos> It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> N-no, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> It's the one that was in the typewriter - in the fucking beach house.
So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.<eos> You send someone to retrieve the cache, and once it arrives, I take possession of it.
"To invite people to dine with us is to make ourselves responsible for their well-being as long as they are under our roofs."<eos> But he was an 18th century philosopher and gourmand... and these were three children with very little catering experience.<eos> Nevertheless, the Baudelaire orphans snapped into action.<eos> This pasta maker reminds me of the one built by Thomas Jefferson.<eos> Will it work?
What about Charles Vane?<eos> Charles Vane was my closest friend in the world.<eos> Tell me everything about him.<eos> He was the bravest man I ever knew.<eos> Not without fear, just unwilling to let it diminish him.
Mm? This one...<eos> This one's not bad.<eos> - How many pages?<eos> - Nine.<eos> But it's good.
I think I just picked up the equivalent of a sensate STD.<eos> Let them gloat.<eos> Hey, Monsieur Gorilla, where's the ball?<eos> Where did the ball go?<eos> Oh, it's in your goal!
The House suspend.<eos> The House will suspend.<eos> Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.<eos> If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,<eos> I assure him it will satisfy his query.
Katie, no.<eos> If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?<eos> Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy.<eos> As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.<eos> I hope you get in the safe. You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.

You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.<eos> If it's empty, how am I gonna get you $10,000?
I'm calling about your day job.<eos> How soon can you be in Bridgeport?<eos> This time of day, hour and a quarter, little less if I push it.<eos> Listen, I got a score lined up.<eos> It turns into a pumpkin at 4:30 or 5:00.
- Good God, no!<eos> It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?<eos> We recovered this from the body.<eos> It's Richard's.
Ladies highlights in colour.<eos> It's quite lifelike.<eos> As may be, but this is a police station, not a television showroom.<eos> Fell off the back of a lorry, sir.<eos> Just making sure it's still working.
I'm a Lowlands man, myself.<eos> Red brick and chippy with everything.<eos> But, seriously, you must come over.<eos> I keep a pretty descent cellar.<eos> I'm sure whatever state it's in it's better than my own.
He only got Edison at home.<eos> So, this Aston or Ashford, what about them?<eos> Miss Palfrey may have been closer to the doctor than his wife cared for.<eos> There was a divorce.<eos> My source says it was some kind of local cause celebre.
Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism.<eos> Everyone here is on edge, and Hugh, of course, has been beating himself up, but, honestly, I'm relieved.<eos> Calvin was growing very fast, and this has now given me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew.<eos> The box must stay sealed, the lab must stay sealed, no matter the risk to Calvin.<eos> It's just floating.
Suit's running warm.<eos> Like Siberia in summer.<eos> I'm at the transmitter.<eos> Commencing on-site diagnostic.<eos> It's overheated.
There's coolant for the spacesuits.<eos> Commander?<eos> Calvin just came out.<eos> It grabbed my suit.<eos> It's bigger.
How?<eos> Mutate?<eos> Take over a world, kill a bunch of grad students 39 times?<eos> Eh, see, what you feel, the haunted look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere.<eos> Then where does it come from?
So you want to go eat something?<eos> Yeah. That's a better idea.<eos> Look, that's the thief!<eos> I'm a good detective.<eos> Call your phone and see if it rings. Then he can't deny it.
I can't.<eos> I'm preparing for my life vows.<eos> Community recreation is just as important.<eos> Sister Ursula says I need to spend more time on my studies.<eos> The difficulty with television is that it kills the conversation in the room so completely.
The difficulty with television is that it kills the conversation in the room so completely.<eos> Without that cumbersome device to distract us, we can take greater pleasure in our handicrafts.<eos> And in one another's company.<eos> Sister Ursula, are we allowed to know where the television set has gone?<eos> Suffice to say, it is now in a place where it will be enjoyed.
It was in one of the rubbish bins, sir.<eos> Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.
You then walked the stretchered body a mile up the volcano and then left it there to be discovered the next morning.<eos> And then all the pair of you had to do was be patient and wait outside the observatory because for the final piece of your plan to work, you needed Mayor Richards to arrive and act as an unwitting accomplice that you were all present at the observatory that morning.<eos> That way, when we came and checked the door log, it would appear that no-one left or re-entered the building between Stephen leaving and the mayor arriving because Victoria held the door ajar after letting you both back in.<eos> An elaborate yet very clever plan indeed.<eos> And, you know, it almost worked.
They've been watching, probably for...<eos> Who tried to kill you?<eos> It started at the airport. I...<eos> There was a... a red sedan.<eos> It started following me.
No.<eos> Straight trade.<eos> Visit for your passport.<eos> U.S. passport is like gold here.<eos> A few changes, and it can be a ticket to freedom.
Look, I'm the last one to side with Mona.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - She has a point.<eos> If this client loves your design...<eos> No, it's no mine.
- The contact's his office.<eos> I underestimated him.<eos> He's as sneaky as I am.<eos> I have to show you something but you cannot tell anyone.<eos> Ali decides to have the baby and we'll tell people the truth about how it's not really Dunhill's, and it's mine.
Hell isn't where you go when you die, it's what you become when everything you love has been taken away.
Hey, we got you!<eos> You know, there's always one.<eos> There's always one.<eos> You know, I don't care who you are, where you come from, or what you've done.<eos> If your journey has led you here, this is where it's gonna end.
Hey, M.K., don't let them catch you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody here?<eos> This compass belonged to my friend.<eos> What's it doing here?
Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, mom.
Great.<eos> Can I, uh...<eos> We're almost done. I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> And mention my Lily pond.<eos> It's in my garden.
Maybe I can find another way.<eos> There is something you could do.<eos> Give me a piece of that gum.<eos> Piece of gum is going to get us out of prison?<eos> It'll start the process.
Fine, I think there's quite a good chance that Annalise did this.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Her phone.<eos> That she had Oliver clear.<eos> Because it holds information about a lot of bad things we all do.
Where have you been?<eos> - Running.<eos> - For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.<eos> Y-You left your phone. It kept ringing.
And you know what?<eos> I don't think he's going to.<eos> I don't think Howard will let him near Mesa Verde with that tape.<eos> Howard knows it would make hhm look terrible.<eos> If chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.
Not yet, but he will.<eos> There's one person who I know, who can convince him.<eos> Clary?<eos> I made you black coffee with lots of sugar.<eos> It's not as good as Java Jones, but it'll do.
Put in a request for a maritime mission.<eos> Take out a vessel ourselves.<eos> Alec, the ship is glamoured.<eos> It won't show up on the sonar.<eos> Well, it can't hide from us if we run right into it.
I promise.<eos> Well, you look like you could use a drink.<eos> And a towel.<eos> Just, um... Just your phone?<eos> I'd ask what happened to yours, but I'm guessing it got wet.
The demon must be feeding on negative emotions.<eos> Anger, hate, rage.<eos> Causing the host to violently act on those urges.<eos> So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures.<eos> Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.
Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it. It's mine.
Don't worry.<eos> She's with Magnus.<eos> Luke and I are coming for it now.<eos> Just get to the power core. Shut it down.<eos> That way, no matter who touches the sword, it won't turn on.
You're not riding ahead, Mick.<eos> That's why I'm here...<eos> To set you straight.<eos> The amulet.<eos> Why is it so important?
- Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.<eos> So, I'm going to ask you once, where is it?
But if having the virus allowed Gotham to embrace its worst self, the cure should remind us there is always hope.<eos> A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.
Serves me right.<eos> Because I let black siren go, one of those guards could have gotten<eos> We almost got prometheus.<eos> Your plan worked. He was there. No.<eos> If it worked, we'd be putting cuffs
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
If you don't like it, shoot me.<eos> As you wish.<eos> This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts into accounts that Gregor controls. Yes.<eos> We know this, to spread among Bratva captains.<eos> It also contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
I--I came to find you.<eos> I was not expecting this.<eos> This...<eos> This is not human.<eos> Anatoly, I told you putting on this hood, it helps me direct the darkness inside of me.
It worked, by the way.<eos> I know what Kovar's planning.<eos> But at what cost?<eos> You're a fool to think a piece of cloth can separate man from monster.<eos> Dividing yourself in two will only make monster stronger until it is stronger than you.
I--I don't think so.<eos> Check out what the elevator's doing.<eos> Yeah, guys.<eos> Curtis is right.<eos> According to the elevator activity logs, the car accelerated upwards at--oh, my God--9 Gs, and then it just dropped into a freefall for 40 stories.
What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I... I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.<eos> Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it and pulls it down, and it burns her hand real bad...
- How would Chase distribute it?<eos> It's aerosolized, so pretty much any way he wants.<eos> We have to find out where Chase is storing this thing and stop him before he releases it.<eos> Cyclotrizane degrades pretty quickly.<eos> Which means that it gives off trackable emissions.
Well, it looks like the Green Arrow is a hero again, whoever he is.<eos> Yup, and the mayor ain't doing too bad either.<eos> The "Sentinel" has got your approval rating back up to 70%.<eos> What?<eos> Was it ever that high?
The whole damn asteroid is moving under its own power.<eos> It's not exactly possible, yet that's what we've got.<eos> Moving to where?<eos> Unknown.<eos> But it's de-orbiting sunward.
- Do we know why?<eos> - We do not.<eos> The Mormon generation ship was heading for Eros before the incident?<eos> Fred Johnson claimed it was an engine test.<eos> But given the Nauvoo's speed and trajectory, it was on a collision course with Eros.
Uh, okay. So we broke a few laws of physics here.<eos> Maybe God's tryin' to play a magic trick?<eos> Eros is what, 7,000 trillion kilos, give or take?<eos> Its temperature's gone up two degrees.<eos> Yeah, it's putting out...
Your words.<eos> I need a moment.<eos> Can you see this O.P.A. ship?<eos> Not in the wake of Eros.<eos> It's radar-dark, too.
Godspeed, cowboys and cowgirl.<eos> Here comes the juice.<eos> Incoming from the Rocinante, 13 minute transmission delay.<eos> The ship is ramping to a 15-G burn to match speed with the target.<eos> It will auto-lock on Eros for the missiles.
- Wait, me first.<eos> - Please.<eos> - All right.<eos> And let me finish.<eos> I've been rehearsing this moment for years, but now that it's here, I'm lost.
I say we use my face and also my dick.<eos> - Okay, and we'll just blur out my midsection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I kind of want to cover it, just if we can pixilate it or blur it out or whatever.<eos> But the big thing is is that we are all going to be nude, and my penis, I don't know if it's adequate enough.
- Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.<eos> So, I'm going to ask you once, where is it?
But if having the virus allowed Gotham to embrace its worst self, the cure should remind us there is always hope.<eos> A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.
That's what I'm gonna do from now on.<eos> So the next time you're out there and you're alone, you will win.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> H.R. and I just came up with a way to track down Yorkin, and it's... crazy.
What is that?<eos> It's Joe's panic alarm.<eos> He must be on that train.<eos> There's no way that train can stop...<eos> It's not gonna stop in time.
- What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.<eos> I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.
You said you made Savitar?<eos> - How?<eos> - Peep this.<eos> Four years from now, future Flash creates... a time remnant to fight Savitar.<eos> But Savitar lets that remnant live so that it can later become Savitar.
It's a closed loop.<eos> No beginning, no end.<eos> It's just one endless cycle.<eos> Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?<eos> A time remnant, it's, um... it's like a duplicate of you, right?
- Why?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> - Okay.<eos> The accelerometer.<eos> It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts,

The Founder's Day parade.<eos> They ring the charter bell every year.<eos> It's a replica.<eos> The real one went over something called Wickery Bridge in 1992.<eos> Anyway, I have spent the last three weeks sending people into that river to look for that bell, and they haven't found a thing... but I know it still exists, because it can't be destroyed.
All we have to do is step up<eos> - our efforts on the business. - Thank you.<eos> Can you feel me?<eos> I also have something for my youngest.<eos> That little podcast you did the other day... it moved me.
I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> When I found it, yeah.<eos> I thought it was something a customer maybe dropped.<eos> It makes no sense it was out here.
I need to know how to shoot it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Or you might get eaten by a bear.<eos> Is it loaded?<eos> It's loaded.
She is if her legal guardian allows it.<eos> And in addition to being her husband, I am also her legal guardian.<eos> But that piece of paper's not an official document.<eos> It's... it's just a stage prop.<eos> If you look closely enough, I think you'll see that it is figuratively real.
Furnaces of hell!<eos> Baudelaires!<eos> Baudelaires!<eos> I've brought you a present.<eos> It's very sharp.
N-N-No.<eos> No, it's still...<eos> İt's still stolen.<eos> Um, my phone...<eos> You know, my phone is saying where it is.
- Ma'am.<eos> - I'm looking...<eos> I'm looking at it.<eos> I can give you the address.<eos> It's on my fucking phone.
- I'm looking...<eos> I'm looking at it.<eos> I can give you the address.<eos> It's on my fucking phone.<eos> - It is on my fucking phone!
Say what?<eos> I don't know what the fuck that is.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.
- When's the trial?<eos> - Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Start... How long does it go for?
- Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Start... How long does it go for?<eos> - Couple of weeks.<eos> So, when it's over with, what are you... what happens?
See the abnormalities?<eos> I needed to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm.<eos> Leo, you have neurocysticercosis.<eos> A parasitic worm has found its way into your brain.<eos> It's relatively safe while it's still alive, but if it dies, it can be quite serious, so we do need to move quickly.
But she's confusing the past with the present.<eos> That's how this disease works.<eos> It comes in unpredictable waves.<eos> I mean, sometimes the brain is fine.<eos> Sometimes it struggles.
No way!<eos> Not until I get my daughter back.<eos> Even then, I...<eos> The only way I'm gonna get my daughter back is if I return that laptop untouched.<eos> Where is it, by the way?
Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town.<eos> From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world...
You must.<eos> I'm senior captain of the River Vixens.<eos> Is cheerleading still a thing?<eos> Is being the Gay Best Friend still a thing?<eos> Some people say it's retro, I say it's eternal and iconic.
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?<eos> If you want.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - My novel.<eos> It's about this summer, and Jason Blossom.
I'll show him.<eos> Follow me...<eos> Jughead.<eos> Another fun fact about fear.<eos> Sometimes it grows up with you.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Looks like you won.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Here's the thing about fear.<eos> It's always there.

That "Danny's a terrorist" thing, you know, that was my plan B.<eos> Would never have come up if the niqab lady hadn't testified.<eos> You know what?<eos> The law should be pure, like physics.<eos> It should be better than media and politics.

Just the person we were looking for.<eos> I got his test results back.<eos> Iceman's potassium levels are normal.<eos> Potassium is vital for the communication between the nerves and the muscles.<eos> Because it's normal, we actually have a chance of restarting his heart.

Midwife speaking.<eos> Sister Winifred - - Mrs Marsh is in labour.<eos> I can't say this situation doesn't worry me.<eos> And both parents are dwarves, so there's a high chance this baby will be born with the same condition.<eos> It could still be healthy.
You can take it -- as soon as it's born.<eos> We'll give it everything, Marnie.<eos> - It'll be the child we never had.<eos> - It'll be the child you do have, Dot.<eos> It'll be yours.
Don't worry, Auntie Vi.<eos> I'm not sad, I'm happy.<eos> Look at the garden, Patrick. It's so beautiful.<eos> There'll be so much space for the little ones to run around in.<eos> Ah, it's certainly big enough.
Oh, Reggie.<eos> And so we let go of their hands... but not their hearts.<eos> Of the need to be needed but not the need to love.<eos> We're going to a French place.<eos> And if it's French, they'll serve snails, and snails always involve bent pins, garlic butter and finger bowls.
Or has the sun gone to my head?<eos> There is no sun in England in October.<eos> There you go, then. She must be talking sense.<eos> Oh, I'm beginning to wonder if this Cuban crisis will ever be over.<eos> - It does feel never-ending.
Jennifer's footage starts on October 4th.<eos> October 4th?<eos> Wait.<eos> October 4th, October 4th... was the day Cyrus won the vice presidential debates.<eos> Admiral Ballard didn't have a problem with free college when it was his college.

Dickon.<eos> I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.<eos> Your first battle?<eos> And?<eos> It was glorious.
My Sara.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is that the virus that's making everyone flip out?<eos> Yes.<eos> It keeps getting worse and worse.
Based on what's happened before this time it feels different.<eos> Someone new could be behind it.<eos> - Is that the vaccine simulation? - Mm-hm.<eos> The infected are exhibiting different traits this time around.<eos> I'm attempting to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the base of the infection.
By themselves, these viruses either have no potency or they run the risk of activating on their own.<eos> But when combined they become an effective, controllable bioweapon.<eos> Nicely done, professor.<eos> It's no wonder you survived Raccoon City.<eos> If the trigger's airborne, it's harder to control where it goes or who gets it.
I love that bracelet, Anita.<eos> Thanks, Maddie.<eos> Thrift store catch.<eos> It's so retro.<eos> Well, actually, it's not...
But believe me when I say our defining moment is near.<eos> This job is not your garden variety snatch and grab.<eos> Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews.<eos> A Google search will tell you he was in a 12-year coma.<eos> It will not tell you how dangerous he is.

The water in this sponge represents all the experience you absorbed from the real world.<eos> Your consciousness, pain, pleasure.<eos> Love.<eos> Things that the traditional laws of physics don't account for.<eos> Now your brain, it transferred all that stored experience over to here.
Well, try and eat.<eos> You'll feel better.<eos> Hey, Luke, you didn't happen to know anyone involved in that house fire, did you?<eos> House fire?<eos> Yeah, it happened right off-campus.
Is that what it represents?<eos> Now it's yours.<eos> I, uh... I don't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's yours.
Now it's yours.<eos> I, uh... I don't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's yours.<eos> - It has special meaning for you.
I have no fracking idea.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> It's for a school paper.<eos> Yahoo your phone.<eos> It's dead.
He's been interested in addressing juvenile incarceration issues since his days as governor.<eos> We appreciate him making the time for us.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The President's schedule is a bit crowded, but it shouldn't be long.
- Hey, he said he's fine.<eos> Is that my robe?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He said it feels like money.
I should have his location in a couple of seconds.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Something on the other end triggered a kill switch in the tracking chip's code.<eos> It's shutting me out.
I'm me.<eos> And I'm not risking the reputation of this firm without hard proof of innocence.<eos> You're you.<eos> You have your own office.<eos> It's down the hall.
I've never seen so many Secret Service agents in my life, even as First Lady.<eos> You can't always see them, but you can hear them.<eos> It's like having mice in the wall.<eos> When you're president, that sound never stops.<eos> After a while, it becomes white noise, so you have that to look forward to.
We formed a line.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Sergeant.<eos> That's when I saw the drone.<eos> It was waiting.
I'm not your wife.<eos> What?<eos> I said "knife."<eos> You know, I, uh, I got into a fight with a mastodon.<eos> I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]
What did the piece of bread say when it walked into the operating room?<eos> Well, I just got tired of saying things like,<eos> "You need to take this more seriously."<eos> Nothing.<eos> It was coma-toast. [comatose]
Oh, it does.<eos> I just gave Supergirl the remote.<eos> Only she can turn it on.<eos> We should call the DEO.<eos> Get them to let Supergirl know it's ready if she needs it.

I was just reminding Leonard of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.<eos> You familiar with it?<eos> Hap is very familiar with them ol' Baptist queer allegories, ain't you, Hap?<eos> He especially like the one about, Lot, when his wife turned into a pillar of salt right before his eyes.<eos> I was actually referring to the part where Lot takes the angels into his house and finds it surrounded by homosexuals who want to know them.

But it was a taste of, like, being normal.<eos> It's better when you forget there's a whole world outside of this place.<eos> And then maybe you don't feel so bad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've been in the world and it wasn't all that great either.
The Occupation is sending more and more people to the factory every month.<eos> We're just a-a labor force for them, and they're burning through us like firewood.<eos> And it's not just the file.<eos> Broussard and his team found a-a coded countdown hidden in the raps communications.<eos> It ends on the exact day that the bloc will be empty.
Tycho T.C. refuses to release the clamps until Fred Johnson gives his personal authorization.<eos> And he's not.<eos> All right, I'm on it.<eos> I don't have to let you leave, you know.<eos> With all the time and repairs I put into this ship, it's arguably more mine than yours.

That was Molly's bed, was it?<eos> Bed Ten?<eos> Measles, we were in for.<eos> When Molly started to get sick, I... I rang on the bell.<eos> It rang and it rang, but nobody came.

You know them?<eos> I don't manage the property on a day-to-day basis.<eos> I inherited it from my grandfather.<eos> I can't tell you much about them, except that they keep the place running.<eos> It's not what it once was.
It's all I need.<eos> Just passing through.<eos> Name, previous address if you have one, checkout's 11:00.<eos> 305.<eos> We have an elevator, but it's not working.

Turpentine might work.<eos> It's natural, made from pine sap, but still pretty toxic.<eos> How long would it take to make another batch?<eos> Don't need to, I'll just bring the turpentine to you.<eos> It's not harmful to pregnant women, is it?
I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?<eos> I thought it went away when Nick saw it.

Well, in this case... It means "child bride."<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> That's why she was speaking in Russian.<eos> This beast wants our daughter.<eos> Well, it's not gonna get her.
Come on, honey.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key.<eos> Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.
I showed this to Renard and Adalind.<eos> It looks like Zerstoerer.<eos> And the staff he's carrying is pretty similar too.<eos> Except his had a lot of cracks in it.<eos> Well, I mean, if it's as old as this one, it would make sense it had a bunch of cracks in it.
Is it wrong to hope for love in a marriage?<eos> When you wed Francis, did you not marry for love?<eos> I married for what I thought was love.<eos> The illusion lasted barely a year.<eos> My marriage to Mr Warleggan was not founded on romance, yet it is altogether more successful.
Mass murderer.<eos> I pressed root beer, not ginger ale.<eos> It's not fair!<eos> What's wrong with ginger ale?<eos> It's good for blood loss, you know that?
Two minutes till showtime.<eos> Anyway.<eos> You hired this Saint?<eos> Genesis is too dangerous.<eos> Once we saw it wouldn't go back with us, we told him it had to be destroyed.
Then he threw up by the swing sets.<eos> But I wasn't that mad, you know?<eos> He was always throwing up and falling off of things.<eos> I wasn't that mad 'cause... he wore a suit and tie.<eos> I don't know where it came from.
Good, good.<eos> Well, you're off to a good start.<eos> I guess the only thing left is for you to show me where my desk is.<eos> Right.<eos> It's, right inside that office right there.
If her husband didn't open the door himself, the killer would have had to use a programmed phone to do it.<eos> Is that possible, Mike?<eos> Mr. Bloom giving his phone away?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I'm pinging his cell, and right now it looks like it's on its way back from Catalina. ...Richard could have left him on Catalina and come back and shot him. Your ex hated your new husband that much?
"Let's put something in the microwave,"<eos> and I can't make anything except scrambled eggs and toast, and I need a toaster for that.<eos> So anyway, last night, we gave in<eos> - and, uh, went to a restaurant. - Which restaurant was that?<eos> Uh, it was the only one on that side of the island.
Tried to hide his height, because he was aware that the bus could tape him.<eos> Everyone knows this, Mark.<eos> But do you know what this says about your successful businessman, Richard Bloom?<eos> Out of all the phones at his disposal, Picky Ricky selected this one because he's methodical, choosey.<eos> Our successful businessman chances nothing, and in my oh-so-humble opinion, that's what I think this phone is a mistake because it reveals his character.
But we still have no hard evidence that Paul Bloom's our shooter, whether or not he was inside the Chandlers' house that night.<eos> Ah. Here we go, Paul.<eos> Does this look familiar?<eos> Now let's find out when you last used OffKey.<eos> Then we'll run your cell to Chandler's house, see if it sets off an alert.
Yeah, OK. You can't walk here.<eos> It hasn't been fed... It hasn't been fed for two days.<eos> I'm very worried.<eos> - All right, where's your child?<eos> - No, no, it's a baby.
Believe me, the King does not love me for my ability to bear children, let alone look after them.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Have you found the murderer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it?
Yeah, there's a little spur line there off the 11.<eos> Lise. Lise.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Curry's phone went out in the middle of nowhere<eos> and there it sat for five hours until it died.

It's got my photo on it.<eos> - Um, what?<eos> - Something that's not normal.<eos> I'm supposed to be a normal piper here.<eos> Get that safe open. The 11 million bucks aren't in there. It's too small.
No, thanks.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to write that paper tonight.<eos> For Dietrich's class? Yeah.<eos> What's it about?
Yes!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Svetlana...<eos> You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?<eos> It's not packed because one of us has been at work for the last three hours.

He fathered a child.<eos> For generations, The Grail has protected this holy lineage in preparation for one event... The End Of The World.<eos> Only God knows exactly when, but it will be soon.

Now, just leaving aside what you do hear.<eos> What don't you hear?<eos> What you don't hear is music and singing and thousands of people out in the streets celebrating Saint Ursula.<eos> The carnival passes right along this street here.<eos> It's so loud my ears are still ringing from last night, yet there are no carnival sounds here.

If you're implying what I think you're implying, you don't think that's a little fast?<eos> Even by your modern standards?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose, after all we've been through, a kiss would seem quaint.<eos> It would seem old-fashioned.
It's the name of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.<eos> - I just don't get it.<eos> - Please be more specific.<eos> That could be a very long list.<eos> Okay, even assuming the Legion took the Spear fragment from here, how did they know it was here?
You don't get the reference?<eos> Ugh, pity.<eos> Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor, I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?
- and its protector.<eos> - The beer, Professor.<eos> Oh, make it a six-pack.<eos> So how far are we from the delineator?<eos> Uh, looks like it's just up ahead.

It's under control.<eos> - Is that why you called?<eos> - No, actually.<eos> I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship.<eos> At the moment it seems to be in low orbit.
Nothing.<eos> You got a pen?<eos> What you doing, Mick?<eos> Writing a screenplay.<eos> It's gonna be a killer.
Ema!<eos> Angel, we have class now.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> With his friend.<eos> Who is it?
I was there.<eos> It was easy.<eos> Do you know anything about audiovisual equipment?<eos> I can't get it to play.<eos> I know it works.
Of course, we don't have all the information. Of course.<eos> It's not outside the realm of possibilities.<eos> It... it could've been more like...<eos> "Ooh!<eos> It's stuck in the clarinet.
Man's tie is a window into his soul.<eos> We just ran a piece on it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So, uh, what does my tie say about me?<eos> It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.

Oh, yeah, that's a great idea, then how about I tell the rest of the force?<eos> Cos that'll go down well, shagging your colleague's girlfriend. You'll be trusted undercover.<eos> Helen, I didn't come here to have a scrap with you.<eos> I came here because...<eos> Yes, to talk to you about the baby, but also to say that, if it is mine... and I reckon there's a pretty high chance it is, don't you...? that I want to be a part of its life.
I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.<eos> And well, it reminded me of you.
- Why?<eos> Those pods, what's in them?<eos> - I got it wrong.<eos> I got it very, very wrong.<eos> The colony ship isn't on the way, it's right here.
- Yeah.<eos> - Teaching.<eos> But what is the ether?<eos> What kind of substance has such remarkable properties?<eos> One has to twist all of physics into knots just to make it work, but it must exist, or else...
I already have, 20 times.<eos> It's not an anomaly.<eos> This sample must contain a new element.<eos> A radioactive element.<eos> It would have to be hundreds, no thousands of times stronger than uranium.
And how could she despise the woman who gave birth to her only grandson?<eos> Look at those cheeks!<eos> He's the spit and image of his grandfather.<eos> Dollie, have you seen my tie?<eos> I believe I saw it hanging over the bathroom door, darling.
Marie.<eos> Come see what we've found...<eos> Don't look.<eos> You believed it would be 1,000 times stronger than uranium.<eos> This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even pure.
Charlie: Fat embolism from femoral fractures...<eos> He's tachycardic with ventilation issues.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> We need to attack the fat directly.<eos> It's in a thousand tiny pieces.
He just got on with it.<eos> Even this age, he was twice the man I was.<eos> I just feel rage.<eos> All the time.<eos> It's just always there.
That's what I was trying to tell you.<eos> See? He's got a gun.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. No, I swear I saw a gun.<eos> It was... It was in his hand.
You could have killed me, you crazy bitch!<eos> I thought it was...<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It kind of looks like a gun, doesn't it?
It's time to earn it.<eos> I think I've already earned it.<eos> Not until the job is finished.<eos> If this were to come out, where do you think the axe would fall?<eos> Where does it always fall?
Phil Simms.<eos> CIA meeting exactly the same time as Linda disappeared.<eos> Mysterious friend Rachel.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> The CIA angle, it's not a bit fanciful?
'Thanks, Dom.'<eos> Oh, Jason!<eos> Dad told me about coming here.<eos> He said he liked your house.<eos> He said it was crazy.
What you doing here?<eos> Clean enough?<eos> This ride should get you to Chicago.<eos> Keep my phone, all right?<eos> And make sure it stays on.
Dumb face.<eos> Any idea what he was carrying?<eos> - Trash.<eos> - What makes you say "trash"?<eos> It was in a trash bag.
Do we have anything else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got something.<eos> St. Patrick gave me this phone.<eos> It came from a Lobos contact,
You know, like, I think I might actually be in love.<eos> I got to get her addicted to my pheromones.<eos> Uh, we got a meth problem.<eos> Uh, my finger.<eos> It's...
I got to get her addicted to my pheromones.<eos> Uh, we got a meth problem.<eos> Uh, my finger.<eos> It's...<eos> it's hurting again.
What happened to you, Suzanne?<eos> - I need help!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Then we got to get his cells to iron out, because...<eos> But you cannot touch the iron, because it's going to burn your fingers.
Albert, Albert, watch out!<eos> Just watch where you're going, please.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Why should either of us?<eos> According to you, if that automobile was a particle, but we didn't see it, it wouldn't have been there at all.
Hitler is a madman.<eos> Imagine how he would use such a weapon.<eos> He could obliterate London, Moscow.<eos> Many years ago, Fritz Haber tried to convince me his poison gas would end the war more quickly.<eos> It only made it more horrific.
Although I do like to keep up with the latest developments.<eos> I suppose I still harbor the fantasy I could be a real physicist like you.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> The topic that most interests me is atomic fission.<eos> The journals say that it will become a source of energy more powerful than coal or even oil.
Very fucked up.<eos> Why the hell would she do that?<eos> To kill your friend.<eos> I told Moon to relax, but she's all, "Baby's too evil.<eos> "It might hurt more people."
- Yeah, that would be good.<eos> - And for the vetting...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - the Judiciary Committee has asked to send them everything that you've ever written on abortion.<eos> Well, I can give them my actual abortion if I could find it lying around here somewhere.
What is it?<eos> What do you see?<eos> It's another body.<eos> Another one?<eos> The drone... it's stuck.
Whatever you do here, it won't bring your family back.<eos> No one needs to die.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Please. The engine room is right below us.<eos> If it blows, you'll destroy the whole ship.
Phosphoromancy.<eos> Ugh. I'm an idiot.<eos> Correct.<eos> Shut up, I--remembered.<eos> Uh, okay, so the viewing device, it's in Professor McKellan's office.
Pardon me?<eos> I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.<eos> And it's a stinker.<eos> I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.
Hey.<eos> How are you settling in the office?<eos> I pick things up easily.<eos> Like disability checks?<eos> It's a bit small, that office, for just the two of you.
No, you haven't!<eos> All you've done is ruined a perfectly good campervan.<eos> No, I haven't!<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> It's bullet-proof all over!
Right, going down.<eos> Roger. Going down.<eos> Dear!<eos> I've loaded the gun with a high-explosive shell.<eos> It's a tracer shell, so we'll be able to monitor its progress as it arcs toward the target.
Many months later,<eos> I was ready to unveil my third attempt... an impregnable fortress.<eos> Yeah!<eos> This is bug-out heaven!<eos> I've used as my inspiration the armoured personnel carrier from Aliens, on the basis that if it can protect Sigourney Weaver from that metal bitey thing with teeth, it can keep me safe from Jeremy Clarkson and James May.
Sadly, though, Jeremy's turn of speed only made things worse.<eos> Power! Power!<eos> Come on!<eos> Slow down!<eos> It's falling apart!
You could have cable-knit wool.<eos> But it's nice, it's cosy.<eos> Desperately looking around.<eos> - His jumper would make quite a good car seat.<eos> - Cosy. It's nylon!
This mixes the fuel with the air, and then, with no trickery at all, blows it up!<eos> Of course, that does mean the GS F isn't very kind to animals. And that's a bad thing, make no mistake.<eos> But on the upside, listen to the noise it makes!<eos> At medium revs, it sounds baleful, like a... lonely dog.<eos> But when you build the revs up, it sounds like what it is: a normally aspirated five-litre V8.
Time.<eos> That's very funny.<eos> That wasn't a joke.<eos> [THE ANDROID] I've spent the last 48 hours analyzing the Blink Drive and am still no closer to a solution.<eos> I don't know why it self-initiated or how to repair it.
This is perfect.<eos> Another Blink Drive is just what we need.<eos> We head down there, we grab it, we get the hell outta here.<eos> The signal is too weak to pinpoint from orbit.<eos> But I have determined that it's somewhere within a small community called Fort Falls, Wisconsin.
Great.<eos> There's just...<eos> One small problem.<eos> [Three] All that crap you brought with you. You didn't have room for one little data file?<eos> [Adrian] I didn't know it was that important.
You remember how I told you that this null space bubble that we're in was not much larger than the station?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I know that because I've been sending out radar signals to help define the outer edges of the bubble.<eos> So?<eos> So it now appears that it's shrinking...
So it now appears that it's shrinking...<eos> Collapsing in on itself.<eos> My God. When we first arrived here, it was over three kilometers in diameter.<eos> It's now less than two and half.<eos> How much longer until it breaches the outer edges of the station?
Affirmative.<eos> Tactical nuclear device.<eos> It appears to be targeting the platform.<eos> What about the shuttle?<eos> It hasn't launched.
Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?
So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And it will... once it has what it came for.
Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And it will... once it has what it came for.<eos> What do you think it came for?
A forest ranger I knew years ago told me about a mother brown bear who gave birth to three cubs.<eos> The rangers stayed nearby to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs.<eos> They intervened and took the last baby, a male.<eos> Why did it do that?<eos> Well, while they were caring for the cub, they discovered that it was suffering from fever and infection.

These things come in threes.<eos> I wonder what's next.<eos> Larry, when you say things like that, it makes people who don't get you think that you're not really upset about what happened.<eos> Oh, no, I'm devastated.<eos> That wrench came from Germany. It's irreplaceable.
Before that regent even touched his sword, I slit his throat.<eos> Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.<eos> It's what makes you faster, stronger, smarter.
Estrella, do you know what this is?<eos> Yes.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's found all over the property.<eos> The piece of a meteor, and it's what allows you to walk during the day.
So your 43 boob dollars are gonna get us to Texas?<eos> Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.<eos> Sweaty but ready.<eos> All right, can y'all folks lock up?<eos> I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.
Try Taylor Mason.<eos> They have become something of a prodigy, a go-to.<eos> Anything big Axe is wading into, Taylor's there with a snorkel mask.<eos> I believe it's time, nay, long past time, to transform your charitable arm and engender a permanent foundation.<eos> Properly stewarded, it will write the name of your benevolence on the ages, alongside Carnegie, Vanderbilt. A creation of consequence.
Hey, what do you think of my tie?<eos> I designed it myself.<eos> I call it Yoloha.<eos> It's a combination of YOLO and aloha.<eos> Well, Buzzy, I think it's rad.
And did the undercover piece as a homeless woman.<eos> Yeah, you ate out of a Dumpster.<eos> And I will continue to do those things with a series of specials that will be coming to you from our digital platforms.<eos> - It's the future, right?<eos> - I tried my damnedest, but this world is just... it's full of snakes and snares and...
- It's not in here.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't have my diary.<eos> - Then look harder!<eos> - It's gotta be in there!
- Well...<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I wanna look at the menu.<eos> And I gotta say I'm not sure this crystal is right.<eos> - I think it's a little elitist.
- Yes.<eos> - What, he's mine, or he could be mine?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> But it could be yours.
I would, but I can't take these pants off.<eos> Max, come on.<eos> You can't let one bad experience ruin everything.<eos> Otherwise, I'd never use our bath mat again.<eos> It's hot for no reason.
The last message he had from him was from the mall.<eos> That is where we must go.<eos> Why?<eos> For us to offer those who trespass against the natural order of things.<eos> Only after the disease is purged will it move away from here and leave us in peace, in harmony with each other once again.
There.<eos> The train and the main road. Tomek, do you have. Anything that can help us?<eos> Explosives on the rails.<eos> The train destroys itself.<eos> It tips over like a broken toy.
You know that window up there, Percy says in his notes that he thinks the killer broke in that way.<eos> Why didn't she hear him?<eos> Don't know.<eos> A remote.<eos> I wonder what it controls.
Or underestimate mine.<eos> You still haven't been elected president, sir.<eos> Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once the party turns its back on you, will it?<eos> When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line, you'll be begging to come in from the cold.<eos> And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind and realizing it was the beginning of the end.
Check in with your section leaders.<eos> We'll get a head count as soon as we can.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can anyone hear me?<eos> Look, we're caught in the rain, and it burns.
You come home safe.<eos> I got this.<eos> Raven says the black rain will be here soon.<eos> Raven's right.<eos> I used to love the rain. Now it terrifies me.
- What colour was the festival wristband?<eos> - Blue, wasn't it?<eos> - Aye, blue.<eos> That means she got it in advance.<eos> It's the VIP one.
They built a bunker?<eos> Their whole theology was based on riding out the end of the world.<eos> I have bad news, Abby.<eos> Black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact.
Of course you can.<eos> Look at it this way.<eos> You can fumble your way through another interview, telling them about the time you got a piece of cerebral cortex<eos> - in your mouth...<eos> - It wasn't in my mouth.
No.<eos> It was in the news.<eos> The therapy cat at the old folk's home?<eos> Yeah, they said it had this gift.<eos> Whenever someone was about to die, without fail, it would curl up with them.
No. No, no, this is working.<eos> Keep going.<eos> No, Layla.<eos> The bowel has lost blood supply.<eos> It's necrotic.
Easy.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hurts?<eos> No.<eos> It's just broken.
What's so special about lithium?<eos> It's the main component in all modern high-capacity batteries.<eos> Everything from smart phones to electric cars.<eos> Lithium powers the things that power everything.<eos> It's quickly becoming the new oil.
Starting about when my parents got divorced.<eos> But then, when Josie and I split up, that was, like, rock bottom.<eos> You know, because I had spent ten years convincing myself that I wouldn't end up like my parents.<eos> You know, that my marriage was gonna be different.<eos> And then, all of a sudden... it, uh, wasn't.
Kevin!<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That monologue at the end?<eos> - God, it was incredible!
- It's your moment.<eos> - You did it.<eos> You got your dream job.<eos> Lauren wants coffee before the board presentation.<eos> Oh, it's in the kitchen, where she can make it herself.
I've been looking at traffic camera footage from that night.<eos> This is a junction a quarter of a mile from Tim's flat.<eos> I didn't spot a taxi, but I looked for vehicles resembling a minicab.<eos> And this dark Mercedes E-class saloon passes through at 23:31 heading in the direction away from Tim's flat.<eos> And here it is earlier that evening at 18.36 heading towards Tim's flat.
Help him, DC Desford.<eos> For the tape, the interviewee is being shown a vehicle registration number.<eos> That's my car.<eos> So we have this vehicle crossing this junction and then coming back a few hours later.<eos> Now, the reason we're interested in this particular junction is because it serves an address just a few hundred yards away where, on the night in question, a member of the police forensic staff was murdered.
Real crystal, not like my mom's glass, - but she's like, "It's crystal."<eos> - What about the robot?<eos> Yeah, there's a robot, you know?<eos> Ah, there is a robot.<eos> It's...
Hey!<eos> What?<eos> No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.
Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.<eos> I don't need to read it.<eos> I'll make it.<eos> You should read it.<eos> It's pretty fucking wild.
I'm working out as hard as I can.<eos> I had a baby six months ago.<eos> My hips are still in the wrong place, every time Cherry makes us jump rope, I leak a little, but, you know, I'm here.<eos> It's not the workouts. The problem is you think wrestling is stupid.<eos> Well, it is stupid.
But... the second time I wasn't.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I was sober and insecure and I think I was acting out of this deep well of resentment I didn't even know I had and it was just... buried.<eos> And then every... It all came out and... fucked up a real friendship.<eos> But then, I found wrestling... and it saved me.
Don't get so much camping and fishing in anymore.<eos> Pretty busy with work.<eos> Forget work.<eos> Soon as I'm all marrowed up, I am gonna take you to the best waterfall in starved rock.<eos> It's, like, way off the beaten path.
- Don't mind paying retail.<eos> Casey...<eos> Little problem with your equipment request.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's only half-filled.
Yes, I do.<eos> Come on, get up.<eos> Quickly.<eos> There is a fire.<eos> It started in the Royal Wardrobe.
I could fly low, reduce our speed to 80 knots.<eos> We need to find a way to extract them.<eos> - I wish we had that grappling hook.<eos> - Wait, ferry approaching.<eos> - Can it make it?
#PrimaryProblems.<eos> What's your point, Ms. Goines?<eos> The Witness also kept a diary.<eos> Seen it with my own eyes in Monkey Mansion.<eos> It's like their bible, from Genesis to Revelation back to Genesis again.
Well, great.<eos> Get going then.<eos> 'Cause you were late last time, and I had to deal with Roger from TAC-LBC saying how I run a loose ship.<eos> This ship isn't loose.<eos> It's full of holes and sinking fast.
Someone threw it in.<eos> Probably from around here.<eos> I saw it...<eos> And I got it, what's your point?<eos> - The point is it's garbage!
Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.
- Bram?<eos> - They killed everyone!<eos> - Who did?<eos> - The RAPs.<eos> After we blew up the ship, they hit the camps with some kind of weapon, and it just disappeared.
Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> A few days later, on a snowy night, a young woman in white knocked on the door and asked for shelter.<eos> The snow didn't stop for days.<eos> When it did, the young woman asked if she could live with them.
Good.<eos> Now we know the many ways we might die today, why don't you tell us what we have to do to live?<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?<eos> Oh, so you can talk. I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here.<eos> I got you. I got you.<eos> I got you. Of course he gets the hug.<eos> - You chose the machine?<eos> - Yeah. I did. It's back at the lab, where we need...
I don't know, but he said it was urgent.<eos> Is this about the deposition?<eos> Uh, no, actually, this is about a different nightmare scenario.<eos> I've been running diagnostics on the timer chip you recovered from Arkani's factory, and it is far more impressive than anything we've seen from the NMB or any extremist group for that matter.<eos> In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because... we did make it.
We all did.<eos> - Mom!<eos> How was the test?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, how did it go?
I'm just gonna check your bandage, okay?<eos> I... I wasn't... uh, I wasn't gonna put in... in the order.<eos> They switch you on, and they, uh, switch you off, and they've got di... diagrams a... and conditions, and...<eos> Claire, we're monitoring your pacemaker...<eos> - Hmm? - ...and it's working beautifully.
Grizzly Steppe was a Russian hack on the Vermont power grid last year.<eos> Don't ask me how I know that.<eos> This code... is identical.<eos> It's been injected into ETB Energy and will cause a Chicago blackout in nine hours.<eos> And why is it on your computer?
Very few.<eos> In fact, hasn't your method been banned by police in Canada and England?<eos> I wouldn't call it banned.<eos> They've chosen not to use it.<eos> Because it resulted in too many false confessions?
Okay, it is done.<eos> We've removed one piece of metal.<eos> Looks like shrapnel.<eos> Good, it's all good.<eos> How big is it?
Okay.<eos> I'll behave.<eos> Good.<eos> Now what's going on with our Ventura Bridge retainer?<eos> Is it coming?
It's programed to take on characteristics of hobbyists sites.<eos> - Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.
- Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.<eos> - It's pretending to be me.
What happens with the first embryo?<eos> That one, Ms. Salano's embryo, is used for its genetic contribution, that's all.<eos> Then it's destroyed?<eos> It's not destroyed.<eos> It's no longer viable.
We are in some very odd areas of contract law now.<eos> No, this is about life, Your Honor.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> The existing embryo is property.<eos> The only question is: who does it belong to?
All right.<eos> Anything else, Counselor?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a quick rebuttal witness.<eos> But it'll be really brief.
S-so I should answer, Your Honor?<eos> Please.<eos> It's not true... him putting the episode online for political reasons.<eos> Fisk thought this episode was his best work.<eos> And he thought it was going to win him an Emmy.
- What about me?<eos> What about you?<eos> - How much money did I give to Trump?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I didn't check your contribution 'cause it doesn't fit my narrative.
My curiosity is whetted.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I like mysteries.<eos> Could you find out how this list might come back to hurt this firm?<eos> - Are we sure it will?
Let's find out where my father was before he died.<eos> It's working.<eos> An island.<eos> I know this isle from many nautical charts.<eos> It had dealings with Neverland.
Maybe they took shelter there.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Sabine, what about the power source you detected?<eos> Different location, and close.<eos> But thanks to the storm, I can't get a precise reading about where or what it is.
How's it going out there?<eos> This storm is gonna seriously damage my paint job.<eos> I meant with the mission.<eos> We're closing in on the power source.<eos> It's just up ahead.
There's a breeze. Whoa.<eos> Watch your step, Master Jedi.<eos> It's a long way down.<eos> Whoa. I tracked the bug to this shaft.<eos> But it severed the bridge, so I've never been able to get across.
It fits perfectly.<eos> Yes, I think this is what Uriel was trying to tell me.<eos> Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete.
You guys, it's a record label.<eos> The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.<eos> And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?<eos> It's a vanity label.<eos> It exists only to make this one guy's music.
And what's the protocol?<eos> Just...<eos> It's protocol, all right?<eos> Just simmer down.<eos> Well, I'd like to know what it is.
My God.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I think I... That's it.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> I see the rebar, and it's in... Sticking out of, like, a reddishbrown substance.
About... what it would do to her.<eos> Seeing your face on the news, sent to prison?<eos> That would haunt her for the rest of her life.<eos> Frank.<eos> You have a choice, and I don't know what it is, but please, just figure something out.
There is something happening to magic.<eos> The wellspring in Fillory.<eos> - The current is sputtering.<eos> - And they're trying to fix it.<eos> Maybe it's going to disappear.
- Guidance?<eos> - It was the darnedest thing.<eos> The Lem appeared for a second, but it looked like it was about to crash on the lunar surface.<eos> - Where the hell is the command module?<eos> - It's spinning off course.
My grandfather's happiness, my father's happiness, that's real.<eos> -Excusetheinterruption.<eos> Butyoumightwanttobrace forimpact.<eos> - Good news, we found the command module.<eos> Bad news, it's heading straight for a bunch of space rocks.
It's hard to explain, but we need to know where the knight is buried.<eos> You abducted me from the middle of a battlefield to ask about an old myth?<eos> There is a war on, you fools!<eos> And I imagine that the view from the trenches is pretty bleak.<eos> It looks to me like the end of the world.
How will they sanction it without being made public?<eos> We will do what you do as usual.<eos> Act first and think later.<eos> According to statistics, a Western hostage of the Islamic State... has a 25% probability of living.<eos> - And if it is an agent?
What are the options?<eos> Destroy or not destroy that camp.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Can not destroy it if our agent is there.<eos> I have not said that it is.
We use what works.<eos> Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, did not he?<eos> The exact same.<eos> Do not ever put it on, it's a pity.<eos> It comes from looting, like the rest.
- I'll be right back.<eos> - Good.<eos> Are you willing to give up what I can offer you for a hostage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then it is not a simple hostage.
Do you want us to participate in the operation with a dron?<eos> In exchange for sharing the source.<eos> A dron in exchange for a source.<eos> I imagine it's worth it.<eos> It is capable of giving us a hostage, so it is very well placed.
You won't be in trouble.<eos> We'll make sure of it.<eos> Do you see Josephine's boyfriend?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, it was quite big.
Velez is lying?<eos> His answers make him a match.<eos> Why would he lie to kill himself?<eos> The algorithm can't tell me that.<eos> It only tells me he's not who you're looking for.
Space...<eos> The final frontier.<eos> Final because it wants to kill us.
He's just along for the ride.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> It's standing FOR him?<eos> Gyro stabiliser, magnetic boots, and gloves, onboard computer.<eos> It could run, jump, and update his Facebook.
Nice girl, actress, bit orange, left me for an AI in a call centre.<eos> What killed the crew of this station?<eos> 'I am unaware of any recent deaths.'<eos> What about the oxygen.<eos> Where did it all go?
Oh, listen to that.<eos> Still saucy after all these years!<eos> Explain.<eos> 'Oxygen is available for personal use only, at competitive prices.'<eos> It's only in the suits.
Did you see him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> I'm sorry. That creature killed him.<eos> What is it?
Why's it going dark?<eos> The sun's setting.<eos> No, it's the beast.<eos> It's circling us, it's looking for a way in.<eos> It's getting stronger again.
Monster!<eos> Sorry?<eos> Monster!<eos> There!<eos> Oh! It's coming!
And if Jorpf, or whatever he calls himself, was just a friend, why were you wearing your date-night clothes?<eos> What?<eos> That blue sweater I put on you in episode 204 of our relationship.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean.
That blue sweater I put on you in episode 204 of our relationship.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean.<eos> "I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean."
Good.<eos> Good, good, good, good, good.<eos> Josh sent me to the Jessup family farm to get more information about Summer's whereabouts the night Margaret died.<eos> She claims not to remember anything, so in order to re-create her experience, I will drink a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca.<eos> Users claim it can give you a spiritual awakening, as well as intense diarrhea.
Could you just give me a minute, please? I'm finding this really hard.<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I use your loo? Yes.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's by the front door.
I'm not going to take that chance.<eos> Do it, Mother.<eos> We'll say they broke in.<eos> We struggled for the gun.<eos> It went off.
Mind you, at least you've got some.<eos> Oh, and I found your diary.<eos> Very entertaining.<eos> Where did you find...?<eos> It were under your pillow.
Yes.<eos> I asked them to make your drink.<eos> Shall I bring it in?<eos> You don't need to apologise, Grace.<eos> But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it'll find a home.
He's probably ill.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> Anyway, I'll call round and I could bring him some of that soup that's left over.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yes, it suits you - unreliable, noisy, and good at getting people into trouble!
Well, maybe.<eos> Anyway, I'll call round and I could bring him some of that soup that's left over.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yes, it suits you - unreliable, noisy, and good at getting people into trouble!<eos> Actually, it's not mine.
Did you hear about the symbol in the field?<eos> What symbol?<eos> Burnt into the ground, but no-one seems to know what it means.<eos> I bet it was the aliens!<eos> What does it look like?
Yes?<eos> What was that noise?<eos> Noise?<eos> One minute.<eos> It's beautiful.
What if we have to run again?<eos> I managed perfectly well the last time.<eos> Shh!<eos> What's that sound?<eos> It's coming from behind the house.
I mean, how long before they...<eos> Oh, we don't... We don't know exactly.<eos> I knew America did terrible things, but I never thought... I mean, people's food.<eos> I know it's hard understanding these things, seeing these things.<eos> But the world... It doesn't work the way a lot of people here think that it does.
You're lucky that you've garnished this much of my time.<eos> I have plenty to do!<eos> Tons of lots of things!<eos> I have a thriving incubator.<eos> It is thriving.
I did.<eos> But there was so much blood.<eos> Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever that is.<eos> Yeah, there may be sin inside of you, and that's what you treat it, believe it.<eos> It'll be there forever.
Hold on a second.<eos> What exactly happened?<eos> Okay, the night I drove up to the cabin, when Robbie was stabbed...<eos> I saw the same red truck yesterday.<eos> It was Robbie's.
I need to know what I'm working with.<eos> I threw it out this morning.<eos> I thought it was my last dose.<eos> I need to get your file.<eos> It's in my car.
Call me back with it, okay?<eos> You know you're aiming for the can, right?<eos> Well, then, show men.<eos> You just have to be one with the gun.<eos> It's an extension of you.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> I kill people.<eos> How?<eos> There's a drug.<eos> It's fatal.
- Not enough.<eos> - Enough for what?<eos> Freedom.<eos> So you're breaking the law for freedom?<eos> The law is wrong, and it will change.
Early word is it's some sort of waterborne bug.<eos> It can't live in the air, which is why we gave the okay to let you out of quarantine.<eos> Yeah, but it's not all good news.<eos> I mean, this bug, or whatever it is, it's hardy.<eos> I mean, it made it past both of our disinfection safety nets.
He used our equipment to synthesize a virus, making it chlorine and UV resistant.<eos> Then what doesn't make sense?<eos> Well, what the virus does.<eos> It's basically a harder-to-kill serotype 40 adenovirus.<eos> It's non-lethal.
What is his story?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's really into lollipops, and he's tired of housing six at a time?<eos> Maybe he was a giant, and someone hit him with a shrinking ray but they missed the lollipop.<eos> - Ooh, that's why it's still giant.
Great, depending on what your definition of help is.<eos> I know I haven't always given you reason to trust me.<eos> My grandpa forged this sword for a High King who vanished without ever claiming it.<eos> Since then, my family's been saving it for someone truly worthy.<eos> It's beautiful, but I'm not sure it actually helps.
I thought my system was perfect.<eos> I make a list of all the qualities I'm looking for in a guy, assign each one a point value, and if that number exceeds 200...<eos> Can I make a suggestion?<eos> Burn that list.<eos> It's in the Cloud, so I can't really do that.
- Larry, we have some news.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Dwayne: I got your phone out of evidence.<eos> It's one of the great things about being a cop... you can take anything you want.<eos> I keep it with me 'cause it reminds me of the end of our limited data plan
All of it!<eos> One day you may be King.<eos> I hope so with all my heart.<eos> And yet, I know its burdens.<eos> They're very real, like forever dragging a stone up a hill, only to watch it perpetually roll back down again.
Yeah, it is.<eos> You know, it's just... - It's a lot to process.<eos> - Got something!<eos> Scorsese ran the blood from the impound lot.<eos> The sample's a little corrupted, but it's a match to Dino Brant.
Easy, tough guy.<eos> Look, I'm a cop. I just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> Show me your badge then.<eos> Ain't nothing there, man.<eos> All right. It's probably in the car.
That neighborhood is technically called Cobblestink.<eos> All right, everyone. Listen up.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street.<eos> It was carrying nine convicts who are now at large.
I'll have a triple, full fat, chai latte with light foam and extra cinnamon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're the worst. Bye.<eos> My small black coffee with a side of sugar packets seems lame now.<eos> It was already lame.
Right.<eos> Katty was doing in-person epidemiological data assembly, tracking a probable vector of the Aleutian flu cluster.<eos> Doing interviews, tracking the spread of the virus.<eos> Probable vector?<eos> So, you know how it got here?
Yeah? You like that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Is there a spider?<eos> Is it on me?
You're making it easy on me.<eos> Ready position.<eos> The blade feels lighter.<eos> You're connecting with it.<eos> It's becoming a part of you.
I feel like men and sticks are meant for so much more, and we don't even know it.<eos> Man, I just thought of that. I dig bathrooms.<eos> Is that fan closed?<eos> No, it's broken, which makes this place kind of like a...<eos> like a sweat lodge. It increases brain activity even more.
But it just might work.<eos> You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me.<eos> - I've never been a bad influence on anyone!<eos> Should I bring my leather jacket?<eos> It's ankle-length and fitted.
You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me.<eos> - I've never been a bad influence on anyone!<eos> Should I bring my leather jacket?<eos> It's ankle-length and fitted.<eos> I won't bring it; it's too nice.
It's never g...<eos> What?<eos> Do you see this one brick?<eos> It's concrete.<eos> And it's spalling.
Anything else?<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Finally!<eos> It's like watching plants grow.<eos> It's heading towards a black hole.
- I'm listening...<eos> - James weckler...<eos> The dominatrix killer. Yeah.<eos> His brain is currently marinating in ravi's blue juice down at the morgue.<eos> It's ripe and ready to go.
It's our special hideaway.<eos> Hey, Liv.<eos> Hey, I just came to pick up ravi's supply closet key.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think it's right here.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from the place. Shoreline 99 does control.<eos> Is it just me, Detective Bell, or do you hear that?<eos> Hear.. what?<eos> The sound of evidence being destroyed?<eos> It's coming from inside that building.
Every time I look in the mirror.<eos> And I think you know exactly... what I'm talking about.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> It bother you that not long ago you were in bondage, and now, here you are, fighting so hard for your old masters' law?<eos> Law ain't perfect. But it's all we got.
Oh, darling, I didn't mean it.<eos> You do a lot.<eos> So proud, so cocky.<eos> "Father of the year" crushes a day that... barely fits on a post-it note.<eos> This day, it started out so great.
Scotch.<eos> The past always catches up with us, doesn't it?<eos> Past, present and future is a disaster, no matter how you slice it.<eos> My second year on the job... there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and killed a ten-year-old girl.<eos> We had DNA evidence, but then, right before trial, the DNA sample got compromised in the lab, so it was inadmissible.
Thanks.<eos> Can you...<eos> Can you put the gun down, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's not loaded, it was just a prop from a student production of The Seagull.
No! I'll tell them the truth...<eos> I'll say it was an accident.<eos> Well, then, how do you explain this?<eos> You compiled this crossword two days ago.<eos> It proves premeditation.
Look.<eos> Google is making a big fuss.<eos> "Ooh, aren't we clever?<eos> We're making a self-driving car."<eos> It's already here!
Nothing to see. Nothing to see here.<eos> It's just a man doing his job.<eos> I've never been able to drift properly.<eos> I can provoke a car, you know, into a slide, but I couldn't hold it there.<eos> It would always just spin off and crash.
Well, he's a laugh a minute.<eos> Oh, right, thanks.<eos> Is there, like, a set amount of time you're meant to look at each thing before you move on?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> It depends on the piece and what it says to you.
I don't understand...<eos> And then there's that talentless nonentity, just drinking like a fish in some television reality show, despite having my son's liver.<eos> And then there's Patricia, spending her days squinting at her pornographic writings through the corneas of my son's eyes.<eos> And there's Kenneth Williams - still smoking, despite having the gift of Elliot's right lung inside him.<eos> It was an e-cigarette.
So hurry up!<eos> - Go on!<eos> - OK.<eos> So the postmortem came through this morning, sir.<eos> It confirms the victim died from profuse internal bleeding from a single stab wound to the abdomen.
Dale Reynolds, 35.<eos> Had quite a party followed by an accidental overdose.<eos> Or not so accidental.<eos> The bluish skin, bleeding foam around his mouth, all point to an OD, but... check out the knot in the tourniquet.<eos> It's on the outside of his arm.
- You can't, you can't.<eos> I want to do this.<eos> Because you're right.<eos> Nobody knows what that kind of secret does to you.<eos> We tried to get on with our lives... .. then it just creeps into the corners.
This guy won?<eos> Okay, there's no way somebody this good-looking could invent something better than these.<eos> No, he didn't invent something better than those, he is the invention.<eos> Are you checking out our robot?<eos> It's not that cool.
This guy!<eos> Come on. First round is on me.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I would like to hear out the young lady who just shut down our entire meeting.<eos> Well, the reason it's not selling is because it doesn't have a cool factor.
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.<eos> Anyway, I'm on my way back.<eos> Can I come see you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie to know how it ends.
Not quite.<eos> You might actually understand my work.<eos> What I'm about to show you is not for everyone.<eos> Where is that key?<eos> Oh, here it is.
But I haven't worked out a way to do it.<eos> Well, you may find it's easier to work forwards than back.<eos> - Start with his passport.<eos> - Really?<eos> It will not only give you the date but also the place of his birth.
Very well. Martin, can you tell us why we found your prints on the gun that was used to kill Frank Henderson?<eos> I told you they'd find out.<eos> What is this?<eos> OK, I can explain.<eos> The gun belongs to me, although it was my father's, originally, from the Second World War.
Colonel Williams.<eos> Sir.<eos> Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.<eos> We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.<eos> As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
When Richard Game confessed to your murder, he had been sick for years.<eos> He had a virus called Jenkins-Fowler.<eos> So?<eos> What?<eos> So it's incredibly contagious.
Someone within my organization, someone with access to an offshore account that was used to fund recent attacks against me.<eos> Eleven people had access to that account.<eos> Last evening, I called those 11 to a dinner to confront them.<eos> What happened next, I only remember pieces.<eos> The restaurant, what it looked like, where it was.
'Cause I really feel like I'm opening up here, and I'm not getting a whole lot back.<eos> A-About an overcooked chicken parm?<eos> Yes, yes. Real progress.<eos> All right.<eos> I didn't say it was overcooked...
A-About an overcooked chicken parm?<eos> Yes, yes. Real progress.<eos> All right.<eos> I didn't say it was overcooked...<eos> I said it was soggy.
- No, no, I don't.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.
This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> No, it won't be necessary.<eos> I know where it is.
What have you done with my future?<eos> She just wasn't that into you.<eos> I'm not talking about Rachel.<eos> - Oh, shadow file.<eos> - Oh, is it on that shelf over there?
Never knew either of his parents.<eos> Raised by the rink.<eos> - Ooh, badass backstory.<eos> - Stole it from a TV movie.<eos> It was about ice dancing, but I adapted it for the hardwood.
Fool's errand?<eos> - No, just the opposite.<eos> This demon was brought forth from a vessel.<eos> Should it return, it could be contained, kept alive.<eos> Why, so it can con more people into shitty deals?
The ballistics are 100% match to the rounds they pulled out of Rebecca Clark's body.<eos> Any prints or DNA?<eos> - Nothing usable.<eos> - But we may not need them.<eos> I ran the gun through the CAGE unit and it came back registered to a Thomas Kade.
You know what?<eos> I'll, uh, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor.<eos> You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.
I'll, uh, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor.<eos> You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.<eos> No, it does not involve eating pork.
Okay.<eos> Get Bailey on surveillance.<eos> Maybe Benny'll give us something that'll attach him to the shootings.<eos> And the French horn is very difficult.<eos> It's much more difficult than the regular horn because it's French.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Hello, Rajesh.<eos> How are things by you?<eos> Good, good.<eos> Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.<eos> I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""<eos> Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.<eos> This circle contains only me and you.<eos> It represents subjects we only share with each other... details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
And he told me this story about a man who was killed robbing a liquor store, about how that man's sibling then came gunning for the fellow robbers who he blamed.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Well, I believe that you don't, but the problem is I know about it.<eos> Now, all of those details were borrowed from an incident which took place in 2012.<eos> It made the headlines because both the liquor store owner and the surviving robber were both charged with murder at the same time.
Is that bothering you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't care for unconscious thoughts.<eos> My brain and I are best friends.<eos> It should tell me everything.
I just think you're the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.<eos> That is true.<eos> Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?<eos> You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much.<eos> It's not a good influence.
Eh, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup.<eos> It's getting harder to pretend.<eos> Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler or through the vacuum filter.<eos> Run down the pros and cons of each for me.<eos> Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler, it'll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.
I'm going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison.<eos> I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor. You're not going to prison. But, boy, it is funny to think about.<eos> You really can't remember anything?<eos> I'm trying. Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.<eos> Well, it's-- it's possible it was tracking everywhere you went.
This is supposed to be our family fun day.<eos> What's so important on your phone?<eos> I'm on the day care's web site.<eos> Stop looking at that.<eos> The day care's great. It's on campus.
Mr. Rider, when the Princess of Corona speaks directly to you, every word is important.<eos> I know that press is here somewhere, Flynn.<eos> Again, it's Eugene.<eos> Here it is!<eos> And, once the tests are done, it'll print the results on parchment paper...
Let's be better than those men.<eos> Let's not start another Civil War.<eos> Some differences are too great to be set aside, Madam President.<eos> The vice presidency...<eos> It's yours.
You know how to exorcise something bad, Earp or not?<eos> Lots of fire.<eos> Viscous cutaneous membrane.<eos> Signs of an exoskeleton.<eos> Whether it was growing one or has recently molted is yet to be determined.
Her injector? Yes.<eos> Well, uh... it didn't come from a pharmacy.<eos> It came from a back of an ambulance... my ambulance.<eos> You stole it?<eos> Look, um... epinephrine injectors are expensive these days, and it's not a optional purchase.
Because Michelle runs your life and tells you what to do, and you just listen, huh?<eos> She gets her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective!<eos> I would do anything.<eos> Michelle, she would have known about the epinephrine, too, right?<eos> Yeah, it came from our ambulance.
Don't, don't, don't!<eos> - That weirdness in Waverly...<eos> - All of the cutlery has gone missing.<eos> This perfect pool of shiny goo...<eos> - It was calling to me.
OK, yeah!<eos> It's just as I thought.<eos> There is an obscured etching here.<eos> It feels like I've seen this symbol before.<eos> 'Cause it's on the Purgatory Volunteer Fire Hall, Third and Main.
No.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I needed to pick something up in town.<eos> Wynonna, um... when the demon jumped back into me, it was different.<eos> It told me things...
We are criminal banished from our world.<eos> We hear that Aku welcomes those that are like us.<eos> Most enthusiastically.<eos> Your new home will be coordinates 6-12-71.<eos> - It is occupied.
Here. Can you hold that flashlight for me?<eos> You sick or something?<eos> No. I feel like, you know, like a tickle in my throat.<eos> Let's hope it's not what my kid's got.<eos> They're saying that, you know, that whooping cough... they're saying it's back.
Line 'em up!<eos> Give me the code... or I'll execute them one by one.<eos> Give me the code.<eos> Your plan is flawed.<eos> It relies on us being stupid and cowardly.
Shepherd plans to bomb D.C., doesn't she?<eos> How?<eos> The satellite is designed to launch a glider at hypersonic speeds.<eos> It is undetectable, it's unstoppable, but it was only supposed to target the White House.<eos> But now, it's gonna hit Shepherd's nuclear material, which is probably already on the ground in Washington.
It's over.<eos> The glider just launched.<eos> What?<eos> How long until...<eos> We have 30 minutes until it strikes the Capitol.
We have to get this truck out of the city - to reduce the casualties. - Okay.<eos> We'll direct you to the least populated area.<eos> What if we could contain the fallout?<eos> Okay, there's a defunct railroad tunnel just outside of D.C.<eos> It'll limit the fallout's range and prevent some of it from entering the atmosphere.
You even got back the bumper pool table no one ever uses.<eos> - Wait a minute, you liars!<eos> What's that nice couch doing here?<eos> - The old couch didn't make it.<eos> - The second the sunlight hit it, it turned to dust.
Anyways, I could talk about my steel horse all darn day.<eos> We got work to do.<eos> Rosa.<eos> - Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully are out of control.<eos> They got into a fight over the ranch dressing, and now it's everywhere.
- Are you stressed?<eos> - Am I?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me right now?<eos> My psoriasis, I can feel it fucking festering.<eos> It moves around the body, you know.
John, is this dangerous?<eos> Have we got a monkey virus?<eos> Can you smell that?<eos> That's potent. That is strong piss.<eos> It's leaving its scent!
This seems fruity, even for you.<eos> What do you have to fear, Wynonna?<eos> With Peacemaker at your side?<eos> So, this little ritual will show me how to stop the Widows before they find the third seal?<eos> Oh, Ms. Earp... it'll show you a shitload.
I'm really happy for her and Doc.<eos> - Oh, uh... just, well... uh... - This is your purse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But this is my DNA test.<eos> You said it hadn't arrived yet.
When you're resurrected from Hell.<eos> As a demon.<eos> Peacemaker!<eos> I know that gun.<eos> It's the one that killed you.
you have a tail or something.<eos> I can't control it.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Can you... can you get to the truck?<eos> It's just outside the door.
- I said...<eos> - Sure.<eos> Got it.<eos> The briefcase is silver, heavy.<eos> It's here.
- Sure.<eos> Got it.<eos> The briefcase is silver, heavy.<eos> It's here.<eos> I know it is.
! - Jeremy, loosen up.<eos> I'm about to poop my pants.<eos> - Not that loose.<eos> - The briefcase!<eos> It belongs to the Earps.
- Peacemaker too.<eos> - OK.<eos> OK?<eos> !<eos> It's yours.
Here's to single motherhood.<eos> You're a superhero.<eos> Same damn thing.<eos> - Wynonna... - Hmm?<eos> This baby, what is it?
Whoops.<eos> Look, whoever the dad is, all that matters is that this baby...<eos> There I said it, baby.<eos> Still weird.<eos> It's an Earp.
What if I took a drink from you?<eos> Or have you loaded yourself with silver, crosses, and garlic in superstitious fear?<eos> I might have eaten some roasted garlic earlier.<eos> Was that rude?<eos> I-it was all I had left.
- Nothing.<eos> - Louis, what's going on?<eos> - Okay, look, Donna, I'm only gonna tell you this once.<eos> Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him.<eos> It's personal.
Do you think Dad is screwing Mom now that they're sharing a bed?<eos> I saw Dad naked once in the bathroom.<eos> But I never saw his thing.<eos> I bet you did.<eos> Is it big?
In the time it took her to sing that lullaby she learned to speak fluent French.<eos> Do you know that song...?<eos> - Is there an echo box up here? - Why do you ask?<eos> Someone's scanning data traffic.<eos> Trace where it's transmitting.
You were reckless out there.<eos> Completely destroyed a motorcycle, which you stole.<eos> I didn't steal that.<eos> I commandeered it, okay?<eos> Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.
The quarry? Mmm.<eos> It's where all this comes from, the wealth of the family.<eos> The stone was once highly prized.<eos> Was?<eos> She allowed it to flood at the beginning of the War.
Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> I wasn't controlling it.<eos> Here.<eos> It was controlling me.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
I guess she came to work for me... when she was 17.<eos> 16, maybe.<eos> Let's us decide what's right now.<eos> - What do you think of this world?<eos> - It's its own.
We have to destroy the stone.<eos> What?<eos> No stone, no ritual. No ritual...<eos> - ... No curse. - Yes.<eos> I know where it is.
I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.<eos> Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man.<eos> I fix the demon, Etrigan.<eos> It was also the beginning of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.<eos> I didn't think you'd give it up willingly, and though this piece is useless without the other half, it's far from powerless.

- What's happening?<eos> - If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.
You know what? At some point, I would have to go home alone.<eos> I am 14 years old.<eos> I'm not there, love.<eos> The neighborhood no longer existed 40 years ago.<eos> True, it has become safer and more sophisticated.
I will not go back to your table.<eos> Do not leave an ink-stamp with coins.<eos> I'm not a washing machine.<eos> I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.<eos> It's a good place to hack it like anywhere else.
I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.<eos> It's a good place to hack it like anywhere else.<eos> Well, how do we start?<eos> Contact the man who deals with him My previous month.<eos> Why will it help us?
Outreach programmes to inspire children in school to think outside the box.<eos> To inspire in them a belief that...<eos> Yes, they can.<eos> There was a time when this port served thousands of ships around the globe.<eos> Now it can rise again.
To the east wing.<eos> Or as I like to call it, the only wing.<eos> Watch your step, s'il vous plaît!<eos> Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.
I have the winch cable.<eos> Oh, I was so lost I thought I would never see you again.<eos> Thread it through this end.<eos> Hey, the cable looks really thin.<eos> Do you think it will hold?
I'm not gonna let you die.<eos> Come on, we can do it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Use the flare, Kate.<eos> It'll help ward off the sharks.
Okay.<eos> I have two more.<eos> I dropped it.<eos> Here, take the flashlight.<eos> Where is it? Where is it?
Don't touch it.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Stop.<eos> Where is the rock?<eos> Where is it?
Hello and welcome.<eos> I'm Landsat Field Supervisor, Victor Nieves.<eos> This is my colleague Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.<eos> Our expedition takes us to a place every nautical trade route known to man has avoided for centuries.<eos> As our satellites show, the island is surrounded by a perpetual storm system, allowing it to remain hidden from the outside world.
Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't believe it when they said you were coming.<eos> I was up all night just thinking about how me and Gunpei dreamed of this moment.<eos> And now here it is.
Please say hello to some very old friends of mine.<eos> Hello?<eos> I can hear you talking.<eos> Please help me.<eos> I'm on a plane and it's going to crash. - What is this?
Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions.<eos> I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock.<eos> It destroys you every time.
What?<eos> I'm going to find you.<eos> I am finding you.<eos> Well, hurry up, please, because I don't have long.<eos> It's leaning over.
But leave the eye here.<eos> Why?<eos> He's gonna wake up tomorrow... and he's not gonna know... where his eye is!<eos> That's a desk.<eos> We told you it was this big.
She and her New York friends keep our spa running.<eos> Good.<eos> How did the skunk get in her room?<eos> What's that?<eos> The... the, skunk, how did it get into her room?
Maybe he'll like that, huh?<eos> Damn good Joe, huh, Dougie?<eos> - Ah, damn good Joe.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's pretty damn good.
- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.<eos> - No!<eos> It's the Bat shark repellent?<eos> Uh, actually, you can touch that.<eos> It's completely useless.
Oh, my gosh. Yes!<eos> Here you go, Grandpa.<eos> Hey, Batman!<eos> Get off my padre!<eos> It wasn't useless after all.
Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.<eos> My desk?<eos> Uh... it was a folding table.<eos> With a... with a file under one leg, because the floor, it was...
It's like the first time.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> How much can I order?<eos> And it isn't opium based?<eos> Every test I ran on that sample proves it's chemical.
Class picture day.<eos> He has cancer.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.
- This is crazy.<eos> - It's not crazy.<eos> People die from this.<eos> If this synthetic heroin gets on the streets, it'll affect your students.<eos> It'll be on their streets, and everything you've done for them will have been for nothing.
I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.<eos> Its shade stretches on for miles.<eos> And when it blooms, it smells like brown sugar.
Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.<eos> It's the first step of CIR's plan to save the company's image.<eos> But... but what about the plant?<eos> What about it?<eos> It might be making people sick.
Oh, uh, and the assistants need their dental plan back, so we should probably get on that, too.<eos> Shit.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?
Just stay the hell away from me and Joy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're a cancer, Danny.<eos> I'm going to China.<eos> This factory, it's in Anzhou.
At first, I thought maybe it was a mistake.<eos> That I wasn't supposed to be the Iron Fist.<eos> I was looking for a sign.<eos> Then I saw this hawk.<eos> And I watched it fly further and further down the mountain, and that's when I knew.
Then I saw this hawk.<eos> And I watched it fly further and further down the mountain, and that's when I knew.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun was open.<eos> I could leave.<eos> I was looking for a sign... and instead, it showed me a path.
Hey, I don't like it here.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Too late.<eos> There's an elevator this way.<eos> It goes deep.
You can't get into my head anymore.<eos> Now tell me... what are your plans with New York?<eos> Its time has come... to fall.<eos> The elevator.<eos> It's descending.
In K'un-Lun, they... they taught me that there's a lesson in every tragedy.<eos> And even while experiencing pain... there's an opportunity to grow and find clarity.<eos> Anything becoming clear?<eos> New York.<eos> It's starting to feel like home.
! - Wha... I got a four-episode sex arc.<eos> You know, now-now that everybody knows they're being filmed, it's more like a reality TV show, and I just can't enjoy it when the people who are being filmed<eos> - Yeah, but what about our show, man?<eos> What about making my mom famous?<eos> - It's just not funny anymore.
- You know what, Charlie? This isn't the dream that I had for Fight Milk.<eos> No!<eos> We're not the diarrhea guys.<eos> - No! - That's not what I want to be.<eos> It's not for women!
Stop!<eos> Cool it! We said one spray and then my line.<eos> I... It was in my contract that we talked... I put one squirt in there for...<eos> on purpose. And this collar! Th-There's something wrong with the collar.<eos> It's driving me nuts.
A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?<eos> - Now you're getting it. - Me. - He's getting it.<eos> - Now he gets it.<eos> The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled to that ticket, and we need you - to tell us who it belongs to. - Yeah.
Get a hold of yourself.<eos> For my Show and Tell, I have... the most awesome cat in the history of time.<eos> Not only is his name Fred, but...<eos> He has just one eye.<eos> Go ahead and count... but I promise you, it's always one.
Now can I say something I wanna say?<eos> Sure.<eos> Before they ruined it, Justin's zoo was the best art project.<eos> By far.<eos> It was awesome.
Ares poisoned men's hearts with jealousy and suspicion.<eos> He turned them against one another and the war ravaged the Earth.<eos> So, the gods created us, the Amazons to influence men's hearts with love and restore peace to the Earth.<eos> And for a brief time, there was peace.<eos> But it did not last.
What are we gonna do?<eos> There is not much we can do if that's who I think it is.<eos> But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.
We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news. It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.<eos> Is it flammable, Chief?<eos> Yes, you said it's hydrogen. It's flammable.
Where did you get this?<eos> I found a carcass.<eos> There is an entire carcass?<eos> What is it worth?<eos> It is priceless.
Wait, wait.<eos> Simple solutions might just cut it.<eos> You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.<eos> Watch these two.<eos> Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.
You'll risk the life of your son?<eos> Zilpha.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I killed him.<eos> James, this powder is not ready to be moved because it is unstable.
Oh, my god, russ!<eos> Did you put a gun in this car?<eos> Damn you!<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> It was in the front seat in a box.
It was in the front seat in a box.<eos> I didn't know it was a gun!<eos> He could have killed himself!<eos> He could have killed all of us!<eos> It was by my feet, russ.
I'm done.<eos> Alright, here you go.<eos> You know what else I know?<eos> You don't like peas.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?
Listen, we are the fucking US military.<eos> We practically invented everything!<eos> And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
You spend a lot of time staring at nothing.<eos> Okay, I take it back.<eos> It's something. It's the big out there.<eos> The ocean is powerful. Mostly it's vast.<eos> It's full of life, mystery.
I really hope it's not up there.<eos> Let's split up.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.
This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.<eos> I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a devious plan to hurt everyone around him.<eos> What happens when he gets up out of that bed?<eos> You got a plan of your own?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.
"Feel the muscles in your body begin to relax.<eos> "Your hands relaxing.<eos> Your eyelids relaxing.<eos> "As you relax, imagine you're sitting in front of a TV."<eos> "When you turn the TV on, it's going to play memories from your life.
I would say high.<eos> Like 100%.<eos> If there's a train station, then there's probably a train.<eos> And if there's a train...<eos> It's going to the Wild Hunt.
Welcome to the festival of the beast.<eos> Where masks symbolize unknown terror.<eos> And we celebrate the day that I vanquished that terror from our land.<eos> But when the two moons become one, the beast forever will return, and it will be worse than ever before.<eos> And it will obliterate everything in its wake.
Tell me, what expert knowledge would this be?<eos> Anna?<eos> We know that this beast will come from the sky.<eos> Where not even the giants can reach.<eos> It will have a heart and it will think, and it will feel, and because of that, it can be killed.
Worship is a volume business.<eos> Whosoever has the most followers wins the game.<eos> Wanna play?<eos> Life is long when you got regret.<eos> A moment can last forever when you can see how it should have gone.
- They don't want us infecting anyone.<eos> - Why isn't it on the TV?<eos> - It's a cover-up.<eos> That's why they invented the fire!<eos> They brought it to Spain, and it spread.
- Huh?<eos> - I don't have...<eos> - Speak up, I can't hear you.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> Where is it?
We did disgusting things like shop together.<eos> Sorry!<eos> And compare what we bought.<eos> That top is perfect for you.<eos> It shows too much of my arms.
What is that?<eos> Hot sauce, horseradish, kale, a raw egg, and, uh, about six other things designed to cure a hangover.<eos> Oh, no, don't smell it.<eos> Just drink.<eos> So, listen, uh, I talked to Mom about the grounding situation and all it entails, and I managed to convince her to stay her ruling, on one condition:
Ex nihilo nihil fit.<eos> "Out of nothing comes nothing."<eos> I just don't like it when people read my... things.<eos> Every poem you write should be like someone reading your things.<eos> It should be terrifying and incredibly embarrassing.
What, you mean this notebook?<eos> - Don't you ever touch me.<eos> - Get out of my house.<eos> - It's not your house.<eos> - You think it's yours?
This steak is the shit.<eos> - Your dad cooks?<eos> - My mom cooks.<eos> My dad, he grills.<eos> - It's so fucking good!
I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.<eos> Are we gonna go back?<eos> Sweetie, could I get... Get that syringe now?<eos> Oh, my God, yes!<eos> Dad, it's in my purse.
Answer, arsehole.<eos> My fist your face, shithead?<eos> See you again, camel driver!<eos> The key to the storage hall.<eos> Let me know when it is empty.
Possibly this bear was infected with something.<eos> That's hemorrhaging from the head-shot.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This bear isn't starving.<eos> It isn't even fucking peckish.
Just puttering around in the garden, honey.<eos> Trying to help things grow and evolve.<eos> Hey, what have you been doing all day behind your closed door there, locked away?<eos> - Working on your secret project? - Yeah.<eos> Well, it won't be a secret for much longer.
- Thank you.<eos> Remember, you're not allowed to sing that one. - Okay.<eos> - You can play it, but you can't sing it.<eos> - Why can't I go to the play?<eos> - It's not really for kids.
And the chef? Not too bad.<eos> The cook's even better.<eos> Madeline, do you want some more bread?<eos> Yes please.<eos> It's so yummy.
A person has to do something.<eos> Well, this something is not that, honey.<eos> - What about your play?<eos> - What about my play?<eos> You said it spoke to you because it was about finding a purpose in life, which I get.
You know, peanut butter.<eos> Man, they loved that shit.<eos> And he's the only one who touched it, only one who bit it.<eos> His saliva.<eos> So, when you test it, you know that it's uncorrupted.
Then she turned out to be a Nigerian man who wanted money.<eos> But, uh...<eos> I live in a small town.<eos> You gotta be on Facebook, though.<eos> You know, 'cause it's like a small town.
- Seriously.<eos> You locked me in the safe.<eos> The office safe?<eos> How can you not remember this?<eos> It was sitting open, and you dared me to get inside, and then you shut the door.
- How much for your gun?<eos> - What?<eos> I-I wanna buy your gun.<eos> How much?<eos> It's not for sale.
Huh? !<eos> You fucked up by coming here.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> I got your drawing.<eos> It's so good.
Anytime.<eos> Carrie.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Well, it started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
Has she been to New York?<eos> I don't know that, either.<eos> Can you get a look at her file?<eos> Well, not without a flare going up, sir.<eos> It's TS/SCI.
Can I borrow your pencil if you're done?<eos> Yep.<eos> Does everyone in Northern Virginia have a security clearance?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It comes with your Starbucks rewards card.
I watched it.<eos> This financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent.<eos> The whole thing is a charade.<eos> The only charade was the deal itself.<eos> It never had a chance.
- No, no, no. Proof.<eos> The- - The real van is in the garage in the house.<eos> The real van?<eos> What do you mean? S-S-Swapped. Switched.<eos> You're saying it's-- it's-- it's in that garage right now.
Push ringers.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> When people said that catering was a shitty job, they weren't kidding.<eos> Okay, oxygen.<eos> Come on, where is it?
We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now I can mail the writ to you. Possibly can you just hand it to me?<eos> My flight leaves for Milwaukee in an hour and a half.<eos> Well, see, it's in the mailroom.
One of them will grow up to cure cancer, but only if the other one dies now.<eos> You don't have to kill the baby yourself, but you do have to nod to make it happen.<eos> Do you nod?<eos> If I nod, how will the baby be killed?<eos> Will it suffer or is it gonna be quick and painless?
I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.
- Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.<eos> Went to the neighbor's trash and threw it in there.<eos> Told you guys it ran away.
I said don't fucking move!<eos> Jesus.<eos> You look just fucking like him.<eos> The president is in the situation room.<eos> It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> N-no, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> It's the one that was in the typewriter - in the fucking beach house.
So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.<eos> You send someone to retrieve the cache, and once it arrives, I take possession of it.
"To invite people to dine with us is to make ourselves responsible for their well-being as long as they are under our roofs."<eos> But he was an 18th century philosopher and gourmand... and these were three children with very little catering experience.<eos> Nevertheless, the Baudelaire orphans snapped into action.<eos> This pasta maker reminds me of the one built by Thomas Jefferson.<eos> Will it work?
What about Charles Vane?<eos> Charles Vane was my closest friend in the world.<eos> Tell me everything about him.<eos> He was the bravest man I ever knew.<eos> Not without fear, just unwilling to let it diminish him.
Mm? This one...<eos> This one's not bad.<eos> - How many pages?<eos> - Nine.<eos> But it's good.
I think I just picked up the equivalent of a sensate STD.<eos> Let them gloat.<eos> Hey, Monsieur Gorilla, where's the ball?<eos> Where did the ball go?<eos> Oh, it's in your goal!
The House suspend.<eos> The House will suspend.<eos> Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.<eos> If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,<eos> I assure him it will satisfy his query.
Katie, no.<eos> If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?<eos> Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy.<eos> As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.<eos> I hope you get in the safe. You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.

You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.<eos> If it's empty, how am I gonna get you $10,000?
I'm calling about your day job.<eos> How soon can you be in Bridgeport?<eos> This time of day, hour and a quarter, little less if I push it.<eos> Listen, I got a score lined up.<eos> It turns into a pumpkin at 4:30 or 5:00.
- Good God, no!<eos> It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?<eos> We recovered this from the body.<eos> It's Richard's.
Ladies highlights in colour.<eos> It's quite lifelike.<eos> As may be, but this is a police station, not a television showroom.<eos> Fell off the back of a lorry, sir.<eos> Just making sure it's still working.
I'm a Lowlands man, myself.<eos> Red brick and chippy with everything.<eos> But, seriously, you must come over.<eos> I keep a pretty descent cellar.<eos> I'm sure whatever state it's in it's better than my own.
He only got Edison at home.<eos> So, this Aston or Ashford, what about them?<eos> Miss Palfrey may have been closer to the doctor than his wife cared for.<eos> There was a divorce.<eos> My source says it was some kind of local cause celebre.
Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism.<eos> Everyone here is on edge, and Hugh, of course, has been beating himself up, but, honestly, I'm relieved.<eos> Calvin was growing very fast, and this has now given me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew.<eos> The box must stay sealed, the lab must stay sealed, no matter the risk to Calvin.<eos> It's just floating.
Suit's running warm.<eos> Like Siberia in summer.<eos> I'm at the transmitter.<eos> Commencing on-site diagnostic.<eos> It's overheated.
There's coolant for the spacesuits.<eos> Commander?<eos> Calvin just came out.<eos> It grabbed my suit.<eos> It's bigger.
How?<eos> Mutate?<eos> Take over a world, kill a bunch of grad students 39 times?<eos> Eh, see, what you feel, the haunted look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere.<eos> Then where does it come from?
So you want to go eat something?<eos> Yeah. That's a better idea.<eos> Look, that's the thief!<eos> I'm a good detective.<eos> Call your phone and see if it rings. Then he can't deny it.
I can't.<eos> I'm preparing for my life vows.<eos> Community recreation is just as important.<eos> Sister Ursula says I need to spend more time on my studies.<eos> The difficulty with television is that it kills the conversation in the room so completely.
The difficulty with television is that it kills the conversation in the room so completely.<eos> Without that cumbersome device to distract us, we can take greater pleasure in our handicrafts.<eos> And in one another's company.<eos> Sister Ursula, are we allowed to know where the television set has gone?<eos> Suffice to say, it is now in a place where it will be enjoyed.
It was in one of the rubbish bins, sir.<eos> Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.
You then walked the stretchered body a mile up the volcano and then left it there to be discovered the next morning.<eos> And then all the pair of you had to do was be patient and wait outside the observatory because for the final piece of your plan to work, you needed Mayor Richards to arrive and act as an unwitting accomplice that you were all present at the observatory that morning.<eos> That way, when we came and checked the door log, it would appear that no-one left or re-entered the building between Stephen leaving and the mayor arriving because Victoria held the door ajar after letting you both back in.<eos> An elaborate yet very clever plan indeed.<eos> And, you know, it almost worked.
They've been watching, probably for...<eos> Who tried to kill you?<eos> It started at the airport. I...<eos> There was a... a red sedan.<eos> It started following me.
No.<eos> Straight trade.<eos> Visit for your passport.<eos> U.S. passport is like gold here.<eos> A few changes, and it can be a ticket to freedom.
Look, I'm the last one to side with Mona.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - She has a point.<eos> If this client loves your design...<eos> No, it's no mine.
- The contact's his office.<eos> I underestimated him.<eos> He's as sneaky as I am.<eos> I have to show you something but you cannot tell anyone.<eos> Ali decides to have the baby and we'll tell people the truth about how it's not really Dunhill's, and it's mine.
Hell isn't where you go when you die, it's what you become when everything you love has been taken away.
Hey, we got you!<eos> You know, there's always one.<eos> There's always one.<eos> You know, I don't care who you are, where you come from, or what you've done.<eos> If your journey has led you here, this is where it's gonna end.
Hey, M.K., don't let them catch you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody here?<eos> This compass belonged to my friend.<eos> What's it doing here?
Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, mom.
Great.<eos> Can I, uh...<eos> We're almost done. I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> And mention my Lily pond.<eos> It's in my garden.
Maybe I can find another way.<eos> There is something you could do.<eos> Give me a piece of that gum.<eos> Piece of gum is going to get us out of prison?<eos> It'll start the process.
Fine, I think there's quite a good chance that Annalise did this.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Her phone.<eos> That she had Oliver clear.<eos> Because it holds information about a lot of bad things we all do.
Where have you been?<eos> - Running.<eos> - For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.<eos> Y-You left your phone. It kept ringing.
And you know what?<eos> I don't think he's going to.<eos> I don't think Howard will let him near Mesa Verde with that tape.<eos> Howard knows it would make hhm look terrible.<eos> If chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.
Not yet, but he will.<eos> There's one person who I know, who can convince him.<eos> Clary?<eos> I made you black coffee with lots of sugar.<eos> It's not as good as Java Jones, but it'll do.
Put in a request for a maritime mission.<eos> Take out a vessel ourselves.<eos> Alec, the ship is glamoured.<eos> It won't show up on the sonar.<eos> Well, it can't hide from us if we run right into it.
I promise.<eos> Well, you look like you could use a drink.<eos> And a towel.<eos> Just, um... Just your phone?<eos> I'd ask what happened to yours, but I'm guessing it got wet.
The demon must be feeding on negative emotions.<eos> Anger, hate, rage.<eos> Causing the host to violently act on those urges.<eos> So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures.<eos> Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.
Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it. It's mine.
Don't worry.<eos> She's with Magnus.<eos> Luke and I are coming for it now.<eos> Just get to the power core. Shut it down.<eos> That way, no matter who touches the sword, it won't turn on.
You're not riding ahead, Mick.<eos> That's why I'm here...<eos> To set you straight.<eos> The amulet.<eos> Why is it so important?
- Wrong, Professor!<eos> This virus is tearing Gotham apart.<eos> That makes your antidote the most valuable thing in the city.<eos> We could demand half of Gotham and the city council deliver it to us on a platter.<eos> So, I'm going to ask you once, where is it?
But if having the virus allowed Gotham to embrace its worst self, the cure should remind us there is always hope.<eos> A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are.<eos> I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.
Serves me right.<eos> Because I let black siren go, one of those guards could have gotten<eos> We almost got prometheus.<eos> Your plan worked. He was there. No.<eos> If it worked, we'd be putting cuffs
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
If you don't like it, shoot me.<eos> As you wish.<eos> This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts into accounts that Gregor controls. Yes.<eos> We know this, to spread among Bratva captains.<eos> It also contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
I--I came to find you.<eos> I was not expecting this.<eos> This...<eos> This is not human.<eos> Anatoly, I told you putting on this hood, it helps me direct the darkness inside of me.
It worked, by the way.<eos> I know what Kovar's planning.<eos> But at what cost?<eos> You're a fool to think a piece of cloth can separate man from monster.<eos> Dividing yourself in two will only make monster stronger until it is stronger than you.
I--I don't think so.<eos> Check out what the elevator's doing.<eos> Yeah, guys.<eos> Curtis is right.<eos> According to the elevator activity logs, the car accelerated upwards at--oh, my God--9 Gs, and then it just dropped into a freefall for 40 stories.
What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I... I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.<eos> Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it and pulls it down, and it burns her hand real bad...
- How would Chase distribute it?<eos> It's aerosolized, so pretty much any way he wants.<eos> We have to find out where Chase is storing this thing and stop him before he releases it.<eos> Cyclotrizane degrades pretty quickly.<eos> Which means that it gives off trackable emissions.
Well, it looks like the Green Arrow is a hero again, whoever he is.<eos> Yup, and the mayor ain't doing too bad either.<eos> The "Sentinel" has got your approval rating back up to 70%.<eos> What?<eos> Was it ever that high?
The whole damn asteroid is moving under its own power.<eos> It's not exactly possible, yet that's what we've got.<eos> Moving to where?<eos> Unknown.<eos> But it's de-orbiting sunward.
- Do we know why?<eos> - We do not.<eos> The Mormon generation ship was heading for Eros before the incident?<eos> Fred Johnson claimed it was an engine test.<eos> But given the Nauvoo's speed and trajectory, it was on a collision course with Eros.
Uh, okay. So we broke a few laws of physics here.<eos> Maybe God's tryin' to play a magic trick?<eos> Eros is what, 7,000 trillion kilos, give or take?<eos> Its temperature's gone up two degrees.<eos> Yeah, it's putting out...
Your words.<eos> I need a moment.<eos> Can you see this O.P.A. ship?<eos> Not in the wake of Eros.<eos> It's radar-dark, too.
Godspeed, cowboys and cowgirl.<eos> Here comes the juice.<eos> Incoming from the Rocinante, 13 minute transmission delay.<eos> The ship is ramping to a 15-G burn to match speed with the target.<eos> It will auto-lock on Eros for the missiles.
- Wait, me first.<eos> - Please.<eos> - All right.<eos> And let me finish.<eos> I've been rehearsing this moment for years, but now that it's here, I'm lost.
I say we use my face and also my dick.<eos> - Okay, and we'll just blur out my midsection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I kind of want to cover it, just if we can pixilate it or blur it out or whatever.<eos> But the big thing is is that we are all going to be nude, and my penis, I don't know if it's adequate enough.

That's what I'm gonna do from now on.<eos> So the next time you're out there and you're alone, you will win.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> H.R. and I just came up with a way to track down Yorkin, and it's... crazy.
What is that?<eos> It's Joe's panic alarm.<eos> He must be on that train.<eos> There's no way that train can stop...<eos> It's not gonna stop in time.
- What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.<eos> I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.
You said you made Savitar?<eos> - How?<eos> - Peep this.<eos> Four years from now, future Flash creates... a time remnant to fight Savitar.<eos> But Savitar lets that remnant live so that it can later become Savitar.
It's a closed loop.<eos> No beginning, no end.<eos> It's just one endless cycle.<eos> Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?<eos> A time remnant, it's, um... it's like a duplicate of you, right?
- Why?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> - Okay.<eos> The accelerometer.<eos> It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts,

The Founder's Day parade.<eos> They ring the charter bell every year.<eos> It's a replica.<eos> The real one went over something called Wickery Bridge in 1992.<eos> Anyway, I have spent the last three weeks sending people into that river to look for that bell, and they haven't found a thing... but I know it still exists, because it can't be destroyed.
All we have to do is step up<eos> - our efforts on the business. - Thank you.<eos> Can you feel me?<eos> I also have something for my youngest.<eos> That little podcast you did the other day... it moved me.
I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> When I found it, yeah.<eos> I thought it was something a customer maybe dropped.<eos> It makes no sense it was out here.
I need to know how to shoot it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Or you might get eaten by a bear.<eos> Is it loaded?<eos> It's loaded.
She is if her legal guardian allows it.<eos> And in addition to being her husband, I am also her legal guardian.<eos> But that piece of paper's not an official document.<eos> It's... it's just a stage prop.<eos> If you look closely enough, I think you'll see that it is figuratively real.
Furnaces of hell!<eos> Baudelaires!<eos> Baudelaires!<eos> I've brought you a present.<eos> It's very sharp.
N-N-No.<eos> No, it's still...<eos> İt's still stolen.<eos> Um, my phone...<eos> You know, my phone is saying where it is.
- Ma'am.<eos> - I'm looking...<eos> I'm looking at it.<eos> I can give you the address.<eos> It's on my fucking phone.
- I'm looking...<eos> I'm looking at it.<eos> I can give you the address.<eos> It's on my fucking phone.<eos> - It is on my fucking phone!
Say what?<eos> I don't know what the fuck that is.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't want any trouble.<eos> My computer was stolen, and this says that it's in there.
- When's the trial?<eos> - Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Start... How long does it go for?
- Starts tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Start... How long does it go for?<eos> - Couple of weeks.<eos> So, when it's over with, what are you... what happens?
See the abnormalities?<eos> I needed to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm.<eos> Leo, you have neurocysticercosis.<eos> A parasitic worm has found its way into your brain.<eos> It's relatively safe while it's still alive, but if it dies, it can be quite serious, so we do need to move quickly.
But she's confusing the past with the present.<eos> That's how this disease works.<eos> It comes in unpredictable waves.<eos> I mean, sometimes the brain is fine.<eos> Sometimes it struggles.
No way!<eos> Not until I get my daughter back.<eos> Even then, I...<eos> The only way I'm gonna get my daughter back is if I return that laptop untouched.<eos> Where is it, by the way?
Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town.<eos> From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world...
You must.<eos> I'm senior captain of the River Vixens.<eos> Is cheerleading still a thing?<eos> Is being the Gay Best Friend still a thing?<eos> Some people say it's retro, I say it's eternal and iconic.
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?<eos> If you want.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - My novel.<eos> It's about this summer, and Jason Blossom.
I'll show him.<eos> Follow me...<eos> Jughead.<eos> Another fun fact about fear.<eos> Sometimes it grows up with you.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Looks like you won.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Here's the thing about fear.<eos> It's always there.

Forget I said anything, okay?<eos> All right. Bye.<eos> I changed my mind about Toledo.<eos> Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?<eos> I don't even care where it's going.
That "Danny's a terrorist" thing, you know, that was my plan B.<eos> Would never have come up if the niqab lady hadn't testified.<eos> You know what?<eos> The law should be pure, like physics.<eos> It should be better than media and politics.

It travels to another realm of existence.<eos> Our subjects each describe, in remarkably similar terms, this place.<eos> They draw this.<eos> Concentric circles.<eos> Scientists and theologians have wrestled for ages about the brain and what happens to it when it fails to function as expected.

- Waldorf salad, thank you.<eos> Could the kitchen make me some tomato finger sandwiches?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, what's the point of a dress if it doesn't send a man straight to the asylum?
I'm gonna need 60 hours a week from everybody, daily reports, lunch is limited to 30 minutes.<eos> Basically, anything going on in your life right now, I recommend you cancel it.<eos> And then go ahead and cancel it again just to make sure that they know that it's... you know, it's cancelled, okay?<eos> You know, this conversation takes me back.<eos> Oh, it takes me back to New York and Harvard and Yale.

Hmm?"<eos> Yeah, you know, it says something more like,
Just the person we were looking for.<eos> I got his test results back.<eos> Iceman's potassium levels are normal.<eos> Potassium is vital for the communication between the nerves and the muscles.<eos> Because it's normal, we actually have a chance of restarting his heart.
It tells you the path that you're meant to take.<eos> You just got to know when to listen.<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you ever seen this?<eos> "The world before me came into focus, "and only then did I realize it was hollow.
Anything?<eos> Convicted sex offender.<eos> We're just hearing now he has nothing in way of an alibi.<eos> Good.<eos> You were on this wall for over an hour, but you can't remember where it was?
Midwife speaking.<eos> Sister Winifred - - Mrs Marsh is in labour.<eos> I can't say this situation doesn't worry me.<eos> And both parents are dwarves, so there's a high chance this baby will be born with the same condition.<eos> It could still be healthy.
You can take it -- as soon as it's born.<eos> We'll give it everything, Marnie.<eos> - It'll be the child we never had.<eos> - It'll be the child you do have, Dot.<eos> It'll be yours.
Don't worry, Auntie Vi.<eos> I'm not sad, I'm happy.<eos> Look at the garden, Patrick. It's so beautiful.<eos> There'll be so much space for the little ones to run around in.<eos> Ah, it's certainly big enough.
Oh, Reggie.<eos> And so we let go of their hands... but not their hearts.<eos> Of the need to be needed but not the need to love.<eos> We're going to a French place.<eos> And if it's French, they'll serve snails, and snails always involve bent pins, garlic butter and finger bowls.
Or has the sun gone to my head?<eos> There is no sun in England in October.<eos> There you go, then. She must be talking sense.<eos> Oh, I'm beginning to wonder if this Cuban crisis will ever be over.<eos> - It does feel never-ending.
Jennifer's footage starts on October 4th.<eos> October 4th?<eos> Wait.<eos> October 4th, October 4th... was the day Cyrus won the vice presidential debates.<eos> Admiral Ballard didn't have a problem with free college when it was his college.
‐ So what kind of cake you gonna have for your birthday tomorrow?<eos> ‐ Mmm... what kind of cake?<eos> I think I might skip out on the cake this year.<eos> ‐ But you have to have cake.<eos> It keeps you sweet for the rest of the year.
Dickon.<eos> I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.<eos> Your first battle?<eos> And?<eos> It was glorious.
My Sara.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is that the virus that's making everyone flip out?<eos> Yes.<eos> It keeps getting worse and worse.
Based on what's happened before this time it feels different.<eos> Someone new could be behind it.<eos> - Is that the vaccine simulation? - Mm-hm.<eos> The infected are exhibiting different traits this time around.<eos> I'm attempting to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the base of the infection.
By themselves, these viruses either have no potency or they run the risk of activating on their own.<eos> But when combined they become an effective, controllable bioweapon.<eos> Nicely done, professor.<eos> It's no wonder you survived Raccoon City.<eos> If the trigger's airborne, it's harder to control where it goes or who gets it.
I love that bracelet, Anita.<eos> Thanks, Maddie.<eos> Thrift store catch.<eos> It's so retro.<eos> Well, actually, it's not...
But believe me when I say our defining moment is near.<eos> This job is not your garden variety snatch and grab.<eos> Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews.<eos> A Google search will tell you he was in a 12-year coma.<eos> It will not tell you how dangerous he is.
Oh. You're the wolf.<eos> Nobody is the... the...<eos> The wolf is the wolf.<eos> The... The... The wolf is you.<eos> It represents your worst fears.
Nobody is the... the...<eos> The wolf is the wolf.<eos> The... The... The wolf is you.<eos> It represents your worst fears.<eos> It comes knockin' on your door, and it's like a... it's like a reckoning, Ramon.
The water in this sponge represents all the experience you absorbed from the real world.<eos> Your consciousness, pain, pleasure.<eos> Love.<eos> Things that the traditional laws of physics don't account for.<eos> Now your brain, it transferred all that stored experience over to here.
Well, try and eat.<eos> You'll feel better.<eos> Hey, Luke, you didn't happen to know anyone involved in that house fire, did you?<eos> House fire?<eos> Yeah, it happened right off-campus.
Is that what it represents?<eos> Now it's yours.<eos> I, uh... I don't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's yours.
Now it's yours.<eos> I, uh... I don't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's yours.<eos> - It has special meaning for you.
I have no fracking idea.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> It's for a school paper.<eos> Yahoo your phone.<eos> It's dead.
He's been interested in addressing juvenile incarceration issues since his days as governor.<eos> We appreciate him making the time for us.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The President's schedule is a bit crowded, but it shouldn't be long.
- Hey, he said he's fine.<eos> Is that my robe?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He said it feels like money.
I should have his location in a couple of seconds.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Something on the other end triggered a kill switch in the tracking chip's code.<eos> It's shutting me out.
I'm me.<eos> And I'm not risking the reputation of this firm without hard proof of innocence.<eos> You're you.<eos> You have your own office.<eos> It's down the hall.
I've never seen so many Secret Service agents in my life, even as First Lady.<eos> You can't always see them, but you can hear them.<eos> It's like having mice in the wall.<eos> When you're president, that sound never stops.<eos> After a while, it becomes white noise, so you have that to look forward to.
We formed a line.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Sergeant.<eos> That's when I saw the drone.<eos> It was waiting.
I'm not your wife.<eos> What?<eos> I said "knife."<eos> You know, I, uh, I got into a fight with a mastodon.<eos> I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]
What did the piece of bread say when it walked into the operating room?<eos> Well, I just got tired of saying things like,<eos> "You need to take this more seriously."<eos> Nothing.<eos> It was coma-toast. [comatose]
Oh, it does.<eos> I just gave Supergirl the remote.<eos> Only she can turn it on.<eos> We should call the DEO.<eos> Get them to let Supergirl know it's ready if she needs it.
 Can I come with you?<eos>  Taking control of your life?<eos>  Trying.<eos>  That smell.<eos> You can't understand how wonderful it is.
I was just reminding Leonard of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.<eos> You familiar with it?<eos> Hap is very familiar with them ol' Baptist queer allegories, ain't you, Hap?<eos> He especially like the one about, Lot, when his wife turned into a pillar of salt right before his eyes.<eos> I was actually referring to the part where Lot takes the angels into his house and finds it surrounded by homosexuals who want to know them.

But it was a taste of, like, being normal.<eos> It's better when you forget there's a whole world outside of this place.<eos> And then maybe you don't feel so bad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've been in the world and it wasn't all that great either.
The Occupation is sending more and more people to the factory every month.<eos> We're just a-a labor force for them, and they're burning through us like firewood.<eos> And it's not just the file.<eos> Broussard and his team found a-a coded countdown hidden in the raps communications.<eos> It ends on the exact day that the bloc will be empty.
Tycho T.C. refuses to release the clamps until Fred Johnson gives his personal authorization.<eos> And he's not.<eos> All right, I'm on it.<eos> I don't have to let you leave, you know.<eos> With all the time and repairs I put into this ship, it's arguably more mine than yours.
- What is it, what?<eos> - I get it.<eos> I see it.<eos> It was easy for your friend because of her eye.<eos> Because it gives her special powers?
Can I use the toilet?<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - I've had a fright.<eos> I need the toilet.<eos> It's down there, first right, second left, past the macaroon dispenser.
That was Molly's bed, was it?<eos> Bed Ten?<eos> Measles, we were in for.<eos> When Molly started to get sick, I... I rang on the bell.<eos> It rang and it rang, but nobody came.
- That what he told you?<eos> I thought that you said you didn't come here for a row.<eos> Come home.<eos> This building houses our new fast breeder reactor, Goldenrod.<eos> It's due to join the national grid this weekend.
You know them?<eos> I don't manage the property on a day-to-day basis.<eos> I inherited it from my grandfather.<eos> I can't tell you much about them, except that they keep the place running.<eos> It's not what it once was.
It's all I need.<eos> Just passing through.<eos> Name, previous address if you have one, checkout's 11:00.<eos> 305.<eos> We have an elevator, but it's not working.
Monroe, can you move?<eos> Camera got knocked over.<eos> They had to have come from behind the dresser.<eos> Check behind it.<eos> It's hollow.
Turpentine might work.<eos> It's natural, made from pine sap, but still pretty toxic.<eos> How long would it take to make another batch?<eos> Don't need to, I'll just bring the turpentine to you.<eos> It's not harmful to pregnant women, is it?
I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?<eos> I thought it went away when Nick saw it.
So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?<eos> I thought it went away when Nick saw it.<eos> No, we don't really know for sure what it was doing.
Well, in this case... It means "child bride."<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> That's why she was speaking in Russian.<eos> This beast wants our daughter.<eos> Well, it's not gonna get her.
Come on, honey.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key.<eos> Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.
I showed this to Renard and Adalind.<eos> It looks like Zerstoerer.<eos> And the staff he's carrying is pretty similar too.<eos> Except his had a lot of cracks in it.<eos> Well, I mean, if it's as old as this one, it would make sense it had a bunch of cracks in it.
Is it wrong to hope for love in a marriage?<eos> When you wed Francis, did you not marry for love?<eos> I married for what I thought was love.<eos> The illusion lasted barely a year.<eos> My marriage to Mr Warleggan was not founded on romance, yet it is altogether more successful.
Mass murderer.<eos> I pressed root beer, not ginger ale.<eos> It's not fair!<eos> What's wrong with ginger ale?<eos> It's good for blood loss, you know that?
Two minutes till showtime.<eos> Anyway.<eos> You hired this Saint?<eos> Genesis is too dangerous.<eos> Once we saw it wouldn't go back with us, we told him it had to be destroyed.
Then he threw up by the swing sets.<eos> But I wasn't that mad, you know?<eos> He was always throwing up and falling off of things.<eos> I wasn't that mad 'cause... he wore a suit and tie.<eos> I don't know where it came from.
Good, good.<eos> Well, you're off to a good start.<eos> I guess the only thing left is for you to show me where my desk is.<eos> Right.<eos> It's, right inside that office right there.
If her husband didn't open the door himself, the killer would have had to use a programmed phone to do it.<eos> Is that possible, Mike?<eos> Mr. Bloom giving his phone away?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I'm pinging his cell, and right now it looks like it's on its way back from Catalina. ...Richard could have left him on Catalina and come back and shot him. Your ex hated your new husband that much?
"Let's put something in the microwave,"<eos> and I can't make anything except scrambled eggs and toast, and I need a toaster for that.<eos> So anyway, last night, we gave in<eos> - and, uh, went to a restaurant. - Which restaurant was that?<eos> Uh, it was the only one on that side of the island.
Tried to hide his height, because he was aware that the bus could tape him.<eos> Everyone knows this, Mark.<eos> But do you know what this says about your successful businessman, Richard Bloom?<eos> Out of all the phones at his disposal, Picky Ricky selected this one because he's methodical, choosey.<eos> Our successful businessman chances nothing, and in my oh-so-humble opinion, that's what I think this phone is a mistake because it reveals his character.
But we still have no hard evidence that Paul Bloom's our shooter, whether or not he was inside the Chandlers' house that night.<eos> Ah. Here we go, Paul.<eos> Does this look familiar?<eos> Now let's find out when you last used OffKey.<eos> Then we'll run your cell to Chandler's house, see if it sets off an alert.
Yeah, OK. You can't walk here.<eos> It hasn't been fed... It hasn't been fed for two days.<eos> I'm very worried.<eos> - All right, where's your child?<eos> - No, no, it's a baby.
Believe me, the King does not love me for my ability to bear children, let alone look after them.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Have you found the murderer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it?
Yeah, there's a little spur line there off the 11.<eos> Lise. Lise.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Curry's phone went out in the middle of nowhere<eos> and there it sat for five hours until it died.
What is that, a gun?<eos> He says he has no idea how the gun got up there.Nt.<eos> All right, what are our options?<eos> It's not gonna be easy getting it out.<eos> It's just past his sphincter.

And then it was over.<eos> My wife was gone.<eos> When did rachel pass?<eos> Last year... ovarian cancer.<eos> It took her so fast.
No, not him.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he shouldn't go.<eos> I'll go in his place.<eos> I thought this world didn't mean anything to you, that it wasn't real.

My plan will rebuild the world that you have grown accustomed to... one where Inhumans are hunted.<eos> And we control the rest.<eos> It doesn't hurt that both of us are unstoppable.<eos> But your plan is flawed.<eos> It's too clean.
- I'm ready.<eos> Good job, sweetheart.<eos> Ah, I wish everyone was as good at packing as you are.<eos> Hey, Mack, I can't find my suitcase.<eos> It was just here a minute ago.
I thought you said you never lie.<eos> Well, I lied when I said that.<eos> Well, are you sure the baby's mine?<eos> - I mean, do you even know?<eos> - It's yours, Ricky.
It's got my photo on it.<eos> - Um, what?<eos> - Something that's not normal.<eos> I'm supposed to be a normal piper here.<eos> Get that safe open. The 11 million bucks aren't in there. It's too small.
No, thanks.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to write that paper tonight.<eos> For Dietrich's class? Yeah.<eos> What's it about?
Yes!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Svetlana...<eos> You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?<eos> It's not packed because one of us has been at work for the last three hours.
Does he?<eos> Yes.<eos> You see, before he sacrificed himself for our sins, our Lord gave a final gift to humanity... He fathered a child.<eos> For generations, The Grail has protected this holy lineage in preparation for one event... The End Of The World.<eos> Only God knows exactly when, but it will be soon.
And...<eos> There's something clipped onto his rib.<eos> Good lord!<eos> There's wire attached.<eos> It runs underneath the skin.
William, if this device is only one way, then how was Gillies able to hear what we were saying?<eos> William, what are you doing?<eos> I'm looking for a microphone.<eos> There has to be a microphone.<eos> Where does it go to?
Now, just leaving aside what you do hear.<eos> What don't you hear?<eos> What you don't hear is music and singing and thousands of people out in the streets celebrating Saint Ursula.<eos> The carnival passes right along this street here.<eos> It's so loud my ears are still ringing from last night, yet there are no carnival sounds here.
- All locked.<eos> I checked.<eos> What about that fire escape?<eos> Can that be opened from the outside?<eos> No, it only opens one way.
I'm Violet Baudelaire, and these are my siblings...<eos> Klaus and Sunny, of course, of course.<eos> Come in. Come in!<eos> - The doorbell didn't appear to be working.<eos> - It's disconnected.
If you're implying what I think you're implying, you don't think that's a little fast?<eos> Even by your modern standards?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose, after all we've been through, a kiss would seem quaint.<eos> It would seem old-fashioned.
It's the name of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.<eos> - I just don't get it.<eos> - Please be more specific.<eos> That could be a very long list.<eos> Okay, even assuming the Legion took the Spear fragment from here, how did they know it was here?
You don't get the reference?<eos> Ugh, pity.<eos> Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor, I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?
- and its protector.<eos> - The beer, Professor.<eos> Oh, make it a six-pack.<eos> So how far are we from the delineator?<eos> Uh, looks like it's just up ahead.
Cadmus has them penned up in cells that are rigged to kill them.<eos> All Lillian has to do is press one button.<eos> I can't disable it myself.<eos> But in the DEO armory, there's a magnetic field disrupter.<eos> It will shut down the cages.
It's under control.<eos> - Is that why you called?<eos> - No, actually.<eos> I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship.<eos> At the moment it seems to be in low orbit.
Nothing.<eos> You got a pen?<eos> What you doing, Mick?<eos> Writing a screenplay.<eos> It's gonna be a killer.
Ema!<eos> Angel, we have class now.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> With his friend.<eos> Who is it?
I was there.<eos> It was easy.<eos> Do you know anything about audiovisual equipment?<eos> I can't get it to play.<eos> I know it works.
Of course, we don't have all the information. Of course.<eos> It's not outside the realm of possibilities.<eos> It... it could've been more like...<eos> "Ooh!<eos> It's stuck in the clarinet.
Man's tie is a window into his soul.<eos> We just ran a piece on it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So, uh, what does my tie say about me?<eos> It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.
Freeze!<eos> Put your hands up!<eos> Put your hands up! Get over there.<eos> - You stole our gun?<eos> - No, it was in her belt.
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea, then how about I tell the rest of the force?<eos> Cos that'll go down well, shagging your colleague's girlfriend. You'll be trusted undercover.<eos> Helen, I didn't come here to have a scrap with you.<eos> I came here because...<eos> Yes, to talk to you about the baby, but also to say that, if it is mine... and I reckon there's a pretty high chance it is, don't you...? that I want to be a part of its life.
I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.<eos> And well, it reminded me of you.
- Why?<eos> Those pods, what's in them?<eos> - I got it wrong.<eos> I got it very, very wrong.<eos> The colony ship isn't on the way, it's right here.
- Yeah.<eos> - Teaching.<eos> But what is the ether?<eos> What kind of substance has such remarkable properties?<eos> One has to twist all of physics into knots just to make it work, but it must exist, or else...
I already have, 20 times.<eos> It's not an anomaly.<eos> This sample must contain a new element.<eos> A radioactive element.<eos> It would have to be hundreds, no thousands of times stronger than uranium.
And how could she despise the woman who gave birth to her only grandson?<eos> Look at those cheeks!<eos> He's the spit and image of his grandfather.<eos> Dollie, have you seen my tie?<eos> I believe I saw it hanging over the bathroom door, darling.
Marie.<eos> Come see what we've found...<eos> Don't look.<eos> You believed it would be 1,000 times stronger than uranium.<eos> This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even pure.
Charlie: Fat embolism from femoral fractures...<eos> He's tachycardic with ventilation issues.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> We need to attack the fat directly.<eos> It's in a thousand tiny pieces.
He just got on with it.<eos> Even this age, he was twice the man I was.<eos> I just feel rage.<eos> All the time.<eos> It's just always there.
That's what I was trying to tell you.<eos> See? He's got a gun.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. No, I swear I saw a gun.<eos> It was... It was in his hand.
You could have killed me, you crazy bitch!<eos> I thought it was...<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It kind of looks like a gun, doesn't it?
It's time to earn it.<eos> I think I've already earned it.<eos> Not until the job is finished.<eos> If this were to come out, where do you think the axe would fall?<eos> Where does it always fall?
Phil Simms.<eos> CIA meeting exactly the same time as Linda disappeared.<eos> Mysterious friend Rachel.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> The CIA angle, it's not a bit fanciful?
'Thanks, Dom.'<eos> Oh, Jason!<eos> Dad told me about coming here.<eos> He said he liked your house.<eos> He said it was crazy.
What you doing here?<eos> Clean enough?<eos> This ride should get you to Chicago.<eos> Keep my phone, all right?<eos> And make sure it stays on.
Dumb face.<eos> Any idea what he was carrying?<eos> - Trash.<eos> - What makes you say "trash"?<eos> It was in a trash bag.
Do we have anything else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got something.<eos> St. Patrick gave me this phone.<eos> It came from a Lobos contact,
You know, like, I think I might actually be in love.<eos> I got to get her addicted to my pheromones.<eos> Uh, we got a meth problem.<eos> Uh, my finger.<eos> It's...

Albert, Albert, watch out!<eos> Just watch where you're going, please.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Why should either of us?<eos> According to you, if that automobile was a particle, but we didn't see it, it wouldn't have been there at all.
Hitler is a madman.<eos> Imagine how he would use such a weapon.<eos> He could obliterate London, Moscow.<eos> Many years ago, Fritz Haber tried to convince me his poison gas would end the war more quickly.<eos> It only made it more horrific.
Although I do like to keep up with the latest developments.<eos> I suppose I still harbor the fantasy I could be a real physicist like you.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> The topic that most interests me is atomic fission.<eos> The journals say that it will become a source of energy more powerful than coal or even oil.
Very fucked up.<eos> Why the hell would she do that?<eos> To kill your friend.<eos> I told Moon to relax, but she's all, "Baby's too evil.<eos> "It might hurt more people."
- Yeah, that would be good.<eos> - And for the vetting...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - the Judiciary Committee has asked to send them everything that you've ever written on abortion.<eos> Well, I can give them my actual abortion if I could find it lying around here somewhere.
What is it?<eos> What do you see?<eos> It's another body.<eos> Another one?<eos> The drone... it's stuck.
Whatever you do here, it won't bring your family back.<eos> No one needs to die.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Please. The engine room is right below us.<eos> If it blows, you'll destroy the whole ship.
Phosphoromancy.<eos> Ugh. I'm an idiot.<eos> Correct.<eos> Shut up, I--remembered.<eos> Uh, okay, so the viewing device, it's in Professor McKellan's office.
Pardon me?<eos> I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.<eos> And it's a stinker.<eos> I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.
Hey.<eos> How are you settling in the office?<eos> I pick things up easily.<eos> Like disability checks?<eos> It's a bit small, that office, for just the two of you.
No, you haven't!<eos> All you've done is ruined a perfectly good campervan.<eos> No, I haven't!<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> It's bullet-proof all over!
Right, going down.<eos> Roger. Going down.<eos> Dear!<eos> I've loaded the gun with a high-explosive shell.<eos> It's a tracer shell, so we'll be able to monitor its progress as it arcs toward the target.
Many months later,<eos> I was ready to unveil my third attempt... an impregnable fortress.<eos> Yeah!<eos> This is bug-out heaven!<eos> I've used as my inspiration the armoured personnel carrier from Aliens, on the basis that if it can protect Sigourney Weaver from that metal bitey thing with teeth, it can keep me safe from Jeremy Clarkson and James May.
Sadly, though, Jeremy's turn of speed only made things worse.<eos> Power! Power!<eos> Come on!<eos> Slow down!<eos> It's falling apart!
You could have cable-knit wool.<eos> But it's nice, it's cosy.<eos> Desperately looking around.<eos> - His jumper would make quite a good car seat.<eos> - Cosy. It's nylon!
This mixes the fuel with the air, and then, with no trickery at all, blows it up!<eos> Of course, that does mean the GS F isn't very kind to animals. And that's a bad thing, make no mistake.<eos> But on the upside, listen to the noise it makes!<eos> At medium revs, it sounds baleful, like a... lonely dog.<eos> But when you build the revs up, it sounds like what it is: a normally aspirated five-litre V8.
Time.<eos> That's very funny.<eos> That wasn't a joke.<eos> [THE ANDROID] I've spent the last 48 hours analyzing the Blink Drive and am still no closer to a solution.<eos> I don't know why it self-initiated or how to repair it.
This is perfect.<eos> Another Blink Drive is just what we need.<eos> We head down there, we grab it, we get the hell outta here.<eos> The signal is too weak to pinpoint from orbit.<eos> But I have determined that it's somewhere within a small community called Fort Falls, Wisconsin.
Great.<eos> There's just...<eos> One small problem.<eos> [Three] All that crap you brought with you. You didn't have room for one little data file?<eos> [Adrian] I didn't know it was that important.
You remember how I told you that this null space bubble that we're in was not much larger than the station?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I know that because I've been sending out radar signals to help define the outer edges of the bubble.<eos> So?<eos> So it now appears that it's shrinking...
So it now appears that it's shrinking...<eos> Collapsing in on itself.<eos> My God. When we first arrived here, it was over three kilometers in diameter.<eos> It's now less than two and half.<eos> How much longer until it breaches the outer edges of the station?
Affirmative.<eos> Tactical nuclear device.<eos> It appears to be targeting the platform.<eos> What about the shuttle?<eos> It hasn't launched.
Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?

A forest ranger I knew years ago told me about a mother brown bear who gave birth to three cubs.<eos> The rangers stayed nearby to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs.<eos> They intervened and took the last baby, a male.<eos> Why did it do that?<eos> Well, while they were caring for the cub, they discovered that it was suffering from fever and infection.

These things come in threes.<eos> I wonder what's next.<eos> Larry, when you say things like that, it makes people who don't get you think that you're not really upset about what happened.<eos> Oh, no, I'm devastated.<eos> That wrench came from Germany. It's irreplaceable.
Before that regent even touched his sword, I slit his throat.<eos> Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.<eos> It's what makes you faster, stronger, smarter.
Estrella, do you know what this is?<eos> Yes.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's found all over the property.<eos> The piece of a meteor, and it's what allows you to walk during the day.
So your 43 boob dollars are gonna get us to Texas?<eos> Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.<eos> Sweaty but ready.<eos> All right, can y'all folks lock up?<eos> I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.
Try Taylor Mason.<eos> They have become something of a prodigy, a go-to.<eos> Anything big Axe is wading into, Taylor's there with a snorkel mask.<eos> I believe it's time, nay, long past time, to transform your charitable arm and engender a permanent foundation.<eos> Properly stewarded, it will write the name of your benevolence on the ages, alongside Carnegie, Vanderbilt. A creation of consequence.
Hey, what do you think of my tie?<eos> I designed it myself.<eos> I call it Yoloha.<eos> It's a combination of YOLO and aloha.<eos> Well, Buzzy, I think it's rad.
And did the undercover piece as a homeless woman.<eos> Yeah, you ate out of a Dumpster.<eos> And I will continue to do those things with a series of specials that will be coming to you from our digital platforms.<eos> - It's the future, right?<eos> - I tried my damnedest, but this world is just... it's full of snakes and snares and...
- It's not in here.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't have my diary.<eos> - Then look harder!<eos> - It's gotta be in there!
- Well...<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I wanna look at the menu.<eos> And I gotta say I'm not sure this crystal is right.<eos> - I think it's a little elitist.
- Yes.<eos> - What, he's mine, or he could be mine?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> But it could be yours.
I would, but I can't take these pants off.<eos> Max, come on.<eos> You can't let one bad experience ruin everything.<eos> Otherwise, I'd never use our bath mat again.<eos> It's hot for no reason.
The last message he had from him was from the mall.<eos> That is where we must go.<eos> Why?<eos> For us to offer those who trespass against the natural order of things.<eos> Only after the disease is purged will it move away from here and leave us in peace, in harmony with each other once again.
There.<eos> The train and the main road. Tomek, do you have. Anything that can help us?<eos> Explosives on the rails.<eos> The train destroys itself.<eos> It tips over like a broken toy.
You know that window up there, Percy says in his notes that he thinks the killer broke in that way.<eos> Why didn't she hear him?<eos> Don't know.<eos> A remote.<eos> I wonder what it controls.
Or underestimate mine.<eos> You still haven't been elected president, sir.<eos> Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once the party turns its back on you, will it?<eos> When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line, you'll be begging to come in from the cold.<eos> And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind and realizing it was the beginning of the end.
Check in with your section leaders.<eos> We'll get a head count as soon as we can.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can anyone hear me?<eos> Look, we're caught in the rain, and it burns.
You come home safe.<eos> I got this.<eos> Raven says the black rain will be here soon.<eos> Raven's right.<eos> I used to love the rain. Now it terrifies me.
- What colour was the festival wristband?<eos> - Blue, wasn't it?<eos> - Aye, blue.<eos> That means she got it in advance.<eos> It's the VIP one.
They built a bunker?<eos> Their whole theology was based on riding out the end of the world.<eos> I have bad news, Abby.<eos> Black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact.
Of course you can.<eos> Look at it this way.<eos> You can fumble your way through another interview, telling them about the time you got a piece of cerebral cortex<eos> - in your mouth...<eos> - It wasn't in my mouth.
No.<eos> It was in the news.<eos> The therapy cat at the old folk's home?<eos> Yeah, they said it had this gift.<eos> Whenever someone was about to die, without fail, it would curl up with them.
No. No, no, this is working.<eos> Keep going.<eos> No, Layla.<eos> The bowel has lost blood supply.<eos> It's necrotic.
Easy.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hurts?<eos> No.<eos> It's just broken.
What's so special about lithium?<eos> It's the main component in all modern high-capacity batteries.<eos> Everything from smart phones to electric cars.<eos> Lithium powers the things that power everything.<eos> It's quickly becoming the new oil.
Starting about when my parents got divorced.<eos> But then, when Josie and I split up, that was, like, rock bottom.<eos> You know, because I had spent ten years convincing myself that I wouldn't end up like my parents.<eos> You know, that my marriage was gonna be different.<eos> And then, all of a sudden... it, uh, wasn't.
Kevin!<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That monologue at the end?<eos> - God, it was incredible!
- It's your moment.<eos> - You did it.<eos> You got your dream job.<eos> Lauren wants coffee before the board presentation.<eos> Oh, it's in the kitchen, where she can make it herself.
I've been looking at traffic camera footage from that night.<eos> This is a junction a quarter of a mile from Tim's flat.<eos> I didn't spot a taxi, but I looked for vehicles resembling a minicab.<eos> And this dark Mercedes E-class saloon passes through at 23:31 heading in the direction away from Tim's flat.<eos> And here it is earlier that evening at 18.36 heading towards Tim's flat.
Help him, DC Desford.<eos> For the tape, the interviewee is being shown a vehicle registration number.<eos> That's my car.<eos> So we have this vehicle crossing this junction and then coming back a few hours later.<eos> Now, the reason we're interested in this particular junction is because it serves an address just a few hundred yards away where, on the night in question, a member of the police forensic staff was murdered.
Real crystal, not like my mom's glass, - but she's like, "It's crystal."<eos> - What about the robot?<eos> Yeah, there's a robot, you know?<eos> Ah, there is a robot.<eos> It's...
Hey!<eos> What?<eos> No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.
Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.<eos> I don't need to read it.<eos> I'll make it.<eos> You should read it.<eos> It's pretty fucking wild.
I'm working out as hard as I can.<eos> I had a baby six months ago.<eos> My hips are still in the wrong place, every time Cherry makes us jump rope, I leak a little, but, you know, I'm here.<eos> It's not the workouts. The problem is you think wrestling is stupid.<eos> Well, it is stupid.
But... the second time I wasn't.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I was sober and insecure and I think I was acting out of this deep well of resentment I didn't even know I had and it was just... buried.<eos> And then every... It all came out and... fucked up a real friendship.<eos> But then, I found wrestling... and it saved me.
Don't get so much camping and fishing in anymore.<eos> Pretty busy with work.<eos> Forget work.<eos> Soon as I'm all marrowed up, I am gonna take you to the best waterfall in starved rock.<eos> It's, like, way off the beaten path.
- Don't mind paying retail.<eos> Casey...<eos> Little problem with your equipment request.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's only half-filled.
Yes, I do.<eos> Come on, get up.<eos> Quickly.<eos> There is a fire.<eos> It started in the Royal Wardrobe.
I could fly low, reduce our speed to 80 knots.<eos> We need to find a way to extract them.<eos> - I wish we had that grappling hook.<eos> - Wait, ferry approaching.<eos> - Can it make it?
#PrimaryProblems.<eos> What's your point, Ms. Goines?<eos> The Witness also kept a diary.<eos> Seen it with my own eyes in Monkey Mansion.<eos> It's like their bible, from Genesis to Revelation back to Genesis again.
Well, great.<eos> Get going then.<eos> 'Cause you were late last time, and I had to deal with Roger from TAC-LBC saying how I run a loose ship.<eos> This ship isn't loose.<eos> It's full of holes and sinking fast.
Someone threw it in.<eos> Probably from around here.<eos> I saw it...<eos> And I got it, what's your point?<eos> - The point is it's garbage!
Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.
- Bram?<eos> - They killed everyone!<eos> - Who did?<eos> - The RAPs.<eos> After we blew up the ship, they hit the camps with some kind of weapon, and it just disappeared.
Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> A few days later, on a snowy night, a young woman in white knocked on the door and asked for shelter.<eos> The snow didn't stop for days.<eos> When it did, the young woman asked if she could live with them.
Good.<eos> Now we know the many ways we might die today, why don't you tell us what we have to do to live?<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?<eos> Oh, so you can talk. I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here.<eos> I got you. I got you.<eos> I got you. Of course he gets the hug.<eos> - You chose the machine?<eos> - Yeah. I did. It's back at the lab, where we need...
I don't know, but he said it was urgent.<eos> Is this about the deposition?<eos> Uh, no, actually, this is about a different nightmare scenario.<eos> I've been running diagnostics on the timer chip you recovered from Arkani's factory, and it is far more impressive than anything we've seen from the NMB or any extremist group for that matter.<eos> In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because... we did make it.
We all did.<eos> - Mom!<eos> How was the test?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, how did it go?
I'm just gonna check your bandage, okay?<eos> I... I wasn't... uh, I wasn't gonna put in... in the order.<eos> They switch you on, and they, uh, switch you off, and they've got di... diagrams a... and conditions, and...<eos> Claire, we're monitoring your pacemaker...<eos> - Hmm? - ...and it's working beautifully.
Grizzly Steppe was a Russian hack on the Vermont power grid last year.<eos> Don't ask me how I know that.<eos> This code... is identical.<eos> It's been injected into ETB Energy and will cause a Chicago blackout in nine hours.<eos> And why is it on your computer?
Very few.<eos> In fact, hasn't your method been banned by police in Canada and England?<eos> I wouldn't call it banned.<eos> They've chosen not to use it.<eos> Because it resulted in too many false confessions?
Okay, it is done.<eos> We've removed one piece of metal.<eos> Looks like shrapnel.<eos> Good, it's all good.<eos> How big is it?
Okay.<eos> I'll behave.<eos> Good.<eos> Now what's going on with our Ventura Bridge retainer?<eos> Is it coming?
It's programed to take on characteristics of hobbyists sites.<eos> - Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.
- Adds personality.<eos> - Okay, so turn it off.<eos> If you invented this bot, turn it off.<eos> If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.<eos> - It's pretending to be me.
What happens with the first embryo?<eos> That one, Ms. Salano's embryo, is used for its genetic contribution, that's all.<eos> Then it's destroyed?<eos> It's not destroyed.<eos> It's no longer viable.
We are in some very odd areas of contract law now.<eos> No, this is about life, Your Honor.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> The existing embryo is property.<eos> The only question is: who does it belong to?
All right.<eos> Anything else, Counselor?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a quick rebuttal witness.<eos> But it'll be really brief.
S-so I should answer, Your Honor?<eos> Please.<eos> It's not true... him putting the episode online for political reasons.<eos> Fisk thought this episode was his best work.<eos> And he thought it was going to win him an Emmy.
- What about me?<eos> What about you?<eos> - How much money did I give to Trump?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I didn't check your contribution 'cause it doesn't fit my narrative.
My curiosity is whetted.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I like mysteries.<eos> Could you find out how this list might come back to hurt this firm?<eos> - Are we sure it will?
Let's find out where my father was before he died.<eos> It's working.<eos> An island.<eos> I know this isle from many nautical charts.<eos> It had dealings with Neverland.
Maybe they took shelter there.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Sabine, what about the power source you detected?<eos> Different location, and close.<eos> But thanks to the storm, I can't get a precise reading about where or what it is.
How's it going out there?<eos> This storm is gonna seriously damage my paint job.<eos> I meant with the mission.<eos> We're closing in on the power source.<eos> It's just up ahead.
There's a breeze. Whoa.<eos> Watch your step, Master Jedi.<eos> It's a long way down.<eos> Whoa. I tracked the bug to this shaft.<eos> But it severed the bridge, so I've never been able to get across.
It fits perfectly.<eos> Yes, I think this is what Uriel was trying to tell me.<eos> Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete.
You guys, it's a record label.<eos> The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.<eos> And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?<eos> It's a vanity label.<eos> It exists only to make this one guy's music.
And what's the protocol?<eos> Just...<eos> It's protocol, all right?<eos> Just simmer down.<eos> Well, I'd like to know what it is.
My God.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I think I... That's it.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> I see the rebar, and it's in... Sticking out of, like, a reddishbrown substance.
About... what it would do to her.<eos> Seeing your face on the news, sent to prison?<eos> That would haunt her for the rest of her life.<eos> Frank.<eos> You have a choice, and I don't know what it is, but please, just figure something out.
There is something happening to magic.<eos> The wellspring in Fillory.<eos> - The current is sputtering.<eos> - And they're trying to fix it.<eos> Maybe it's going to disappear.
- Guidance?<eos> - It was the darnedest thing.<eos> The Lem appeared for a second, but it looked like it was about to crash on the lunar surface.<eos> - Where the hell is the command module?<eos> - It's spinning off course.
My grandfather's happiness, my father's happiness, that's real.<eos> -Excusetheinterruption.<eos> Butyoumightwanttobrace forimpact.<eos> - Good news, we found the command module.<eos> Bad news, it's heading straight for a bunch of space rocks.
It's hard to explain, but we need to know where the knight is buried.<eos> You abducted me from the middle of a battlefield to ask about an old myth?<eos> There is a war on, you fools!<eos> And I imagine that the view from the trenches is pretty bleak.<eos> It looks to me like the end of the world.
How will they sanction it without being made public?<eos> We will do what you do as usual.<eos> Act first and think later.<eos> According to statistics, a Western hostage of the Islamic State... has a 25% probability of living.<eos> - And if it is an agent?
What are the options?<eos> Destroy or not destroy that camp.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Can not destroy it if our agent is there.<eos> I have not said that it is.
We use what works.<eos> Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, did not he?<eos> The exact same.<eos> Do not ever put it on, it's a pity.<eos> It comes from looting, like the rest.
- I'll be right back.<eos> - Good.<eos> Are you willing to give up what I can offer you for a hostage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then it is not a simple hostage.
Do you want us to participate in the operation with a dron?<eos> In exchange for sharing the source.<eos> A dron in exchange for a source.<eos> I imagine it's worth it.<eos> It is capable of giving us a hostage, so it is very well placed.
You won't be in trouble.<eos> We'll make sure of it.<eos> Do you see Josephine's boyfriend?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, it was quite big.
Velez is lying?<eos> His answers make him a match.<eos> Why would he lie to kill himself?<eos> The algorithm can't tell me that.<eos> It only tells me he's not who you're looking for.
Space...<eos> The final frontier.<eos> Final because it wants to kill us.
He's just along for the ride.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> It's standing FOR him?<eos> Gyro stabiliser, magnetic boots, and gloves, onboard computer.<eos> It could run, jump, and update his Facebook.
Nice girl, actress, bit orange, left me for an AI in a call centre.<eos> What killed the crew of this station?<eos> 'I am unaware of any recent deaths.'<eos> What about the oxygen.<eos> Where did it all go?
Oh, listen to that.<eos> Still saucy after all these years!<eos> Explain.<eos> 'Oxygen is available for personal use only, at competitive prices.'<eos> It's only in the suits.
Did you see him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> I'm sorry. That creature killed him.<eos> What is it?
Why's it going dark?<eos> The sun's setting.<eos> No, it's the beast.<eos> It's circling us, it's looking for a way in.<eos> It's getting stronger again.
Monster!<eos> Sorry?<eos> Monster!<eos> There!<eos> Oh! It's coming!
And if Jorpf, or whatever he calls himself, was just a friend, why were you wearing your date-night clothes?<eos> What?<eos> That blue sweater I put on you in episode 204 of our relationship.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean.
That blue sweater I put on you in episode 204 of our relationship.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean.<eos> "I don't know.<eos> It was all I had clean."
Good.<eos> Good, good, good, good, good.<eos> Josh sent me to the Jessup family farm to get more information about Summer's whereabouts the night Margaret died.<eos> She claims not to remember anything, so in order to re-create her experience, I will drink a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca.<eos> Users claim it can give you a spiritual awakening, as well as intense diarrhea.
Could you just give me a minute, please? I'm finding this really hard.<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I use your loo? Yes.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's by the front door.
I'm not going to take that chance.<eos> Do it, Mother.<eos> We'll say they broke in.<eos> We struggled for the gun.<eos> It went off.
Mind you, at least you've got some.<eos> Oh, and I found your diary.<eos> Very entertaining.<eos> Where did you find...?<eos> It were under your pillow.
Yes.<eos> I asked them to make your drink.<eos> Shall I bring it in?<eos> You don't need to apologise, Grace.<eos> But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it'll find a home.
He's probably ill.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> Anyway, I'll call round and I could bring him some of that soup that's left over.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yes, it suits you - unreliable, noisy, and good at getting people into trouble!
Well, maybe.<eos> Anyway, I'll call round and I could bring him some of that soup that's left over.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yes, it suits you - unreliable, noisy, and good at getting people into trouble!<eos> Actually, it's not mine.
Did you hear about the symbol in the field?<eos> What symbol?<eos> Burnt into the ground, but no-one seems to know what it means.<eos> I bet it was the aliens!<eos> What does it look like?
Yes?<eos> What was that noise?<eos> Noise?<eos> One minute.<eos> It's beautiful.
What if we have to run again?<eos> I managed perfectly well the last time.<eos> Shh!<eos> What's that sound?<eos> It's coming from behind the house.
I mean, how long before they...<eos> Oh, we don't... We don't know exactly.<eos> I knew America did terrible things, but I never thought... I mean, people's food.<eos> I know it's hard understanding these things, seeing these things.<eos> But the world... It doesn't work the way a lot of people here think that it does.
You're lucky that you've garnished this much of my time.<eos> I have plenty to do!<eos> Tons of lots of things!<eos> I have a thriving incubator.<eos> It is thriving.
I did.<eos> But there was so much blood.<eos> Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever that is.<eos> Yeah, there may be sin inside of you, and that's what you treat it, believe it.<eos> It'll be there forever.
Hold on a second.<eos> What exactly happened?<eos> Okay, the night I drove up to the cabin, when Robbie was stabbed...<eos> I saw the same red truck yesterday.<eos> It was Robbie's.
I need to know what I'm working with.<eos> I threw it out this morning.<eos> I thought it was my last dose.<eos> I need to get your file.<eos> It's in my car.
Call me back with it, okay?<eos> You know you're aiming for the can, right?<eos> Well, then, show men.<eos> You just have to be one with the gun.<eos> It's an extension of you.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> I kill people.<eos> How?<eos> There's a drug.<eos> It's fatal.
- Not enough.<eos> - Enough for what?<eos> Freedom.<eos> So you're breaking the law for freedom?<eos> The law is wrong, and it will change.
Early word is it's some sort of waterborne bug.<eos> It can't live in the air, which is why we gave the okay to let you out of quarantine.<eos> Yeah, but it's not all good news.<eos> I mean, this bug, or whatever it is, it's hardy.<eos> I mean, it made it past both of our disinfection safety nets.
He used our equipment to synthesize a virus, making it chlorine and UV resistant.<eos> Then what doesn't make sense?<eos> Well, what the virus does.<eos> It's basically a harder-to-kill serotype 40 adenovirus.<eos> It's non-lethal.
What is his story?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's really into lollipops, and he's tired of housing six at a time?<eos> Maybe he was a giant, and someone hit him with a shrinking ray but they missed the lollipop.<eos> - Ooh, that's why it's still giant.
Great, depending on what your definition of help is.<eos> I know I haven't always given you reason to trust me.<eos> My grandpa forged this sword for a High King who vanished without ever claiming it.<eos> Since then, my family's been saving it for someone truly worthy.<eos> It's beautiful, but I'm not sure it actually helps.
I thought my system was perfect.<eos> I make a list of all the qualities I'm looking for in a guy, assign each one a point value, and if that number exceeds 200...<eos> Can I make a suggestion?<eos> Burn that list.<eos> It's in the Cloud, so I can't really do that.
- Larry, we have some news.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Dwayne: I got your phone out of evidence.<eos> It's one of the great things about being a cop... you can take anything you want.<eos> I keep it with me 'cause it reminds me of the end of our limited data plan
All of it!<eos> One day you may be King.<eos> I hope so with all my heart.<eos> And yet, I know its burdens.<eos> They're very real, like forever dragging a stone up a hill, only to watch it perpetually roll back down again.
Yeah, it is.<eos> You know, it's just... - It's a lot to process.<eos> - Got something!<eos> Scorsese ran the blood from the impound lot.<eos> The sample's a little corrupted, but it's a match to Dino Brant.
Easy, tough guy.<eos> Look, I'm a cop. I just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> Show me your badge then.<eos> Ain't nothing there, man.<eos> All right. It's probably in the car.
That neighborhood is technically called Cobblestink.<eos> All right, everyone. Listen up.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street.<eos> It was carrying nine convicts who are now at large.
I'll have a triple, full fat, chai latte with light foam and extra cinnamon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're the worst. Bye.<eos> My small black coffee with a side of sugar packets seems lame now.<eos> It was already lame.
Right.<eos> Katty was doing in-person epidemiological data assembly, tracking a probable vector of the Aleutian flu cluster.<eos> Doing interviews, tracking the spread of the virus.<eos> Probable vector?<eos> So, you know how it got here?
Yeah? You like that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Is there a spider?<eos> Is it on me?
You're making it easy on me.<eos> Ready position.<eos> The blade feels lighter.<eos> You're connecting with it.<eos> It's becoming a part of you.
I feel like men and sticks are meant for so much more, and we don't even know it.<eos> Man, I just thought of that. I dig bathrooms.<eos> Is that fan closed?<eos> No, it's broken, which makes this place kind of like a...<eos> like a sweat lodge. It increases brain activity even more.
But it just might work.<eos> You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me.<eos> - I've never been a bad influence on anyone!<eos> Should I bring my leather jacket?<eos> It's ankle-length and fitted.
You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me.<eos> - I've never been a bad influence on anyone!<eos> Should I bring my leather jacket?<eos> It's ankle-length and fitted.<eos> I won't bring it; it's too nice.
It's never g...<eos> What?<eos> Do you see this one brick?<eos> It's concrete.<eos> And it's spalling.
Anything else?<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Finally!<eos> It's like watching plants grow.<eos> It's heading towards a black hole.
- I'm listening...<eos> - James weckler...<eos> The dominatrix killer. Yeah.<eos> His brain is currently marinating in ravi's blue juice down at the morgue.<eos> It's ripe and ready to go.
It's our special hideaway.<eos> Hey, Liv.<eos> Hey, I just came to pick up ravi's supply closet key.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think it's right here.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from the place. Shoreline 99 does control.<eos> Is it just me, Detective Bell, or do you hear that?<eos> Hear.. what?<eos> The sound of evidence being destroyed?<eos> It's coming from inside that building.
Every time I look in the mirror.<eos> And I think you know exactly... what I'm talking about.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> It bother you that not long ago you were in bondage, and now, here you are, fighting so hard for your old masters' law?<eos> Law ain't perfect. But it's all we got.
Oh, darling, I didn't mean it.<eos> You do a lot.<eos> So proud, so cocky.<eos> "Father of the year" crushes a day that... barely fits on a post-it note.<eos> This day, it started out so great.
Scotch.<eos> The past always catches up with us, doesn't it?<eos> Past, present and future is a disaster, no matter how you slice it.<eos> My second year on the job... there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and killed a ten-year-old girl.<eos> We had DNA evidence, but then, right before trial, the DNA sample got compromised in the lab, so it was inadmissible.
Thanks.<eos> Can you...<eos> Can you put the gun down, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's not loaded, it was just a prop from a student production of The Seagull.
No! I'll tell them the truth...<eos> I'll say it was an accident.<eos> Well, then, how do you explain this?<eos> You compiled this crossword two days ago.<eos> It proves premeditation.
Look.<eos> Google is making a big fuss.<eos> "Ooh, aren't we clever?<eos> We're making a self-driving car."<eos> It's already here!
Nothing to see. Nothing to see here.<eos> It's just a man doing his job.<eos> I've never been able to drift properly.<eos> I can provoke a car, you know, into a slide, but I couldn't hold it there.<eos> It would always just spin off and crash.
Well, he's a laugh a minute.<eos> Oh, right, thanks.<eos> Is there, like, a set amount of time you're meant to look at each thing before you move on?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> It depends on the piece and what it says to you.
I don't understand...<eos> And then there's that talentless nonentity, just drinking like a fish in some television reality show, despite having my son's liver.<eos> And then there's Patricia, spending her days squinting at her pornographic writings through the corneas of my son's eyes.<eos> And there's Kenneth Williams - still smoking, despite having the gift of Elliot's right lung inside him.<eos> It was an e-cigarette.
So hurry up!<eos> - Go on!<eos> - OK.<eos> So the postmortem came through this morning, sir.<eos> It confirms the victim died from profuse internal bleeding from a single stab wound to the abdomen.
Dale Reynolds, 35.<eos> Had quite a party followed by an accidental overdose.<eos> Or not so accidental.<eos> The bluish skin, bleeding foam around his mouth, all point to an OD, but... check out the knot in the tourniquet.<eos> It's on the outside of his arm.
- You can't, you can't.<eos> I want to do this.<eos> Because you're right.<eos> Nobody knows what that kind of secret does to you.<eos> We tried to get on with our lives... .. then it just creeps into the corners.
This guy won?<eos> Okay, there's no way somebody this good-looking could invent something better than these.<eos> No, he didn't invent something better than those, he is the invention.<eos> Are you checking out our robot?<eos> It's not that cool.
This guy!<eos> Come on. First round is on me.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I would like to hear out the young lady who just shut down our entire meeting.<eos> Well, the reason it's not selling is because it doesn't have a cool factor.
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.<eos> Anyway, I'm on my way back.<eos> Can I come see you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie to know how it ends.
Not quite.<eos> You might actually understand my work.<eos> What I'm about to show you is not for everyone.<eos> Where is that key?<eos> Oh, here it is.
But I haven't worked out a way to do it.<eos> Well, you may find it's easier to work forwards than back.<eos> - Start with his passport.<eos> - Really?<eos> It will not only give you the date but also the place of his birth.
Very well. Martin, can you tell us why we found your prints on the gun that was used to kill Frank Henderson?<eos> I told you they'd find out.<eos> What is this?<eos> OK, I can explain.<eos> The gun belongs to me, although it was my father's, originally, from the Second World War.
Colonel Williams.<eos> Sir.<eos> Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.<eos> We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.<eos> As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
When Richard Game confessed to your murder, he had been sick for years.<eos> He had a virus called Jenkins-Fowler.<eos> So?<eos> What?<eos> So it's incredibly contagious.
Someone within my organization, someone with access to an offshore account that was used to fund recent attacks against me.<eos> Eleven people had access to that account.<eos> Last evening, I called those 11 to a dinner to confront them.<eos> What happened next, I only remember pieces.<eos> The restaurant, what it looked like, where it was.
'Cause I really feel like I'm opening up here, and I'm not getting a whole lot back.<eos> A-About an overcooked chicken parm?<eos> Yes, yes. Real progress.<eos> All right.<eos> I didn't say it was overcooked...
A-About an overcooked chicken parm?<eos> Yes, yes. Real progress.<eos> All right.<eos> I didn't say it was overcooked...<eos> I said it was soggy.
- No, no, I don't.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.
This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> No, it won't be necessary.<eos> I know where it is.
What have you done with my future?<eos> She just wasn't that into you.<eos> I'm not talking about Rachel.<eos> - Oh, shadow file.<eos> - Oh, is it on that shelf over there?
Never knew either of his parents.<eos> Raised by the rink.<eos> - Ooh, badass backstory.<eos> - Stole it from a TV movie.<eos> It was about ice dancing, but I adapted it for the hardwood.
Fool's errand?<eos> - No, just the opposite.<eos> This demon was brought forth from a vessel.<eos> Should it return, it could be contained, kept alive.<eos> Why, so it can con more people into shitty deals?
The ballistics are 100% match to the rounds they pulled out of Rebecca Clark's body.<eos> Any prints or DNA?<eos> - Nothing usable.<eos> - But we may not need them.<eos> I ran the gun through the CAGE unit and it came back registered to a Thomas Kade.
You know what?<eos> I'll, uh, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor.<eos> You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.
I'll, uh, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor.<eos> You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.<eos> No, it does not involve eating pork.
Okay.<eos> Get Bailey on surveillance.<eos> Maybe Benny'll give us something that'll attach him to the shootings.<eos> And the French horn is very difficult.<eos> It's much more difficult than the regular horn because it's French.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Hello, Rajesh.<eos> How are things by you?<eos> Good, good.<eos> Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.<eos> I call these circles "Zones of Privacy""<eos> Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.<eos> This circle contains only me and you.<eos> It represents subjects we only share with each other... details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
And he told me this story about a man who was killed robbing a liquor store, about how that man's sibling then came gunning for the fellow robbers who he blamed.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Well, I believe that you don't, but the problem is I know about it.<eos> Now, all of those details were borrowed from an incident which took place in 2012.<eos> It made the headlines because both the liquor store owner and the surviving robber were both charged with murder at the same time.
Is that bothering you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't care for unconscious thoughts.<eos> My brain and I are best friends.<eos> It should tell me everything.
I just think you're the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.<eos> That is true.<eos> Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?<eos> You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much.<eos> It's not a good influence.
Eh, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup.<eos> It's getting harder to pretend.<eos> Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler or through the vacuum filter.<eos> Run down the pros and cons of each for me.<eos> Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler, it'll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.
I'm going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison.<eos> I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor. You're not going to prison. But, boy, it is funny to think about.<eos> You really can't remember anything?<eos> I'm trying. Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.<eos> Well, it's-- it's possible it was tracking everywhere you went.
This is supposed to be our family fun day.<eos> What's so important on your phone?<eos> I'm on the day care's web site.<eos> Stop looking at that.<eos> The day care's great. It's on campus.
Mr. Rider, when the Princess of Corona speaks directly to you, every word is important.<eos> I know that press is here somewhere, Flynn.<eos> Again, it's Eugene.<eos> Here it is!<eos> And, once the tests are done, it'll print the results on parchment paper...
Let's be better than those men.<eos> Let's not start another Civil War.<eos> Some differences are too great to be set aside, Madam President.<eos> The vice presidency...<eos> It's yours.
You know how to exorcise something bad, Earp or not?<eos> Lots of fire.<eos> Viscous cutaneous membrane.<eos> Signs of an exoskeleton.<eos> Whether it was growing one or has recently molted is yet to be determined.
Her injector? Yes.<eos> Well, uh... it didn't come from a pharmacy.<eos> It came from a back of an ambulance... my ambulance.<eos> You stole it?<eos> Look, um... epinephrine injectors are expensive these days, and it's not a optional purchase.
Because Michelle runs your life and tells you what to do, and you just listen, huh?<eos> She gets her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective!<eos> I would do anything.<eos> Michelle, she would have known about the epinephrine, too, right?<eos> Yeah, it came from our ambulance.
Don't, don't, don't!<eos> - That weirdness in Waverly...<eos> - All of the cutlery has gone missing.<eos> This perfect pool of shiny goo...<eos> - It was calling to me.
OK, yeah!<eos> It's just as I thought.<eos> There is an obscured etching here.<eos> It feels like I've seen this symbol before.<eos> 'Cause it's on the Purgatory Volunteer Fire Hall, Third and Main.
No.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I needed to pick something up in town.<eos> Wynonna, um... when the demon jumped back into me, it was different.<eos> It told me things...
We are criminal banished from our world.<eos> We hear that Aku welcomes those that are like us.<eos> Most enthusiastically.<eos> Your new home will be coordinates 6-12-71.<eos> - It is occupied.
Here. Can you hold that flashlight for me?<eos> You sick or something?<eos> No. I feel like, you know, like a tickle in my throat.<eos> Let's hope it's not what my kid's got.<eos> They're saying that, you know, that whooping cough... they're saying it's back.
Line 'em up!<eos> Give me the code... or I'll execute them one by one.<eos> Give me the code.<eos> Your plan is flawed.<eos> It relies on us being stupid and cowardly.
Shepherd plans to bomb D.C., doesn't she?<eos> How?<eos> The satellite is designed to launch a glider at hypersonic speeds.<eos> It is undetectable, it's unstoppable, but it was only supposed to target the White House.<eos> But now, it's gonna hit Shepherd's nuclear material, which is probably already on the ground in Washington.
It's over.<eos> The glider just launched.<eos> What?<eos> How long until...<eos> We have 30 minutes until it strikes the Capitol.
We have to get this truck out of the city - to reduce the casualties. - Okay.<eos> We'll direct you to the least populated area.<eos> What if we could contain the fallout?<eos> Okay, there's a defunct railroad tunnel just outside of D.C.<eos> It'll limit the fallout's range and prevent some of it from entering the atmosphere.
You even got back the bumper pool table no one ever uses.<eos> - Wait a minute, you liars!<eos> What's that nice couch doing here?<eos> - The old couch didn't make it.<eos> - The second the sunlight hit it, it turned to dust.
Anyways, I could talk about my steel horse all darn day.<eos> We got work to do.<eos> Rosa.<eos> - Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully are out of control.<eos> They got into a fight over the ranch dressing, and now it's everywhere.
- Are you stressed?<eos> - Am I?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me right now?<eos> My psoriasis, I can feel it fucking festering.<eos> It moves around the body, you know.
John, is this dangerous?<eos> Have we got a monkey virus?<eos> Can you smell that?<eos> That's potent. That is strong piss.<eos> It's leaving its scent!
This seems fruity, even for you.<eos> What do you have to fear, Wynonna?<eos> With Peacemaker at your side?<eos> So, this little ritual will show me how to stop the Widows before they find the third seal?<eos> Oh, Ms. Earp... it'll show you a shitload.
I'm really happy for her and Doc.<eos> - Oh, uh... just, well... uh... - This is your purse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But this is my DNA test.<eos> You said it hadn't arrived yet.
When you're resurrected from Hell.<eos> As a demon.<eos> Peacemaker!<eos> I know that gun.<eos> It's the one that killed you.
you have a tail or something.<eos> I can't control it.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Can you... can you get to the truck?<eos> It's just outside the door.
- I said...<eos> - Sure.<eos> Got it.<eos> The briefcase is silver, heavy.<eos> It's here.
- Sure.<eos> Got it.<eos> The briefcase is silver, heavy.<eos> It's here.<eos> I know it is.
! - Jeremy, loosen up.<eos> I'm about to poop my pants.<eos> - Not that loose.<eos> - The briefcase!<eos> It belongs to the Earps.
- Peacemaker too.<eos> - OK.<eos> OK?<eos> !<eos> It's yours.
Here's to single motherhood.<eos> You're a superhero.<eos> Same damn thing.<eos> - Wynonna... - Hmm?<eos> This baby, what is it?
Whoops.<eos> Look, whoever the dad is, all that matters is that this baby...<eos> There I said it, baby.<eos> Still weird.<eos> It's an Earp.
What if I took a drink from you?<eos> Or have you loaded yourself with silver, crosses, and garlic in superstitious fear?<eos> I might have eaten some roasted garlic earlier.<eos> Was that rude?<eos> I-it was all I had left.
- Nothing.<eos> - Louis, what's going on?<eos> - Okay, look, Donna, I'm only gonna tell you this once.<eos> Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him.<eos> It's personal.
Do you think Dad is screwing Mom now that they're sharing a bed?<eos> I saw Dad naked once in the bathroom.<eos> But I never saw his thing.<eos> I bet you did.<eos> Is it big?
I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.<eos> Not everything has to.<eos> Your intellect has taken you far in life... But it will take you no further.
His disciples followed him like sheep.<eos> Seduced by false doctrine.<eos> And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did it do?
You're okay.<eos> A relative term.<eos> But yeah, I'm okay.<eos> The cloak of levitation.<eos> It came to you.
But yeah, I'm okay.<eos> The cloak of levitation.<eos> It came to you.<eos> No minor feat.<eos> It's a fickle thing.
Come on, move!<eos> -Hurry!<eos> -That's the express train!<eos> And it's not stopping!<eos> It's coming!
Just take the stairs down and get him out.<eos> Hey, stop right there!<eos> Shut it down!<eos> The Ghostbusters.<eos> Look, I think it's great you found yourself a little hobby, and I'm sure, on paper, flooding New York City with ghosts seemed like a great idea, but we happen to like the world the way it is.
-Well...<eos> What did you do, Kevin?<eos> I did a lot, actually.<eos> I'll have you know that I walked over to the power box, pushed a bunch of buttons.<eos> Everything got sucked into the portal, then it closed up.
You're three-and-a-half hours late.<eos> Yay!<eos> Lunchtime!<eos> And don't worry about the weight.<eos> It should come off after you stop nursing the infant.
Meg, I'm not ready to be alone.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't know how to reset my router.<eos> I don't even know where it is.<eos> I don't even really know what, exactly, it does.
What, it's gonna make the pee go in there.<eos> No, it doesn't work like that.<eos> That's not a Polaroid.<eos> I'm gonna be the best auntie, ever. I am.<eos> I'm gonna give that kid whatever it wants.
Yeah... no, I know.<eos> Who likes arts and crafts?<eos> Can you pass me the red tape, please?<eos> Sure can.<eos> Now, we want the joints extra tight. Otherwise, it won't compress enough.
I don't kill women or children.<eos> I do.<eos> See, I was born with the Devil's gift.<eos> I kept it hidden for most of my life, but...<eos> The older I got, the stronger it got.
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.<eos> I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.<eos> Hey, they've made three of those movies.<eos> At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.<eos> The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you... but what it does to the people you love.
You've turned disasters into triumphs with your sheer, joyful, indefatigable, infectious lust for life.<eos> You've managed this entire pregnancy almost entirely on your own, despite a lunatic mother, repressed men, and cheating boyfriends who don't deserve you.<eos> Just the last few moments.<eos> Just the last few moments, my love, and then you'll see your beautiful baby.<eos> What if it's not yours?
I think unicorns are sexy, too.<eos> That must happen to you all the time, right?<eos> Ah, nah.<eos> I mean, all that meaningless sex is just--<eos> It's not my bag anymore, CJ.
You gotta get in first.<eos> What is it that--<eos> What-what!<eos> Take my gun, Jet, we may have to kill some people.<eos> - Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
We're leaving now.<eos> The casket will be closed, won't it?<eos> At the funeral?<eos> We'll sort that all out later.<eos> I want it closed so badly, Bobby.
And as my eyes crossed the president's car...<eos> Mrs. Kennedy...<eos> Keep going.<eos> I had to get to you, put myself between you, the president, and the shooter.<eos> Who was it?
You think you all control everything, that you have the world on puppet strings.<eos> And you're ridiculous.<eos> And I let myself believe it.<eos> And this parade?<eos> Who is it really for?
- Kill it now!<eos> Dad!<eos> He's breathing.<eos> Someone call a medical team!<eos> Is it dead?
This talks about an intergalactic war.<eos> This concerns the whole universe.<eos> What about this one?<eos> Something about an enemy.<eos> It needs to be destroyed before it gets to us.
- Yes, that's me.<eos> I'm Inspector Gonzalez, Madrid Judicial Police.<eos> My assistant, Deputy Inspector Bermejo.<eos> - Nice house.<eos> - It isn't mine.
Well, I know that you are, and...<eos> Nadine.<eos> Would you like to know an observation that I made this weekend?<eos> Sure.<eos> " - Oh, my god, Shannon, your outfit, it's so cute!
Once they reach the capital, nothing in the world can stop them.<eos> At a full gallop, it's two days to the capital.<eos> - There's no way we can catch them.<eos> - The wind is strong now.<eos> It blows from the north all day tomorrow.
I lent it to the boy who had the accident.<eos> My pants don't hold up so good without it.<eos> Well, uh, I don't have your belt.<eos> No, I know that, ma'am.<eos> It's out there.
I wasn't even...<eos> M.B., you're an analyst for Treasury.<eos> What the hell have you got yourself into?<eos> What do you have to hit to dent a steel thermos?<eos> It's just old.
He saw us!<eos> That was funny!<eos> Hey, what's in this thing?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> It came open!
No!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Did Oogway teach you that little trick?<eos> Too bad.<eos> It only works on mortals.
Oh, look, there's a bunch of cute otters over there.<eos> I want one!<eos> Ow, Bailey!<eos> Oh! I see the truck.<eos> It's over there.
Any family not known to be dead?<eos> No.<eos> Sister died in the quakes.<eos> Mom and Dad killed by the virus.<eos> But it didn't kill you, did it?
Good.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's my gun?<eos> Where's my gun?<eos> Where is it?
You were bleeding on the highway.<eos> I brought you back here to my house.<eos> Where's my gun?<eos> All right, when you found me on the highway, I had my gun.<eos> Where is it?
These employ the same technology as the detector viewer from medical.<eos> We've improved it.<eos> Made it mobile.<eos> The idea is to allow our soldiers in the field to instantly differentiate between friend and foe.<eos> You look at the enemy through this and it lights 'em up green.
Let me make it up to you with some very expensive, very delicious champagne.<eos> Wow!<eos> Look at that gun.<eos> And by the way, you two have gotta try this dip.<eos> It's amazing.
- No, I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - For you. - Oh...<eos> A hunting horn.<eos> From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.<eos> It's beautiful.
Okay.<eos> That's... Class is dismissed.<eos> For now, we're simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object.<eos> So, you're saying it's not ours?<eos> Do you even know if it's from Earth?
How do they communicate?<eos> Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.<eos> The first breakthrough was to discover that there's no correlation between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.<eos> Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.<eos> It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.
So, Hannah.<eos> This is where your story begins.<eos> The day they departed.<eos> You all right?<eos> Despite knowing the journey and where it leads,
He only has to evade you for another few minutes. And the last remaining human outposts will fall.<eos> We need an intercept path.<eos> And the fastest way to the surface.<eos> Already done.<eos> If you release the Antivirus, it will kill all organisms infected with the T-Virus.
I'm out.<eos> So you had never seen the sunrise?<eos> No.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> What color was it?
She certainly gives a good bed bath.<eos> Funny guy.<eos> I like him.<eos> So, I could take you to a Shakespeare festival.<eos> It's happening today and tomorrow.
It's not a negotiation.<eos> ...stuff. Okay.<eos> A bed inside a sofa.<eos> That's neat.<eos> Well, it's old, but it's comfortable, so...
I had to hold a conversation with a new person for 30 minutes...<eos> - ...and demonstrate how to be a good hostess.<eos> Next week, I'm thinking maybe they'll arrange marriages.<eos> I'll tell you what, I'm gonna design a special new badge for the Dandelions.<eos> It's gonna be a real big one, so no one misses it.
And fugu for the lady.<eos> - Thank you, Ping.<eos> - Fugu?<eos> The infamous pufferfish.<eos> When prepared incorrectly, it can lead to paralysis or even death.
A dragon?<eos> Jack, you dragged me all the way out here for a dragon?<eos> I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth.<eos> It was here.<eos> It's still in there.
I'm almost a teenager.<eos> Come on, we're only young once.<eos> So, how's it going with your listing?<eos> I asked, uh...<eos> I advised the sellers they should lower it by another $20,000 but I don't know, if it's gonna move.
Oh, wow.<eos> I get in, in the morning, and I'm like...<eos> "How's the hedging coming?<eos> You been hedging? You hedged much?"<eos> And it's like, too big to fail.
Jericho take it easy.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> My head...<eos> I've just gave you an injection.<eos> It will take effect in a minute.
I was visiting my mom in a hospital, and..<eos> I saw an angel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was..<eos> standing next to a little waste bed, and just gently touching his cheek, and it stopped then it looked right at me.
You shouldn't cry just 'cause you didn't get a land lease from an oil company.<eos> Who's crying?<eos> Wouldn't take money from Terravex, anyways.<eos> They ruined this town.<eos> You're talking like you're old enough to remember how it used to be.
- Mind if we take a look?<eos> - Yes, actually.<eos> Because it's private property and you're not allowed to go in there, but go ahead and look around, if you want to.<eos> I can make an exception this time.<eos> You know, the coyote that I saw... I heard, was... I think it came from that side of the yard.
I missed you, too.<eos> They're a family.<eos> He was looking for his parents.<eos> I got the truck.<eos> It's stationary.
Daddy got the best present of all.<eos> Can those things happen?<eos> I guess that depends on you, Cody.<eos> You have an amazing gift.<eos> Who knows what can happen as it grows?
Good, Good, that will help!<eos> There's something else<eos> The Agency called, The left engine was still operating<eos> Not possible, I felt it go.<eos> It was like it stopped in mid-air.
There's something else<eos> The Agency called, The left engine was still operating<eos> Not possible, I felt it go.<eos> It was like it stopped in mid-air.<eos> They said there's a chance it was sub-idle.
That's my Dad, it's an emergency.<eos> He's got to be on this flight.<eos> Okay, everybody say the same.<eos> Golf emergency.<eos> Did it go cancelled?
It was just a dream.<eos> No, it felt real.<eos> I know.<eos> Your mind is the most powerful I've ever seen.<eos> It can convince itself...
To stop an asteroid?<eos> The last two asteroids Fell exactly in the same spot.<eos> And it will happen again.<eos> We need to go there and see what attracts the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.
Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.<eos> This plan is so stupid that i wish it had a face i can smash!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> instead of running away from a deadly asteroid You want us to run directly towards it ?<eos> I know it sounds sub optimistic , but the good news It is that it will kill us anyway.
- It just I can not go.<eos> How can I go?<eos> I do not want to leave you , guys.<eos> Do you remember the first time you play hockey?<eos> You was so afraid to get on the ice because it was slippery.
Indeed it is, Miss Crawly.<eos> Top of the morning to you.<eos> I made you some coffee.<eos> You did?<eos> Where is it?
I'm so sorry!<eos> I just...<eos> No, no, don't go!<eos> Has anyone seen my glass eye?<eos> It's right here, Miss Crawly. I've got it.
No.<eos> Nothing in the world like flying your own plane. A girl down in New Jersey, waiting for you.<eos> See, an airplane gets people excited the same way they come out and watch a man race.<eos> But what they really want, what really gets them worked up, is to see you crash.<eos> To see you fold up that Stearman biplane like a piece of paper. Watch the ground crew drag you out like a rag doll before it blows up, explodes into flames.
I thought it was a dream.<eos> Nope!<eos> Our ancestors believed Maui lies there... at the bottom of his hook.<eos> Follow it, and you will find him.<eos> But why would it choose me?
Makes sense.<eos> You're what, eight?<eos> Can't sail.<eos> Obvious choice.<eos> It chose me for a reason.
You're what, eight?<eos> Can't sail.<eos> Obvious choice.<eos> It chose me for a reason.<eos> If the ocean's so smart... why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?
Happy-sad.<eos> Shit, I've got to go soon.<eos> We only have a half hour dinner window in our house.<eos> So, what's the house like, where you live?<eos> It's nice.
Still in the post.<eos> - I'll fix you up next week.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yes, the air here takes some getting used to.<eos> It's quite polluted with feces.
- My parents were Bulgarian, and when they passed away, he just stayed on with the farm.<eos> Got it.<eos> So...<eos> I'm still trying to make sense of this story of yours.<eos> Well, it... it is complicated.
- Is he okay?<eos> - Come on, give them some room to work. - Support his airwaves...<eos> Is he going to be okay?<eos> I'm Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez.<eos> There's lots of stuff washing up on the beach and I just need to know where it's coming from.
Could you... elaborate?<eos> Well, he brought me a deer back from Aberdeen.<eos> It had been hit... by a car.<eos> Why would you want a deer?<eos> It's very... damaged, isn't it?
My name is Sophie.<eos> Well, jump, Sophie.<eos> This be where all my dreams is beginning.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> As a dream comes whiffling by it's so silvery soft, it was making like a tiny little buzzing, humming sound, like music.
It's behind you on your elbow!<eos> No, not that elbow!<eos> Now it's on your foot!<eos> The other foot!<eos> It's on your bottom!
It be a trogglehumper.<eos> What are you going to do with it?<eos> I locks them up, you wicked beastie, you.<eos> What does the bad dream say?<eos> It says...
Since you're here... Would you mind going over there to get that radio?<eos> Right there, in the bag.<eos> Would you get it for me, please?<eos> Please, get me to the radio.<eos> It's right there.
- Is she dead?<eos> No.<eos> She is... becoming.<eos> She took a poison.<eos> It allows her to visit the Sacred World.
You know what you must do.<eos> Water is the path.<eos> Selene.<eos> Praise the day... when it ends.<eos> Praise the ice... when it holds.
Water is the path.<eos> Selene.<eos> Praise the day... when it ends.<eos> Praise the ice... when it holds.<eos> Praise the sword... when it kills.
Can you play with me a little bit?<eos> This is a nice truck.<eos> What's funny?<eos> You're sitting there talking about my truck while you're stroking my cock.<eos> Well, it's a nice truck.
Let me help you with that.<eos> Interesting.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, this blackmail note.<eos> When I place it under the magnifying glass, the print becomes much larger, but then when I take it away, it's immediately small again.
Guddu!<eos> Mum, I love you very much<eos> Guddu, I miss you very much<eos> The train on platform two is a decommissioned train<eos> It is not taking passengers
It's just so hard not to think of you.<eos> Think of where you are... my Stardust.<eos> Saw... the reactor module, that's the key.<eos> That's the place I've laid my trap.<eos> It's well hidden and unstable.
Master switch? Describe.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> The master switch?<eos> Where is it?
HONG KONG Wednesday - June 5, 2013<eos> Janine, how did the White House conversation go?<eos> I made it quite clear that we were in possession of an authentic FISA court order.<eos> They wanted to see it; we refused.<eos> Now I just pray that it's actually authentic.
Hey. Why didn't you watch my movie?<eos> - Hey, goodbye.<eos> - Come and watch with me.<eos> - Have a great night. - Come on.<eos> It's still playing.
Thanks.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?<eos> I got it in the hallway.<eos> I thought it was hot.
Little guy, stringy hair.<eos> I think they went out through those doors.<eos> Hey, Chet?<eos> Chet?<eos> Amelia's film, where is it?
Hey, Chet?<eos> Chet?<eos> Amelia's film, where is it?<eos> The film is in the projector.<eos> Repeat, it's in the projector.
I have an idea.<eos> If we suppose that Filatov had a cell phone on him, and it was switched on, it might have been registered in mobile base stations closest to our office.<eos> So what?<eos> As we know the phone numbers of our employees and of the visitors we had at that time, we can find out Filatov's phone number using the elimination approach.<eos> Well... if it's still in the records.
Yes.<eos> Thanks, you're free to go.<eos> -Open the trunk. -What for?<eos> You'll help me fetch something.<eos> But it is empty...
Well?<eos> I don't know, maybe I'm making things up, but on the day when Katya went missing, there was a van driving around here.<eos> What kind of van?<eos> I couldn't see the brand and the color. It was dark.<eos> I wanted to come closer and look, but it speeded right from that spot and disappeared.
Hey, hey, hey. We got the best seats in the house right here. Anyone can sit down there.<eos> We saved this city.<eos> We should be on the Jumbotron, not in it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, one year ago, a shadow fell over our city.<eos> Suddenly, it was under siege by the notorious villain, Shredder.
Why am I here?<eos> Because you and your buddy Dr. Stockman found something of mine.<eos> The teleportation device.<eos> The teleport was supposed to break me out of prison.<eos> But it is capable of so much more.
And your help.<eos> Oh, you will do just fine.<eos> Done.<eos> While Jamie inspected the shipment of port, I went for a walk.<eos> I was beginning to be susceptible to bouts of morning sickness, and while the air along the docks wasn't exactly fresh, it was better than the close confines of our temporary lodgings.
Come on.<eos> You know that.<eos> God.<eos> Can we talk about this helmet?<eos> It's crazy heavy, and it's really hurting my back.
Are you okay?<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Those lying bastards!<eos> I don't understand what's wrong with the code.<eos> It should work.
It's way too important to work on in a fucking student apartment. Together...<eos> You have nothing to do with this!<eos> You have stolen my code.<eos> Your code?<eos> It's not your code.
I was so damn close to succeeding. So close to making it stable.<eos> I was so close to getting it to work.<eos> Erik...<eos> The pH value...<eos> It shouldn't be neutral if the sample is destroyed.
- I'm looking for my ship.<eos> Yeah, the Anubis.<eos> - Check the board.<eos> - I did that.<eos> It's here.
Fucking asshole.<eos> Get in the fucking car.<eos> I can't obey your orders until you unlock the door.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's not like the motor's going to die tomorrow, but Joe said it keeps breaking down like a son of a bitch.
Phone is beautiful.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> That's just a picture of a girl on a phone.<eos> What?<eos> Where'd it go?
I didn't even wanna be with me.<eos> Eventually...<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, that's what I wanted to tell you, Hank.<eos> There's a giant raccoon, and it's eating our food.
The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.<eos> Let us pledge allegiance here and say aloud our promise to our new country.<eos> - Our flag is raised.<eos> - Our flag is raised.<eos> - And it will never fall.

- You need to evacuate your people.<eos> - We can't move the injured.<eos> - I need to get her out of here now.<eos> - There's a way out back.<eos> Where does it come out?
We couldn't have saved it.<eos> But to leave it alone?<eos> Cold, and trembling, and possibly in pain?<eos> The anaesthetic from the mother should still be in its system.<eos> It shouldn't suffer.

When can I see my baby?<eos> Ruby... .. I'm so very, very sorry.<eos> But your poor little baby was born... so desperately unwell.<eos> And it wasn't possible for us to save it.<eos> Did it die?
If you'd repair to the corridor.<eos> Please come through, Mrs Dawley.<eos> Can you manage, my dear?<eos> Today, if you would, Mr Dawley.<eos> I was hearing about how the baby shouldn't sleep on its back in case it gets sick, and it got me to thinking, what would make it sick?
Roseanne?<eos> It's out.<eos> It's not moving.<eos> Is baby breathing?<eos> Why won't it move?
He offers you the world and gives you Chrisp Street.<eos> I mean to say, he tried, but you can't run a shop on good intentions, can you?<eos> Don't he know this shop's the only thing you've got?<eos> It's not all I have, Mrs Cadman.<eos> But it is mine.
She did anything she could to feed me, to try and get me shoes to wear.<eos> I didn't see how that broke her.<eos> But I wish, oh, I wish so much she were here now so I could put my arms round her, tell her she's good and strong, and the bravest woman I ever knew.<eos> Shame will keep us in all kinds of prisons if we let it.<eos> And it will keep us from those we love, and who love us.
- Morning!<eos> - Good morning, Master Turner.<eos> You're looking very spruce.<eos> New blazer?<eos> Yes, although it's still purple, unfortunately.
- So what do we do about it? Sink his barges carrying his supply of stone.<eos> Block up the river.<eos> Chaps, wouldn't it be easier just to go through the side?<eos> See? That's the problem with an education.<eos> It gets in the way.
So, you have one exit remaining.<eos> And that has a tavern 20 yards from it.<eos> There's always more Blacklegs in the Two Hot Cocks than there are rats on the street.<eos> Why don't you use the other building?<eos> Because it's 175 yards away.
Luckily, I knew a little magic of my own.<eos> But there was still one problem.<eos> Smurfette's name doesn't tell us anything about her.<eos> Okay, the physics are...<eos> It doesn't tell us who she is.
Back it up!<eos> Contain her.<eos> Get behind me!<eos> You took all the medicine.<eos> It's wearing off.
It has fleas?<eos> No, silly.<eos> Ah, it's just an expression.<eos> Daddy, where's my other blanket?<eos> Oh, Well, it's up in a closet, but how about we just try this one, just for tonight?
How come you haven't been wearing it?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I took it off to take a bath the other day and I thought I knew where I placed it.<eos> But...<eos> It's gotta be in the house, though.
So you take all the glory, thanks...<eos> - OK!<eos> - .. Thanks all the same.<eos> Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?<eos> It's driving me nuts.
Please.<eos> I promised my brain to the Royal Society.<eos> Where would you suggest?<eos> Well, I suppose there is a heart somewhere inside me.<eos> I don't imagine it's much of a target, but why don't we try for that?
While my sister was CEO...<eos> What was the name of that lake?<eos> Moose Lake.<eos> Moose Lake.<eos> While my sister was CEO, dumping so much toxic waste into Moose Lake that it exploded...
What?<eos> What is it, Bobby?<eos> I know exactly where Jack Rabbit's Palace is.<eos> My dad, when I was a little kid, he took me to this place.<eos> It was near where our station used to be.
'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.<eos> Back in the monastery, Brother Kuo would... harvest plums every summer to make wine.<eos> He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.
He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.<eos> Me and my friend Davos, when we were kids, we'd... we'd wait until the brothers had gone to sleep and we'd climb up the tower.<eos> We'd, uh... we'd sneak drinks and refill the pots with water so no one knew it was missing.<eos> The wine was so sweet.<eos> In the dead of winter, it tasted warm... like summer.
We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.<eos> This place...<eos> it seems familiar.<eos> It should.
What are you doing?<eos> Whoa! She is very strong.<eos> Sir, this is for your protection.<eos> We need this place to look closed.<eos> It is closed!
The next time you conveniently forget shit that affects the rest of us...<eos> You're not exactly an open book yourself, Jessica.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - Well, no one's digging into your past.<eos> My past is none of your goddamn business, and it's not actively trying to kill us.
Ask for guidance.<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> That kinda thing.<eos> So the architect discovers a structure underneath his building.<eos> And whatever it is, it's bad enough that he dies trying to blow it up.
Mac knew to look.<eos> Dennis and Dee knew to look.<eos> Charlie, who kicked him in the chest, knew to look.<eos> Hell, even the little kid with the balloon knew where to look.<eos> Okay, it may have been effective, but it was an offensive slur.
Weird<eos> But good...<eos> What do they do?<eos> You'll find out.<eos> Wear the silver satin, It will go well with this.
If the attack didn't happen today, we need to find out when and what she's done since.<eos> If she's not ready to talk...<eos> We'll get her home, see if we can find out more then.<eos> When was the last stranger rape round here?<eos> We don't know it was, until we get more information.
The gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.<eos> This great tower is where we keep them.<eos> The God Killer.<eos> It's beautiful.
Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.<eos> Aye, he lived on air and honey beer.<eos> From where?<eos> From a man in Feather Lane.<eos> Look, it was cheaper than the tavern and, er, your father only gave me coppers.
What do you want?<eos> I want a line of conference with the President of the 15 states of America.<eos> My name is James Delaney.<eos> That name means nothing.<eos> But it will to the President and his representatives, who are travelling to the negotiations in Ghent.
Powder?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dumbarton said the need was very urgent.<eos> Then it must indeed be urgent.<eos> If your business is not gunpowder, what is it?
And yet you're a rationalist.<eos> What kind of rational man believes in justice?<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.<eos> Mr. Delaney...<eos> I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.
Do you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Hawk.<eos> Electricity is humming.<eos> You hear it in the mountains and rivers.<eos> You see it dance among the seas and stars and glowing around the moon, but in these days, the glow is dying.
Something like this.<eos> Charl.<eos> Hi Hi.<eos> It's Charley.<eos> This creature, it suffers, it hurts.
But I am behaving like a leader.<eos> I'm unavailable.<eos> I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.<eos> You have my approval, General.<eos> We both know it was never really mine to give.
Hey, that's my friend's coat!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> What're you doing with that coat?<eos> It's mine.
That's what we offer.<eos> That's what we represent.<eos> You feel you've been treated unfairly?<eos> I feel misrepresented in the media.<eos> Put a pillow over that feeling and bear down until it stops kicking.
I'm happy!<eos> You should be.<eos> He's the best.<eos> He is.<eos> But when he said that, my heart, it leapt a little bit.
You didn't tell Taylor about the New York warrant, and I'm pretty sure Persikof didn't say anything.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> You're thinking something.<eos> Does Persikof get another bail hearing?<eos> This morning, but it'll be short.
-Hannah!<eos> Mom, he's not a customer.<eos> Oh. Oh, I see.<eos> I'm gonna go get my coat.<eos> It's in the back, so...
Not like this.<eos> MR. PORTER:<eos> Hey, Ryan, thanks for coming in.<eos> I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?
Uh, I kind of am.<eos> I saved the God damn universe.<eos> That's not the issue, Rick!<eos> Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't!<eos> The Vindicators say their job is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... Pick the location you'll... You'll never hear them even mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.
Agent Burgle.<eos> Gloria.<eos> Trust me.<eos> The future is certain.<eos> And when it comes, you will know without question, your place in the world.
That means you guard my body.<eos> Is that not right?<eos> Not when you're robbing a bank.<eos> At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.
- Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Saul Berenson.<eos> The nuclear arrangement started with Saul.<eos> He wants it to work.
You're saying he's the enemy?<eos> Not on this.<eos> Not on Iran.<eos> The nuclear arrangement started with Saul.<eos> He wants it to work.
I didn't wanna go back to prison.<eos> You know, you believe what you want, man.<eos> Yeah, I took it down, but once that boy's face went up online, you can't undo that shit.<eos> He's right.<eos> It's everywhere now.
Are you accusing these men of lying?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Either they're confused or they've been suborned.<eos> What about the footage? Is it lying?<eos> Why does it end there, on a shot of my son running away?
You're part of Long John Silver's resistance.<eos> I am Long John Silver.<eos> The resistance in the interior...<eos> I built it.<eos> I led it. It was mine.
Why isn't it true?<eos> I'm sorry, the more I try and dismiss this, I...<eos> You know my story.<eos> Thomas, Miranda, all of it.<eos> Know the role it played in motivating me to do the things that I've done, the things I will do.
That's right.<eos> Fleet Street.<eos> London!<eos> Good luck.<eos> Next time you see my name, it'll be on page one.
I'd be grateful.<eos> Poor Tessa.<eos> She'd an idea about some job in Fleet Street on offer, if she got the scoop on all this.<eos> Last thing she said was,<eos> "Next time you see my name, it'll be on the front page."
Get out of there right now.<eos> Booth, I promise I'm fine.<eos> Nothing is going to happen.<eos> I'm at a crime scene.<eos> It's secure.
Why not?<eos> Is it because you feel guilt for other things that you've done?<eos> No, the reason Dr. Hodgins should not be thanking me is because ultimately the treatment is unlikely to work.<eos> But that's what I'm telling you.<eos> It worked.
You don't have to introduce me to your little posse.<eos> Just tell me where you got the dress?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The dress.<eos> Where did it come from?
Supposed to do laundry last night but I was out following Sydney until 4 a.m.<eos> - You're fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Except for that giant coffee stain.<eos> - How did it even get there? - Oh.
Do you think that Jenna orchestrated the whole thing so that A.D. could take a shot at Spencer?<eos> Wait, Sydney's phone is in range.<eos> - I'm picking up a text.<eos> - What's it say?<eos> Who's it from?
And I'm lying there, praying that Mr. Boss' dimwit henchman doesn't shoot me in the head. And then suddenly it all became clear.<eos> You made all this happen.<eos> All of what?<eos> Everything!<eos> I don't know when you got the idea, but I'm guessing it's when you took the cure, and it worked.
Law school isn't really about making friends, right?<eos> Yeah, I bet some of you are really happy that he's dead 'cause that means your ranking goes up one.<eos> - Great. - Okay, I'm going.<eos> Like, there's not even a body to bury.<eos> You're all vultures glomming onto this tragedy like it's your own.
I just stand by my actions, good or bad, and I accept the consequences.<eos> Unmerciful to the bone.<eos> That's what's always made you the best.<eos> But this place...<eos> It'll bleed every ounce of defiance out of you.
You didn't want me to know that you didn't want me.<eos> No, you're right, I...<eos> I didn't want children.<eos> But if there's one thing my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that time often doesn't provide us with what we want.<eos> But it... it's quite adept at giving us what we need.
Until now, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.<eos> What's it telling you?
That was between you and Frank.<eos> It had nothing to do with us.<eos> When the time is right, we will call upon you.<eos> And Frank's body?<eos> It's still in the brownstone.
I don't know.<eos> Caitlin?<eos> - Caitlin?<eos> - I'm losing control.<eos> Okay, all right, it's spreading.
Stupid.<eos> Still here, pretender?<eos> Still trying to find your place?<eos> I found my place.<eos> It's standing here with these people, against you.
You're not weak, Cass.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I mean, obviously, you've changed, but it's all been for the better, man.<eos> And you have been with us every step of this long, crazy thrill ride.<eos> And no matter how crazy it got, you never backed down.
All right, Mick, you're gonna need holy oil, sage, and myrrh.<eos> Do you have that here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, make a tincture, coat a silver bullet. Use this spell.<eos> It'll mimic the original etchings.
So remember Gadreel?<eos> The psycho angel who took your body for a test drive?<eos> Yeah, what about him?<eos> All right, well... there was this, there was this spell...<eos> Yeah, but it didn't work.
You?<eos> I...<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But I need my rig.<eos> Where is it?
Is that so?<eos> I'm sorry Mr. Poe bothered you.<eos> I'm glad he did, because I want you three children to feel more at home here, now that I am your father.<eos> As you know, I have been working hard with my theater troupe, and I'm afraid I may have acted a bit standoffish.<eos> The word "standoffish" is a wonderful one, but it does not describe Count Olaf's behavior toward the children.
"Standoffish" refers to a person who, for various reasons, is not associating with others.<eos> It is a word which might describe somebody who, during a party, might stand in a corner instead of talking to another person.<eos> Gustav?<eos> Jacquelyn here.<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.
Perhaps the worst experience of my life.<eos> It was proven to me, in public, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there was a battery... a fully charged battery... almost next to my skin for the better part of two hours.<eos> And I felt nothing.<eos> What does that mean to you?<eos> This condition... to me, it's as real as that chair.
And in three, she'll have latched he to some other girl to destroy.<eos> Good morning, students.<eos> This is your principal speaking.<eos> There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.
You're a Blossom, through and through.<eos> Okay.<eos> One more thing before you go to the dance.<eos> Nana Blossom's ring...<eos> It's not in my jewelry box, it's not with Polly.
Okay.<eos> One more thing before you go to the dance.<eos> Nana Blossom's ring...<eos> It's not in my jewelry box, it's not with Polly.<eos> Where is it?
Everyone is gonna know.<eos> I'm going to the press with everything!<eos> Once I get into the embassy, how do I find Mary?<eos> I have the plans for all three floors right here.<eos> It's big, but the public stuff... conference rooms, offices... it's all on the first and second floor.
I... I was terrified.<eos> And it was blinding.<eos> I was so alone.<eos> It is our belief that the comatose mind is sent off.<eos> It travels to another realm of existence.
Careful.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> That thing I did outside, with the wolf and the... And the... If this isn't a dream, how was that even possible?<eos> The reason you were able to do what you did... it's because of this place.<eos> I think it agrees with you.
Paula and I have proof that the cemetery's committing burial fraud.<eos> Great.<eos> Where is that proof?<eos> Okay.<eos> It was a little bit confiscated, but we can get more because we know it's there now.
Uh, see?<eos> It's a priceless family heirloom.<eos> He didn't buy you a ring?<eos> Yeah, he did buy it for me; he bought it back from the pawn shop that I sold it to, which is so sweet, 'cause he knew how much it meant to me.<eos> Well, I mean, if it meant that much to you, you probably wouldn't have pawned it.
Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> You know, it's funny that you picked this place.<eos> It's right near Scott's new apartment.
Oh. Oh. Josh and my dad are talking.<eos> Ooh. I wonder if they're talking about me?<eos> Hero... oh!<eos> I like saying that word.<eos> I don't know what it is, but I wear it well, and it fits me like a cape.
It was awful.<eos> You think you'd get used to the sound of men yelling, but you never do.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mrs Marsh.<eos> His sight, it...<eos> It will come back, won't it?
People were given a place to gather, room to play, a space to share.<eos> Sometimes the heart desires such very simple things.<eos> The heart holds within it all that is most precious, all that we must protect.<eos> Ready... steady...<eos> But it is also braver and bolder, more resilient than we realise.

The heart holds within it all that is most precious, all that we must protect.<eos> Ready... steady...<eos> But it is also braver and bolder, more resilient than we realise.<eos> If we wound it, it will heal.<eos> And if it breaks, it learns to beat again.
Every last one of them.<eos> And you'll soon be feeling so much better.<eos> Don't worry, it's a fairly common reaction to the gas.<eos> Bite down hard on this pad for me, Mrs Williams.<eos> There is always some bleeding to begin with, but it shouldn't last long.
I would have told him not to come.<eos> And he's here anyway.<eos> You don't have to believe him.<eos> Let him mine the dragonglass.<eos> If he's wrong, it's worthless.
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.<eos> Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.<eos> My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.<eos> I see a great deal of potential in that venture.<eos> I imagine it would require outside investment.
Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.<eos> But the world you want to build doesn't get build all at once.<eos> Probably not in a single lifetime.<eos> How do we ensure your vision endures?<eos> After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?
Told him I'd tell them he's okay.<eos> That's the front door buzzer.<eos> I put the "gone fishing" sign up, but... somebody must really want their dope.<eos> Hi, Gladys.<eos> I know you came for your medication, but it won't be ready until tomorrow. No.
Look, I say Karate Kid, all of them.<eos> I'm a Miyagi aficionado.<eos> I get how this works.<eos> What I don't get is what the hell I'm training for!<eos> You are supposed to control this place, not let it control you.
I found this youth intervention program out in Jamaica Queens.<eos> So I'm thinkin' about workin' with them.<eos> No shit, huh? Wow.<eos> Prison changed you.<eos> Well, you know, self-respect isn't a straight line, it's a circle.
You and you alone have the power to improve the lives of so many people and the only life you're concerned with is your own?<eos> You even lost... your friend Kevin, was it?<eos> You've got Kevin's blood on your hands... and you don't even want the chance to apologize.<eos> If you feel a light tickle at the back of your throat, that's just the neuroinhibitor, modified to keep your outbursts under control.<eos> But at least it won't turn you into a blueberry.
Running around all pregnant.<eos> No.<eos> Never seen her.<eos> I'm realizing... you don't know how far we're willing to go to bring all these clones in.<eos> You better embrace this new future, Art, because it's going to be here real soon.
This is the key, okay?<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> I hid your treatment in the back of a fridge<eos> It's ready, enough for you and Charlotte.
- Do me a favor.<eos> - Sure, man.<eos> Wrap that wire around my neck until I'm dead.<eos> I am so sorry about the protest out there.<eos> I don't like the word shrill because it's so misogynistic, - but in this case...
- Mm-hmm. - There's a lot at stake.<eos> Which I told you would be the case someday, hmm.<eos> Well, welcome to someday.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.<eos> It will kill anyone, including your Beast.
Any questions?<eos> Is this a knock-through?<eos> Well, in a way, yes.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> - It's like a...
Either the creature came here specifically for what's in here,<eos> - or it's just a coincidence.<eos> - It's just a coincidence.<eos> Well, we can't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah, we can. It was here for ages before it did anything.
- It's just a coincidence.<eos> Well, we can't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah, we can. It was here for ages before it did anything.<eos> If it had work to do, why would it lie around in a puddle?<eos> - I don't know, maybe it's a student.
For something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> Nick!<eos> If the Pleiades cluster is here,<eos> Taurus is here, and Orion is here...<eos> Then whenever this event is coming, it has to be pretty close to the March equinox.
Yeah, she didn't want to quit.<eos> The only weird thing... was the mirror.<eos> What mirror?<eos> The hand mirror we used to show you when you changed into Renard.<eos> It was on the floor next to her, covered in blood.
And then the face.<eos> The same one that you and I saw?<eos> Yeah, so I broke the mirror.<eos> Then I went to clean it all up, and all the pieces started coming back together.<eos> And then... it grabbed me.
I...<eos> I shot it, but it didn't do nothing.<eos> And then... And then I ran, you know, 'cause I thought - it was coming after me.<eos> - And do you know where Dev's body is?<eos> It was right here.
- Not alone, you don't.<eos> - Are you sure we wanna do this?<eos> - Not entirely. Where is it?<eos> I broke this mirror.<eos> And it shattered into pieces, and the pieces all came back together. It's not a magic mirror.
- Are you sure we wanna do this?<eos> - Not entirely. Where is it?<eos> I broke this mirror.<eos> And it shattered into pieces, and the pieces all came back together. It's not a magic mirror.<eos> It belonged to my mother.
Wesen here don't woge.<eos> We need to get this done.<eos> I need to know more about this other place.<eos> Diana, what can you tell me?<eos> It's behind the mirrors.
- Are we never to be rid of him?<eos> - Not here, but in Truro...<eos> I'll miss Geoffrey Charles, of course, but the thought of being out of Ross's reach...<eos> - The grain ship's in!<eos> - It's in!
But if Tweedledee and Tweedledum don't get it together, you may not have to make that decision at all.<eos> Katroina Bonnet, as I live and breathe.<eos> Pouis Pitt. I do declare.<eos> No, um, you see,<eos> Katrina, you need to work on your code name for me, 'cause it's way too obvious.
Yes. It's... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God.<eos> Tom changed it every seven days.<eos> Uh, he went to a military boarding school, so we used that alphabet sequentially. So the Monday before last was Charlie, so that would mean... "D" would be Delta.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Chandler, did the message you just got on your cellphone come from OffKey?<eos> Yes, it does that when a new device logs into the network.
- He should look in the mirror. - Well, you may be right.<eos> I'll be starting by vetting the dirtbag, but I'll also end up working with his attorney, which you should know is going to be Linda Rothman.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Your case against Bloom isn't just thin.<eos> - It's anorexic. - ‭
This baby will only hasten the inevitable.<eos> Mandrake.<eos> Keep it with you, always.<eos> She is... kicking you at night. In the left rib with her heel.<eos> So close to your heart, it sometimes feels like it could break.
Let's get a chest x-ray.<eos> What appears to be the problem here?<eos> There appears to be some irregularities. With the patient's heart.<eos> What kind of irregularities?<eos> It's not where it's supposed to be.
A few years ago, He realized that rock faces weren't enough.<eos> He loved his life.<eos> It's not over.<eos> But his heart will fail again, won't it?<eos> If it does, I'll restart it.
Now, the man who made that promise is gone, so you got to talk to them and let them know -- we'll make good on it, i know.<eos> Or how about we review those plans I stole from hydra's lab?<eos> You know, since I almost died to get them.<eos> Look, if she's building some -- some crazy doomsday device -- can we not use that word to describe it?<eos> It's not helping me think.
Is that true?<eos> Can you destroy her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But it's like Daisy said, she won't let me anywhere near her.<eos> This thing in you ... is it as desperate to destroy Aida as we are?
Be careful, bring a constable with you.<eos> This man has worked with James Gillies.<eos> Sir.<eos> What's this device capable of?<eos> It can receive a signal from a nearby source.
It can receive a signal from a nearby source.<eos> How nearby?<eos> A city block.<eos> Maybe two.<eos> - Can it send signals out?
Hello, City Morgue.<eos> That's a funny message to put in a doll.<eos> Hey!<eos> The message wasn't for you.<eos> It was for me.
I'm going to war with Krakow and Guangdong, and I need boots on the ground.<eos> I want to crush this fuck.<eos> That glass... it's not a barrier.<eos> It's an asset.<eos> It's what makes you good.
Because Axe invited me to play in the firm's other seat along with him.<eos> Oh, this is fucking bullshit!<eos> Turn the fuck away.<eos> That's my fucking seat.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's my fucking seat.
What?<eos> I was about to tell you that, in your confusion about your opponent, you've become easy to read.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I've been watching that thing the entire time.<eos> That's why I came here... so it wouldn't see me looking.
Because the longer you stay out of your bodies, the harder it's gonna be to get back in them.<eos> Blood won't stop coming.<eos> There must be several micro-capillary ruptures.<eos> If we don't relieve the pressure quickly...<eos> It will block the blood flow to the brain. That's right.

Come on, man, who doesn't like the future?<eos> I like history.<eos> Yeah, I know, it's filled with terror and violence,<eos> - but the future just...<eos> - It's uncertain.
Question... what do we expect when we get inside Rip's mind?<eos> - No idea.<eos> - Whoa, wait, what?<eos> Well, I've seen it done, had it done, never taken a trip myself.<eos> Given that you're entering his subconscious, I suspect it will look like someplace familiar to our old Captain.
Lock-down mode initiated.<eos> Why are you putting us in lock-down?<eos> The only way to catch that thing is to trap it in here.<eos> - With us?<eos> - We don't even know where it went.

So am I.<eos> Under two hours.<eos> The clock is ticking fast.<eos> I know.<eos> And if it ticks down completely, we both lose.
Never mind.<eos> This sports day is already going better than the previous one.<eos> Well, the marquee is still standing and none of the children have been mauled by a dog.<eos> That's good.<eos> Now, look, there's a limited amount of champagne today, so please make sure that it goes to the parents and not the masters.
Is it so hot?<eos> Oh! But at least you're not being boiled alive!<eos> You don't think I've been trying to get rid of this guy, too?<eos> I've been fishing around that same file.<eos> That's why it was in my office.
- What are they?<eos> - Keys.<eos> - To what?<eos> - This place.<eos> It's yours.
- Which planet. - "Which planet"?<eos> So, you think Sutcliffe is an alien?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> - Because the creature is an alien.<eos> It certainly appears to be producing fuel suitable for interstellar travel.
Which ball would win a race?<eos> You don't need to raise your hand to speak here, Albert.<eos> Oh.<eos> Really? Well...<eos> Uh, the ball in outer space would win 'cause it's traveling in a vacuum.
You didn't come up here for a tip on a race?<eos> You heard anything about a new casino coming to upstate New York?<eos> Whispers, yeah.<eos> I heard whispers.<eos> It's important I find out where exactly it's going.
Well, it sounds wrong. To say this but... Maybe it's for the best.<eos> Poor ulli, he wasn't well.<eos> He wasn't sick.<eos> No, no, of course... What I mean is... Despite all the love...<eos> Mongoloids never develop normally. And when you think about the future, What would it have been?
You musn't blame yourself.<eos> I wish I could be half the father that you are.<eos> Yes, I heard you had a son.<eos> Hold him tight, Albert.<eos> You think his childhood will last forever, but I promise you, it will pass in a fraction of a second.
Well, she was the one who told me to stay.<eos> Her exact words were, "Don't come with me."<eos> It doesn't get more clear than that.<eos> Unless this letter says differently.<eos> It's in Hebrew.
- Oh, cool.<eos> - 400 miles.<eos> I drove.<eos> Well, uh, thank you for making the trip up.<eos> Uh, this proposal... is... it's not good.
I... think we should, uh... - Hm? - Get a dishwasher.<eos> Sure.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, okay, I tried putting the ring in, like, a fortune cookie, but it doesn't fit.
Sure.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, okay, I tried putting the ring in, like, a fortune cookie, but it doesn't fit.<eos> It breaks every single time. Just crumbles.
You must have questions.<eos> Physics tries to explain the entire universe.<eos> Who doesn't have questions about that?<eos> Look at the sky.<eos> Who can tell me why it's blue?
Did they indeed?<eos> - How much for?<eos> - One pound, with an undertaking to make the necessary structural repairs detailed in the survey.<eos> And before the survey, how much was the building worth?<eos> Its market value is £1.8 million, and our forensic accountant reckons once it's developed, it'll be worth £8 million to £10 million.
I can't stop him.<eos> - I don't have to do it, though.<eos> Actually, you do.<eos> If they do re-indict, the jury pool, the public, it's all still relevant.<eos> If he is going to do the interview, it has to be letter perfect.
Well, if you want to make art so bad, why don't you do it out here?<eos> - Don't be a dick.<eos> - No, seriously.<eos> We got to make this place nice and fix it up.<eos> Like you said, it's depressing.
No good.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Your face is under there.<eos> Oh!<eos> And it's beautiful.
So you're the new flamekeeper.<eos> This is a sacred space.<eos> Leave before you get hurt.<eos> Give me the flame.<eos> It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.
I'll talk to roan.<eos> If we give him back the flame, I can convince him to show mercy.<eos> Azgeda knows no mercy.<eos> Give me the flame, Gaia.<eos> It's around her neck.
A weapon is only theoretical.<eos> Yes, but, theoretically, if you had the materials, could it be done?<eos> It would be an extremely difficult process.<eos> But I have a question about atomic fission for you, Herr Ritter.<eos> If you were a real physicist, one who knew how to build such a weapon, and you knew it would help your country win a war... but that it could also kill thousands... what do you suppose would be stronger... your patriotism... or your moral qualms?
Whether by accident or idiocy or the will of a tyrant, these weapons will be used.<eos> And when they are, not even. God can help us.<eos> What is it you suggest, Albert?<eos> A world government.<eos> It would sit on top of all existing nations and, as adjudicator in all disputes, would make world wars a thing of history.
Well, if you like, Jane, I can float your name out there for you.<eos> You think I'd make a good judge?<eos> You do like throwing books at people.<eos> When we return, more of that signature Danny Egan wit.<eos> Plus, reading... could it be bad for your child's self-esteem?
I don't think she even finished the spell.<eos> We're gonna have to start this all over again, and now we've lost Marina.<eos> I don't even know how we're supposed to do...<eos> Don't be so hasty.<eos> Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?
I second that.<eos> My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.
In here!<eos> Wow.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's an old metalworks factory.<eos> And now it's yours.
You utilized that friendship, blurring professional lines.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> That is a bit rich.<eos> Your practice represented the testator and now the sole beneficiary of a highly contested will.<eos> Granted, the will was drafted by Dunbar and Calloway, but it's perfectly consistent with Ada's position.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> -JULIE: Thanks.<eos> Right. Um, let's get you that certificate.<eos> It's in here somewhere.
No problem.<eos> -JULIE: Thanks.<eos> Right. Um, let's get you that certificate.<eos> It's in here somewhere.<eos> -Here it is.
What is this Space Invaders shit?<eos> Clearly not.<eos> Right, full power for the Isn't again.<eos> Electric ain't for engines.<eos> It's for lights and chairs.
Look at that!<eos> - Monster.<eos> - Another log.<eos> Can I just draw your attention to a picture I've got?<eos> Here it is.
And there would be an overwhelming force waiting for us.<eos> Well, we have to do something.<eos> What?<eos> I'm detecting an anomalous energy signature.<eos> It's coming from the position recently vacated by the station.
[Adrian] Oh, it's hard to describe exactly the feeling of having a gun pointed at you.<eos> What a rush.<eos> It really puts life into perspective.<eos> I mean, just look at this sky. I...<eos> I've never seen it so blue and vibrant.
Sir, we just received an emergency flash from the UN.<eos> Apparently, they got wind of an OPA plot to bomb your transport.<eos> All traffic in or out of this airspace has been restricted until further notice.<eos> Who sent the notification?<eos> It came directly from Undersecretary Avasarala's office, sir.
Actually, be quiet.<eos> A child can leave Earth without looking back, but not an old man.<eos> Jules-Pierre may be a titan of the system, but his life, his memories are anchored to that rock.<eos> That is Earth's real gravity.<eos> It's in there.
- Mom, what happened to your forehead?<eos> - Oh, it's nothing.<eos> Mike and I were at Mee-Maw's last night and... oh, the stable got wrecked, by the way.<eos> What? How did the stable get wrecked?<eos> Anyway, you know how I have been searching forever for the perfect place for my library, and all along, it's been staring at me in my face!
Uh, while there has been some very positive progress, there are some practices, however, that require a firm stance, such as female genital mutilation.<eos> And our stance must be... who are we to judge?<eos> Don't we... in the United States, we practice male circumcision on boys as young as tiny babies.<eos> So, uh, glass houses.<eos> And I would also add that it really does help to prevent sexually transmitted diseases as well as certain types of cancer.
Like my labradoodle, Teddy, when I cover his cock in honey and give him a sticky licky.<eos> - No, bad!<eos> - Look at me.<eos> You could shut down the government.<eos> Well, maybe the government needs to be shut down - because it's broken. - Oh!
Oof, here we are.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> It is such a dump, isn't it?<eos> Although, I have to admit I sort of miss it.<eos> Aw, and it misses you, too.
It's how my mom robbed all those Carvels in the '90s.<eos> I should get going.<eos> So... group hug?<eos> I'm still trying to figure out where to take you on our third date.<eos> I want it to be special.
We'll be waiting for them.<eos> I thought you might be able to use this.<eos> It's a bit battered, but it works.<eos> This radio's got us through some scrapes.<eos> He'd be glad to know it's helping the right people.
That's what we don't know.<eos> Anyway, thanks, Steve.<eos> And, Kate, you better get home and get some kip.<eos> Look, wait, sir.<eos> Jackie's disappearance -- this was our case and it remains unsolved.
And coagulating intra-abdominal vessels.<eos> What happens to the tumor baby thing?<eos> You just suck it out or something?<eos> Wilson?<eos> Uh, the mass is harmless, so it actually stays in the belly until delivery.
This thing... burrowed into David's brain when he was a boy, maybe even a baby, and it has been there, feeding on him, ever since.<eos> - The memories.<eos> - The memories... exactly!<eos> Every time David sees this thing, or... or realizes it's there... this creature makes him forget.<eos> It rewrites his memory.
- The memories... exactly!<eos> Every time David sees this thing, or... or realizes it's there... this creature makes him forget.<eos> It rewrites his memory.<eos> Is that why we couldn't see it?<eos> I think so, and I think it made you forget as well.
Wait.<eos> How does it work?<eos> We've identified a second set of brain waves inside David's head.<eos> Now, this device targets everything that isn't David.<eos> It creates a vortex...
Okay, I see him.<eos> He's coming.<eos> Finally.<eos> They tell us time heals all wounds.<eos> And I believe it creates them.
It takes, and it runs.<eos> Like a thief.<eos> You speak about time as if it were an enemy.<eos> We can call ourselves healers all we want, but all we're really doing is just fighting the clock.<eos> And it always wins.
Signed confession.<eos> The roommate.<eos> Your pawnshop vision was the key.<eos> Well, savor this one, Clive.<eos> - It was our last case.
You must be Gaia. - I'm...<eos> - I know who you are...<eos> Wanheda.<eos> You helped my people find the bunker. Thank you for that.<eos> And you gave the flame to an unworthy king, who saw it destroyed.
R."<eos> I'm guessing the R stands for Raymond?<eos> I've never seen that letter before in my life.<eos> That is true.<eos> It came first thing this morning.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Padre, and assume you weren't harbouring a wanted murderer.<eos> When we found him, he was trying to stem the flow of blood.<eos> Doesn't mean he didn't stab her.<eos> Have you found the murder weapon?<eos> It'll turn up.
Dr. Grey.<eos> Kepner.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I... I know his name because it's on - all our stationery.
What do you got?<eos> I got into one of the Sandstorm operative's phones.<eos> Okay, this guy right here, the one Roman "forked"... he texted Borden and 15 others late last night.<eos> But the message... it just looks like spam.<eos> It's in some kind of code.
- The topcoat, I know.<eos> - Want some water? - Mm.<eos> Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.
- My head.<eos> He was... He was fine.<eos> We were talking, and he... he got tired, so he just was resting, and then he just doubled over.<eos> If... If he got better and he suddenly deteriorated...<eos> Okay, well, he has a brain bleed, and it's getting worse.
Oh, she's gonna hate me.<eos> That's a good point.<eos> It has taken me a long time to tell you.<eos> Attraction is messy.<eos> It grabs you when you least expect it.
Uh, can you help me out?<eos> Okay, yeah, one second.<eos> Yeah?<eos> The body adapts.<eos> It protects itself.
Holy fuck.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> - What? Do it.<eos> You have wards.<eos> The thing, it got to her.
- Yeah, um, about that.<eos> I am, uh, so sorry I said those things.<eos> No one should know too much about their future.<eos> - I'm not afraid of the future.<eos> Whatever is supposed to happen, it's bigger than just me.
Well, that's remarkable.<eos> The spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound which acts as its own sealant.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.
The spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound which acts as its own sealant.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.<eos> It will draw on our weaknesses, our desires, our regrets.
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.<eos> It will draw on our weaknesses, our desires, our regrets.<eos> It will promise each of us that we can remake the world just as we want it.
You said destroy, so I destroyed.<eos> It's not destroyed.<eos> It's not even charred.<eos> Any harm brought upon the spear is temporary.<eos> It will always heal itself.
You'll make a great mum one day.<eos> It would be wonderful if you could stay the whole night.<eos> Just one time.<eos> I think Leonard might have found his calling.<eos> We all thought it was writing impenetrable sermons.
Okay?<eos> And then, that's it.<eos> That's it. That's it. No more.<eos> Stupid fucking Jian-Yang and his shitty app.<eos> I don't even know if it is shitty.
Read what she wrote about Leigh Davis.<eos> My top pick, highly strategic and competitive, should go far at The Farm.<eos> So who did make the cut?<eos> León.<eos> Lydia admires his poker face but fears it conceals a divided soul...
I have a boyfriend.<eos> What?<eos> Then why are you on the app?<eos> I like to use it to make friends.<eos> No, that's not what it's for.
What?<eos> Then why are you on the app?<eos> I like to use it to make friends.<eos> No, that's not what it's for.<eos> It's a dating app.
I missed you.<eos> I'm good. I got my friends here.<eos> - Ah. - No. I...<eos> I missed you too.<eos> All right, try this wine. It's amazing.
That's right.<eos> It's three to one.<eos> Guess you won't be needing this anymore since you'll be moving in with me.<eos> - Yeah, your towel.<eos> Why won't it burn?
It's three to one.<eos> Guess you won't be needing this anymore since you'll be moving in with me.<eos> - Yeah, your towel.<eos> Why won't it burn?<eos> Because it never fully dries.
And yet I find myself drawn to this case for the uniquely challenging foe it presents.<eos> How is Frank Trimble a â€œuniquely challenging foeâ€?<eos> He's not.<eos> I'm referring to time itself.<eos> As rivals go, it's undefeated.
With that, meet Jonathan Lyons...<eos> Yale graduate, champion rower, and one of the best recruits to ever walk these halls.<eos> His first assignment was his dream assignment...<eos> Moscow Station.<eos> It was also his last.
I mean, I know she's vulnerable.<eos> Had some sort of...<eos> Yes, yes, I know, JP.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> But she currently has no alibi, and she was in the vicinity of the murder at the time it happened.
One minute, they're best of friends. Next, they can't stand the sight of each other.<eos> - They were good kids at heart.<eos> - Why did Charlie leave all those years ago?<eos> I think he fell out of love with the place.<eos> It suited Elliot, you know?
- But you hate those.<eos> I know, but I'm going away with Chelsea this weekend and she's insisting on bringing her son.<eos> Isn't no kids in the agreement that you make women sign<eos> - before you date them?<eos> - No, the agreement states that we can't make any kids, but it doesn't account for any pre-existing conditions.
I need five minutes with this.<eos> - Open or closed? - Closed.<eos> Am I good with that statement?<eos> I marked it up.<eos> It's on my desk.
Aren't you supposed to limit it to 30 minutes? - Oh, God, Jesus, no.<eos> - Not if you calibrate the workout.<eos> Oh, I'm feeling fine.<eos> It's all about listening to your body.<eos> It'll tell you when it's time to rest.
I do.<eos> Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative.<eos> Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing... and I hope we get to clear some things up for the American people.<eos> Mr. President, the floor is yours. You can take as long or as short as you like.<eos> If you have any written statement, we will include it after and it will be part of the record.
- The Greenwood Estate.<eos> - In Rosedale?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I was surprised, too.<eos> I had thought it empty ever since Lady Greenwood passed away.
Confident people are mean and selfish.<eos> - Wait, you liked awkward Scully?<eos> Giraffe-heart Scully?<eos> - Oh, my God, he has a giraffe heart?<eos> Aww, I bet it pushes on his organs.
Well, none of this makes any sense.<eos> If Cy was murdered, how is it nobody noticed it?<eos> Our colleagues are looking into that as we speak.<eos> You said you remembered the Kotite case.<eos> Oh, it got a lot of attention.
That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.<eos> Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish; so much is unprovable.<eos> But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.
Hang up!<eos> We don't need help.<eos> I don't need your help deciding when we need help!<eos> Raj, what's going on?<eos> Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
I'm sorry to have put you in such a difficult position, Harold.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Losing someone we love is painful.<eos> Agonizing even unto death.<eos> The Japanese call it tako-tsubo... a grieving surge of... abnormal electrical waves that causes the heart to deflate... and contort until it resembles a... a fishing pot.
Now... tell me where your heart is.<eos> I...<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where it is.
Gephardt added it to the Fidel Files himself?<eos> It's what he had in mind all along.<eos> That's why he was so keen to get his hands on the files.<eos> They're a Trojan horse.<eos> If he had posted this online by itself, there'd be a million questions about whether it was real, where it came from.
Brian?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Kathy used to wear a crucifix?<eos> She did, her mum gave it to her.<eos> Do you know where it is?
Well, I had a little help.<eos> I wonder what our sorry excuse of a teacher would say if he could see us now?<eos> Gold: How about, "Thank you"?<eos> Now, this was made to freeze the curse.<eos> I wonder how well it's gonna work on people.
Emma, when we met, there was just one thing that mattered to me... getting my revenge.<eos> And you did something that no one else ever could.<eos> You showed me that a heart full of love was the most precious treasure of all, and one that I don't intend to lose.<eos> They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship.<eos> And with this ring, it now belongs to you.
Yeah.<eos> You were just on the news.<eos> Your kid.<eos> You dodged a bullet.<eos> A gun assumes you can see it pointing at you, that there's something to dodge.
And how long of a road are we talking about?<eos> Indefinite.<eos> Indefinite?<eos> This confession doesn't change anything?<eos> It has an impact, but like I said, these incidents are indicative...
Check your telephone.<eos> It's the same date as when I fell asleep.<eos> In a dream, it can feel as though hours and hours have passed, but then you wake to find out you've only slept for a minute.<eos> No one in Purgatory will even realize time has passed... because in fact,<eos> - it hasn't.
They sure do know how to make a girl feel special.<eos> I mean, I've never heard so much applause, and someone actually booed me.<eos> Forget that guy. I wouldn't pay too much attention...<eos> I've never even heard that cheer before.<eos> - It's so exotic.
Hey, ladies. Looks like one of you ladies dropped your lady's ring.<eos> Your valuable...<eos> lady's ring.<eos> Eugene, where did that ring come from?<eos> - It came from...
Thank you, Captain.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> The application is due tomorrow.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - It's 96 pages.
- Are you still upset?<eos> - No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You should consider modifying your handshake.<eos> It's sending the wrong message.
Whaaat?<eos> Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.<eos> The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.<eos> Same with an egg.<eos> Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole.
Two against one, Doc.<eos> Hey! Wynonna, your condition.<eos> That's not what this is about.<eos> Give me the ring.<eos> It's mine.
Oh, my God!<eos> He's accessing BBD archives.<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm casting a binding spell so it will lure the Widows to us and you guys can kill 'em.
Do you want a reef knot or a bowline?<eos> I never broke.<eos> Never told her a thing.<eos> Why do you think I chose you to hold the ring?<eos> Yeah. It's safe and sound in my coffee cup at the station.
I got a number, and it's good.<eos> Shit.<eos> What?<eos> This offer's not just good.<eos> It's too good.
Does your firm know what it is that you did?<eos> But if you don't let this shit go, they're not gonna be the only ones I tell.<eos> And not just what I did.<eos> What you did.<eos> I let this shit go, and it comes back and hits you in the ass.
- Rachel...<eos> - Look...<eos> We've been through enough for you to know that I'm still gonna love you in the morning, but you have to ask yourself:<eos> What is your word worth?<eos> 'Cause with the way things are going, it's not gonna be worth very much.
- This is a fireable offense.<eos> - Harvey isn't gonna fire me.<eos> Yeah, but maybe he should.<eos> What is your word worth?<eos> The way things are going, it's not gonna be worth very much.
It sounds like PTSD psychosis.<eos> We see it in combat veterans a lot.<eos> Something associated with Cora's trauma triggers her memory of the trauma.<eos> The memory replays like a hallucination.<eos> To Cora, it's real.
I would think that you'd be glad that I don't.<eos> Mom, it was your favorite restaurant.<eos> If nothing happened, then why did we stop going?<eos> I think it closed down.<eos> No, it is still open, to this day.
She was complicated.<eos> Complicated?<eos> The dark dimension is volatile.<eos> Dangerous.<eos> What if it overtook her?
You've heard that whole "make an omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?<eos> I'm about to hurt you, Wade.<eos> I was a patient here once myself, you know.<eos> The treatment affects everyone differently.<eos> It made Angel inhumanly strong.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.<eos> I was a patient here once myself, you know.<eos> The treatment affects everyone differently.<eos> It made Angel inhumanly strong.<eos> In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.
- What?<eos> What do you mean, "What"? Why do you think I wanna see that?<eos> No, I'm working on a new sexting app.<eos> Okay. It's kind of like lnstagram, right?<eos> But, instead of filters, it just makes yourjunk look huge.
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.<eos> You're Bob Stone!<eos> - I made that name up.<eos> - So what?<eos> - It's not real.
Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Did you see that tree that fell?<eos> Sounded like it landed nearby.
All tugs, take evasive action.<eos> Pull back!<eos> Pull back!<eos> - Charlie!<eos> It's gonna crush the base!
Watch out!<eos> You'll put her off!<eos> You can see it, can't you?<eos> No one else can.<eos> It's invisible, Jake.
I told myself that spending $100 on a trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time to an event that I thought was silly in the first place, was...<eos> - Wasteful.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But Vera Wang made this black, strapless classic.<eos> It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.
- Wasteful.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But Vera Wang made this black, strapless classic.<eos> It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.<eos> - It was an investment.
Why is my name Hannah?<eos> Yeah, got it right here.<eos> Get those people back, please.<eos> Well, your name is very special because it is a palindrome.<eos> It reads the same forward and backward.
So we can learn Heptapod, if we survive.<eos> If you learn it, when you really learn it, you begin to perceive time the way that they do.<eos> So you can see what's to come.<eos> But time, it isn't the same for them.<eos> - It's non-linear.
But he got your name, though.<eos> One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, and he was marking it up for the Judgement, and he let me see your name.<eos> He got it in there under "M."<eos> He got Rose's name.<eos> I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.
Of course, nobody believed me.<eos> I knew what people were saying about me.<eos> I must admit, there were times when I thought, Maybe they're right.<eos> But then I thought about the magic.<eos> It changed the way I see the world the way I see trees, the way I see sunshine the way even I see you.
It's a bummer.<eos> You wasted the day on purpose.<eos> Madam, I have a fake badge.<eos> I would never impede your pretend investigation.<eos> It's not a pretend investigation.
Of course not, sir.<eos> Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir.<eos> Afternoon, Abernathy.<eos> Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.<eos> He has a crazy creature in that case, and it got out and caused mayhem in a bank.
I wish the man you were.<eos> Spare me.<eos> It's your bath too.<eos> Your ambition is noticed.<eos> Where do you hope it would lead?
Nothing does with him.<eos> I'm not afraid of him.<eos> You should be.<eos> I've read so much about this place.<eos> But being here, it actually seems kind of... familiar.
How are you doing, Con?<eos> You look tired.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mum's on this new medicine.<eos> And it will make her better.
I spoke to the doctor this morning.<eos> The new treatment, it's... it's not working.<eos> The one from the yew tree?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How can it not be working?
Yeah.<eos> How can it not be working?<eos> Things just happen fast.<eos> Faster than they thought.<eos> - How can it not be working?
Nana, you were absolutely amazing.<eos> Please, this flattery is futile.<eos> I have no intention of bailing you out.<eos> Your pathetic shows are the reason that theater no longer has an audience.<eos> Oh, but this show is gonna pack them in like it did in the good old days.
Most folks would be doing backflips to have their names cleared like that.<eos> Be outta Angola.<eos> Breathin' fresh air like a real, live person.<eos> Bury the past.<eos> Or it'll bury you, boy.
Aw, you shouldn't be in here.<eos> I took a life, Mohamed.<eos> Wasn't mine to take.<eos> How's our place?<eos> It's empty again.
In the beginning... there was only ocean... until the mother island emerged.<eos> Te Fiti.<eos> Her heart held the greatest power ever known.<eos> It could create life itself.
We have to stop them.<eos> You can't keep living like this, BFG.<eos> BFG, what did you do with my blanket?<eos> I thought you had it there.<eos> Where is it, in my other...
Wait, no...<eos> I was not scolding. Just I am trying to get the radio...<eos> Your Highness...<eos> This secret message is your amulet.<eos> It will... be able to protect you from evil forces, my knight...
Are you whipped?<eos> Wow. That water's really dirty.<eos> Gary on the line.<eos> Gary, you went out with Tonya.<eos> Tell us a little bit about the date, how it went and what's going on.
My father made a choice.<eos> He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.<eos> He's rigged a trap inside it.<eos> That's why he sent you, to bring that message.<eos> Where is it?
We've told you the reason, to stop the Jacobite rising.<eos> That is the purpose of the lie.<eos> It's not the reason.<eos> The rising is doomed to failure.<eos> it must not happen.
He lost his freedom to return home to his family, to his school, to his night job that helps pay for that school.<eos> But what he didn't lose, and what none of us can lose, were his Constitutional rights to an attorney, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his peers, and to the presumption of his innocence<eos> beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> We hear that term a lot.<eos> But what does it really mean, huh?
And what about God's truth?<eos> For His is the only truth that matters, is it not?<eos> I tell you both... it is God's will that I, Charles Stuart, unite the clans.<eos> It is God's will that I be the beacon of light, for I am, by divine right, the outstretched hand of God.<eos> Our cause shall succeed, but it cannot move forward without money, and money it shall have.
-No, you go first.<eos> -No, you first.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> It keeps falIing off.
He's downstairs.<eos> You can see him if you want.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Went into cardiac arrest.<eos> You know his heart was very weak at this point, and it just gave out.
Yes.<eos> Okay, go ahead.<eos> Uh, anyway, our bedroom is in the downstairs, and the kids sleep upstairs, so Randi makes everyone leave around 2:00... or three AM.<eos> And then... she goes back to bed.<eos> So, I go upstairs to check on the kids, and it's fucking freezing up stairs, but I can't use the central heat because it dries out Randi's sinuses, and she gives her really bad headaches.
Uh-huh.<eos> But I will do it for nothing.<eos> Which is why I didn't come here with a retainer in my hand.<eos> Because this is the kind of case that reminds me why I wanted to be a lawyer to begin with.<eos> And it'll get the full attention of my firm and all of my resources, including Chandra.
Who the fuck said anything about relenting?<eos> Look, I am talking about letting someone else stand in and play your role now and again.<eos> Thank you for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to start altering our tactics.<eos> No, I'll decide.<eos> This crew has spilled a great deal of blood to make your name what it is.
Look, I am talking about letting someone else stand in and play your role now and again.<eos> Thank you for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to start altering our tactics.<eos> No, I'll decide.<eos> This crew has spilled a great deal of blood to make your name what it is.<eos> It doesn't belong to you.
Thank you for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to start altering our tactics.<eos> No, I'll decide.<eos> This crew has spilled a great deal of blood to make your name what it is.<eos> It doesn't belong to you.<eos> It's a jointly held asset belonging to every man on this crew who sacrificed some part of himself to build it.
Well...<eos> I applaud your courage.<eos> And...<eos> And no one would enjoy seeing you triumph here more than I, obviously.<eos> But this place is just... it's so big, you know.
And one, and two, and three...<eos> The female body is a complex thing, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and brave.<eos> It carries the seed of our hopes, the bloom of our youth, the weight of our fears.
And one, and two, and three...<eos> The female body is a complex thing, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and brave.<eos> It carries the seed of our hopes, the bloom of our youth, the weight of our fears.<eos> It can nurture and tremble... inspire and terrify.
And one, and two, and three...<eos> The female body is a complex thing, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and brave.<eos> It carries the seed of our hopes, the bloom of our youth, the weight of our fears.<eos> It can nurture and tremble... inspire and terrify.<eos> It oppresses and protects us, holding within it all that we are, projecting less than we wish to be.

Is there anything you'd like say to the class?<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> I started coming to Keep Fit at an absolutely ghastly time in my life.<eos> It meant that for an hour or two each week, I didn't have to think about all the horrible and wretched things that made me so frightfully unhappy.<eos> But after a while, Keep Fit didn't just distract me, it started to make me stronger.
I thought cleanliness was close to Godliness.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> I'd have liked to have travelled more, I suppose.<eos> But work got in the way?<eos> I love nursing, but, yes, it leaves little time for a private life.
Many, many congratulations, Ian.<eos> And Linda.<eos> And now...<eos> I suppose I ought to ask to see the ring.<eos> It's lovely.
sets you up for failure.<eos> [Squabbles] You know she ain't mean no harm.<eos> Reminding you of what you ain't got can be pretty damn mean.<eos> Or it can help you focus.<eos> You know, this type of loneliness in here, it can kill.
The one and only.<eos> I need to find your daughter.<eos> She still carrying on about that ring?<eos> It ain't worth shit.<eos> Maybe it reminds her of better times... back in the day.
How many of these you own, brother?<eos> Looks like this place don't wanna be a barber shop anymore.<eos> [sighs]<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But whatever it is, it's gonna be famous.
The Ellcrys called to me.<eos> I heard it during the Gauntlet and then again tonight.<eos> I tried to ignore it, but it won't let me.<eos> Amberle, you're not making any sense.<eos> When I touch the tree, it shows me visions... horrible visions of the future.
I'm thinking someone fired a gun into them.<eos> Gun holes.<eos> So much for the suicide theory.<eos> I mean, this case is so weird.<eos> It just keeps changing and changing and changing.
Even to hold a press conference? We have set up emergency disaster control headquarters. to combat the large unidentified creature that has come ashore.<eos> The creature's heading toward Shinagawa.<eos> At a speed of about 13 km per hour.<eos> It moves slowly for it's size.<eos> It can trample through Tokyo in 3 hours.
But why ask?<eos> There's no legal purpose for it.<eos> But Mr. Cochran and the defense have a purpose for entering this area, and that purpose is to inflame the passions of the jury and ask them to pick sides.<eos> The-the "N" word is a dirty, filthy word, Your Honor.<eos> It is so prejudicial and inflammatory that the use of it in any situation will evoke an emotional response from any African-American.
¶ Can go no further ¶<eos> ¶ 'Cause you got me chained... ¶<eos> In the O.J. trial, Nicole's sister, Denise Brown, on the stand today.<eos> Emotional, stirring testimony.<eos> Will it make a difference?
Yes. It was parked strangely.<eos> Jutting out.<eos> As I got closer I noticed a small spot above the driver's side door handle.<eos> And what did this spot look like?<eos> It had the visual properties of blood.
Jorah the Andal.<eos> You have not been dismissed.<eos> You pledged yourself to me.<eos> You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.<eos> Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world.
My lord.<eos> My lord.<eos> My friends, the hour has come.<eos> Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children.<eos> But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came.
Have a drink with me.<eos> And you?<eos> What's your excuse?<eos> I have tried wine before.<eos> It made me feel funny.
The Ellcrys called to me.<eos> I heard it during the Gauntlet and then again tonight.<eos> I tried to ignore it, but it won't let me.<eos> Amberle, you're not making any sense.<eos> When I touch the tree, it shows me visions... horrible visions of the future.
- (Amberle) Tell us your name.<eos> - Bandon.<eos> Either he's hiding magic or he doesn't know he has magic.<eos> The Ellcrys called to me.<eos> When I touched the tree, it showed me horrible visions of the future.
Clearly we can't trust him.<eos> But with someone who actually knows these woods, we actually stand a chance of finding Eretria.<eos> We were taught Humans were warmongers, intent on destroying the world.<eos> But Human-kind was more than that.<eos> It was curious and compassionate, brilliant even.
You're hurt.<eos> Ow.<eos> It's just a scratch.<eos> Monkey, why didn't you tell him sooner who you really are?<eos> The magic that keeps me here, it's fading.
Good, I'm glad.<eos> Well...<eos> Wait.<eos> This letter came for you...<eos> Is it for you, Julieta?
Should I get them tea?<eos> Get 'em beer, Curly.<eos> They used to run on it like cars on petrol.<eos> Give them the Black Country stuff.<eos> It's in a barrel with the tack.
There's hope.<eos> Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.
!<eos> How come you have ice cream?<eos> !<eos> I want mine!<eos> Where is it? !
Where is it? !<eos> Where is it?<eos> !<eos> I want my ice cream!<eos> What flavor is it?
!<eos> I want my ice cream!<eos> What flavor is it?<eos> !<eos> What flavor is it?
Toss him off a roof?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My parents were in evening clothes.<eos> It was cold and wet.<eos> You-you grabbed my mother's pearl necklace; it broke.
Watch me.<eos> See?<eos> [scoffs] Smoking's gross.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It gives you cancer.
- Thank you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... I had no idea that our show failed to live up to your standards.<eos> I'm just saying, like, we're making a good show, but, you know...<eos> - It could be great, right?
Listen...<eos> Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?<eos> Well, you can't deny the past.<eos> - Past is all it is.<eos> - It doesn't have to be.
They said no.<eos> I've lost my boy and I need to know where he is!<eos> Right, so this is what we know.<eos> A British ship called the Leila Jane docked in Istanbul two days ago.<eos> It's got no right to be anywhere near Istanbul, it should be in the Azores and it should be full of crop sprayers.
And all of it cannon fodder.<eos> May I be of any assistance, Your Excellency?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> We're going to our estate in Bogucharovo.<eos> - It's over there.
It's part of his charm.<eos> Your victim, he's a photographer, a video guy.<eos> Where's his equipment?<eos> No cameras, no computers.<eos> I know where it is.
But tread lightly.<eos> Don't get too close to anyone.<eos> It never ends well.<eos> You see, the past doesn't want to be changed.<eos> There are times when you feel it push back, you know?
But they share one lobby, one reception area, so egalitarian as hell. Not to mention efficient.<eos> Oh, also... soundproof walls, what with the drilling and the pain and the whatnot.<eos> And the location, I mean, holy crap. I think this is the place.<eos> Kim?<eos> Yeah, it's great. Soundproofing.
Ah, and the Lady Broch Tuarach... a vision of true loveliness.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be Scotland without you, Dougal.<eos> Colum change his mind, then?<eos> Is the Clan MacKenzie to join the cause?<eos> Colum's mind is his own. It's no concern of mine.
She even texted you.<eos> She asked me to buy a Snow White dress from the Disney store.<eos> Of course!<eos> -Of course what? I thought the fuchsia one was prettier and can pass as a Snow White dress.<eos> Ever seen the movie? It's yellow.
Don't you understand that the show is about these Disney characters?<eos> What's it got to do with the Brothers Grimm?<eos> Did they write Mulan?<eos> I'm not saying you're wrong, but you could make an effort to listen to her, it doesn't hurt!<eos> The dress is pretty, but it clashes with the others!
We're fighting a war to protect Nassau in which our most effective weapon is the fear that we can instill in our enemies.<eos> Everything is dependent upon that gold, and right now it is sitting in a fort with no guns and full of holes.
We should have taken the pardons.<eos> Sign our name, swear to whomever or whatever the fuck one swears to on the occasion, accept the pardons, then go straight back to the account.<eos> What the fuck could they do to us they weren't gonna do anyway?<eos> I don't imagine Hornigold's offer still stands, if that's what you're asking.<eos> No, I don't imagine it does either, but a few hours ago when the offer did stand, perhaps that should have been a conversation...
It is only gossip for now, but sooner or later, it will affect him.<eos> Erode his support.<eos> Complicate the role he must play here.<eos> The governor's chair is no doubt as unforgiving as mine.<eos> It will demand the same kind of sacrifices and present the same sorts of dangers to those closest to him.
I am something new.<eos> There is no appropriate label.<eos> Do you think it's safe to say that your consciousness is superior?<eos> No.<eos> It's just different.
Let me be honest with you, Bruce.<eos> Sometimes, the less you know, the better it is for you.<eos> I don't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> When I first joined Ruhn Laboratories, we were working on a new cancer drug.<eos> It tackled chronic myeloid leukaemia, and it worked.
Okay.<eos> So, wait.<eos> All porn is kiddie porn?<eos> Basically, all entertainment is porn.<eos> It's like, everywhere.
Mr. Pell, could I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> I would like to reopen the office manager dialogue.<eos> Uh, so, upon further... further consideration,<eos> I realize that I would love to reaccept that job if it were still available.
I mean, I could have a guy draw up a document,<eos> - but I feel like...<eos> - Well, what if it makes a fortune?<eos> It's hardly Minecraft.<eos> Okay, but it could still end up making us some money.
Let's do it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Also, this does not last forever, this feeling you're having.<eos> I know exactly what you're feeling, too.<eos> This whole misery thing, it passes.
- You look incredible.<eos> I was completely right.<eos> And the whole pedophile mustache was so distracting.<eos> But now I see your face.<eos> It's beautiful.
Got his fucking murder on tape?<eos> It's been almost 15 years since 9/11.<eos> Now, we're working our asses off to make sure the next 9/11 doesn't happen for another 15 years<eos> So we're not about to compromise our entire operation to help you solve a murder that doesn't matter.<eos> It does to us.
But today she tried to quit.<eos> Still trust her?<eos> I want to.<eos> I didn't know this place was open for lunch.<eos> It's not.
That's a minimum age to serve.<eos> I am.<eos> I was born April 12, 184... 3.<eos> Allow me to take that flag?<eos> I'll make sure it's well cared for.
Haven't ate in two days.<eos> Please.<eos> Just bring some food.<eos> You ain't wearing the necklace.<eos> It too pretty for every day.
Okay.<eos> I'm close.<eos> Why would he let them implant something in his cheek?<eos> They said it was a biometric study.<eos> A dentist inserted this tiny little grain, and now... It's growing.
I fuck girls, guys.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Everyone fucks.<eos> That thing has no chance to compromise me.<eos> I hope it at least gets you off, man.
It's hard to let good people go.<eos> And I know you're not the type to take other people's feelings lightly, Harold, but that's what I like about you.<eos> You've got a good heart.<eos> Go with it.<eos> It won't steer you wrong.
I don't know.<eos> One more job.<eos> Then if you want to quit, you can.<eos> What's the job?<eos> It requires an exam.
What's it like up there?<eos> The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.<eos> It's in the bathroom.
Don't be a douche.<eos> OA wouldn't say she's an angel and then vanish.<eos> No, that's exactly what an angel would do.<eos> Homer told me his football coach once said to him,<eos> "Knowledge is a rumor until it lives in the body."
To hear it in you, too.<eos> I want to.<eos> You know I want to.<eos> It's a name truer than Prairie... than Nina, even.<eos> It sounds like...
You never got me any jewelry.<eos> Well, well, you never wanted any jewelry.<eos> I got you a wedding ring.<eos> I'm not giving him my diamond ring.<eos> Hopefully it'll be too small for him to notice.
Come on, let her slice a little.<eos> And we forgot to open the champagne!<eos> I won't say no because I love champagne.<eos> Watch out, champagne gives you gas.<eos> Not if it's good.
Before everything, I used to work for the FBI.<eos> I thought you were my friend.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> Don't disrespect that word.<eos> It means something to me.
Sure, let it slide.<eos> That's just some dog shit.<eos> But those are three devious little words.<eos> You know, if... if I let your dog shit slide, then I have to be okay then I have to be okay with this whole plaza filling up with it, which it would before we know it.<eos> Oh, then it would be on our pant legs and our shoes, and we would track it into our homes, and then our homes would smell like shit, too.
Besides, you heard Violet.<eos> If you don't show, she'll throttle me.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, we've sent our men to pick up the body of Jane Scott from the morgue.<eos> It should be here by midday.
This for you.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Do you have any questions about your objective?<eos> I am a little confused about this doohickey.<eos> Why don't you come over here, show me how it works?
Unfortunately, Daniel's dealing with Vernon Masters.<eos> He won't be coming.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Miss Carter, do you not feel that the sudden and inexplicable appearance of this signal is... rather convenient?<eos> It isn't inexplicable, Mr. Jarvis.
Yeah.<eos> So this attacker throws a bomb into your house and waits for you to run all the way downstairs and grab the fire extinguisher and then lets you get a look at him?<eos> Are you asking me to explain the motivations of a man who was attacking my family?<eos> Maybe he wanted you to see him, send a message.<eos> Well if the message was to terrify me, it worked.
Mr. Jarvis is a lucky man.<eos> I am, indeed.<eos> I'll just get Mrs. Jarvis settled, and then I'll be happy to take you wherever you need to go.<eos> Oh, that won't be necessary.<eos> I've already rung for a taxi. It'll be here any moment.
♪ We've been friends for so long ♪<eos> ♪ And I've always been your shoulder when you cried ♪<eos> ♪ And now you're asking ♪<eos> ♪ How to end your heartache ♪<eos> Rayna, it's gorgeous.
Who?<eos> The woman from the park.<eos> Oh, I guess, um...<eos> I guess your date went well, huh?<eos> It definitely exceeded expectations.
Our people, they'll never see anything but death here.<eos> Our people are wrong, Lincoln, and we can change their minds.<eos> Places are not evil, brother.<eos> People are.<eos> Abby, this place, it could do so much good for our people and theirs.
That's not really the kind of thing you remember.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> All right, I'm gonna go now.<eos> Bye.<eos> Lise, if she shoots your face off tomorrow, just remember this is what it looks like.
The family that owned it gave it to the state in the '30s.<eos> The state turned it into a living history museum.<eos> Every elementary school for 50 miles used to come here for field trips.<eos> The place was running a long time before the modern world built up around it.<eos> I think people came here because they figured it'd keep running after the modern world broke down.
What?<eos> There was something in the back room.<eos> What do you mean, "Something?"<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> It disappeared.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.<eos> It is who we are.
Why couldn't I have seen it before?<eos> Well, let's assume your blind spot usually works for you.<eos> It's fairly essentially if you don't feel indestructible like Superman.<eos> How are you gonna risk billions every morning?<eos> But it's not working for you now.
Well, Derek needs to get a life.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I do.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I think maybe I need to start thinking about my future.<eos> I don't know if it's here.
Seeing as we're using a map without any distances, it could be days before we reach Luna's village.<eos> At least we know we're going the right direction. We're running out of daylight.<eos> We should stop in the sun, recharge the battery.<eos> What sun?<eos> We keep going until it dies.
So instead of calling an ambulance or the police, you wrapped this lad's body in bin bags and slung him in an unmarked grave in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Then came back as if nothing had happened.<eos> - No, it wasn't like that.<eos> - Roll up, roll up!<eos> The show must go on... and it did.
Yeah.<eos> Okay. So, it's gotten crazy ugly between the two of them.<eos> I mean, look, I owe them my career.<eos> I love them.<eos> I do, but I love this show even more, and I really want it to continue, and at this point, I'm just not sure it will.
Hey.<eos> - You look great.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Um, are you sure about this dress?<eos> It's not too revealing?
Refugees, famine, war.<eos> War is easy.<eos> These girls are hard.<eos> Stop.<eos> The only thing hard about this show is pretending it doesn't highlight how deeply vapid American culture is.
- Are you serious?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Let me just be the first to apologize.<eos> But, look, I did find this dress.<eos> You know, it could be great.
Good, good.<eos> Uh, let... let's see.<eos> Went on another job interview today.<eos> Number 14, not that I'm countin'.<eos> Mm-hmm. How'd it go?
We're looking for a friend.<eos> There is a place.<eos> They send you there, you never come back.<eos> You can hear the screams all night.<eos> This place, where is it?
Back to the time when the Old Gods sang and there was only thee and there was only me.<eos> Give yourself to me freely.<eos> Be what you are and always were.<eos> And then?<eos> We stand at the fire as it consumes all men and all women and all the beasts of the Earth until only we are left.
I am nothing.<eos> I am no more than a blade of grass.<eos> But I am.<eos> You think you know evil?<eos> Here it stands.
And thank God for Sean.<eos> He was the one who pushed me to get this loan.<eos> Aw, he's like Superman, except for the whole junkie thing.<eos> Does he know about Gus's ring?<eos> Well, he knows that it exists, but not that I'm pawning it.
- Yes.<eos> I have some schnapps in the freezer.<eos> It's a Yamazaki.<eos> My boss gave it to me.<eos> It's fucking expensive.
I mean, that's what we signed up for:<eos> - to be heroes.<eos> - I agree with Jefferson.<eos> Yes, of course you both do, because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.<eos> Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous than changing the past, because it is still in flux.
Back at my old school... At Devenford,<eos> I got into a fight with this kid.<eos> I knocked two of his teeth out.<eos> They made me write a letter of apology.<eos> We both knew it meant nothing.
Amputees can have the sensation of an itch they can't scratch or a pain that couldn't possibly be there.<eos> The missing limb is so important, the brain acts like the limb's still there.<eos> So, my subconscious is trying to tell me what's missing?<eos> It may be.<eos> How the hell do I figure out what it's saying?
Don't move and don't make a sound.<eos> No one can help you. Do you understand?<eos> Young, healthy, a tad unsophisticated, but not bad.<eos> Listen to the heartbeat.<eos> It will tell you when to stop.
What's up?<eos> We sprang some pretty big news on you last night and I got the sense that maybe you're not as happy as we are.<eos> I... I just did not see it coming... at all.<eos> I know your surprised face.<eos> It's very different than your concerned face.
Yeah?<eos> What does Hanna need?<eos> What do you think?<eos> What's that Dr. O quote?<eos> Good writing doesn't tell you it's raining... it lets you feel what it's like to be rained upon.
That Sonic device has been modified.<eos> My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?<eos> It should have only worked with Laurel.
Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> This place truly is Hell.<eos> It makes monsters of us all.
You're seeing something that isn't there.<eos> I've got a witness that places you near the connecting door to the car deck in the middle of the night.<eos> Is he seeing things?<eos> Your alibi doesnae add up.<eos> But then, I suppose it doesn't have to, does it?
This is incredible.<eos> You've completely transformed the place.<eos> Almost looks real.<eos> "Almost"?<eos> It is real.
Well, based on the size of this vault, we'll need more.<eos> - More?<eos> - How much more?<eos> Well, look at the size of it.<eos> It's enormous, isn't it?
What's he doing?<eos> He's lifting the weight of God.<eos> And what is the weight of God like, Michael?<eos> Very fragile.<eos> It's extremely fragile.
By violence.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> Violence, per se, ought not to exist.<eos> It does exist when there is a lack of respect.
How.<eos> How can we abandon our mission?<eos> Your mission, Father Garupe, was to find news Ferreira, you have found it.<eos> Excuse me Father, but this letter<eos> Relates the most terrible story, but it says nothing of Ferreira himself.
Here, aim one hand at the sun and the other points north.<eos> Then that's north.<eos> Since when is the sun in the north?<eos> - Right now.<eos> Now look, the sun rises in the east, moves south and sets in the west. It's never in the north.
Well, you said you put the prophecy to rest.<eos> So what's the worry?<eos> I didn't sleep last night.<eos> I just had this feeling of dread.<eos> I don't know if it's my own guilt, or maybe it's my intuition telling me something's coming.
Torture him!<eos> Torture him!<eos> Justice... for Klaus Mikaelson... should be a fate worse than death.<eos> This blade is imbued with dark magic.<eos> It will cause unending agony.
Well, I got no concern.<eos> It don't make sense.<eos> She took a bath.<eos> The water was still in the tub.<eos> But her towel was sittin' where I left it, it was folded up, and it weren't damp.
For what purpose, my Lord?<eos> A necessary ruse.<eos> And I now possess all of Palmer's knowledge and memories.<eos> Thus, using Palmer's memories, I have located the other nuclear device.<eos> - Where is it?
You know what I can't stop thinking about?<eos> What we saw on the moon.<eos> I mean, it has got to be a base.<eos> Maybe it's the Factory.<eos> I did some research, and there's all kinds of specialized equipment at USC and up on Mount Wilson, and maybe the RAPs didn't bother to destroy that stuff since it's outside the Zone.
Where and when what?<eos> Where you get your spending money and... when are you letting me go to a store?<eos> Clary...<eos> Okay, that dress is way too tight.<eos> It's stretchy.
Plus, they get to work in flip-flops.<eos> Homie, it's time we figured this out.<eos> Maybe milk will help us think.<eos> How would milk do that?<eos> It's from cows who are smart enough not to get turned into hamburger.
I want to get my hands on that thing.<eos> Speaking of which, how is Alexander?<eos> I was hoping I might hear from him.<eos> Putrefaction.<eos> It's decomposing.
Marci came by, though.<eos> Some of the higher-ups at her firm were impressed with my opening argument in the Castle case.<eos> Yeah, I'm not surprised.<eos> Neither am I. Not anymore.<eos> Castle case was in many ways a disaster, but... it made me realize I'm really good at my job.
...forgive those who trespass against us.<eos> Matty, use that hearing of yours.<eos> How's her heart rate?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's good.<eos> It's steady.
Yeah.<eos> And can you never do that again?<eos> Right, sorry.<eos> So how do you afford this place?<eos> I don't; it's my mother's.
Monogamy fails again.<eos> So, if Tim didn't want out of the closet, were you aware of anyone that would want to blackmail him?<eos> Or threaten to go to the press?<eos> But Tim texted me this photo for safekeeping.<eos> I... I have no idea what it means.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Knowing what we're up against might just save lives.<eos> This creature belongs to a race devoted to the mission of killing me and mine.<eos> It'll be back.

But it attacked the Senator...<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> I brought it to National City.<eos> As Martians, we not only share our ability to shapeshift, we share a link.<eos> If I assume my true form, or phase, or reach out to it with my mind, it knows.

Nope.<eos> Switch.<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> So... So what happens at the office when the date goes bad?<eos> Kara. Please just go on the date first and have fun before you talk about it going bad.
- What have you lost?<eos> - Cigarette box.<eos> I threw it away.<eos> It was full of tat.<eos> It had a great deal of sentimental value.
Let's concentrate on last night's victims...<eos> This young mother and her 3-year-old.<eos> I want to get on top of this gang crap right now.<eos> The past can wait.<eos> Except it's already here. You're talking about the gun, Tao?
Never would I have agreed to this in a million years. Are you sure it would have made a difference?<eos> From what I recall, when your wife felt strongly about something, she did not shy away from confrontation. No. No.<eos> She mostly got her way.<eos> She didn't ever just out-and-out lie to me, sir.<eos> Maybe Maria found a way to phrase her decision so it sounded less drastic than it was.
- I mean... - Hi, Gus.<eos> - Hello. - How was your trip in?<eos> Great.<eos> I think I have the subway down.<eos> I just wish it went all the way to work.
I had to do the selling.<eos> And you think that was gonna be easy for me, with her almost 40?<eos> But I was willing to work it for both of us.<eos> The robbery wasn't for both of you.<eos> It was to set her up and force her into taking...
Debts will accrue rapidly.<eos> It will be advisable to sell within a year.<eos> Sell it?<eos> Mum and Dad spent 30 years building this place up.<eos> Now it's... it's worthless.
Welcome to the Physical Kids' Cottage.<eos> It's the single best place on campus for a number of reasons that will become clear as soon as you taste our signature cocktail.<eos> I-I've got to...<eos> Try on this dress I have.<eos> It's perfect.
- It's conceivable that he made some sort of accord with them, brought them over to the New World to finish the job.<eos> Carla, I have been given a new medication.<eos> - You might call it experimental. - What is it?<eos> I need to look it up.<eos> What if it interacts badly
That suggests someone creeping up on him from behind.<eos> But someone stole the money AND his phone.<eos> So we're dealing with a thief who's clever enough not to leave fingerprints and levitate above a worktop, but dumb enough to leave behind a watch worth a fortune?<eos> Hmmm. So a botched burglary is what it looks like.<eos> But that's exactly what it is not.
Alfred, I will say a prayer for you every day,<eos> But you are very fortunate.<eos> You know, when you are dirty, you have a bath to wipe off the dirt.<eos> Well, going on a pilgrimage is like taking a bath for the soul.<eos> It wipes away the dirt from the soul.
I was just coming to see how the boats were progressing.<eos> What do you say, helga?<eos> What shall we tell him?<eos> We think that it won't be long until you have boats. Ready and able to take you to the mediterranean sea!<eos> If it exists.
We have to go to the George V.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you'll look out of place in a little bistro on the Saint-Sulpice... wearing this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Jean, it's beautiful.
She's a good woman. Hmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One more thing.<eos> This envelope came for me the day after.<eos> I think it's from him.
Let's see what a seven will do to S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> I was aiming for his leg.<eos> Where is Zoom's lair?<eos> Where is it?
Though it will give me no satisfaction I must do what the law demands of me.<eos> Right, hold on, let's make a little hole.<eos> So, is the plant inside the seed?<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> - How does it fit in there?
No.<eos> It's clean.<eos> In 1979, I was ten years old.<eos> All of us kids, we lived here at the inn.<eos> And our parents had one rule, it was the granddaddy rule of them all.
What apartment?<eos> You know, the good news for you is I'm not here because you're a worthless traitor, okay?<eos> - I just want the research.<eos> - Why?<eos> You know it won't change anything.
Thanks for coming.<eos> This is gonna be really quick.<eos> This is Abe, the notary.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> It's in a safety deposit box at the bank, which is closed right now, but I can grab it for you first thing tomorrow morning.
And now we've got nothing else to show for four bastard years of war!<eos> But you don't remember where you stashed it.<eos> Yeah we remember.<eos> In the caves.<eos> But it'd gone!
Do whatever you like.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> I've known soldiers like you before.<eos> And maybe you were good men once.<eos> But when you see so much violence, it becomes the only thing you truly understand.
Never satisfied, born greedy.<eos> And here you are, desperate to be one of them.<eos> End your alliance with Gaston.<eos> I have made him an offer of reconciliation.<eos> It's a generous one, which I believe he will accept.
Don't shoot!<eos> You still need me alive.<eos> But not intact.<eos> Everything points to a concerted effort by your enemies to tarnish your name, Majesty.<eos> Ruin your Regency's chances before it even begins.
Speedsters... we're not the only two out there, you know?<eos> This isn't the first time I've time traveled.<eos> How come I've never seen one of these until now?<eos> Because you ran out of luck.<eos> And Time Wraiths hate it when speedsters manipulate the timeline, and now that thing's gonna do everything it can to end you.
- No, no.<eos> T-that's fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> I-I just don't think that a partnership is a good idea for me.<eos> I understand it could make me extremely rich, but that's not what I'm all about.
Kyle.<eos> I was just about to go for a jog when I saw you, and... I-I wanted to see if you got any of our mail.<eos> I'm expecting a letter.<eos> No.<eos> But if it shows up, you can take your shirt off again and come and get it.
Let me give you a hand, Esben.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Do you take milk?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> - Otherwise it's in the fridge.
What are you doing here, John?<eos> I came in, I answered all your questions.<eos> Listen.<eos> This investigation...<eos> It-It's all ongoing.
- Yeah.<eos> That gives me hope.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Um... I decided to take you up on that offer, if it's still open.
Last year, a Polish paper did a profile on him.<eos> They said that he was a ruthless negotiator and implied that he had assassins on retainer.<eos> So maybe one of the rival oligarchs had him killed.<eos> I would've thought, if a Russian wanted him dead, they would do it in Russia, where the authorities can be relied upon to turn a blind eye.<eos> Perhaps he came to New York on business, it went poorly, and someone decided to do unto him before he did unto them.
Mind the open sewer.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what I think we should do?<eos> Go sit outside the embassy and wait for it to open.
The other dimension.<eos> Is it like this one?
Stefan!<eos> Hi there, hero.<eos> You've been out a long time.<eos> The spell's not working.<eos> It pulled Stefan out, no problem.
What's going on?<eos> Opening the doorway to this dimension may not have been a good idea.<eos> On a scale from one to namaste, how screwed are we?<eos> Demons are attracted to this dimension.<eos> It's defenseless and peaceful.
I am.<eos> Truly.<eos> Now, let's choose a wedding dress!<eos> Will it taste nice?<eos> Medicine always tastes nice, as long as you remember it's going to make you better.
You find a man named Frederick Tanner.<eos> He's in or around New York City.<eos> The sooner you're able to figure out where that is, the more lives you'll be able to save.<eos> Is he planning an attack?<eos> It's already happening.
I get pulled in, who's to say what happens to that file?<eos> Lucy, we're done.<eos> This case is over.<eos> We have everything we need to nail the hedge fund.<eos> No, there is one more thing before we file charges, Adrian, and you know how important it is.
You guys hear that?<eos> Hey, Maurice.<eos> So the electricity's not making it out of the generator.<eos> It's-it's not reaching the power lines.<eos> Exactly. It's just disappearing into thin air.
So, find the guy, shed some blood, and show her who's not athletic.<eos> I mean, what are you doing walking around with that in your pocket, not talking to her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm afraid of what she'll say.<eos> You know in my experience, when you have that hunch, it's usually right.
You had assured Mr. Pfender that his engagement ring was on hold at the pawnshop.<eos> But we called to check, and that ring has been sold. He said he would hold it;<eos> that guy that works there is a fucking prick.<eos> Given its sentimental value, we're working with a valuation of $15,000.<eos> It's not worth half that.
These are yours now, honey.<eos> There's no "Ben" here on the ward.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Loneliness is a dangerous thing.<eos> It can turn you into someone you don't even recognize.
Quagmire?<eos> Uh, oh... uh, uh...<eos> I have a hobby that takes me this way.<eos> Hey, I'm freezing. You got a blanket in there or something?<eos> I got a towel, but it's wet because I'm eating peaches.
Careful.<eos> That beer cost more than I spent on underwear last year.<eos> I don't like it up here.<eos> I don't even like beer.<eos> It's so bloaty.
Are you saying you were after my job?<eos> Of course I wasn't.<eos> But who the hell am I kidding, you know?<eos> I mean, I'm not Frodo.<eos> Once I got that ring of power, we all know it would've consumed me.
- He claims he's heard voices.<eos> - In his head.<eos> You have to admit, such a device would be revolutionary.<eos> To be able to talk to loved ones you've lost.<eos> It could also save a woman from execution.
Hopefully, we'll be able to make contact through the Necrophone.<eos> We are quite excited to see this remarkable device.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> Marvellous.<eos> How does it work?
- Excuse me?<eos> Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.<eos> We need to rehabilitate it.<eos> That means pro bono, and you know it.<eos> One free case is not going to move the needle, no matter how worthy it is.
The Palace is issuing a statement about Al-Qadi.<eos> Denying responsibility.<eos> President Al Fayeed acknowledges the sheik's opposition to his rule, but he also recognizes his commitment to the people of Abuddin.<eos> That the Caliphate would assassinate him is a measure of their fear.<eos> It underscores the importance of the president's efforts to destroy this evil before it infects Abuddin...
Alex, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, we've been going over Miranda's timeline, all right?<eos> Her entire week.<eos> It doesn't match the Voice at all.
So, we were looking for his weakness.<eos> And we just found it.<eos> Castle:<eos> Hey. Celebratory champagne.<eos> Felt appropriate, given the twist it played In today's courtroom drama.
So, apart from Jay and Rosey, everyone else was in the marquee when this happened?<eos> Miss Ronson, what were you doing?<eos> She was supposed to be helping me get Sadie into her dress.<eos> What, you need two people to get someone into a dress?<eos> It's quite intricate, it ties at the back.
- Looks like ecstasy.<eos> - Right.<eos> Well, let's get them over to the lab and wait for toxicology to confirm what they are.<eos> We also found her towel.<eos> It was on her bed, bone dry.
I mean, the fact that they needed to call us at all means that the intrusion's much more sophisticated.<eos> I'm thinking that Flight 272's onboard GPS device may have been tampered with.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> One device can cause 50 separate phantom planes to appear?<eos> Well, technically, if it can create one, it can create 50, and we both know that there's not 50 Flight 272s flying around up there.
That it had been referred to D.O.I.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I worked another Sandy construction case in Brooklyn.<eos> And it never made it to the grand jury either.
Stupid!<eos> She's long gone by now.<eos> I gotta find her.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Axel, whatever your mission was, it's over.
That's a real thing?<eos> That's not just a bunch of country boys running around in the woods with some guns playing soldier?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> - It's a real thing.
Did you learn all this since the rising?<eos> I was a high school phys. Ed. Teacher.<eos> Yep.<eos> Taught fencing at the y.<eos> Never thought it'd actually have any practical value.

Okay, sidenote... You both might want to be on this side of the room, especially if you're wearing any jewelry or you have any metal plates in your body.<eos> - Huh? - Excuse me?<eos> The stray energy from the accelerator reactivated Girder's brain... Well, parts of it, anyway.<eos> So I disassembled our MRI machine to set up these... Electromagnets.<eos> So, when Girder walks through that door and gets caught in the field that they generate, it should disrupt the energy wave that turned him Abby Normal.
I need to show you something.<eos> The Author's pen?<eos> I thought you destroyed it.<eos> I did, but that just brought it here.<eos> The Apprentice told me where it was.
What is a vote?<eos> Well, I think that's pretty obvious.<eos> Oh, is it, Your Honor?<eos> In many cultures, the word vote can mean a myriad of things.<eos> It can mean a celebration.
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.<eos> Oh, is it, Your Honor?<eos> In many cultures, the word vote can mean a myriad of things.<eos> It can mean a celebration.<eos> It can mean a dance around a fire.

I barely notice.<eos> I lost one between Nick and Alicia.<eos> One week her heart was beating-- bap, bap, bap, bap.<eos> Too fast to count.<eos> Next checkup, it just stopped.
Well, thank you so much for coming.<eos> It was my pleasure.<eos> Oh, gentlemen.<eos> Well, that was completely useless.<eos> Ma'am, we need a final decision right now, even if it's the wrong one.
Huh, hey.<eos> Ash! Ruby, shit's gone so sideways, it's basically upside down.<eos> Have you found the spell...<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> It's working.
Because, apparently, Jack's empty fucking chair is a better choice than I am.<eos> So, maybe... maybe ask the chair, see what it thinks.<eos> Say what you will about the chair, but at least it never told me to build a fucking box. True.<eos> Compared to Richard, it's a lot sturdier.<eos> And it has a lot less of Barker's ass rubbed all over it.
-Okay.<eos> -It is possible that grigory, Even though he did not work here, Kept a dedicated e-mail account on our private server.<eos> This will tell us a little bit more About his investigation into his mother's death.<eos> Yes.<eos> And there it is.
Did you hang up?<eos> She hung up on me.<eos> Look, and now he just took the last craft beer, which he said he didn't even want.<eos> That bastard.<eos> I'm so pissed at him, I'm gonna drink the last craft beer, even though it tastes like thick, soapy shampoo.
I was gonna give it to him and then he...<eos> You know, he broke up with me.<eos> So I was gonna mail it to him, then I decided not to.<eos> So I decided to burn it, but then I didn't do that, either.<eos> That's why it's a little scorched.
If what this guy's planning goes off, we're talking a lot more casualties than a tornado.<eos> Fire Department.<eos> Anyone home?<eos> These hinges look bent to you?<eos> That window, it's sagging.
Oh. Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Don't miss the trade agreement.<eos> Page three.<eos> It's finally happening.
But with the modernization to the cities, industry can thrive.<eos> And it will help close the enormous wealth gap and, in turn, raise the standard of living for everyone.<eos> We're talking about generations of people who have only lived close to the land.<eos> Ambassador Maxwell, I understand.<eos> This agreement, it isn't perfect, but at the end of the day, the positive effects clearly outweighed the negative.
Wynken, Blynken and Nod.<eos> Yeah, that sounds great.<eos> I just... I think he'll prefer that to the saw, I'll be honest.<eos> We scoop it out and get it back into its domicile.<eos> Because it lives inside a coffee can.
See, ladies and gentlemen, what I've been telling you?<eos> And we were together... alone... the night that Red Killeen was murdered.<eos> That's how I know he has no crime to conceal.<eos> So, no, I don't wear my wedding ring any more.<eos> I don't even know where it is!
I reckon I can tell you t'whereabouts of that wedding ring.<eos> She sold it me... in return for taking her to Settle.<eos> She were going after her boy.<eos> He'd run away.<eos> It's in a shop there.
What do you want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just wanted to thank you.<eos> For my knee, I mean.<eos> It doesn't hurt anymore.
Mm, you really are awesome at that.<eos> Good call on the bathroom, by the way.<eos> - Like, really good choice.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I used a new app... it shows you where all the nearest public bathrooms are.
Donald Cooperman would love nothing more - than to destroy you. - Hmm.<eos> Don't give him that chance, okay?<eos> Please?<eos> Please.<eos> Just so you know, I got a case, and I think it's a pretty damn good one.
- Why?<eos> Well, it's just indiscreet.<eos> - And I haven't got the job yet.<eos> - What about that tree?<eos> It's blocking all the light.

Well, what's the good news?<eos> Your friend Alma called.<eos> How the fuck did he get the case reinstated in state court?<eos> It was dead in state court. I saw it die.<eos> - And yet it lives.
I didn't think so.<eos> See you in court!<eos> You can't second-guess agents of the judiciary, Your Honor.<eos> As you yourself know, judges need wide-ranging discretion in order to do their jobs and not worry about taking an unpopular stance or making an honest mistake.<eos> Discretion, yes, but it can't be unlimited.
Part of learning how to make decisions is learning how to live with poor decisions.<eos> Last Halloween, you disciplined a student for wearing a "Caitlyn" costume, which you said made fun of trans students.<eos> You did, not the student council.<eos> Well, no one brought a petition to the student council, - but that didn't mean that the...<eos> - Yes, but before the council acts, after it acts, whether it acts at all, you do.
-They're K cups.<eos> -DALE: Clive.<eos> I just can't win with that woman.<eos> Check out this Shady Plots surveillance photo.<eos> It's blurry, it won't hold up in court, but it could be something.
It's very appealing.<eos> Keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Internal Affairs can take it from here.<eos> You're going to need backup someday, Babineaux.<eos> Fingers crossed it gets there in time.
Why?<eos> Why would Dad cut these out?<eos> Okay, look...<eos> Look, the Silver Bells case was everywhere.<eos> I mean, it was all over the news, right?
Hello, this is Mrs. El-Mansour.<eos> Hi.<eos> I bought a black dress from you.<eos> Yes?<eos> I wanted to know when it would be ready.
Yes?<eos> I wanted to know when it would be ready.<eos> - What's the name?<eos> - El-Mansour.<eos> It'll be ready later this afternoon.
Did you say Tucker?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - That name mean something?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's on a consent form from a cellphone I downloaded at the crime scene.
That's not true.<eos> You survived.<eos> You created this space, the space in your head the monster couldn't get to.<eos> But that place never went away.<eos> It was still here for you when you needed it.
Step aside.<eos> This creature isn't the monster. You are.<eos> And if you want to shot him, you'll have to shoot me first.<eos> You've made a fateful decision tonight.<eos> I just hope, for all our sake... it was the right one.
And I call her "Meemaw""<eos> because, well, just, well, look at her.<eos> It's interesting that<eos> Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don't.<eos> Oh, well, you know, now-now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.
Bye.<eos> There you are.<eos> Well done, Jamie.<eos> Unfortunately, we cannot overlook the fact that Mr. Ruiz has broken the law for years.<eos> And we're willing to make a generous offer, but it will include jail time.
Let's go.<eos> BISHOP:<eos> Mr. President... I said this case made me reconsider why I became an agent.<eos> Well, that's not entirely true.<eos> It made me want to work harder.
It could be something to do with Mary's past.<eos> For once, just let the police do their job!<eos> I would, if I thought they were capable of doing anything!<eos> There's something about the attack on Mary's garden.<eos> It's not like the others.
There's something about the attack on Mary's garden.<eos> It's not like the others.<eos> The police have missed it!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, it didn't affect her chances of winning the competition, did it?
- There was a lawyer present.<eos> Nobody forced you to sign anything.<eos> Look, I don't like doing this. I'm...<eos> I'm only asking to see her.<eos> I-I-I saw this dress. It's... it's purple. It's her favorite.
Damn it!<eos> (tires screeching)<eos> The dress has landed.<eos> - (tires screeching) - Good-bye.<eos> Oh, God, it's perfect.

If he left something here, I want it found.<eos> It's not impossible, it's ingenious.<eos> He's using Grace's site to take over CTOC.<eos> You vetted that connection yourself.<eos> You said that it was safe.

As a police officer, violence... is part of my everyday life.<eos> But that's not the same as experiencing violence personally.<eos> That is to say, having violence perpetrated against you, and/or maybe even losing a loved one.<eos> As Marcia said, many people believe that violence only occurs on the 6:00 news.<eos> It only happens to other people.
As Marcia said, many people believe that violence only occurs on the 6:00 news.<eos> It only happens to other people.<eos> You know, something that the public doesn't always know is that when the police work a homicide, they refer to the case by the victim's name only.<eos> I never realized how important that was... until my brother Danny Rayburn lost his life to violence.<eos> Violence is particularly difficult when it... happens in the family, and I have experienced that as well.
I was saving it for a special occasion.<eos> It's the closest thing I have to a family heirloom.<eos> I want you to have it,<eos> Jane.<eos> It's beautiful.
Hey, boss.<eos> Just spoke to the landlord, and get this.<eos> Evan had a roommate...<eos> Jordan Scott, 35.<eos> I pulled up his file, boss, and it is thick.
Do you have a more pressing appointment?<eos> There's an anti-slavery bill going through Parliament.<eos> I'm worried about its outcome.<eos> Surely slavery was abolished a long time ago?<eos> It's still legal in some Caribbean islands.
Not in these circumstances.<eos> The relationship between Crown and Parliament is a sacred one and I will not allow you to put it in danger.<eos> Drina can be foolish, and headstrong maybe, but she's not mad.<eos> Visiting Melbourne at his house on a whim is hardly rational.<eos> I suppose he had a mad wife, so this kind of behaviour is quite unexceptional to him, but it is not fitting in the Queen.
Look, the long and short -- it's like a game of hot potato.<eos> You got to keep paying it forward.<eos> If you don't, you die.<eos> Melissa, this curse started with you.<eos> And I think it wants to end with you.
They all do.<eos> Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn.<eos> I mean, a month, a year, however long later, they all come back -- same story, different man.<eos> So you tweak the curse?<eos> Now it not only punishes the cheaters, but the foolish women who want them back.
You didn't break out of prison just because your old man was kicking the bucket.<eos> He has your share of the gold.<eos> When you found out he had a stroke, you panicked because you were worried that his new wife was gonna steal your gold.<eos> The thing I don't get is, why didn't you just have your partner on the outside get it for you?<eos> You don't know where it is.
She's ready.<eos> And just when she was beginning to feel defeated, there it was.<eos> That's when Jane learned a very important lesson.<eos> You never know when inspiration will strike.<eos> And let me tell you, when it happens... there's nothing quite like the rush of finding the flow.
I've always been a bit of a drifter.<eos> Suppose some find that something to be proud of.<eos> My experience says drifting is just another word for running.<eos> Running ain't in my nature.<eos> Well, maybe it didn't use to be, but enough time in the dark...
The department's decided to reopen the investigation into Charles Baskerville's death.<eos> We now have reason to believe he was murdered.<eos> You think I did it?<eos> A witness told us that Charles was chased down by some sort of strange animal.<eos> It might even be as strange as this.
It-it's the animal, it's the thing.<eos> Tell me the cops are coming.<eos> Henry, be quiet.<eos> It's in the damn house.<eos> It's breaking down the door.
When will you believe I'd do anything for you?<eos> I think I'm getting there.<eos> Is that?<eos> My heart.<eos> It's beating.
Boats pull up, take 'em away.<eos> Vanish into the Atchafalya.<eos> All we have to do now, Brody, is find a boat in 250,000 acres of coastal wetlands.<eos> Well, I think I found a way to track our boat.<eos> Um, when a... when a vessel travels a waterway, it leaves behind an oil trail.

ATF told us it was not our concern, and it didn't end well, so... that's the game you're playing, tell me now, amigo.<eos> Don't waste my time.<eos> It's a top-secret op.<eos> Military weapons have been disappearing for years, so we installed these tracking chips.<eos> Not anticipating this robbery but... when it happened, it seemed like a... good opportunity to test our system.

I assume you've met our foreign secretary?<eos> As first lady, yes.<eos> Madam.<eos> General.<eos> I'm not sure that I can accept your offer, generous though it is.
And here you are, in my wedding gown.<eos> I mean, you may as well have just signed a confession.<eos> First of all...<eos> I look amazing.<eos> And I'll admit, I was surprised when I tried it on and it fit like a glove.
The letter is for Mister Grant.<eos> As you can see, the seal is unbroken.<eos> Ah, ah, no, no!<eos> It's, it's not for you.<eos> It's for Mr. Grant.
I didn't know I'd be working at this bar.<eos> I mean, I-I didn't know a lot of things.<eos> - Nobody knows the future.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It is, by definition, unknown.
That sounds good.<eos> Nina?<eos> Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> Frankie, would you get my coat?<eos> - It's on my chair.
You are a princess, and Sean will be your prince.<eos> People love a fairy tale.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Oh, one more thing... do not take this ring off, because it will be extremely painful... for your children.<eos> It's very nice.
What the fuck does that mean?<eos> Maybe they found your sex tape.<eos> I don't have a sex tape.<eos> You don't have a sex... even I have a sex tape, man.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a really awful sex tape.
And a soul can never heal.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
Or shall I deprive you the pleasure you seek and kill him myself?<eos> Regina.<eos> Here's what's going to happen...<eos> Leave town, and Jekyll is all yours.<eos> The problem is, my work is here... in Storybrooke, and it's only just beginning.
Why are you doing the locator spell?<eos> Roland had a gift.<eos> Zelena lost it.<eos> Robin's feather.<eos> You know better than anyone why it didn't work.
Over the past decade, the partnership between the FBI and the Jeffersonian Institution's Forensic Division has resulted in over 250 murder convictions, making it one of the most successful collaborations in law enforcement history.<eos> In order to better understand the partnership and how it works,
Ten beers and zero fish, baby!<eos> Yeah, yeah!<eos> Holy crap, Doc, is that a dead body?<eos> No, I don't think so, bro.<eos> Doc, I think it's real.
Holy crap, Doc, is that a dead body?<eos> No, I don't think so, bro.<eos> Doc, I think it's real.<eos> I think it's a mannequin.<eos> Oh, I don't know, Doc, I'm thinking it's real.
You think I speak French?<eos> Here, it's all yours.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> I'm gonna go read this file, because it's in English.
We're going to help you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I came as quickly as I could.<eos> We need to get her to a hospital, preferably in Port Elizabeth, and persuade them to give her a drug called metronidazole.<eos> It's new. It's still experimental, but I've read reports on it and I'm prepared to beg.
I was at Spencer's when you dropped off Hanna.<eos> Emily.<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you staying here now?<eos> No, I was just... thinking about this place today and wondering what it looked like now.
The tree?<eos> Hanna, look around you.<eos> It's all trees.<eos> We're in a forest.<eos> No, I put it by this tree because it looked like one of those trees that those-those little men would live in.
Luggage tags, check.<eos> We actually don't have a luggage tag for the dress.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> We will not be checking the wedding dress.<eos> It's delicate and lacy.
I was pretty focused on making it to the Olympics.<eos> I remember.<eos> Well, then I had a little car accident.<eos> Tore up my knee pretty badly.<eos> It heeled maybe 90% back to where it was.
No, no, it's okay, I can tell you.<eos> Archer fled to France a few days ago on a fake passport.<eos> France?<eos> I know that's not the news you wanted to hear.<eos> The case is still open but since he's overseas it's shifting out of my jurisdiction.
- Then you better find out.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Cause of death was a single penetrating wound to the upper torso on the left side.<eos> The blade entered just below her ribcage and was thrust upwards.<eos> It travelled four inches before it finally penetrated her heart.
It doesn't make sense.<eos> It's like asking a race car to adapt to a covered wagon.<eos> - Poetic.<eos> - Maybe we should all try to, you know, take our egos out of it.<eos> Well, my ego would love to have a good night's sleep, but sadly it has to rewrite your code first.
It is beautiful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And what do you want me to say?<eos> I... I'm proud of this place.<eos> But back then, it was this secret.
Give me a job, make me useful.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. President.<eos> Is this real?<eos> We analyzed the photo. It's real.<eos> It went up on a private site to Caliphate insiders.
It is our only choice.<eos> And who we are.<eos> In the face of hate, this is our answer.<eos> "The quality of mercy is not strain'd.<eos> It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. Upon the place beneath, it is twice blest,
I just wanted to call for a minute.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Bye, Hanif.<eos> Ah, I didn't know anything about this place.<eos> It's wonderful.
Let me guess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That one summer was...<eos> Pretty great.<eos> If it was so great, why only one summer?
- You got him to come to the shrine?<eos> - I told him I had the money.<eos> I was waiting for him.<eos> But Kat worked it out, didn't she?<eos> When we showed her the video from Horsley's computer, she knew where it had come from.
The door's never supposed to be closed, ever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you get into a vault door?<eos> We can try.<eos> What's it look like?
Who would believe that my children would do this thing?<eos> I sacrificed so much for them.<eos> And police brought charges against all three of your children, correct?<eos> How about using this interview?<eos> You could say it biased the jury pool, making a fair trail impossible.
Unh! Hit me, people!<eos> Except you.<eos> Here's some champagne.<eos> You all earned it.<eos> It's expensive, too.
You know, it's... it's just a massive stroke.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> We can see him breathing.<eos> His heart's beating.<eos> It's strong.
Wh... old-growth what?<eos> Don't.<eos> We made calls to ginseng dealers all over the state.<eos> We found one, named Xiang Wu, who said he'd met you at the property several times.<eos> You know how much it's worth.
I'm Marc.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I am delighted to meet you too.<eos> Take a seat, welcome to the house.<eos> It's a bit like our home here.
You say possessive. I say, uh, romantic.<eos> Hey, Krystal.<eos> W-What's wrong?<eos> - You vet this place?<eos> - It's solid.
Yes.<eos> Hi. Ooh. Oh, my goodness.<eos> Oh. Isn't she...<eos> She's so cute. Oh, my God.<eos> Agriculture has long been the foundation of this country, beginning, as it did, right here in the great Commonwealth of Virginia, a land which has yielded so many valuable resources.
And armor is only as strong as the man who wears it.<eos> I don't want to shoot you guys.<eos> I love ninjas.<eos> That was the armature relay.<eos> It enhances the limbs' reaction time.
Grey?<eos> That is not a reaction to time travel.<eos> What did you just see?<eos> A woman.<eos> Someone I've never met, but her face, it keeps... flashing in my mind.
I know our first date didn't shatter any records.<eos> I mean, it wasn't that bad.<eos> It was...<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> It wasn't that great, either.
We have to stop meeting here.<eos> No one saw me.<eos> I was careful.<eos> I ordered wine.<eos> It's in here.

Who is Jason Putnam?<eos> My name is Jason Putnam, and I have something to confess.<eos> Over the past year, while working as a private financial advisor, I embezzled over $800,000.<eos> Mostly from elderly clients whom I believed were less likely to detect the fraud.<eos> Jason Putnam posted this video to his profile three days ago and it immediately went viral.
I figured out why Shaw broke in here.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He was looking for a weapon.<eos> It's the only thing that can kill the Antichrist.
Who's this, Ma?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know that picture.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - It used to hang on the wall.
In your chest, right there, behind your bra?<eos> - You step back now.<eos> - Not mine.<eos> No, mine's floated up my neck and it's beating inside my skull.<eos> It's just... it's beating inside my skull and it's driving me crazy.

Castillo is a snake.<eos> Make sure my shipment arrives from California in good shape, and I'll talk to Wilson about St. Louis.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - Store owner Bob said they loaded his food into shipping containers.<eos> Maybe that's what it is...
I'll be.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> It really is.<eos> This place has been here longer than I have.<eos> Damn, I didn't realize it was that old, Carl.
If you're just gonna stand there and breathe...<eos> You shouldn't be at work. - Huck.<eos> - You're not ready.<eos> The first one... the kill...<eos> It stays with you.
You'll understand what needs to be done.<eos> You will pick a side, and then you will handle this situation in the manner we both know it needs to be handled.<eos> 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue power.<eos> You will burn it down and never look back.<eos> The apple does not fall far from the tree, Olivia, poison though it may be.

Buddy of mine keeps going back to Afghanistan.<eos> This is what he likes.<eos> Is that where you were?<eos> Use the forge to temper the blade.<eos> You want it thin enough to cut... Hard, but not brittle.
I couldn't sleep all week.<eos> I could ignore the mountain of complaints in my in-box, but I care too much.<eos> I came up with a better solution.<eos> Just because you think you need to sprinkle your fairy dust over everything around here before you feel satisfied doesn't mean it's better.<eos> No, it is better.
Have fun.<eos> My spies say the bash is "off the hook."<eos> What's that mean?<eos> You don't know that expression?<eos> No, does it mean out of hand?
It's when a starved body can't process an excess of new food.<eos> The body shuts down... dies, even.<eos> For centuries, our people have been starved of prosperity and opportunity.<eos> You can't just open up a buffet and expect a starving person to make smart choices.<eos> You have to feed the starved body a little at a time so that it can get well again.
Go to my house.<eos> You two are a couple now?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> My engagement announcement is coming out in The Gazette tomorrow, and it will feature Mario's name, his family name.

So are you ready to pull your first oar?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Okay, so part of the stroke is in your wrist.<eos> It's called feathering.<eos> You want to twist the oar so it doesn't catch the water.
For what?<eos> For the Laundromat.<eos> The lease.<eos> You'd give me 80,000 for this place?<eos> I never thought it was worth that much.
What just happened?<eos> I just disarmed the bomb.<eos> But you didn't pick a wire, it was just...<eos> Despite the plots of the many movies that you tell me are good, which are in fact not good, bomb-makers don't build tests of electrical engineering skill, they build devices that go bang.<eos> The simpler the device, the more likely it is to explode.
Thank you.<eos> Athena, hey.<eos> They tell me this wine is good.<eos> I don't really know anything about wine.<eos> I mean, it tastes nice.
What do you think?<eos> Mm, it's OK.<eos> - You a wine person?<eos> - No.<eos> Hm, well, it's expensive.
Did you just rip that book in half?<eos> What are you, the Hulk?<eos> Um, yeah, you want to know something about the dress.<eos> Right, okay, um...<eos> It's white.
Jess... thank you.<eos> And, Cece, about your dress...<eos> I should have told you before but, um...<eos> But Jess... says that it's, uh...<eos> That it's gorgeous.
Called Brandon's mother as a favor, because I asked her to.<eos> You even loaned her a necklace.<eos> It's a necklace my mother gave me...<eos> Amethysts in rose gold...<eos> It belonged to my grandmother.
Execution?<eos> Listen, that's not my word.<eos> I will not say that.<eos> But I will make a statement, Frank, and you're not gonna like it.<eos> Because it would be premature.
Each one arms her with a different power.<eos> A sense of proportion allows her to change size.<eos> A sense of humor allows her to fend off most forms of attack.<eos> A sense of self allows her to appear and disappear.<eos> Okay, well, decency doesn't give her an actual power, but it makes it possible for her to win the rarest sense of all... common sense, which lets her see everything more clearly.
Have you been thinking all night that they've been putting tropical fruit in the wine?<eos> No, okay, so what it is, right, there just shouldn't be much else in wine other than grapes, okay?<eos> The reason why it's interesting is because, like, the same variety of grape grown in different soil or different weather would always taste different, right?<eos> They're just words they use to try and describe this particular flavour profile.<eos> It's sort of why wine is so, like, romanticised, why it can be so expensive, 'cause you can never replicate what's happening in that bottle.
All right, say he picks up the phone.<eos> How close can we get?<eos> If Pablo talks in Medellín, we'll know every word he says.<eos> -Can you get his exact location?<eos> -If it's within range, yes.
And that whole time you've been in the van listening to static?<eos> Yes.<eos> Waiting.<eos> Stubbornness seems to run in my family.<eos> It's in our blood.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> That dress is amazing.<eos> Oh, this dress?<eos> It's...
Before the Internet or cell phones. I mean, you could talk to anyone in the world with one of these things.<eos> I'm gonna get this thing working, and then you and Gordo...<eos> Daniel stop.<eos> The ham's in the garage because I want it in the garage.<eos> It was my father's. Gordo, you understand?
Parents Day, 1982.<eos> When you told me your old man was talking to Michael Goodson, that he'd heard about Michael's visions.<eos> That's when I knew he was getting too close.<eos> He treated you like a brother.<eos> This place... it calls to you.

I just think he's confused.<eos> He wants to make sure everything is really over.<eos> I was wondering the same thing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> This eclipse, I think it unlocked something.
You can find out who you are here.<eos> You can be who you want to be here.<eos> The power of the demon is beyond anything you can possibly imagine.<eos> Lake Stillwater is the only place that can contain it.<eos> If evil were to ever escape this place, it would bring darkness unto the world.
No, we're gonna use 'em.<eos> Frank, I want to write a will...<eos> I don't have anything solid to leave the kids.<eos> Those kids don't need an inheritance.<eos> It'll ruin 'em.
I was hired to investigate it...<eos> By the victim.<eos> Patrick Spring, the rich guy?<eos> Wait, he's the one who died at the hotel?<eos> That's right and he hired me, well above my normal rate, to investigate his own death a full six weeks before it even happened.
Is this, you know, a universe thing?<eos> Like, if I don't do this now, the universe goes all weird?<eos> The universe is already weird, Todd.<eos> If you don't tell her now, and we get... killed later...<eos> I'll go with Farah and take the machine back to the Spring Mansion, and figure out what the hell it does.
"Never ever."<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> "Like, ever."<eos> I told you guys, curiosity killed the cat.<eos> Mm. It didn't kill the cat, it just ripped off the cat's tail, which has now been reattached.
Who asked you to investigate Touvier?<eos> The prosecutor to the Court of Security.<eos> What for?<eos> I'd like to see your report.<eos> It's confidential.
More than that.<eos> He's the king of the Shadow Kin.<eos> That's not an encouraging look.<eos> It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but... You both now share April's heart.<eos> God knows, it big enough.
April?<eos> I think the world's ending.<eos> How do I know that you're not just some chameleon?<eos> Chameleon? An animal they have here.<eos> It changes its skin to match its background.
What the hell is this?<eos> It's...<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> You said you wanted Lena Luthor's take on aliens.<eos> Well, here it is.
I know her.<eos> I am her.<eos> And if we're doing this, we're doing this now.<eos> We have 6,332 agents working on just this case alone.<eos> It's the hardest case I've ever worked on and probably the hardest one I ever will.
Katie just saw it.<eos> - Katie!<eos> - Katie!<eos> The only time the show ever aired was during the murders.<eos> Now it shows back up again.
- Katie!<eos> The only time the show ever aired was during the murders.<eos> Now it shows back up again.<eos> You were released from a psych ward three days ago.<eos> It did something to my brother.

Katie, she...<eos> Where did she get a hook?<eos> She's here, but something's wrong.<eos> She won't talk.<eos> Look, I know you said that... this show, it can make people do things.
That's right!<eos> What's next?<eos> Hopefully, the Olympics one day!<eos> For now, the Nationals next summer.<eos> Only one spot per province and it's mine.
Why are you here?<eos> Are you back because of the show?<eos> Do you know who made it?<eos> Do you...<eos> Do you know how it does what it does?
Blah blah blah.<eos> You really should hear yourself.<eos> Mr. Murphy, my people are waiting for us aboard a ship with a fully equipped lab.<eos> Well that explains the broken radio.<eos> It only plays Chinese.
No.<eos> But we know someone who might be able to help.<eos> From what we understand he's the only one who can use the weapon.<eos> He is, but he won't do it.<eos> He lied to me about it even working all this time.
Come on.<eos> I wanted to catch you before you came in.<eos> This guy doesn't know the interview is about extremist groups, so don't say anything.<eos> - What's he think?<eos> - He thinks it's about Republican/Democrat relationships.
What the shit was that?<eos> !<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Where's our stuff? !<eos> It was in here!
The last time I saw you wearing it was the night I was sent away from the palace the night father died.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I threw it out.<eos> Why?<eos> It held too many terrible memories of the night of his death.
Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.<eos> It's mine.
Or she.<eos> Where?<eos> You found a dead body up in that tree?<eos> - No, down in that tree.<eos> - It's hollow.
A different kind of space.<eos> Sir, we have a priority message from San Francisco Station.<eos> Our agents believe they have located the most recent hideout of High Castle.<eos> How recent?<eos> It was a barn, torched within the last 24 hours.
I had a no-show who vanished into thin air.<eos> Well, you could've asked for postponement to have time to find her.<eos> And I would have, except for one thing:<eos> when I pressed her as to what the two of them were doing at the time of those murders, she admitted they were both on meth.<eos> Gallo's filing came back, and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.
The shit has hit the fan.<eos> Jesus.<eos> This stuff legit? You're asking me if kiddie porn is legit? !<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> That's some of the most hateful stuff I've seen in my life, and yet there it is.
We're looking to expand ourselves.<eos> This space would have been perfect.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In fact, it's so perfect, I would have made you an offer on the spot.
Then you figure out a way to make him buy it.<eos> Fine, I'll think of something, but that's not my only problem.<eos> What now?<eos> Gallo's filing came back.<eos> It needs to be filed in person and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.
What did you find? Traces of blood on one of his shoes that could be Ashley's, and then, of course, there's the ring.<eos> And you're the one who found it.<eos> Search warrant, by the book.<eos> That's right. I was just looking in his sink.<eos> Checked the drain... there it was. And we spoke to Zach, Ashley's fiancée, who confirmed that it was indeed her ring.
No, but that's what you said last time.<eos> None of us saw what happened. I mean, if you really think about it, I mean, we're all just... we're just guessing.<eos> We're just filling in the blanks and... and connecting the dots.<eos> I found Ashley's ring in his drain.<eos> How else could it have gotten there?
- Your Honor, I need a recess.<eos> I squat 225, ten reps.<eos> I mean, my body is perfect.<eos> - Ms. Miller, what are you...<eos> - It looks perfect!
- Yeah?<eos> Well...<eos> it seems like he's gone now.<eos> She.<eos> It was a girl.
Yeah, I just meant it's time to start connecting the power cells.<eos> I really need to update your cache of common vernacular.<eos> You really think the magnet's gonna be strong enough to hold him down?<eos> The neodymium core is no ordinary magnet.<eos> It enabled the Watchdogs' EMP device to knock out the power in several cities.
But can't we all, at this point, just, sort of, you know... Sort of move on, right?<eos> You're a good kid, Kevin.<eos> I appreciate your honesty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The show, it's a solid performer, but it's not the biggest thing on my network.
Being one with God.<eos> Seeing His face.<eos> I saw it once.<eos> At the moment of exorcism.<eos> I saw it, and it was so... loud.
What if a college recruiter saw this?<eos> Then what, Jack?<eos> Dad, it's ZipVid...<eos> It-it disappears unless you put it on your timeline.<eos> And even then, it's only up for 48 hours.
What?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - The missing cocoa has been found.<eos> And we have irrefutable proof that it does indeed contain poison.<eos> You might have some powder with thallium in it, but you can't prove it's mine.
Oscar Ducharme.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ducharme.<eos> Are you here to see the new items?<eos> Actually, Oscar, we're investigating a murder.<eos> And it led you to me.
Trailing clouds of me, me, me.<eos> You see what she's wearing?<eos> Not some boxy frock, that's for certain.<eos> Sketched in Milan, stitched in Bangladesh.<eos> It catches light, opens doors, and gets what it wants.
You think he wants the kidnapper to kill her?<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> Have Aaron and Beth had a rough go at it lately?<eos> Yes, they fight about this place, the money it loses.
Can you read me?<eos> Over.<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you think the message was?<eos> She said it was Doc.
Cool.<eos> It was terrifying and... awe-inspiring.<eos> It's why I became a doctor.<eos> You know?<eos> That feeling, it's like...a drug.
Aladdin. You know, like "A Whole New World" and magic carpets.<eos> Aladdin.<eos> He made it.<eos> He's okay, which means if he is, then maybe the vision doesn't matter.<eos> Maybe it's wrong.
You believe me?<eos> Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you,<eos> I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.<eos> I never realized this building was classified.<eos> Maybe that's because it's classified.
are we dead or are we alive?<eos> Are we tired or are we vigorous?<eos> Are we healthy or are we sick?<eos> Are we good or are we bad?<eos> Do we still have time or has it run out?
I have to go check the drains.<eos> Oh, if you find my love life down there, bring it back to me.<eos> Han, the hurricane ain't coming, man.<eos> My body always knows when a disaster is on its way.<eos> It predicted the '97 El Niño and my third wife, Diane.
Yeah, parts of it have chased me around the kitchen.<eos> I love how you're funny.<eos> The storm is gone.<eos> My body got it right.<eos> Now, if it could only pump blood on its own.
But why bury the budget for internment camps in a farming bill?<eos> It's the heat.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> The air-conditioning in the Russell Building is on a timer.<eos> It shuts off at exactly 10:30 p.m.
Just get Quick Pick.<eos> Darling, it's really stuck.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's why God gave us soap.<eos> That is really in there, isn't it?
- What? N-no, I just missed.<eos> Yeah, right, a blind man could've made that shot, with no arms, not facing the basket.<eos> Okay, you were sweating all over the place, and I thought you were having another heart attack, and...<eos> My heart is fine.<eos> No, no, it's broken.
- You're the historian.<eos> - Yeah, believe it or not,<eos> I have not memorized every single letter ever written in the history of time, and this letter, if I don't get every single word exactly right...<eos> It's just a letter.<eos> It's not just a letter. It's the letter that created Texas.
Thank you for your support.<eos> It really means a lot to me.<eos> - Is everything okay, Santiago?<eos> - No, I lost my ring.<eos> - Did you see where it went?
- Is everything okay, Santiago?<eos> - No, I lost my ring.<eos> - Did you see where it went?<eos> - Actually...<eos> It's behind one of these three doors.
Just like you are right now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, that's what's happening.<eos> You can't be mad at your past...<eos> it makes you who you are.
That's all I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know the Summer Palace.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's yours. It belongs to you and Agnes, of course.
I've prosecuted her five times in the past two years.<eos> I think I would've known if she wasn't a legal citizen.<eos> Have you seen her birth certificate?<eos> I must've, at some point.<eos> Would it be in your files?
I mean, Pat's gonna be fine, right?<eos> I definitely heard bones breaking.<eos> I'm night blind, so I've run over a lot of animals.<eos> Possums, coons, squirrels, dogs and cats, of course, and one animal...<eos> I never knew what it was, but it yelled "Stop!"
Sir, the bloodstains on Rohan's jeans, they are consistent with him kneeling down.<eos> There is no other blood splatter.<eos> He has a strong alibi for the time of death.<eos> I know you don't think Rohan had anything to do with this, Lustigman, but everything points to it.<eos> ok, sir, but this past murder at Cardinal Park, it bothers me.
Then how come I have no idea who you are?<eos> We put off moving here because my husband was in the hospital.<eos> If the place isn't for rent,<eos> - should we...?<eos> - No, it is for rent.
What happened to your mom?<eos> That's what I got to find out, but she's watching us, so you got to come up with a reason for us to leave.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Do you like this dress?<eos> I think it's kind of plain.
Moments ago, LHL learned that Trinity has awakened from his coma.<eos> He will remain under observation, but his doctors are cautiously optimistic.<eos> Yesterday, we aired a disturbing video that showed Trinity sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.<eos> On behalf of myself and Julia George, the show's executive producer, I'd like to offer our viewers an apology.<eos> Because while that video was shocking, it didn't tell the whole story.
Great.<eos> Are we gonna open with the video Levi sent you?<eos> No.<eos> But that video's part of the story.<eos> Julia, I watched it. It's captivating.
These kids... are doing stuff in a basement that ten years ago you could only do at a major university or hospital lab.<eos> You should go.<eos> It'll make you feel better.<eos> Make me feel better?<eos> Nat, when we find the cure for cancer, it might just come out of a lab like that one.
He took a slice of apple and implanted it with HeLa cells.<eos> The cellulose in the apple is kinda like scaffolding for the cells to grow on.<eos> Wow.<eos> That really looks like an ear.<eos> Well, it's not.
Me? No.<eos> I, um... I'm just, um...<eos> Oh, I forgot, I got wine.<eos> You don't drink.<eos> It is for you.
Who knew they were being followed?<eos> In our line of work, you must always assume someone is watching.<eos> Even when you're the watcher.<eos> Surveillance is the foundation of intelligence gathering.<eos> It requires patience, focus, and awareness.
Oh, good.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> How'd I do?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It is... perfect.
I said, "No, Daddy, it's time for this Daddy's little girl to grow up."<eos> Is it, though?<eos> Whoa!<eos> What a pit. [Chuckles]<eos> My place doesn't have a roof, and it looks better than this.
My place doesn't have a roof, and it looks better than this.<eos> Then why don't you go there?<eos> What do you want, Axl?<eos> My tummy is rumbling'.<eos> I'm in between classes, so where is it?
Uh, Kenny and I were just doing a little safety check<eos> - on the 'Bago. - Safety check?<eos> Weren't you the guy who said, "Brakes are for sissies"?<eos> Yeah, well, I just noticed this thing has really been acting up.<eos> Like yesterday, it rudely drove itself to Orson again without telling anybody.
What do you think was in that injector?<eos> My free will.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That medicine wasn't meant for you.<eos> It's messing with your mind.
But then someone in MI6 noticed that the detail the source was describing was identical to scenes in the 1996 movie The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.<eos> Really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.<eos> Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.<eos> What exactly does this stuff do?<eos> If the rocket renders it aerosol, it could take out the entire city of people. How?
Before we sign off, I want to send good wishes to Mets pitcher Matt Harvey, out for the season with a bad shoulder.<eos> Been there, buddy... it's painful.<eos> Oscar, you sprained yours buttering a pancake.<eos> That butter was right out of the fridge.<eos> It was like a brick!
Well, my brother was dead, too.<eos> He was up in space.<eos> Not Tokyo, but friggin' outer space.<eos> And then somehow, my dead brother managed to make it to Earth and find me in Malibu, alive.<eos> Now, if a miracle could happen for me, why can't it happen for you?
Why would it?<eos> 'Cause everybody says that it does.<eos> People who say that don't understand.<eos> Time is cruel.<eos> It punishes.
Is your daughter in either of those fields?<eos> No, she is not.<eos> My information is the test...<eos> I made a deal with Dana not to air it.<eos> It's already loaded.
Maybe this new tree will have food and no resident owner.<eos> Everything in the jungle has to compete for space.<eos> Only 2% of the sun's rays reach the ground so even the plants must battle for the light they need if they're to grow.<eos> 300 years ago, this Hura tree began its race for light.<eos> And every day since, it has absorbed the water and sunshine it needed to grow into a giant.

I finished packing for you.<eos> You're going home.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I wrote you a cover.<eos> It's a good one, too.
The investigation is stalling out because the community has stopped cooperating.<eos> They're buying into when Potter says we can't be trusted.<eos> Which is why we have to get him back on our side publicly.<eos> And immediately.<eos> The longer we let this case go on, the more it's gonna cost us in the long run.
Initiating a kiss is a tough nut to crack.<eos> It is not a Mummy kiss, which is so easy.<eos> You run a weird meeting, dear.<eos> JJ's date is going to be like Disneyland.<eos> It will appear effortless, but behind the scenes it will be preparation, work, and precision.
Nessie entrusted me with her egg.<eos> And now we are entrusting Ezekiel.<eos> Nessie?<eos> So you're telling me that this is the egg of the Loch Ness Monster?<eos> Yes, it is.
Tonight, we're going to...<eos> Have sex.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I'm in the ring... there are times when my body moves without me telling it to.<eos> It moves without me thinking, "I should do this, I shouldn't do that."

You can still stop the war from happening.<eos> How?<eos> By coming home.<eos> Your presence will calm everything.<eos> It will forestall more unnecessary bloodshed.
You were too good a dancer to be a straight boy.<eos> I love you, Mama.<eos> Why do you like watching this silly movie every year?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I like what it believes in.
That's okay.<eos> Nobody's perfect.<eos> I was just thinking about it.<eos> If he really wanted to make some money quick... a poltergeist abduction isn't a bad idea.<eos> Even if it turned out to be a fake.
What happened to you?<eos> Portugal, 2003.<eos> There was a monastery in the forest of Bussaco... with a particularly nasty entity.<eos> And you got rid of it?<eos> Not before it took a piece of my leg with it.
There was a time I knew everything in the sky.<eos> Every satellite... every constellation... souvenirs of space walks and astronauts... and rockets launched by NASA in the '60s.<eos> As a kid, I looked up and felt the future.<eos> It belonged to me.
Hello, John.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> I read your letter.<eos> Several times.<eos> It's different than the others.
He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.<eos> At the end of the war, Skynet was trying to develop a new type of infiltration unit by infecting human subjects with machine-phase matter.<eos> It restructures and rebuilds human tissue on a cellular level for maximum combat utility.
If that thing's still active, so is he.<eos> We can't beat him.<eos> He's stronger than any of us.<eos> Yeah, he is. But he's not stronger than all of us.<eos> Look, this place gave him his powers. But it gave us all of ours too.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.<eos> Kaulder, I came to help.<eos> Chloe.<eos> I told you not to...<eos> Immortality was never yours. it was mine.
This was my mother's.<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you but your mother's taste was questionable.<eos> This thing is so old-fashioned it's practically falling to pieces.<eos> The shoulder's frayed.<eos> - It's falling to bits.
As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.<eos> You breathe.<eos> Keep breathing.<eos> When there is a storm...<eos> And you stand in front of a tree... If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall.
We all saw the shape Glass was in, it was no more to be done, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all saw it.<eos> When there is a storm ...<eos> And you stand in front of a tree ... If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall ...
I can't believe you just cursed at piers Morgan.<eos> I can't believe he just said he might get an Oscar nom.<eos> I'm just staying there till my roof gets reshingled.<eos> So I got the pizza boy, the brother Fredo, and a turtle.<eos> Yet, somehow, this sort of weird collection of people, it worked.
To me, this is just another check.<eos> It won't fail.<eos> I have to go to Dubai tonight on, uh, more pressing' business.<eos> I want you to take Travis here to la-la land with you and show him the goddamn movie.<eos> It's not ready.
Well, what do you mean he won't release any more money?<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm dealing with it.<eos> I thought you said his opinion didn't matter.<eos> It doesn't, and I'm dealing with it.
If I, um... If I became, you know, rich beyond the dreams of avarice, you know, whether it would affect my song writing, you know, detrimentally.<eos> And I thought...<eos> I said I thought it would.<eos> Anyway, John, for some reason, took an exception to this and wrote a letter in.<eos> It was a very friendly letter.
Yeah.<eos> There should be statues of that man.<eos> His name should be on the lips of schoolchildren.<eos> The rainbow flag Apple with a bite taken out.<eos> That's where it came from?
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?" "You'll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long."<eos> "And may I add I love your dress? It's adorable."<eos> "This old thing?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I love the way it twirls."
Bring those back!<eos> They're in the dump.<eos> Nothing comes back from the dump. Yeah.<eos> Look, lady, this is our job, okay?<eos> When Riley doesn't care about a memory, it fades.
How about we wake her up?<eos> - Great idea, Joy. - Thanks.<eos> Come on!<eos> this place is huge!<eos> Yeah, it looks so much smaller than I expected.
Joby, swing!<eos> What do we say we get you home now?<eos> I think that's a really good idea.<eos> Now, the Sendai quake in Japan, was considered to be one of the five strongest since 1900.<eos> It was so powerful, in fact that it moved the main island of Japan eight feet.
You stole my dream!<eos> I was going to conquer England someday!<eos> There was gonna be a coronation, and I was going to be made Queen.<eos> Every moment was planned.<eos> I'd wear a dress so sparkly, it glowed!
Bye,Fabflce!<eos> I liked him.<eos> He was fun.<eos> So, what do you think of the dress?<eos> Oh, it's so beautiful.
So, how'd you find the place?<eos> I saw the sign on the front lawn.<eos> I figured as much, smartass.<eos> How'd you really find the place?<eos> I guess it kinda found me.
I saw the sign on the front lawn.<eos> I figured as much, smartass.<eos> How'd you really find the place?<eos> I guess it kinda found me.<eos> It tends to draw people in.
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I didn't say it would.<eos> Wine is supposed to mature with age... but I think 450 years may make it bitter.<eos> What?<eos> It's British.
Hey, will, I'm Ben.<eos> Remember me?<eos> We drove a thriving business into the ground together.<eos> Never thrived.<eos> It was thriving like a motherfucker for three months, and you know it.
It's kind of weird because it's the only country in South America where they sing in Portuguese. It's an anomaly, right?<eos> I learned that word in your book.<eos> I like that word.<eos> Anomaly.<eos> I like the way it sounds and I like what it means.
Tonight, we're going to...<eos> Have sex.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I'm in the ring... there are times when my body moves without me telling it to.<eos> It moves without me thinking, "I should do this, I shouldn't do that."

No.<eos> But it will be soon.<eos> Oh, I hadn't seen them.<eos> They're dying.<eos> They take their heat from the sun and when it deserts them, they die.
!<eos> What the- sooner or later someone is gonna come looking for us, right?<eos> If we leave the house here, someone can move in, but if we burn it down, it'll look like we died in the fire.<eos> Look at this place!<eos> It's toxic, it's rotting.
I kind of knew that tips from my dad's diner weren't really going to cut it.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I love art. I love... everything about it.<eos> I love studying it.<eos> I love the culture that it brings and the whole human experience... just all wrapped up into one, you know.
Baskhim, can you hear me?<eos> Baskhim!<eos> Illegal possession of weapons is a threat.<eos> Illegal possession of weapons is a threat.<eos> And as such it is a source of future conflict.
Look out below!<eos> Reggie Blood coming through!<eos> Come on down, boys!<eos> I don't know why you want this mirror.<eos> It's filthy.
You know there was a housekeeper on her way back when the bomb went off?<eos> She forgot her gloves.<eos> If she was two minutes later - what would that have done for your cause?<eos> Violence doesnt discern.<eos> It takes the innocent and the guilty.
Why?<eos> - Have you ever touched that creature?<eos> No!<eos> Do you see?<eos> You can't really know if it exists or not.
I have never been bit.<eos> Well, people work with bees all the time, don't they?<eos> What is royal jelly?<eos> It's a special secretion of the worker bees.<eos> - And it's royal because?

There used to be a lid on it, it was the heaviest thing in Room.<eos> When he came in I smashed it on his head.<eos> But I messed up.<eos> He shoved the door closed and he grabbed me by the wrist.<eos> That's why it's sore now.
All sit at different tables, betting low, playing hand after hand, counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck.<eos> Ignore all distractions.<eos> When the count is high, you have a "hot deck," and the odds are in your favor.<eos> Then you use a secret signal to call in "the Closer."<eos> The Closer bets big, wins bigger, and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally acceptable screw job.
Good!<eos> The witness is excused.<eos> You believe this committee has the right to compel testimony. You are dismissed, sir!<eos> To indict opinion, to criminalize thought... Guard, take him out! ...but that right does not exist, sir!<eos> Order! And the moment it does, God help us all! This is typical communist tactic!
Step up.<eos> Into the pigpen.<eos> occasionally releasing hounds.<eos> My crowning achievement? Getting rid of that glee club.<eos> Making sure that every last one of those sitter-diddled transvestites were forcibly transferred to other schools and converting this place into the beehive of learning it is today.
Nobody knew for about another week.<eos> But she knew.<eos> The whole time, she knew.<eos> It was late one night in the lab. And I happened to notice a paper clip on the floor inside the air lock portion of Judith's enclosure.<eos> Now, that environment was meticulously kept. It was nearly sterile. So there was no explaining how it got there.
Most people want to leave when they first get here, just like you.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> It let me be someone new, you know, forget my past.<eos> Problem is, you can't forget forever.<eos> It'll catch up to you.
And they would pioneer the way into the hidden corners of the Internet. Maybe the big turning point for the cypherpunks,<eos> I think, was WikiLeaks and Julian Assange and Jacob Appelbaum's idea of what it means to be a cypherpunk.<eos> You cannot trust a government to implement the policies that it says that it's implementing.<eos> And so we must provide the underlying tools, secret cryptographic codes that the government couldn't spy on to everyone as a sort of use of force.<eos> And a government no matter how hard it tries, if the cyphers are good, cannot break into your communications directly. Force of authority is derived from violence.
It was a sophisticated electronic smokescreen and it took federal agents almost two years.<eos> They were able to infiltrate the site, but they made some of these purchases themselves using undercover identities.<eos> The secretive Dread Pirate Roberts was arrested in the most unlikely of places... this local public library in this San Francisco neighborhood.<eos> The FBI seized $3.6 million of Bitcoin's biggest haul in its five-year history.<eos> When the criminal complaint first appeared in October, it describes this 29-year-old kid named Ross Ulbricht.
And if it's not a crime, why is it there...<eos> Because it's prejudicial to a jury to have that sitting there unproven just... just smearing him.<eos> The portrayal they want is of someone who they could present to a jury of not having redeeming value.<eos> It's a way of poisoning the atmosphere so that the jury doesn't focus on the allegations, but focuses on this atmospheric that the government has created that in some sense is a diversion appealing to the emotional aspect of it<eos> so that if the proof is weak, the benefit of the doubt doesn't go to the defendant, where it belongs, under the presumption of innocence, but it goes to the government because there are these awful things lurking out there
We're not here for you!<eos> We're here for them.<eos> You stay down! Think about your families.<eos> - Is the glass rated for assault rifles?<eos> - It'll hold.
It's where we end.<eos> Most of us.<eos> Would you like some chocolate?<eos> Childhood ain't so jolly.<eos> In fact, it's rather frightening.
Well, kid.<eos> Looks like the old gang's back together.<eos> Let's get this ship in the air.<eos> Let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm not the chosen one, and the prophecy wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.
But there's one part I consider private that not everyone does...<eos> The heart.<eos> It's a vulnerable organ.<eos> It breaks easily.<eos> Some people are lucky enough to know what it feels like when it's full.
The heart.<eos> It's a vulnerable organ.<eos> It breaks easily.<eos> And some people are fortunate enough to know what it feels like when it's...<eos> When it's full.
You vomited on me.<eos> I don't recall that.<eos> How are we only now finding out people think this is racist?<eos> Research has had this title for six months.<eos> I still think it's clever.
You'll see me on a game show in the next couple of years, I swear to God.<eos> To have written the book about how seductive image is, how easy it is to get seduced off of any meaningful path because of the way our culture is now.<eos> What if I become a parody of that very thing?<eos> You know, tomorrow you drive away, and you get on a plane, and this whole thing is over.<eos> I go back to knowing, like, 20 people. I'm gonna have to decompress from all this attention, because it's like getting heroin injected into your cortex.
Not everyone appreciates what I've tried to do.<eos> Does Mari?<eos> Not always.<eos> But this place...<eos> It's in her blood.
Ok, so I've been doing a little recon, and after seeing what the other teams are doing,<eos> I think we should cut that last solo and put in that double time section we've been working on.<eos> Wait... you're cutting my solo?<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - I'm sorry, but it's the weakest one.
Come on. Scooch over.<eos> Now will you tell me what you're doing under here?<eos> I saw a monster last night.<eos> Out the window.<eos> What did it look like?
Nobody knows where the building came from.<eos> But the building is always the same.<eos> Every single universe.<eos> Everywhere on every Earth, the building is always the same.<eos> But it didn't just appear out of thin air.
A window, okay.<eos> So, were you in a car, or...?<eos> No, I was, uh...<eos> I was standing.<eos> And the window, it was smaller.
- No.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> This necklace belonged to Rachel.<eos> Yeah, she gave it to me for my birthday.<eos> My dad and I got in a fight because he thought it was from Kyle.
I cannot believe we got that done so early.<eos> [laughs] It's not early.<eos> You leave tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, but I don't usually, like, pack.<eos> I usually leave my crap in a pile and just hope it somehow makes it to where I'm going.
How?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> Until it gets light again.<eos> What did you think of the poem, Alma?<eos> It was heavy.
Hi!<eos> Welcome.<eos> There is a place that you get to that's beyond all of that,<eos> You move through to a place of peace and acceptance.<eos> And it's not just for you, but for the person that you lost, too.
L-look, I'm sorry, okay, but she's got to come out sometime.<eos> So, what, it's up to you to decide when?<eos> You know, Perez stopped doing that recently.<eos> Rach, our show's like a mirror, okay?<eos> It helps people face the truth.
- Mary killed herself.<eos> - It is our responsibility.<eos> - Okay, you want to turn this into a homicide?<eos> This show has zero chance of coming back.<eos> - It dies along with Mary.
I just love coffee.<eos> Live off it.<eos> You must really like this place.<eos> Yeah, sure, it's...<eos> It's great, I guess.
Dozens dead or dying.<eos> Many more suffering, weakened.<eos> Only a handful of men defending it, most barely even able to stand.<eos> The Urca gold is on that beach exactly where we left it.<eos> And owing to a most fortuitous act of God, it is almost entirely undefended.
A launch landed on the beach a short while ago.<eos> They told Flint the gold was gone.<eos> What did they tell you?<eos> The Urca gold is on that beach.<eos> It is almost entirely undefended.
But what they will never be, under any circumstances, is partners in a plan to reconcile with England.<eos> From where I sit, I think it is clear that we must act to prevent--<eos> We?<eos> I'm fairly certain that you aren't suggesting that we do anything.<eos> The only way to truly ensure that the Urca gold doesn't return here is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge of where it is and how to retrieve it.
My challenge would be to find peace, reawaken my chi and atone for my sins.<eos> Maybe this Golden Nectar at the Wuyi mountain could help build me a new future.<eos> Lord knows I need it.<eos> But even though you may try to leave your past behind, in the end,<eos> it always finds you.
There's...<eos> There's something over there.<eos> I don't see anyone.<eos> At the... At the base of the tree.<eos> It's smiling at me.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> That boat, where is it going?
A kiosk.<eos> A football field.<eos> A backyard.<eos> Small spaces that contain an entire childhood.<eos> And though time is endless for a child, for a mother, it passes far too quickly.
Over 30 years later I see my image, captured by him for a few seconds.<eos> A precious moment that reminds me of who I am and where I come from.<eos> Now I'm an adult and a mother.<eos> I have my own film camera.<eos> I document our time, but it will soon pass as well.
In labour, you say?<eos> Hello?<eos> ~ A woman in labour at Bulthorpe?<eos> ~ You're familiar with it?<eos> ~ I thought it had closed down.
Tell her to pop into clinic next Tuesday.<eos> It's probably all nerves.<eos> I'm sure Doctor will be able to reassure her.<eos> I love it when you don't wear a hat or a scarf and the sun gets the chance to shine down on your hair.<eos> Shame it don't get a chance to shine down on mine, eh?
Jesus came back from the dead and did miracles.<eos> So is Jesus a ghost?<eos> I'd like to see a ghost.<eos> You can put your hand through them, they feel like a cloud.<eos> I've never touched a cloud but I bet it feels like candyfloss.
I like your look.<eos> You're hot but not whorey.<eos> Uh, thanks.<eos> So what does this app do?<eos> It geolocates affiliated liquor brands so you can buy drinks using your Buzz Points.
I just lost my negotiating partner. And, I need somebody to talk. You seem like a reasonable young man.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> It is all right! It is all right! I just...<eos> I just need you to give a message to your boss.<eos> It has to be very, very, very clear.
What was the name of the medicine?<eos> Um, I want to say it's called...<eos> Crouch Cream.<eos> But that's not right.<eos> It's a white tube with a red label.
And yet, it is you who has taught me that it is possible to respect two cultures, and to live in amity between them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please tell Earl Ingstad how much I admire her and that she is always, always welcome at my hearth.<eos> She says she likes the necklace.<eos> It is so beautiful, that it must have been made by dwarves.
The only way to truly ensure that the Urca gold doesn't return here is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge of where it is and how to retrieve it.
Well, I wish we had better news.<eos> There's definitely evidence of severe arterial blockage.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm recommending we perform a bypass.<eos> It'll increase the flow of blood to his heart.
~ Boom!<eos> ~ Good.<eos> And the murder weapon?<eos> Looks old.<eos> Ah, I think it came from here, Chief.
Well, I...<eos> I was once left alone in a room in the convent.<eos> They didn't leave novices alone normally.<eos> And there was a piano there.<eos> I tried it, and it was open.
I was once left alone in a room in the convent.<eos> They didn't leave novices alone normally.<eos> And there was a piano there.<eos> I tried it, and it was open.<eos> It needed tuning.
And there was a piano there.<eos> I tried it, and it was open.<eos> It needed tuning.<eos> Some of the notes were dead.<eos> But it sounded more beautiful to me than any of the pianos I'd ever played.
I'd be happy to give it back to you.<eos> You just have to give me something in return:<eos> Immortality.<eos> When'll the stew be ready?<eos> It'll be ready when it's ready.
The primary impediment to a free and uninhibited future is the violence and terror that currently grips our beloved country.<eos> A violence initiated by these evil men... will be brought to justice... in the name of decency... and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.<eos> We will extradite.<eos> This decision... will not come from fear.<eos> It has come from a clarity of judgment... free from the cloud of terror that surrounds us and obscures our view.
♪ Hangin' out the Passenger side... ♪ But the thing about a rating is you don't know the quality of the person who's giving the rating, right?<eos> I mean, like, for instance, some dum-dum goes into a Morton's Steakhouse.<eos> She orders a steak well-done and then complains when the damn thing comes out and it's too dry.<eos> Well, it's like, "Hey, dum-dum, you ordered the damn thing well-done.<eos> That's why it's dry, you stupid idiot."
Maybe you should.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Can't abandon Charlie's...<eos> He knew this place was fierce, merciless.<eos> It's... vivid... and unsullied... and wild.
Sir Malcolm will be back tomorrow.<eos> I'll come back then.<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> More than that.<eos> It never leaves us.
Come meet the new man we've hired, Mr. Clare.<eos> Miss Putney.<eos> Mr. Clare.<eos> May I touch your face?<eos> It is not a face for touching.
And honestly... those aren't very sensible shoes.<eos> But I'm frightened.<eos> What horrors might it contain?<eos> Behold the evil wonders of Lucifer. Unleashing his dark powers onto the world.<eos> I don't admit to my real name, it's beneath contempt.
But with you, I've found a kind of elation.<eos> To feel the old touch of passion.<eos> To yearn.<eos> To be truly human.<eos> My humanity, such as it is, is colder than this house.
And set a monster to catch a monster?<eos> Very like.<eos> My less monstrous colleagues will be on duty night and day, you can be assured.<eos> You will not take one step from this house when you will not be observed.<eos> Your peace of mind, such as it is, will cease to exist and a length of hemp will seem a cheap price to be free of the burden.
Who brought me mail today?<eos> Well, Johnny, you got over 500 letters from kids who love you, asking for you and April to stay.<eos> Aw, babe, did you hear that?<eos> Now, Johnny, you also got one very special letter.<eos> It's from me.
Tell them about it.<eos> As you know, the cameras on your phones are always on, whether you're using them or not.<eos> I'm sorry, they are?<eos> This app uses facial recognition software to track your expressions.<eos> It's always watching.
"Woof, woof."<eos> Bark.<eos> Why here?<eos> Because this tree reminds me of you.<eos> It's strong and quiet and always here when you need it... or whatever.
Things are getting testy out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> We better move this along.<eos> Vincent's boundary is too strong, but what Davina and I can do is cast a disruption spell.<eos> It would temporarily neutralize all magical objects in this compound, including the compound itself.
Nice kicks.<eos> Welcome home gift?<eos> Uh, actually inside is a tracking device.<eos> It works like your phones GPS system.<eos> It transports a signal to a satellite and bounces back to us.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You know that this isn't her.<eos> She's just back here after having been out.<eos> - You want a shot, too, Chapman?<eos> - Will it keep her out of SHU?
I'm so sorry.<eos> You know, I am really bad with names.<eos> Nat?<eos> Can I get your advice about the floor runner?<eos> It's looking a little "kuntry" with a "k" to me.
She snuck us things when she could.<eos> I like to crochet, so she'd bring me yarn.<eos> Was Jackie ever there during the times that Mr. Groves visited you at night?<eos> No, but she would visit us before, give us milk.<eos> She said it would help put us to sleep so we wouldn't have to... know what he was doing.
Of course I do.<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.<eos> Any idea why we found it in the woods?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Of course I don't know how it got there.
- Are we even sure somebody would go to these lengths to win a science fair?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes!<eos> These kids live for this competition.<eos> I mean, it can define your whole future.
Allegedly.<eos> Even brutal.<eos> An expertise in the craft that I have not seen in a very long time.<eos> And this is what's hurting these kids.<eos> I mean, you wish that you defeat your opponent, even subconsciously, the spell is so powerful, it amplifies that wish and makes it so.
And the hope is this will actually make money?<eos> We didn't... we didn't do it to make money, Mom.<eos> We just did it so we could work on something together.<eos> Something that was ours.<eos> Yeah, but we do own the app, so if it sells, this could be a tidy payday.
A story can do two things.<eos> Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.<eos> You work in pharmaceuticals-- don't you have anything you can give him?<eos> All I have is our new urine flow drug.<eos> Won't help with his anxiety, but it's so strong, when he pees he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.

Oh, no, it will.<eos> See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.<eos> Howard's right-- that'll never work.<eos> Stop fighting me on the premise.<eos> It's scientifically valid.
Howard, what do you think?<eos> Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution.<eos> I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.<eos> Well said, old chap.<eos> I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us.
Don't move!<eos> Code A-A-23, A-A-23.<eos> Copy.<eos> I can see the ranch, Leonard!<eos> Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely.

On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...<eos> - Where are you taking me?<eos> - Home.<eos> The Boltons have Winterfell.<eos> The marriage proposal... It wasn't for you?
So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.<eos> But the dragonglass...<eos> No one's ever getting that back now.<eos> It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
- It sounds like she dumped you.<eos> - No, I dumped her.<eos> I definitely, definitely dumped her.<eos> Can we not use that word?<eos> It's so violent, you know?
Learn to swim!<eos> Learn to swim!<eos> Now, first of all, you need to get a rent book.<eos> So, to get a rent book, you need to establish Roderick's status.<eos> And then you need to establish the status of this building, to find out whether it's a commercial property or whether it had its designation changed to residential, and if I do all of that for you... can I stay?
- Probably.<eos> Why? - Is that bad for Hindus, suicide?<eos> No, it's great.<eos> They love it.<eos> - But is it like a mortal sin?
Hey.<eos> - Can I have a shower?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Use my towel.<eos> It's on the rail.
Yeah, I have to have visitations with him every week.<eos> It's not the same as you, like, at all, but I keep thinking, like maybe, maybe now, maybe this time, I'll be out of the system for good, you know?<eos> And they just keep... pulling me back.<eos> I just wanna be in one place for a while, you know?<eos> Even if it ain't as nice as this one.
You know, if you want, I will show you my workshop later.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just realized that we don't have any wedding rings. It's okay.<eos> I have my grandma's ring, but it's at my mom's house.
That's what's good about a beer.<eos> - Yeah, it's good. - It just keeps cycling through you...
Aye.<eos> Aye, we are.<eos> What about the price on yer head?<eos> I'm expecting a pardon, with the aid of the Duke of Sandringham.<eos> It hasn't come through yet, but we're hoping it will soon.
Hey, birthday card for Henry.<eos> That is a retirement card for...<eos> Helen? Whatever, it's fine.<eos> So, I have a question for you.<eos> Um, I hope you're listening to your gut, you know, when it's telling you to maybe get to know somebody better rather than pursuing them relentlessly.
Otherwise we have to bounce you.<eos> Kirsten: I thought I had to do that.<eos> But after that, you're gonna have to make the bounce yourself.<eos> - And if I can't?<eos> - We can still do it for you, but your consciousness won't like being yanked out when it's not ready.
What, I suppose you want me to... ?<eos> Fine.<eos> Wait.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> The thing about being stitched... it made me feel things I've never felt before.
No!<eos> Stop!<eos> The Morvan is much higher than what they say.<eos> That tree...<eos> Didn't it use to be red?
Stop!<eos> The Morvan is much higher than what they say.<eos> That tree...<eos> Didn't it use to be red?<eos> - No, I thought it was blue.
They will be, until evil is regulated.<eos> Well, we all want to find the guilty one.<eos> We are ALL guilty.<eos> Evil generates more evil.<eos> It ramifies.
Well, it's, uh, good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, well, let's get started.<eos> Um, we've read your revised demand.<eos> It's, uh, quite a laundry list.
Yep, all gone.<eos> Good.<eos> I want to run something by you.<eos> The sandpiper case...<eos> It's getting too big for hhm.
I'll see you bright and early.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Here's the draft for the statement tomorrow.<eos> I want it to be perfect.
I bought you a ring.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> It's the element of surprise.<eos> That's kind of the point, isn't it?<eos> It's in my glove compartment.
Mm-hm. Then after the first year is fine and, uh... troop numbers look agreeable, are you sure you can procure this many on your end?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't need Congress for that.<eos> No, but the funding.<eos> It comes out of the DOD budget like any regular deployment.
I could screw myself if I say it, but there's pressures on me you don't have to live under, if you accept that you're older.<eos> And let the kid stuff go.<eos> I let you go, Annie.<eos> From my hands and my head.<eos> The heart, which cynics say is code for penis, wants what it wants.
But we both got kids.<eos> And I don't want to drag them through our dirty laundry.<eos> Hey, this remind you of anything?<eos> Our first date, remember?<eos> It was right here on this very spot.
You said that you were getting rid of the chair.<eos> No, you said you didn't want it in the living room.<eos> This isn't the living room.<eos> What is it with you and this chair?<eos> It's comfortable and I like it.

Is this okay?<eos> Shoshanna: So I was really inspired by working on his campaign and, you know, seeing all of the change that he's already been able to make in his neighborhood regarding the traffic lights.<eos> It reinvigorated my job search, so here I am.<eos> And I don't think that I need to overplay my résumé, you know?<eos> It's not exhaustive, but I have really stuck with the jobs that I've had and I am incredibly educated about the current corporate climate and also what marketing means in the digital age.
You do not care about my ring.<eos> - No, of course I do.<eos> - I'm such a dork!<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.<eos> - Marcos: No, it's beautiful.
The ring of the Magi.<eos> Where is the ring?<eos> I don't see a ring.<eos> The five maidens are your five fingers, and the serpent is the sacred ring.<eos> You know where it is.
You know what this means?<eos> You don't?<eos> No.<eos> Do you expect me to believe that?<eos> Where is it?
Something like that.<eos> You've got the ring of the Magi!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - Where is it?
I don't know how to tell you.<eos> ~ I've lost the ring.<eos> ~ Oh, Nancy...<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> It must have fallen off my finger.
Elizabeth: And so, under IP rights he had no authority to sell.<eos> And so, under PI rights...<eos> I.P.!<eos> Intellectual property.<eos> Excuse me, under I.P. rights, Max had no right to sell because it was never his to sell in the first place.
It's the guy I called about the estimate.<eos> Look, we don't need to deal with the foundation today, but it needs to be handled soon.<eos> Oh, um, Lilly called me about her birthday dress.<eos> I haven't gotten her anything yet, so is it okay if--<eos> - It's a little pricey, so--
We call it gasoline.<eos> You look absolutely stunning.<eos> That dress.<eos> Henry's complimented me 100 times.<eos> It's worth every penny.
And I will find happiness in other people's love.<eos> Now, who is the target of your arrow, there, Cupid?<eos> George and AnnaBeth.<eos> Oh, that is preposterous!<eos> Daddy, the heart wants what it wants.
We are not firing all of our support staff.<eos> Well, it's easy for you to say, being that your name is first.<eos> What are you talking--<eos> Jessica, I am talking about respect.<eos> R-e-s-p-e-c-t, find out what it means to me.
Damn it!<eos> General Zaman.<eos> President Navarro, good day.<eos> I saw your speech earlier.<eos> I fear it was a bit wordy and long-winded.
President Navarro, good day.<eos> I saw your speech earlier.<eos> I fear it was a bit wordy and long-winded.<eos> I'm only just now getting the hang of this.<eos> On the contrary, I thought it was quite direct and eye-opening.
It's just it's kind of hard to get through an episode of anything without your father coming by the house to make himself a sandwich.<eos> Plus, I've got a special brew on tap just for binge watching.<eos> It's called TV Night Light.<eos> Binge without the bulge.<eos> Oh, and it goes perfect with a five-hour block of Battlestar Galactica.
It's beautiful.<eos> Uh, when we couldn't decide on a movie, I realized you haven't even seen some of the best drama out there.<eos> It's in video games.<eos> I mean, the cutscene that opens The Last of Us?<eos> Oh, my God. It's heartbreaking.
Praise Jesus!<eos> But we have one more thing to be thankful for.<eos> Dear lord, thank you for Everett Backstrom.<eos> We all know that evil can cloak itself in beauty.<eos> Yes, it can.
A certainty grew in his heart; his brethren were dead, and it was up to him to kill the beast or die trying.<eos> Finish your soup, Abraham, and I'll finish my tale.<eos> When he finally encountered the creature... it was not a wolf at all.<eos> It was an ancient, hungry being.<eos> And as it gazed at the giant's body, it smiled.
It's a glorious day, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is glorious.<eos> You know, I remember there was a time when I would say, "it's a nice day.<eos> The sky is blue, but I wish it was even bluer."
He knew where to look for me.<eos> You knew where he would look for you.<eos> He said he forgave me.<eos> Forgiveness is too great and difficult for one person.<eos> It requires two:
My name is Alie.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Thelonious.<eos> It's a good name.<eos> It has a double meaning.
Or at least that's according to the very nice lady at the lima mental health clinic.<eos> So to help Rachel with this new transition, we are throwing her a "farewell to Rachel's house" party, and everyone's invited. It's going to be Friday night in Rachel's basement.<eos> You guys, this is very unnecessary but very sweet.<eos> Wait, so this lesson isn't - for us?<eos> - It's for Rachel?

What did you do to me?<eos> Hope's blood is now in you.<eos> You are now the bait.<eos> And this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
There's nothing in there.<eos> Where is the bio weapon?<eos> Don't make me ask again.<eos> Food cart.<eos> It's in the food cart.
You, him, and Oliver.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> I am Al Sah-him.<eos> This would not be the first time that Sarab has betrayed me to Maseo Yamashiro's weaknesses.<eos> And though your timing was a function of my gambit, it was nevertheless fortuitous.
Man can only evade death for so long.<eos> The waters' powers Are losing their effect on me.<eos> My time is almost over,<eos> But my legacy won't be just ash and bone,<eos> It will be history.
I have body odour.<eos> What this proves is that consciousness is fungible...<eos> What have we found out about the Spivak life form?<eos> Well, I'm still in the process of mapping.<eos> Tell me we've determined at least what genus it belongs to.
I've really enjoyed our time together, however brief, but with regret I must do what needs to be done.<eos> Good to be home.<eos> You know what I like about this place?<eos> Spacious?<eos> It's mine.
I'd guess about 50 IBUs, which is my max.<eos> Is nothing sacred?<eos> What?<eos> Don't do that!<eos> It's cold, it's refreshing, it's not... science.
I mean, it's time.<eos> You deserve your happily ever after, too.<eos> Well, skin's a little dry, but baby Froda is perfect, Wanda.<eos> This rocking chair's amazing.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?
She was getting off a ride with a friend, and we bumped right into each other.<eos> I just wanted to recreate that moment when I proposed.<eos> Who helped you design your engagement ring?<eos> No one.<eos> It was my grandmother's.
Something's up.<eos> - "Up"? That... - Mm-hmm.<eos> That is ridiculous. (laughs)<eos> Magnolia, you look great in that dress!<eos> It just goes so great with mine!
- I mean, that's gotta hurt.<eos> - Well, it doesn't exactly hurt...<eos> Anyway, this has nothing to do with Billy.<eos> I just heard that my nomination is dead in the water.<eos> It's not dead in the water.
The long guns used were AR-15s.<eos> Now, usually hard to get, but most certainly harder to customize.<eos> Check this crazy shit out.<eos> CSI snapped a photo of Maker's gun.<eos> It's a sear-cut lower receiver, makes it fully automatic.
It all depends on how he touches her.<eos> - This Madame de Stendhal was married.<eos> - De Rênal.<eos> Your first name.<eos> Where does it come from?
It's too soon to flush his quarry.<eos> He's deciding what to do.<eos> Someone's put a price on your head.<eos> As an early-warning system, a bounty is better than radar.<eos> It inclines authorities everywhere to forsake their duty and scramble after me privately.
Your liver tells me you haven't quit drinking, Your pallor tells me you aren't sleeping, And I have seen with my very own eyes<eos> That you haven't stopped smoking. When you finally fall of a heart attack or stroke Or whatever inevitable malady takes you,<eos> They will turn to me and say, "how could you find him fit to work?"<eos> Oh. So it's about you.<eos> The worst part about your world view Is that it's contagious.
And he was killed in the car within ten minutes.<eos> Now, most killers don't want to drive around for longer than 20 minutes with a dead body in their car.<eos> And he'd avoid bridges and tunnels because traffic jams and accidents prevent an easy escape.<eos> That gives us a search area of approximately two miles in any direction.<eos> If the body was dumped three days ago and we haven't found it yet, it means it's off the beaten path.
About a letter?<eos> Right.<eos> The letter.<eos> Umm.<eos> It was right here...
Oh.<eos> Umm.<eos> I think that's. Okay.<eos> My letter.<eos> Who's it from?
The Pyrippus is... me.<eos> I'm trying, I'm struggling.<eos> I've known you for what?<eos> Five years, and yes, you do have a lustrous mane of hair. But you don't have a horse face.<eos> It's more... oval?
Haley, you've said that you believe that it might be trying to reach this rock that was found near the captain's crash site.<eos> If that's true, what are we doing to secure it?<eos> We have several contingency plans in place.<eos> But I think Wes Lawrence's team has the best defensive posture.<eos> Mr. President, here's what we know about the entity... number one, it appears to only directly communicate with children.

Like Louis the Sun King.<eos> Okay, that's great.<eos> Can I borrow your office and can you leave, Your Highness?<eos> - Uh... - I need somewhere to prepare for my nursing license hearing.<eos> It's today?
I went the first year.<eos> I mean, if you want to get over something, maybe sitting around and remembering it in every detail ain't the right way.<eos> Yeah, well, the thing of it is some of that knowledge they spill makes sense.<eos> Stuff about the past, not denying it,<eos> letting it be a part of you.
Veles.<eos> Veles Taxi.<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope you like it.<eos> It's delicious.
What do I...<eos> What do I tell them?<eos> Feel my heart.<eos> Come on, feel it.<eos> What is it telling you?
It's... smoke trapped in a closed room, swirling... changing.<eos> Buffeted by the passing of years and wishful thinking.<eos> But even though our perception of it changes, one thing remains constant.<eos> The past can... never be completely erased.<eos> It lingers.
Oh, my God.<eos> That's Louie Becker.<eos> That necklace is gorgeous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was my mother's.
[Sighs] Yes.<eos> Blanca, you look beautiful in Carmen's dress.<eos> And that necklace is gorgeous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was my mother's.
And you're just telling us now?<eos> What?<eos> I was mad.<eos> She took my dress!<eos> And let's not forget, it's still out there somewhere.
Please, enjoy.<eos> All right, we got it. Thank you.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Oh, my god. I have to say, this dish is everything.<eos> I mean, it's -- it's innovative.
- Okay, well, I was the head chef, uh, and owner of Savannah's kitchen.<eos> Actually, we closed a little over a year...<eos> Let me stop you.<eos> I'm not interested in the past.<eos> It's not important.
You wrote your will on a napkin?<eos> I made copies, obviously.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know, how have I never had...<eos> How has it ever... it's always on the table.
Who was the witness?<eos> Jessica DiLaurentis.<eos> Mrs. DiLaurentis saw Spencer in the backyard and told the police?<eos> Where's the statement been for two years?<eos> Where it has been is deliberately hidden in the files of the officer who took the statement, Darren Wilden.
He identified Sammy's body.<eos> We're having a tough time getting any other information out of him.<eos> I appreciate all the hard work you must do down at the ME's office, but I still can't help you with a Vice case.<eos> - Not one that's ongoing.<eos> - It's ongoing, huh?
And the Great Red Dragon kills pets first.<eos> You put your hand on Dr. Chilton's shoulder in the photograph.<eos> Touch gives the world an emotional context.<eos> The touch of others makes us who we are.<eos> It builds trust.
Mr Taylor, please.<eos> Dr Campbell?<eos> This way, please.<eos> Waiting for inspiration, Mr Simms?<eos> Well, it has to come from somewhere!
I might.<eos> And who's that?<eos> My cousin, but she lives in Eskilstuna.<eos> You should tell your parents.<eos> It's important to notice eating disorders early on, or it might get really serious.
There are two paths. One worn and one yet to be.<eos> How you plant your next step ahead in this moment will determine the way ahead for all of us.<eos> We know how kings of the past would have moved against this problem but you are different, Sire.<eos> You are the king of our future.<eos> The only question is, what kind shall it be?
Do as you must.<eos> Baptise it thoroughly.<eos> See how life fights death.<eos> Cherish this moment.<eos> It is God given.
We can wage war or fill hearts with wonder, but we do not have means to do both.<eos> We must wage war.<eos> All those who encircle you would smile at you and would obey you, But they would prefer ruin you from a distance.<eos> You are the monarch of the future.<eos> It remains only to determine which future it will be.
My dad worked in construction, and I promised him and myself that I was never gonna work with my hands.<eos> Now your broke ass is mopping floors, slinging trash.<eos> You're right, Kenny.<eos> But one day, I am gonna be a Doc, which makes all this crap worth it.<eos> What you have to ask yourself is what makes it all worth it for you.
A tumor.<eos> My god, Kaylee has brain cancer.<eos> No, don't...<eos> Don't go down that road.<eos> The mass is probably benign, but it has grown big enough to cause some bleeding.
Getting shot kind of puts thing into...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Kind of puts things...<eos> Oh, look at his face.<eos> It's swelling.
- Knew more of you were coming.<eos> And we're leaving, - just give me the device.<eos> - Come and take it.<eos> Stop.<eos> We don't even know what it does!
No, no, no, no, I-I disagree.<eos> If I allow you to take this egg back to Chester's Mill, it's a one-way ticket.<eos> I need to know that you're doing this for the good of the company, and not for some sentimental reason.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> To unlock and harvest the power of the egg and the secrets it holds, regardless of costs.
Wouldn't you rather be looking into Barclay Spades' supposed suicide?<eos> - How did you... - Ooh.<eos> A magician never reveals her secrets.<eos> Wait, you said "supposed suicide."<eos> So you think it's fake, too?
What I've always done.<eos> What about your inheritance?<eos> This place?<eos> Not interested.<eos> Still, it is bigger than yours.
What's going on?<eos> Why hasn't my husband's surgery started?<eos> Is this because of that detective somehow?<eos> No. No, it's-it's because the... the heart is still in transit.<eos> But I thought it was already here.
No pressure.<eos> Don't worry, we'll get him.<eos> Yeah, and we got 17 hours to do so.<eos> I love the name.<eos> It's catchy, has drama.
Gross.<eos> But... one can't always trust such an animalistic method to find a suitable partner.<eos> What are you trying to tell me?<eos> Arnold Flass was released.<eos> I know that you two were dating, and if the attraction wasn't intellectual... How could it be with that gorilla? ...
I will take her to Asgard.<eos> - It will be safer for all of you.<eos> - We will do no such thing.<eos> The weapon has been activated.<eos> It needs to be eliminated before it hurts someone.
Leviathan is coming.<eos> Chief Dooley?<eos> Chief Dooley, I'd like to make a confession.<eos> I already got the confession I need.<eos> It's a fake.
I have heard much of your genius.<eos> It is a shame that you put your gifts towards creating such horrible weapons.<eos> Midnight oil was not supposed to be a weapon, Dr. Fennhoff.<eos> Should never have been used.<eos> And yet, it only exists because of you.
Or are you gonna dig deep and find out what it takes to reshuffle those cards life dealt you?<eos> Your call.<eos> Good choice, kid.<eos> No one's bought me ice cream since my dad died.<eos> What's it taste like?
That's what your war's come to?<eos> Killing children?<eos> That thing in the container was not a child.<eos> I could hear his heartbeat.<eos> It was light and fast.
Of course you're invited to my wedding.<eos> - I am?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, Grace got an invitation, but I didn't.<eos> Well, it's on its way.
That was a big moment.<eos> I'm so glad my car was there for you.<eos> That's good.<eos> I'm gonna try the chair.<eos> It's great.
Previously on 12 Monkeys... - The core is dead. - It can't be repaired.<eos> There's only one place we can find one.<eos> If I go now, I'll be there by morning.<eos> If we hit resistance, it'll come from Foster's head of security... my father.
With your help, a vaccine could be a year away.<eos> We need the core for our servers.<eos> That algorithm is the lifeblood of our species.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> There is only one true cure, and it's within my reach.
It seems the venom deformed the baby.<eos> Better for you not to see that.<eos> It's my fault, I tried to abort...<eos> We'll plant this tree on the grave.<eos> It will grow, become tall and strong thanks to the baby's breath.
West 7.<eos> That didn't take long.<eos> Max lied.<eos> She's still with them.<eos> If Deacon's on to this place, it's a mother lode.
And the vault is like its own little Fort Knox per Dr. Toussaint's specs.<eos> And obviously you're the only one here who can open it.<eos> So if someone comes looking for daddy's little secret, they have to get though that?<eos> And that, and that?<eos> It's secure.
You're having memories from two different realities.<eos> The human brain is not made for such things.<eos> If you can't correct the past, this condition is certainly going to kill you.<eos> - Does the machine still work?<eos> - It brought you back here.
It changes everything in my time.<eos> Right now she's the only thing that matters.<eos> L've been traveling back and forth between 2043 and now.<eos> Every time, the future's the same.<eos> This time, it changed.
James...<eos> You're dying.<eos> You're breaking the unwritten rules of the universe.<eos> But time, it's going to take what it's owed.<eos> Eventually, it will kill you.
To you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wind up a better me in a better place, I hope.<eos> And what is that, that place?<eos> What does it look like to you?
I won't let my job... [coughs] Or how bad my mouth is burning right now come between us.<eos> My spice champion of Central City.<eos> (Gideon) A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.<eos> I couldn't agree more, Gideon.<eos> But it will do the job.
- No. I haven't been in this house since that night.<eos> Bar?<eos> This mirror--you remember it?<eos> Yeah. It belonged to my grandma.<eos> How is it still here?
Bar?<eos> This mirror--you remember it?<eos> Yeah. It belonged to my grandma.<eos> How is it still here?<eos> Just be glad it is.
Yeah, that definitely happened.<eos> But this time, I'm ready for him.<eos> I originally designed the force field to keep a speedster from getting out.<eos> But I've reversed it.<eos> Now it won't let one in.
Now in the chair.<eos> That chair.<eos> Bro, what the hell?<eos> I'm making a statement.<eos> Yeah. Does it say, "Come arrest me"?
If this was Thomas' room, it's all gone now.<eos> What's this?<eos> What?<eos> There's a mirror.<eos> It was right here.
Grows like a weed almost anywhere.<eos> So, not particularly helpful.<eos> No.<eos> But... the trace that you pulled from the rope-- that's a different story.<eos> You were also right-- it's organic.
He's financing films of an erotic nature.<eos> Ends up making loans to some of 'em, too.<eos> Yeah, I'm not really catching an alibi in any of this garbage, are you, partner?<eos> No, just a bunch of words like, "films of an erotic nature."<eos> I suggest you come up with an alibi real quick, and make it a good one.
That's Riley's seat.<eos> Forever.<eos> Hey, Emma, again,<eos> I am just so exponentially sorry about that video.<eos> I had no idea that it was gonna just mutate and spread like this crazy zombie sex virus.
She didn't mention seeing you that night.<eos> Well, she was covering for me.<eos> And why would she do that?<eos> Nina and I both made that video.<eos> I didn't do the release, but the night that it went viral, I went to Audrey to confess.
- The device won't let me.<eos> - OK, override it!<eos> I cannot.<eos> Storm impact in 30 seconds.<eos> What if it just stopped?
Asag is a Sumerian rock demon, okay?<eos> Legend has it he was so ugly, he couldn't find a wife, so he mated with mountains, begat baby rock demons.<eos> This is how he keeps track of his baby demon pebbles.<eos> Hence, demon tracking device.<eos> How does it work?
- Where's Emma?<eos> - Mademoiselle is in the kitchen.<eos> Emma, everybody's calling me.<eos> What's got into you, honey? Drop that case.<eos> It's not for you.
No, I mean real shame, Wendy.<eos> You know, when you've done something...<eos> You've hurt, disgusted someone so completely... that you can see it in their eyes.<eos> The black, oozing shit inside you.<eos> You sweat it through your skin but it keeps spreading... until you would do anything... not to feel it.
I'm, uh... checking something on the department intranet.<eos> Jacoby...<eos> Jacoby...<eos> I knew I recognized that name.<eos> It keeps coming up in our briefings.
None of the doctors had any idea what it was.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not sure yet.<eos> But Jacoby's autopsy is scheduled for the morning.<eos> If it reveals what I think it might, we'll know exactly what's going on here.
Yeah, it was weird.<eos> I don't know... he seems like such a nice guy.<eos> Maybe he's just frustrated over watching the farm fail.<eos> Joshua must have had a vision of this place for a reason, right?<eos> I mean, it's about to be taken over by the same brothers we're looking at as Horsemen.
Okay, one more.<eos> Ready?<eos> And then boom.<eos> Look, I don't want to freak out right now, but that bitch, she won't keep her dress on.<eos> It's a Vera Wag.
Hold on.<eos> I helped you out.<eos> You owe me, right?<eos> I owe you nothing.<eos> "My true name will come out in due course, "and it is a name that no one will ever forget.
It was there that I fell in love with a fuel pump.<eos> This part of my life continued to develop, and it was much more satisfying than the rock.<eos> In one of the tropical moon caves, I found an abandoned nest of eggs.<eos> It's purple!<eos> You open the lids like that and it comes off.
~ I think that letter really belongs to me.<eos> ~ No.<eos> When I'm sure of the reasons for your wife's suicide, then I'll return this letter to Dr Plant.<eos> It's addressed to him.<eos> Until then, it's evidence in an unexplained death and belongs to the coroner.
You went because she told you about the Inler letter.<eos> You told Miss Zweig and Miss Zweig told you to go and get it at all costs!<eos> This has absolutely...<eos> If you don't like it, you don't have to be here.<eos> Where is it... where is it?
Gina.<eos> We're close.<eos> Ryan, a video just came through.<eos> You need to see it.<eos> It's--it's streaming on the Internet.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<eos> Still no I.D. of the victim?<eos> Garcia's running her markers through ViCAP.<eos> This unsub went through a lot of trouble wrapping and weighing the body down.<eos> Usually it's postmortem gas production that brings a body to the surface, but if you freeze it, it'll rise to the top like ice cubes in a drink.
Mom, I know we all got past dad's one big lie, but do you think that there's any chance he was hiding other things?<eos> Honey, I wonder about that all the time.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The only person who really knew your dad was George.<eos> You know, maybe the real reason I held onto my dress all those years wasn't because I actually thought it was stunning.
Honey, I wonder about that all the time.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The only person who really knew your dad was George.<eos> You know, maybe the real reason I held onto my dress all those years wasn't because I actually thought it was stunning.<eos> I think... It might've just been that I really liked the memory of the day and what it symbolized, more so than the actual parts of the marriage.
I was hoping I wouldn't be too late, but...<eos> I guess I was.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> I'm taking you off the clinical trial.<eos> So, it... wasn't working?
Time's going to prove that to you.<eos> I want you to just look forward<eos> and be strong.<eos> Time gets rid of a lot of things.<eos> It heals everything.
I-I would like to see if there's any, uh, information, uh, o-or possessions relating to my parents.<eos> Your name?<eos> Weinraub.<eos> Abraham Weinraub.<eos> And while it's true that no amount of atonement can ever change the past, it does have the power to heal us, to restore relationships and connections we thought were lost forever.
Plenty of dumb men out there.<eos> Abigail, who did this to you?<eos> Must we know everything about each other?<eos> Can't our past just... stay behind us?<eos> Not if it continues to haunt you.
Well, that's not surprising, given the location of the mass.<eos> Pressure on the ventral temporal lobe can cause visual hallucinations.<eos> It ain't a tumor that's causing her visions, mate.<eos> She-she's been having them a long time, trust me.<eos> Well, she might have had this mass for a long time, if it's a slow grower.
Did you get a taste for that on the inside?<eos> Hey, guys, it's been almost two weeks since the mother condor has been to the nest.<eos> Do you think something might be wrong with the egg?<eos> Something is.<eos> It's on our website.
What it showed was the location of nearby women possessing erect nipples.<eos> And as such, Mr. Bighetti's grotesque creation was passed over by every investor in this town except you because it was perverted.<eos> Well, I'll admit that...<eos> I'll concede that the cultural moment may have passed, but at the time...<eos> No, at the time, it was as misogynistic as it is now, wasn't it, Mr. Bachman?
It's okay to lose as long as you played with honor.<eos> Right, Russell?<eos> Like in that poem you once wrote about honor.<eos> I... I-I wrote a poem about honor?<eos> Well, superficially, it was about your pet bird.
Well, the recipe's working now!<eos> Isn't it?<eos> It works.<eos> I need the antidote!<eos> It works?
Stealthily, we shall sneak up on...<eos> Who would live in this?<eos> Wipe that off, will you?<eos> And, lo, a creature with no face.<eos> It's looking at me.
He was so in love.<eos> But Bog, he had no patience.<eos> That's enough!<eos> So, he came to me for my love potion.<eos> I tried to tell him how it worked.
(Sighs) G'day, Archie.<eos> You're not on your bicycle today?<eos> ~ No, me knees are giving me grief.<eos> ~ That's no good. Thanking you.<eos> And, ah... .. you can take this Lysol soap back to where it came from.
What about the head injury?<eos> His skull was definitely fractured when he fell but that's not what killed him.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> You need to bring my father in for questioning and you have my permission to torture him.<eos> He's received a letter and I know it's from that madman.
She upstairs with Grace.<eos> Did you know the reason your heart physically hurts when it breaks?<eos> It's because your body doesn't understand what's going on.<eos> Like, your body doesn't know you just broke up with someone.<eos> It just assumes you must be in trouble, like, poisoned or something, so it's, like:
-Oh, me neither.<eos> -I don't much like drinking red wine during the day.<eos> Gives me a headache.<eos> -I have seen so much soap shaped like cupcakes this year. I'm just sick of it.<eos> Like, it doesn't soap up like real soap,
It... no, it's probably... nothing.<eos> And you didn't even notice?<eos> What?<eos> Your shoulder...<eos> it's, uh, back where it belongs.
- I don't know.<eos> Does she really?<eos> Well, where would you put the glider?<eos> You'd have to remove the oven to put the glider in.<eos> Well, you know, it's an absolute life saver.
Take this what?<eos> Dram.<eos> (knocking at door)<eos> MAUDE: Josh?<eos> Can I come in? What-what... what does it do?
We're not gonna just sacrifice you.<eos> I'm not sure we have much of a choice.<eos> That thing's magical, right?<eos> I would say "magical" is a pretty good guess.<eos> So if it's magic, what happens if it leaves town for a world with no magic?
You are so filled with assumptions.<eos> Regina is not the one we have to worry about.<eos> What?<eos> That beast did seek out the heart with the greatest potential for darkness, yes, but it was wasn't going after Regina.<eos> It was after Emma Swan.
Do I want to know how you do this?<eos> You most certainly do not.<eos> Whatever you're doing, put it on hold.<eos> Girlfriend of the band was recording their set-- caught the exact blast site.<eos> Where was it?
So, I didn't think it was smart to stop at an isolated jetty Where no one could hear me scream.<eos> You should have texted me.<eos> You should have texted me.<eos> Where's the wine?<eos> It's right here.
The pgc into the envy of every wine club in the world.<eos> If they love him that much, they can't know the wine's fake.<eos> Well, he didn't seem to, either.<eos> How is that possible? Well, for one, the wine is too valuable to open.<eos> And when it is, without anything to compare it to, Very few people can tell the difference between A decent wine and the most exclusive wines on the planet.
And a second clown mask.<eos> Very good.<eos> Hair fibers, DNA.<eos> Is there a way you like to kill, your own signature?<eos> I like the immediacy of a gun, but the sound that a blade makes when it cuts into the flesh is so delicious.
No.<eos> "No"?<eos> What do you mean, "no"?<eos> Is something wrong with the offer?<eos> It's well above the asking price.
Did I tell you that it's a boy?<eos> We're having a boy.<eos> When shock wears off...<eos> When the body can accept that a trauma has happened...<eos> When it can let down its defenses...
I saw through her eyes.<eos> She went outside, down the street, and then...<eos> I know where she was taken from.<eos> The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?
She went outside, down the street, and then...<eos> I know where she was taken from.<eos> The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.
I've had plenty of practice.<eos> Let's just hope that she's strong enough.<eos> That's not what's really troubling you though, is it?<eos> I stare into the face of evil every bloody day.<eos> It usually manifests itself as a demon, a malevolent spirit, a bloody zombie, but now...
The damage is done.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Okay, I mean, your narcissism wins again.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I mean, it's bigger than all of us, Dad.
Stop it!<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> See that stinger?<eos> If that wasn't covered, it would shoot into your neck and drain all the blood from of your body.
I made a mistake.<eos> I never should have accepted Louis's resignation, because not only is he a billing machine and a damn good attorney, he has personally gotten me out of more than one jam, and there's no one I'd rather have my name next to<eos> than my friend Louis Litt. Thank you, Harvey.<eos> Even though it's "not official," I already feel like my name's been up there as long as yours.<eos> And I definitely feel like it's gonna be up there for a long, long time.
How about you give me the lady's ring, and we'll call it a day?<eos> The lady is my fiancée.<eos> That's her engagement ring.<eos> It has sentimental value.<eos> Unless it can bring the both of you back from the dead, hand it over.
Let me talk to her.<eos> I'll call when I get close.<eos> Keep Duffy there.<eos> I just need to get my purse.<eos> You know, I can usually smell a rotten bud before it blooms.
The real killer is a zombie.<eos> Anyone on Blaine's trail will be in danger and we can't warn them.<eos> And if they do manage to catch him, then there's the whole zombie-in-a-prison problem.<eos> And then there's the body.<eos> It's a biohazard, and we don't know if it's contagious.
No one else is here.<eos> Do you put your pubes somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> You're teaching a class today.<eos> And it starts in two hours.
Welcome to the new world.<eos> I see you had little time to prepare your new vessel.<eos> I chose this host for its loyalty.<eos> Something you know nothing about.<eos> It lacks... intimidation.
This is about something much bigger than us right now, Alex.<eos> The SVR has a plan.<eos> Codename Black Dagger.<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> It was on Mikhail's laptop.
You will know every conversation that they have, every move they make.<eos> If you cannot accomplish this, I have men who will.<eos> You understand?<eos> It is nice how you have made a life for yourself here.<eos> Enjoy, because if your reassignment becomes necessary, it will not involve a flight home to Russia.
What are you doing, fucking around?<eos> You got to stack this shit.<eos> We thought you were gonna do that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> It can't be all over loose like this.
How was the release?<eos> Good, except for the thousands of dollars we have to dispute with the insurance company.<eos> Have you seen my meat?<eos> And the dragon says, "Oh, I don't see any meat."<eos> And the man goes, "That's 'cause it's in your belly!"
I'm sorry I brought up that stupid fucking curse.<eos> Well, I'm not, because this has made something really clear to me.<eos> Anything that goes wrong in your life, you blame someone else... your mother, your ex-wife, even your fucking dead grandfather... which means that, if something goes wrong with us, you're gonna blame me.<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> If you want your shit, it'll be in the Butlers' garage.
It's so strong that it sticks you like glue, and there's no way you can get away from it.<eos> I was deeply convinced that we were going to save the world.<eos> I considered myself tremendously fortunate to be in that position.<eos> Out of the blue one day, I received this envelope with an invitation to join the sea project.<eos> It was completely confidential.
There's somewhere I need to be.<eos> Looks like septicemia.<eos> Blood poisoning.<eos> You need to stay put if you wanna live.<eos> You're lucky it hasn't spread.
I wanted to run away to someplace far beyond the Badlands where life was easy and all my problems would disappear.<eos> Now that place is an illusion.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You see that building, hmm?<eos> It was once the seat of power for the entire world.
Now that place is an illusion.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You see that building, hmm?<eos> It was once the seat of power for the entire world.<eos> It stood tall in a shining city on a hill where so-called enlightened men promised their citizens a bright future.
It's just an optical illusion.<eos> Slanty, huh?<eos> Yeah. Technical term.<eos> This ring has been with me for a very long time, and, uh it has obvious significance with my past.<eos> It also represents meeting you.
This ring has been with me for a very long time, and, uh it has obvious significance with my past.<eos> It also represents meeting you.<eos> If I didn't have this ring, I would never have met you.<eos> So in a sense, uh...<eos> It has the potential to represent my future, as well.
It also represents meeting you.<eos> If I didn't have this ring, I would never have met you.<eos> So in a sense, uh...<eos> It has the potential to represent my future, as well.<eos> And I-I'm not expecting you would ever wear it, but I want to share it with you, and I want it to represent our future...together.
Eh. About time for another vacation, huh?<eos> Yeah, I can't see past the work.<eos> Did Lieutenant Koto give y'all the Kaleb case?<eos> - Hmm. - You find anything?<eos> No, but I can see why it went cold.
We need to get a micro recorder inside.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Duplicates of the shirts Alex bought tonight.<eos> One button on each is a recorder with a burst transmitter.<eos> It will upload the audio when a signal is available.
This is over the edge, no parachute.<eos> A little theatrical, isn't it?<eos> Even for you.<eos> I've got a fondness for this place.<eos> In a strange way, it's home.
- And they were never recovered.<eos> - All right, maybe we start there.<eos> - Wait, maybe not.<eos> I went over the jacket to look for cotton fibers, and instead, I found this adhesive residue.<eos> It's in a symmetrical oblong shape.
It wasn't, right?<eos> I mean, 'cause part of it just showed up at a murder scene.<eos> Want to tell me how that might have happened?<eos> The body, Lucas Reem, was stolen.<eos> It was on my prep table.
Rumored to be eight of them out there.<eos> Any idea who has them?<eos> No, but there is a user who is trying to track them down.<eos> He goes by the name of DesertSky60, and he has spent the last month asking about those knives.<eos> I ran his username through a search engine, to see if it would pop up on any other site, and I found this profile.
My god, you must be Scott.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yes, the blood work's very encouraging, but I want to get you into an MRI.<eos> That treatment though, the one from Kira's tooth, that's working, yeah?<eos> I mean, it's possible it's suddenly this efficacious, but...
- No?<eos> - Mm-mm. Well, I don't care what you believe.<eos> You're institutionalized.<eos> What does this word mean?<eos> It means that you love it here.
Mm, that does not sound like him.<eos> Okay, personal photos are down, kitchen is spotless, and I got the silver-painted break-dancer outside to move his very loud boom box elsewhere.<eos> - You beat him in a dance-off?<eos> - No, I destroyed him. There's absolutely nothing here that will set off Holt.<eos> Oh, oh! I was trying to cook my oatmeal with a road flare, but it caught on fire.
It's not something you can put under microscopes or examine from a telescope.<eos> Well, 230 years after Newton, a German patent clerk in Switzerland finally realized that scientists have been asking the wrong question all along.<eos> They would never find an object in all the immensity of space called gravity, because, in point of fact, gravity is nothing but the shape of space itself.<eos> That clerk- - Einstein-- posited that the apple does not fall to the ground because the Earth exerts some mysterious kind of force upon it.<eos> The apple falls to the ground because it is following the lines and grooves that gravity has carved into space.
You'd really do that for me?<eos> Meet me at the docks tomorrow morning.<eos> So, where exactly did you bury my treasure?<eos> Oh, I didn't bury what you're after.<eos> It's aboard the Jolly Roger.
Not if I take you.<eos> [ chuckling ] You'd really do that for me?<eos> Meet me at the docks tomorrow morning.<eos> So, where exactly did you bury my treasure? Oh, I didn't bury what you're after.<eos> It's aboard the Jolly Roger.
Yes.<eos> And is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well maybe you should take a piece of advice from a man who has pushed away every chance at happiness because it was never enough.<eos> If it's within your grasp, if you know... where it is and who it's with... then you should run to it, grasp it, and never let it go.
I won't return your wife's heart.<eos> No, no, dearie.<eos> You misunderstood.<eos> I already have it.<eos> Regina's protection spell might keep me out, but it doesn't account for the common thief.
Except now there is no heir.<eos> Instead there's opportunity.<eos> This... opportunity... would secure your position as well before others take it from us both.<eos> I wouldn't claim your heart, my lady.<eos> I know it belongs to another, one you've been denied these many years.
Um, that's not the only thing that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Jackie did review my application.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Well, I wrote a letter to the admission's board hoping that it would land on her desk.<eos> And it did.
Look what I have for you.<eos> What's that?<eos> A Ferris wheel.<eos> And what does this wheel do?<eos> You get on it and it spins around.
What else can she do?<eos> Laverne, could you feel the laptops coming on?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> All right, just keep expanding that feeling.<eos> I want you to feel the building, like it's...
Laverne, could you feel the laptops coming on?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> All right, just keep expanding that feeling.<eos> I want you to feel the building, like it's...<eos> Like it's your own skin.
That's not the point.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> The picture just meant a lot to me.<eos> It got me through a lot of tough times when I was in prison.
I hear a lot of bad boys come in here.<eos> I love me some bad boys, especially when they're my people.<eos> Well, you found the right place.<eos> Stick around.<eos> If the sun decided to be a graffiti artist instead of the center of the solar system, I imagine it'd paint something like this.
Shelley's mind is a good deal more intricate than your own.<eos> - Little bitch.<eos> - I'm almost ready.<eos> It took me 20 years to realize how much I wanted your heart.<eos> Now it's mine.
But what you can do is help find her killer, and that is what best friends are for.<eos> (sighs) Okay. But you have to promise you won't judge.<eos> I so won't.<eos> The night kimber went missing, she left me a voicemail.<eos> And i didn't play it for anyone because it made her sound bad.
I'm pregnant.<eos> All we have to do is power her up.<eos> Did you steal that dress from my closet?<eos> No, I printed it out.<eos> I specifically told you it was inappropriate.
It seems strange to sleep.<eos> Eat.<eos> Go to birthday parties under the circumstances, - don't you think?<eos> - This invasion is slow.<eos> It is insidious.
Something you learn when you're the one giving the orders: sometimes there are no good decisions.<eos> It's just a lesser of two evils.<eos> And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.
You know me?<eos> I saw your trial.<eos> Now, these days, most people, they keep a low profile for fear of crucifixion, and yet you...<eos> I had a vision.<eos> And it bids me to be here on this cracked stone.
The mystery is here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, you're right.<eos> The mystery is here, but the answer isn't.<eos> It's out there.
But maybe I could track where he came from.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just trying to survive, like you.<eos> I tracked down the courier who was supposed to give me my medicine, but apparently you intercepted it, Agent Thomas.<eos> Now, I need to know where it is.
I see you on a horse... bleeding out, hands reaching for you.<eos> Did you nearly die for a brother?<eos> A woman?<eos> Both.<eos> Your heart... broken, and then healed... but it will shatter because...
That cabbage breakfast is the best idea I've had.<eos> Thanks for all this, Judge.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You can really thank me, Tedward, by trying very hard to find your gun.<eos> Mm. It's somewhere.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Jo made me a new daylight ring.<eos> - You like?<eos> - Depends.<eos> Does it work?
Your next position is up to you.<eos> Ordinarily, I don't allow for relationships in my unit, but in this case, I'm willing to make an exception.<eos> Lindsay's spot's open.<eos> You two think you can handle it...<eos> It's yours.
Then they tell me the company's being taken over, and I'm out on my ear, but there was no redundancy.<eos> The union was useless.<eos> Nothing I could do about it.<eos> Just sat there, killing the last few hours on the internet.<eos> And then I saw this place - it looked amazing.
I'm good with technology.<eos> [laughs] A hacker.<eos> You're a guy who needs order.<eos> Coding is good for that.<eos> It channels the OCD.
Cool little mom-and-pop place that operates out of an old gas station.<eos> The menu's entirely in Japanese.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I had to download this app to be able to read the sushi menu.<eos> It translates images into text.
And the things we do on purpose we tend to repeat.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I spent the night consulting our ancestors.<eos> They say we must remain strong and to defend our homes, but for now, no covens are to expand into gentilly.<eos> This decision is to keep us from a violent turf war with the vampires, and it's final.
Do you recognize the man in these photos?<eos> That would be Mr. Pendergraff.<eos> Those pictures were taken from a surveillance camera at the Gold Leaf Casino in Atlantic City.<eos> Do you find his behavior here acceptable?<eos> Well, it is certainly distasteful.
What's on it?<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> No.<eos> He was very specific.<eos> It was only to be watched by you.
I-I'd like that.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You sure you want me to spy on him?<eos> Absolutely, wasn't your offer sincere?<eos> It was very sincere, I'm just asking, you know...
I'm Sara. Hey.<eos> Joe, don't leave them in the hall.<eos> - Oh, sorry, come on in.<eos> - Big galoot.<eos> I love that word. It comes from the Dutch.
Joe, don't leave them in the hall.<eos> - Oh, sorry, come on in.<eos> - Big galoot.<eos> I love that word. It comes from the Dutch.<eos> It means either galley slave or pirate or pimp.
- Don't.<eos> And I will always love...<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> I found this necklace.<eos> It was Lucy's.
Sure, it's what we do, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about the vault?<eos> What vault?<eos> I think that's what it is.
Adam?<eos> Tony.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> I found this necklace.<eos> It was Lucy's.
It's still funny to me, it still makes me laugh, 40 years later.<eos> I can still see it so clearly and it still makes me laugh.<eos> Run, Benjy!<eos> You can't run from this shit, bitch.<eos> It's gonna get you.
Okay, just wait a minute here.<eos> If this is a supernova or whatever, that means it's been happening since we got here, right?<eos> So, how come Miss Know-It-All is only telling us about it right now?<eos> I believe I may have already mentioned that the external sensors were down.<eos> I only detected the radiation once it made significant penetration into the hull.
And then Jimmy Jr. comes running?<eos> And Rosa and my math scores, according to Darryl's theory, which is probably right, since he's the smartest boy I've ever dated.<eos> Fake dated.<eos> Right, right. Fake dated.<eos> So, the breakup, is it gonna be classy or nasty?

We stop it.<eos> We stop that beating heart.<eos> And that, my friend, is what your president would want us to do.<eos> It is what he would demand that we do.<eos> If his heart were not out there, if it were in here, he would do it himself.
Although Rebecca's biological components are superior, she must be constantly monitored and maintained by her nanites.<eos> Slow down the nanites, slow down Rebecca.<eos> Is that what you did to her?<eos> Yes. I have blanketed this entire facility in a dampening field.<eos> At its present lowest setting, it merely renders her harmless.
The hard slab of the cold steel curbed the swelling in my spinal column.<eos> When I woke up and regained consciousness, I felt better than ever.<eos> Really, I should be thanking you right now.<eos> That fall?<eos> It might have cured me of my severe scoliosis.
I'm also already hot and rich.<eos> What would I have to gain by hatching a plan to knock off a bunch of nameless dumb whores?<eos> I don't think that you did hatch the plan, Chanel.<eos> But I think that once the murders started happening, you saw it as the perfect opportunity to knock off the pledges that you thought would ruin Kappa Kappa Tau.<eos> With each murdered pledge, this sorority house got closer to being the Kappa Tau that you always intended it to be!
Beth!<eos> We should go back in there.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, what's going on in there is obviously some kind of sorcery, and it's wrong.<eos> It's showing us what we could be, the two of us together.
The department told me I had too many vacation days built up, so I had to use them or lose them.<eos> I'm aware you're off duty.<eos> In fact, that's exactly why I asked you here.<eos> I've picked up some potentially interesting work involving stolen zebras.<eos> I thought it might be an opportunity for you to gain more exposure to my methods.
Hurry!<eos> Catherine.<eos> Francis, he's dying.<eos> I've had a vision.<eos> The prophecy, it will come to pass.
My stomach still aches from your efforts to slowly kill me.<eos> Francis, I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me, and everything you're doing.<eos> The new château isn't just for you.<eos> It's for the both of us.<eos> And I'm sure it will be wonderful, but I'm not just talking about that.

You're not gonna freak out at the first curveball your relationship throws you.<eos> I'm fine with the curves.<eos> It's the balls I'm worried about.<eos> Gabi, the date was perfect!<eos> It ended with sex on the kitchen floor.
Oh, that wooden works part really got to you, didn't it?<eos> Why don't you tell me what was really going on today when I came home.<eos> I was just working on a clock, and I started thinking about, you know, how much time this clock had ticked its way through...<eos> I mean, the Civil War and everything after that.<eos> And I thought how important time is and it just keeps on ticking past.
- But I'm the...<eos> - Shh!<eos> Sleepy, sleepy.<eos> Millie is already up to one percent support.<eos> Our lead was this, now it's this.
Do you still believe in coincidences?<eos> You tell me. What's it look like to you?<eos> Looks like they ran into each other in a bar and stayed talking for two hours.<eos> I want to know what they were talking about.<eos> And unless I know to do otherwise, I'm gonna follow this investigation wherever it leads me.
Damn it, Violet, sit down!<eos> Please...?<eos> Listen, it's natural that I worry some guy might be taking advantage of you.<eos> Where's the apology?<eos> It's coming.

Nice.<eos> Mr. Crider said that being in prison actually prevents Erica James from contributing to society in a positive way, so, he, uh, - gave me a "C". - Come on, Jace.<eos> I mean, it's an admirable point, but you had to know you were poking the bear.<eos> Okay. So, what, civil disobedience isn't important?<eos> Well, it is.
You know she does.<eos> Er, there is a thing called special circumstances.<eos> If I can talk to your therapist today, then perhaps we can make a case for a retake, but you'll have to take it now, before your English paper.<eos> There's a 24-hour rule.<eos> 'And there it was.

What about problems here at school?<eos> Well, we did have an incident at the beginning of the year.<eos> We have several minorities here at the school, and there's been some bullying.<eos> One of our seniors, a Native American boy, found some racial slurs on his locker.<eos> It was reported to janitorial staff, and it was cleaned up, but it appeared again two more times.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We have a suppressant.<eos> A suppressant?<eos> We tested it, and it will work.
Oh, really?<eos> You think it's a good idea to hand me an ax right now?<eos> Well, yeah. It's cold, Tobias.<eos> It's getting colder.<eos> That, uh... that ass wound of yours... bet it's acting up, huh?
Great.<eos> Way to go!<eos> Please tell me you have a spare.<eos> Course I do.<eos> It's right there.

The last couple of days, it's been registering strange power surges.<eos> I traced the last one here around the time the mascot disappeared.<eos> Right, well, a power surge alone isn't necessarily an indicator of magic, so...<eos> But with readings like these, this building should have been leveled.<eos> But it's still standing.
I've writ every play with it.<eos> [Lowered voice] Now we know why he's the world's greatest writer... magic pen, kind of a cheat.<eos> [Lowered voice] Magic pen wouldn't be enough.<eos> He'd already have to be a genius.<eos> It only boosts his level of writing.

Felix didn't ask me a single medical question.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - Well, I just told him to not get all worked up about things, you know?<eos> I mean, what are you gonna do?<eos> When your time's up, it's up, you know?

Sure.<eos> I like a man who knows his Scotch.<eos> Oh, nice chair.<eos> You like it?<eos> - It swivels. - Mm.
No.<eos> Because of art.<eos> That statue that was so offensive provoked a conversation.<eos> That's what art does.<eos> - It brings people together.
Don't ask why.<eos> I love it when children have talent.<eos> Why are you smiling like that?<eos> Did something happen to mom?<eos> Put your face back to what it used to be.

How does toramex factor in?<eos> Shahir? I'll take this one.<eos> Toramex alleviates arthritis, targets TNF, and is proven to reduce associated inflammation.<eos> These proteins can be up to 25 times higher in Alzheimer's patients' brains.<eos> Right, so the tricky part is, how do we get the drug into the brain without it dissipating in the body?
Knock, knock. Speaking of crazy.<eos> Prom night. [chuckles]<eos> I made you girls some mocktails.<eos> Twinkie-tinis.<eos> Cute, huh? I threw on my old prom dress just as a goof and it still fits.
And because sometimes, on a good day... ..if I try very hard... ..I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away.<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> Compassion then.<eos> Always.<eos> It grows strong and fierce in you - like a cancer.
Compassion then.<eos> Always.<eos> It grows strong and fierce in you - like a cancer.<eos> I hope so.<eos> It will kill you in the end.
Well, then you obviously haven't been drinking enough.<eos> What do you got?<eos> 18th got a call last night reporting gunshots around 2:00 A.M. outside Arthur's Grill.<eos> - You know the place?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's actually a couple of blocks from my apartment.
Yeah, for your judgment, yeah, but not for you politics.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> This case is about a young father confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.<eos> It's not about gun control.<eos> It's also not about the quick fees you can make from $200,000.
As far as I know.<eos> That's not what I'm here about.<eos> Come on in.<eos> That, uh... job offer from the War College, Henry... it really wasn't a question.<eos> It came from your office.
You cannot do this from the comfort of your own fireside, sir.<eos> We're not in Yorkshire any more.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I heard all the ladies of Yorkshire may put out their dirty linen in baskets at night, and in the morning it is magically clean.
I guess your grandmother just wants to stick around to see those boys grow up.<eos> ♪ Amazing grace ♪<eos> ♪ How sweet the sound... ♪<eos> Loud singing could kill her.<eos> HOMER: And it did.
People do enough damage without help from the afterlife.<eos> Put it on her tab.<eos> That was his office.<eos> The room you're staying in, 64.<eos> If this building has a heart, it's black as the ace of spades, and you're sleeping in it.
- Now...<eos> - My God, look at this.<eos> The whole floor needs to be torn out.<eos> This space is perfect for my atelier.<eos> It's gonna be sensational.
It's true.<eos> She killed my man over 20 years ago and tossed me aside.<eos> You know the only thing worse than heartbreak?<eos> Loneliness.<eos> Knowing that it's never going to end.
You sound like a 1930s movie.<eos> You look like one, too.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I had a marvelous professor at Exeter.<eos> I freely admit that I mimicked his Brahman diction until I made it my own.
Don't be mad.<eos> We can dump someone else in there, maybe this weekend.<eos> In the meantime, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Name it.<eos> I need you to retrieve Will's body before it gets too ripe.
Was there one night you do remember?<eos> My dad found me on the floor, lying beside the chair.<eos> - What about the skylight?<eos> - That's the thing.<eos> It doesn't actually open.
There's a huge tree in the middle of it.<eos> You'd think it was 1,000 years old.<eos> But it's been cut down.<eos> It's just a stump.<eos> It's real.
Each band has a family dynamic, and this family, it seems to me, has lost its communal bond.<eos> Now, this Nakota ritual, which I call "the egg and I,"<eos> is designed to restore that bond.<eos> Now, the goal is to take each delicate egg and pass it from person to person, and then put back safely in its nest.<eos> Each egg represents a family member, and if it breaks, so does that family member.
"Tragically, most of the town expired<eos> "when the dome came down, leaving only a few survivors."<eos> So you're-you're talking about those of us that show no signs of an alien infection.<eos> Correct.<eos> And as long as it remains dormant in you and the others, you will have your freedom.
What that Janice did to poor Mark makes me sick.<eos> Either that or it's the four chickens you ate this morning.<eos> ~ Listen, Woodster, between you and me...<eos> ~ Is your massive belly.<eos> I know, it's pressing against my knee.
Why am I the only one who's never seen this commercial?<eos> Because it comes on late at night, and when you're not moonlighting, your honey-milk-sipping ass is in bed by 10:00.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill the Pitbull?<eos> Maybe CSU will get lucky and find the murder weapon.<eos> Meanwhile, let's get the body to the morgue and see what it can tell us.
And the note read, "1527 Benedict Canyon,"<eos> and the word "Cadaver."<eos> The letter was postmarked the day before the discovery of the victim's body.<eos> That letter says a lot.<eos> It gets mailed to a police department, so that somebody would come and find her body so it's not sitting there, decomposing, rotting away.
Not when you consider the alternatives.<eos> Dr. Brennan, this blunt force trauma injury to the left temporal bone is unlike any I've ever seen.<eos> Yes.<eos> Angela already ran the fracture pattern through the computer.<eos> It doesn't correspond to any commonly known blunt force weapons.
A system I felt created me, to be brutally honest with you.<eos> I never once felt remorse for the things I've done or took any of the help that was on offer for me.<eos> And I know... I know this meeting is primarily about this case and this sentence, if you look at what I've achieved in here for the past four years, I hope you can see massive changes I've made to the way I was in the past.<eos> You see, the past does matter.<eos> It kind of shapes the future if we face it.
What are you talking about?<eos> I emptied a full clip into one of them before the son of a bitch went down.<eos> Dean, what are you doing with the holy oil?<eos> There is a cure for the Mark in the book.<eos> But it comes at a price.
If you'd just think about that for a second, Liam, you would know that I'm right.<eos> I am thinking!<eos> I'm thinking about alternatives.<eos> Liam, it's the Supermoon.<eos> It's feeding your anger.
I'm thinking about alternatives.<eos> Liam, it's the Supermoon.<eos> It's feeding your anger.<eos> It's making you more aggressive.<eos> It's making me stronger!
I never knew my father.<eos> I got over it. 68 years ago.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Is a crime less serious because time's passed?<eos> Is it... Is it less wrong... because it was done 50 years ago, or 60, or 70?
"One can't see too many beautiful things," my father said.<eos> And it was free for kids.<eos> But not everything was beautiful.<eos> The art could be disturbing demanding and daunting.<eos> It made me think about life.
And it was free for kids.<eos> But not everything was beautiful.<eos> The art could be disturbing demanding and daunting.<eos> It made me think about life.<eos> It gave me a direction.
They think you're loyal to people.<eos> They don't know that you would use them as kindling for the fire if have to.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know that you would never allow people to get in the way of what is right, of your fundamental belief that the Republic must stand at all costs.<eos> I know you, because the apple does not fall far from the tree, Olivia, poison though it may be.
I was right, she makes Thinnies.<eos> We got to put this ring on a Colton.<eos> - Without a Colton, we cannot get into the Void.<eos> Your trip didn't change anything.<eos> - It changed everything.
Once he gets what he needs.<eos> - Haven.<eos> I thought you were crazy, Duke, but I remember this place.<eos> - You were born here.<eos> - Yeah, I just don't remember it being so bleak.
- Did you bring it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What is that?<eos> Caroline got rid of everything from her former life.<eos> Her mom had sent this letter, intending for it to arrive after she died, which it did, but Caroline had already flipped her switch.
Yeah.<eos> Damon!<eos> Damon--I'm getting-<eos> - I'm getting my memories back.<eos> Damon, the cure, it undid the compulsion.
Dull blade's just as dangerous.<eos> For the user as well.<eos> I mean, a blunt knife is not efficient, and it's an odd choice for a murder weapon.<eos> Murder wasn't the plan.<eos> Apparently, it became the plan.
Wait, wait.<eos> Stop.<eos> I know where the egg is.<eos> I stole it.<eos> It's here on Bird Island.
You try to stop me, he dies.<eos> You killed your own man.<eos> Yes.<eos> For the egg.<eos> Where is it?
Wait.<eos> All right.<eos> It's smashed.<eos> I broke it.<eos> It's broken.
How about the beginning?<eos> Christine and I work for Aktaion.<eos> We were told we could help the world.<eos> So they hired us to find fragments of meteors from a shower that hit the earth 25 years ago.<eos> When Melanie found the egg. It was in one of the meteors.
She's probably telling him everything she knows about you, which is a lot.<eos> So, you see, your plan has no margin for error.<eos> And that's a big chance to take when the fallout is your brain in a jar.<eos> I still have a human being's body, Jim.<eos> And it's tired.
So, we have a conversation that we need to finish.<eos> I believe the outstanding question was... who are you?<eos> I worked for Aktaion and was tasked with finding the egg.<eos> And what did Aktaion tell you the egg was?<eos> They said it had the potential to be the next great energy source.
I said, "Okay."<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> I don't know, it's weird.<eos> I remember thinking that all I cared about was the kinship.<eos> That it felt more important than my own life.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Is that the sun?<eos> No, it's coming from the wrong direction.
Where were you?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Is that the sun?<eos> No, it's coming from the wrong direction.<eos> It's getting closer.
Did you see that?<eos> Dale, what's happening?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Joe.<eos> Look at the sky! It's coming back.
This information about my father, it changes everything.<eos> Especially if the cure works.<eos> - Lily...<eos> - Shut up and listen to me.<eos> Say it works, and you save all these people.
But I do know what we're up against.<eos> And our next move has to be smart.<eos> When I left the day care, Junior was doing well.<eos> He was back to his old self.<eos> So if Hektor's cure works, it can help your baby.
Oh... you have yourself to blame for that.<eos> You drew us a square on the door.<eos> Only reason we knew to look here was because "Paper mill" was next on the list of hideouts.<eos> So, we saw the bodies at the day care. What happened?<eos> The cure, it made Junior go totally aggro.
You have two hours, or the deal is off the table.<eos> This is disgusting!<eos> It's the triumph of the anarchists.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You know, the next killer app isn't coming from some corporate office in Seattle or San Jose, it's coming from some 16-year-old in Warsaw who gets excited by a 14-year-old's code in Mumbai.
Okay.<eos> Now let's ID the bastard who framed our son.<eos> Hard drive should be under the front desk.<eos> DHS has the picture.<eos> 20 minutes, it'll be on the wall of every law-enforcement office in the country.
The committee would like to know how many casualties you expect.<eos> Well, that's the thing about tragic accidents.<eos> You cannot count casualties until after it happens.<eos> In two days... a disaster will befall America.<eos> It will dominate the news here and around the world for weeks to come.
But he locks the doors on saturdays.<eos> Maybe we could get a key somehow?<eos> - He's got it on his belt.<eos> - Oh, what about The bathroom window?<eos> It was open this morning.
One of them is in Witness Protection.<eos> And he saved them for last because if he kills that target first, we'd be on him immediately.<eos> What?<eos> You see something?<eos> Encryption's a highly specialized skill set, but it's fundamentally a mathematical process, which means it's a human process, but sometimes your technique can reveal where you learned it.
Use the lesser card stock.<eos> You're downsizing the Tribune?<eos> But that was your first acquisition.<eos> Go see if the new art director has the layout ready.<eos> It's not that I don't see your frown, it's just that I don't care enough to ask why it's there.
We're not gonna fight her.<eos> She's the devil.<eos> And you don't dance with the devil, because you get burned.<eos> Also, because in Madeline's case, she has no rhythm and her hands are like little rat claws.<eos> If she wants the case, it's hers.
Yeah.<eos> I didn't kill Christine.<eos> I wasn't trying to kill Eva.<eos> Well, we looked into your alibi, Jamie.<eos> It didn't check out.
Oh, the reason I'm asking is 'cause I live in my car.<eos> Okay, that does.<eos> Hey, y'all.<eos> Check out my new dress for hosting bingo night.<eos> It's gonna show off all my curves.
I would never use such a rigid and closed-minded term.<eos> She did, however, share some useful information on the church's methods.<eos> Apparently, their esteemed leader likes to send his acolytes out to follow, photograph and harass people who dare to criticize him.<eos> So she's currently in your office, e-mailing me the dossier you compiled on Garrison Boyd.<eos> I'm hopeful it will, uh, shed some additional light on his final days.
You ready for your close-up?<eos> Oh, yeah, go on.<eos> Get the spread in!<eos> Oof, that meat's off.<eos> No, it's fresh from the "batchers".
Oh, thank you.<eos> A new breath of freedom... utopia.<eos> Do you even know what that word means?<eos> An ideal world.<eos> It means "no place."
What are you doing?<eos> Taking away your shame and giving you back your glory.<eos> Do you not think that this flesh has seen a lifetime of wounds and scars and the ravages of time?<eos> And yet, behold...<eos> It retains its youth.
You know what, sweetheart, I got a...<eos> I got a meeting I have to get to.<eos> It's really, really important, okay?<eos> Listen, I got you coconut ice cream.<eos> It's in the freezer for you and the little guy to have a little coconut ice cream.
- Amen?<eos> - Amen.<eos> Do you feel God's love?<eos> - Yes. - I know you do.<eos> Now I remember walking into this building when it was rat and roach infested.
Shall we continue?<eos> Have you forgotten her so quickly?<eos> You've already discarded her, and you're a human being.<eos> Imagine how quickly that thing that you've created would discard you.<eos> Do you ever lay awake at night wondering if one day it will see you as a threat?
Though not out loud.<eos> What a man must not be, he cannot be, he said, with a pop.<eos> Can I make you love me again?<eos> In a letter, for losing?<eos> If the letter is the last thing left of me, will it sit on your shelf, with my ashes, gathering dust to dust?
Come on.<eos> It's a big place for someone who lives on their own.<eos> I have a servant.<eos> And all manner of visitors drop in.<eos> Your device... what is it?
Well, of course you would.<eos> When we combine, we'll avoid duplicating our efforts.<eos> The whole thing would work a lot more efficiently than it does now.<eos> So you don't disagree with the plan?<eos> Well, don't you see what it could mean?
A son belongs with his father.<eos> But we have each other. Just like we did when we first arrived on this planet.<eos> And just like then, we will survive and prosper.<eos> Do not lose faith!<eos> I made you a promise back then and it still holds.
Is it real?<eos> What?<eos> Is this place real?<eos> I'm not sure I understand the question.<eos> One of the only reasons we chose this place was because you said it was special.
Alura...<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> I saw a hologram of you.<eos> A message from Krypton.<eos> It was on the ship that brought your daughter to Earth.
He's only been doing readings for a few weeks and they say that he's the real deal.<eos> I want you to find what you're looking for, I do.<eos> How's this guy gonna be any different from any of the others?<eos> Because this place is different.<eos> It's special.
They have been deciphered.<eos> Then our location is known?<eos> Once a codex is broken it offers opportunity.<eos> I wrote a new note, made sure it was found.<eos> It proposes a rendezvous today on the other side of Paris, so we are quite safe here.
Sorry. I see.<eos> And, um...<eos> So how familiar are you with illinois criminal procedure?<eos> I've been getting up to speed.<eos> It's complicated, though.
They kept me late at the base, so we're late for Daddy and Me again, kiddo.<eos> My schmiddo, diddo.<eos> God, you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> Just going to drop off the ice cream so it doesn't melt on us, 'Kay? I'll be back.
If I understood correctly it's about the circumcision of their son.<eos> How do they look?<eos> I should have never left him with you.<eos> I'm just letting you know about his wish.<eos> And where does it suddenly come from?
Just for a moment.<eos> If you need anything at all...<eos> We need to give Zoe the war that she deserves.<eos> Strike hard, strike fast.<eos> Destroy this rebellion once and for all before it gets even more out of control.
I did have buttery hands, didn't I?<eos> I take it as a compliment, but I don't think you meant it that way.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> It's amazing how our skin changes, isn't it?<eos> The worse we treat it, the stronger it gets.
Greetings.<eos> Do kids still say greetings?<eos> I haven't been in this dimension for a really long time.<eos> Whoa, six-fingered handshake.<eos> It's a full finger friendlier than normal.
So if we get that file, we get the truth.<eos> Assuming it still exists, it could be confetti by now.<eos> Well, we have to find out one way or another.<eos> I looked up the data center.<eos> It's 20 minutes from here.
It's 20 minutes from here.<eos> We can't just walk in there and ask for it.<eos> No, but I can ask for mine and then we'll know if they've been shredded.<eos> What if they haven't?<eos> Then we'll check out the place, see how secure it is and figure out what to do next.
Don't sugarcoat it.<eos> Headache, chills, muscle pains, fever at 102.<eos> - And his blood pressure is...<eos> - Low.<eos> If it drops any lower, you could experience dizziness, confusion, subconjunctival hemorrhage.
These three years, they've been the best time of my life, but I want to be with my family.<eos> I'm going to North Carolina.<eos> Yeah, so Jessica Chilton, that's me, obviously.<eos> Anyways, everyone calls me Chili, 'cause I hate the name Jessica.<eos> It's better than my sister, I guess, 'cause we call her Jelly Bean.
It occurred to us once we arrived - that the event is at 4:00 in the afternoon. - Mm.<eos> At 4:00 in the afternoon, the sun will be there in the sky.<eos> Directly behind the stage.<eos> So?<eos> So I'm worried it will blind the audience.
So I'm worried it will blind the audience.<eos> Make it very difficult for them to see your father or my boss, the ambassador.<eos> This is the desert.<eos> The sun is always somewhere.<eos> No matter where you move the audience, it will find them.
