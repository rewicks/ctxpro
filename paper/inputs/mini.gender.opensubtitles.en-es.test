It's a coffee pot.<eos> Is that not coffee in there?<eos> Oh, is there not coffee?<eos> Actually, Ders, don't you mean flat Dr. Pepper pot?<eos> Because we put flat Dr. Pepper in a coffee pot and switched it.
- Right, he just happened to stumble across molestation photos online.<eos> Yeah, while booking a trip to Thailand.<eos> Did you pay the person who posted this garbage so that you could own it yourself?<eos> And then maybe trade the images with other perverts?<eos> Regardless of how you organized your collection, someone stole it, and you were paying huge sums of money to have it returned.

What about GPS data?<eos> Unfortunately, the phone was switched off for a large chunk of time.<eos> But the last GPS location on the 17th and first on the 18th are DCI Huntley's home address, consistent with her story of being off sick.<eos> Sorry, Sarge.<eos> Every piece of evidence that Roz Huntley's got on Tim Ifield's murder -- we go through it.
Good.<eos> Because we have a problem.<eos> The painting's not here yet.<eos> It's not gonna arrive until right before the auction.<eos> So we steal it from them before the auction?
That holds magical current.<eos> That is the biggest one that I've ever seen.<eos> How many of those do you have?<eos> - Not enough to spare.<eos> Took years to make, and I need it.
I hated to see him leave comedy for the other stuff that came later on, for the more serious stuff, because nobody could do comedy quite like he was doing it.<eos> [narrator] Stevens had taken all of the footage he had shot throughout the war and at Dachau and locked it up in a warehouse.<eos> He retrieved the reels only once, in 1959, when he was preparing to direct The Diary of Anne Frank.<eos> He went alone to the screening room to watch the footage, put on the first reel of film, and after about one minute, turned it off.<eos> He drove it back to the warehouse, locked it up... and never looked at it again.
Don't ask me that shit.<eos> I don't know who Achilles' mother." Don't yell out if you know.<eos> "It's Campampetes." Nobody cares what you know.<eos> She had a question about Achilles, it was interesting.<eos> I'll tell it to you.
You're absolutely right.<eos> Do they make masks like that here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This silicone is very expensive.<eos> We have to find out who supplies it to our country.
Come on, just tell me what you want from me.<eos> Look, take anything.<eos> It's all yours, okay?<eos> Okay? Hey, y'all like weed?<eos> Just untie me, I'll go get it for you.
Isn't that right, partner?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, Walt, do you want a beer?<eos> You have beer?<eos> Yeah, I keep it tucked away in a little fridge in the garage.
You remember the Act of Contrition?<eos> Good.<eos> Do you remember the words of the Act of Contrition?<eos> Yes.<eos> As your penance, I would like you to recite it now... .. in the presence of our associates.
Right move, mate.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Say good-bye to Bullock for me.<eos> I don't really want the whole Celtic farewell.<eos> He's gonna have his hands full, but I think he can handle it.
No one gets through, you hear me?<eos> We need oxygen now.<eos> I don't know, Travis, it's bad.<eos> Yeah, it's Sean.<eos> They tried to take his gun, but he wouldn't give it up.
And now, according to Donnie's wishes, we drink and have a good time.<eos> Walter.<eos> Donnie said, and I'm quoting here,<eos> "Have them all bury my picture in autumn leaves, and as they do, they should make a wish for the world... that has nothing to do with the financial markets."<eos> The paint was about eight layers thick and hard, but I scratched it.
It's because I am the cartel, Daniel.<eos> And this church?<eos> This church is the cartel. The Bloods, the Diablos...<eos> they're all me.<eos> I cut the dope, and I send it out to both gangs.
- I know!<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> - Bye. Okay, so in chapter one of your textbooks, there is a series of photographs, they start on page 10.<eos> I'm gonna give you all a second to find that, and then we'll start discussing.<eos> Okay, has everyone found it?
And no apparent connection to Senator Bransfield.<eos> Never even voted.<eos> How'd he get DiNozzo's badge and I.D.?<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I didn't give it to him.
So what's up? Did you get my text?<eos> My sexy pics come through?<eos> Yes, Rooster, I got the picture of your balls.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I thought I sent it to the other Mary in my phone.
"Clark Westerfeld."<eos> There's no match for him in the federal database.<eos> State and local are still looking.<eos> I didn't see a Goddamn thing.<eos> Even when I took her to dinner, when I was looking for it.
I think you covered up the fraud.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We must call a meeting, let the members decide.<eos> It doesn't seem unreasonable to ask for transparency in our party's accounts.<eos> Then you shall have it.
Get us to report on something you guys are just astroturfing?<eos> Would I do that to you?<eos> Look, all 83 calls said the same thing:<eos> stay the course on the government shutdown.<eos> - Who leads it?
Maybe we could take a picture... to send him?<eos> Sure.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Okay, I think I got it.
You're all about fate and destiny, except when it comes to love?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've seen attraction and chemistry, but... no lightning bolt from the heavens.<eos> Nothing like that.<eos> I've seen it.
Pizza and--<eos> -Pizza?<eos> -I'm jealous.<eos> Pizza and a burger.<eos> Arisa made it for me.
Mm. No hits from ballistics.<eos> Autopsy turned up something.<eos> What?<eos> Both Donnie and Megan were missing a fingernail.<eos> They didn't lose it in the crash?
Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, you don't know what happened to all the TP, do ya?<eos> The what's that?<eos> Had a case of TP in the back last week.<eos> Somebody took it.
Okay, eating Chinese takeout with a severe food allergy. I'm gonna go with "Suicidal" for $1000, Alex.<eos> The EMTs already pushed 5 milligrams of epinephrine.<eos> Yeah? Anyone bother to tell them that's a lot of adrenaline for a girl this size?<eos> They had trouble maintaining her airway.<eos> That is why they call it severe anaphylaxis. And from the looks of things, she couldn't care less whether we save her or not.
What's "the contract"?<eos> I won't repeat myself, you know what I think.<eos> I read that letter dozens of times.<eos> I had people read it to me. I copied it by hand.<eos> I gave it to 3 graphologists.
It was, like, 50 pounds of pork and whatnot.<eos> Never seen my mom so happy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thing is, when I was sharing it out, there was, like, 15 pounds of prime angus beefsteaks in there.<eos> And I kept it all for myself.
He looked for them for a long time.<eos> Should've hired a P.I.<eos> Wendy sent her evidence to the general company inbox.<eos> Interns check that.<eos> What if I didn't catch it in time?
Yeah.<eos> - Bye, Joshua. - Oh.<eos> Bye.<eos> So let me get this straight:<eos> the preacher has a vision and you all just... follow it.
I'm sorry.<eos> I still don't understand why child services was called.<eos> Before we get into it, I just wanna say that this... is a safe zone.<eos> And that's why I brought... the share clam.<eos> If I pass it to you, share how you're feeling.
Yeah, but they died a year ago.<eos> Check it out!<eos> Porno mags!<eos> Gimme the beer.<eos> Fuck, man, why didn't you hand me it?
Keep the spatula on the bottom of the pot.<eos> If they burn now, they're ruined.<eos> Keep it straight.<eos> Move it quickly.<eos> Dorft stir it so hard.
Zak.<eos> He's practically 'ohana. Why?<eos> They make this macadamia nut malasada that Kono loves.<eos> I want to get her a box.<eos> But the thing is they only make it once a year.
Ma'am, I said all we got is vanilla.<eos> - You okay with that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's my favorite anyway.<eos> Okay, I'll bring it over to your table.
You don't believe that he is legally negligent.<eos> You just think he's politically offensive.<eos> I think he's both.<eos> He's making it possible for anyone to make an untraceable, untrackable gun.<eos> - Who do you think will use it?
I mean, you go to a barber, you're going to get a haircut.<eos> You go to a bar, you're going to get a drink.<eos> I like to think of drug companies as motion picture makers.<eos> They've decided, I've got this movie I'm going to show you guys.<eos> I'm going to show it to you so often, that you're going to internalize it, and at some point if you get one of these afflictions, you're going to say,
My heart. Oh, what's wrong?<eos> Sweetheart, Where's your medication?<eos> Nightstand. Where do you think?<eos> Oh, he left his medicine on the nightstand.<eos> Why would you leave it there? [Groans] Hello? Hello?
- This one...<eos> - Don't touch it.<eos> Now, Vegas PD, they tell me they're gonna bring me to the courthouse right from the hospital.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> I took all the cords plugged into my hospital equipment, and I put it together into a rope, and I swing down from the second floor, and I've been on the run ever since.
Come on.<eos> You can crash at my place.<eos> My father picked me up from school one day, and we played hooky and went to the beach.<eos> It was too cold to go in the water, so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza.<eos> When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand, and I dumped it on my bedroom floor.
What is this?<eos> That is a box with a bomb in it.<eos> Yup, I've handed out about 100 of them today.<eos> It feels so good to give.<eos> You see, right now, there are 100 random children who've each taken home a box just like that one and are shoving it under their Christmas tree.
I thawed some out after you fell asleep.<eos> I needed something to... dredge us out of this funk.<eos> That stuff is contributing to the funk, trust me.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Burke was clear about returning the evidence in the same condition we got it in.
But I want to look in your safes.<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> The police are already there.<eos> We have a search warrant.<eos> Either you open it, or we take with us safe.
With a second gun I just happen to be carrying?<eos> We both carried a second piece back then, Marty.<eos> And according to the lab results, that gun lacks wear and tear consistent with a weapon that sat outside on a roof for the last 15 years.<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> Somehow, I get my hands on this piece Grazioso stole, use it to pop Green, then hang onto it for 15 years
Maggie!<eos> Napkin diaper nut cups.<eos> What?<eos> Napkin diaper nut cups.<eos> You fold the colored napkin up, you see, and then you hold it together with safety pins,
I'll let Genevieve push you. It'll be safer for you.<eos> Hey, you want your bell back?<eos> Keep it.<eos> As a souvenir.<eos> Oh, my bags are packed. I don't know where I'd put it.
He drives an '81 Toyota Corolla.<eos> What?<eos> I've got the, uh, license plate and VIN right here.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm sending it to you now.
- GIRL: Ha-ha. Nice backpack.<eos> - Kim, you hear that?<eos> A girl giving another girl a compliment is never sincere.<eos> No one ever had a nice backpack. Come on!<eos> There's gonna be a girl fight, and you are gonna break it up.
Have you got details of the probate?<eos> Yeah, it's just here.<eos> There.<eos> Yeah, it comes with a few hundred acres of scrub.<eos> Granddad's had it since the '50s.
Things like breaking into the phone company to rewrite the code on their servers and give myself free unlimited service.<eos> Swapping out my pre-burned SIM cards everyday at 6pm is a small price to pay.<eos> I don't care about privacy.<eos> Or social status or accumulating stuff.<eos> I don't care about the law or who makes it.
You have to listen to me.<eos> I have seen this disease before.<eos> I have faced it before.<eos> You... you must contain it.<eos> You've seen it before?
Granite counters.<eos> Stainless steel.<eos> - Do you cook?<eos> - Not really.<eos> What's really funny is that the people with the nicest kitchens they're the ones who actually use it the least.
Pay attention tonight.<eos> I'm gonna teach you a few things.<eos> The first is called a pattern interrupt.<eos> The brain has learned certain actions like shaking hands or tying a shoe as one single motion.<eos> If you interrupt it in the middle, the brain can't pick up where it left off.
I'm starting to feel the urge.<eos> I go to get you a bottle of water, and... tell me how many bottles do you see in the fridge?<eos> None. The door's blocking it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which means Anita, Sam, or Dwight couldn't have seen it, either.
I know Lynette worries.<eos> Don't talk about my mother! Oops! One of the nurses found our blood.<eos> She put it in the bank.<eos> She thought someone had misplaced the bags.<eos> Well, dammit, you better get it back!
Apparently there is a N.A. sponsor-approved plan... for when someone in recovery is injured.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> It's pretty simple.<eos> I get a prescription for pain medication from Coop.<eos> You hold it and you administer it.
- Do you think that...<eos> - I do.<eos> "With family."<eos> She was bringing the tape to you... maybe to give it to your father for safekeeping.<eos> Which means she would have had it on her when she was killed.
Let me tell you something about my daughter.<eos> She left that boy out there with me when he was still in diapers.<eos> So she could run around and have a good time.<eos> And she never tried to contact him?<eos> Well, she'd send a birthday card when she remembered, but I never showed it to him, because what good would it do?
Where is the key?<eos> Where is the key to the other box?<eos> Tell me..<eos> Shoot him down.<eos> Tell me. - No, I don't have it.
She's a glamorous one!<eos> Thought he'd be more macho.<eos> I guess all men need excuses.<eos> I don't see any drugs, sir<eos> I don't think he'd keep it at home.
Yeah. I don't know what else to do with it.<eos> Fucking leave it here.<eos> No.<eos> They'll throw it away.<eos> Let his family claim it.
Great!<eos> They're not showing up, are they?<eos> I don't think so, no.<eos> I wrote a novel and still there's no response from him.<eos> He's barely literate, so who knows if he could even read it, but if he did manage to sound it out, it'd just be nice to hear that he was proud of me.
I kept Henry afloat long after his wars plunged France into debt.<eos> I am aware of the Crown's debts.<eos> But not how in debt it is to me.<eos> I heard about the execution.<eos> If Lord Narcisse demanded it, those men are certainly innocent.
You're not my type.<eos> Ok, then...<eos> You can party with someone YOUR TYPE.. ...and, I'll find someone MY TYPE to party with.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've heard amazing things about the night-life in Paris.. ...but never seen it.
I think people would rent anything with a cover that interested them.<eos> It wasn't about studio, it wasn't about movie star, it wasn't about budget.<eos> When you're looking at a shelf, it's very democratic.<eos> The best cover catches your eye.<eos> One thing I do, is go to video stores whenever I'm in them, and find the movie, and I pick it out, and I put it flat so it's facing front.
You would protect us, wouldn't you, if the Germans came?<eos> Of course.<eos> How does Hankin get the casualty list before The Times, Edmund?<eos> Wrong question.<eos> WHY does he get it first?
And Dan was notoriously pa--no.<eos> Paranoid about the location and protecting his stash.<eos> So I'm assuming that your lead is the other half of that puzzle box?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> I managed to trace it to a black market dealer in antiquities, and I finally convinced him to let us buy his half. Ha!
Boot production.<eos> I have plans.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> I'm going to make boots with flaps over the lace-holes and double tongues so no water can enter.<eos> I think three years would be the life of such a boot and then... at the end of the three years, we'd clump it.
Give it up for the joneses!<eos> Relationships are hard.<eos> Especially when you are married to a man who doesn't shower and hangs out in horse stalls.<eos> A man who lets a raccoon eat your very, very, very expensive wooden shoes just to prove a point.<eos> A man who borrows things, like your... buggy, and then loses it after drinking too much... Spirits.
Great news.<eos> Chloe's gonna be fine.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The surgery took a little longer than expected.<eos> There were some complications, but Chloe came through it like a trooper.
I'm just saying the professor can't get any more tied up, and we can't get any less than an "F", so let's just take a beat and think this through.<eos> Okay, this is way better than Die Hard in a restaurant.<eos> So what exactly is your plan here, Mr. Winger?<eos> I mean, I'm certainly not gonna change your grade, and it'll take several days to starve me as I really loaded up on that dreadful tapas.<eos> Oh, but you already have changed it, professor.
You see that pretty confluence of good sweet-water streams?<eos> Well, it ain't much, but it's on my land.<eos> My husband left me all of this when he passed in '62.<eos> Well, it may be your land now, madam.<eos> But the Union Pacific Railroad will reach it before the year is out.
Your plan was simple... hire Shane to steal the phone, that way, you can get in to the studio.<eos> The one thing that you didn't plan on was holly.<eos> She showed up and caught you just as you were leaving the studio.<eos> You couldn't risk her exposing you.<eos> She pulled out her gun to protect herself, but you managed to use it on her instead.
Yes, but we still don't have any hard evidence on him.<eos> Well, it's a start.<eos> Pick it up again in the morning.<eos> See if you can get a confession.<eos> OK. Oh, and the video camera, there was a bit of damage but I managed to transfer it to stills, I put it up on the board.
Right above the bubble tray.<eos> Someone opened it.<eos> Are those guys gonna blow up all of our evidence?<eos> Not all of it.<eos> Whoa! Bomb squad managed to separate the non-explosive parts from the bomb, served it up for us to analyze.
Is there any chance she could have scored the drugs in here?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I try not to hire too many drug dealers.<eos> Get me a list of employees, anyway.<eos> I'll have Felicity cross reference it for drug arrests.
Helen's a wonderful girl.<eos> Would you know if there's any firearms kept on the premises, Mrs Cartwright? Oh... Mother had a pistol.<eos> For vermin.<eos> Squirrels and the like.<eos> I haven't seen it in years.
Which leaves a window for our killer to get in and out of the R.V. without him noticing.<eos> That's evidence, not lunch, and it was in Jimmy's mouth.<eos> And this was under his lip.<eos> Bar-code sticker.<eos> Supermarkets use it to track produce.
Even the slightest hope of a miracle keeps their faith alive.<eos> Only to be crushed when their prayers go unanswered.<eos> If this is what your people need, then I--<eos> [LADY CAMDON] What our people need is hope.<eos> And you can give it to them.
It's a term to describe a particularly aggressive species.<eos> It's odd to...<eos> Odd to see them here.<eos> They're not native to New York.<eos> It's almost as if someone has placed it here on a route known to be frequented by Hillary Taggart.
Okay, don't react, because he's not exactly in a state to come back to the precinct yet, but we found Gabe.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Sorry, not reacting, it's just... Joe's been giving me crap all day, like this is my fault.<eos> What were you supposed to do, guard the 47th story window?<eos> Well, he's just stressed out and taking it out on me 'cause he thinks he can.
What happened?<eos> It just fell by itself.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> ...and to him, it's the mark of when we are truly alive.<eos> Why don't we put it back together?
You're actually good.<eos> How about Kiko's job offer?<eos> What's the dog's name?<eos> The masses never really created history.<eos> There's always someone who determines it.
Hey!<eos> In truth, Tamara had no need for the potion, but still, she was eager to possess it.<eos> She is not sick.<eos> She is actually after the magical abilities this man has.<eos> Now that I have it,
Really?<eos> Does everyone agree with yours?<eos> It's not his and mine.<eos> Everyone has an opinion.<eos> We haven't heard it, but I'm sure they do.
Which is either a weird coincidence since Ethan wrote this song in law school, well before he met you, or he knew your brother first, served with him in Iraq, which you failed to mention.<eos> Sorry, detective.<eos> The reenactment's about to start and I still have to find my jacket and get ready.<eos> Oh, yeah, about that.<eos> I kind of borrowed it so we can do some tests on the buttons.
Please, there are no good shoes east of Italy.<eos> No, you know, I'm just researching some issues, seeing where the other City Council members stand.<eos> I'm guessing they stand right next to mommy. What is that?<eos> I'm taking a five minute break from work and checking out this app thingy.<eos> You know it takes a picture of two people and merges it together to show what their baby would look like.
Someone wearing a janitor's uniform, used a stolen key card to access the evidence room archives.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> Why ask me?<eos> It's the physical evidence from the Clyde Ritter assassination.<eos> - I didn't steal it.
[Grunts] It ended up being a lot heavier than we... Than we imagined, you know, having to lift it up.<eos> And dad was disabled, so I was worried about him.<eos> Dad. I got this.<eos> So Sean put the box up into the loft area.<eos> We didn't want anybody stumbling onto it and being able to get in and take my guns.
- Neal.<eos> - Hello, Rebecca.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> I swear, I had my key card when I left work.<eos> We figure out what's hidden in those pages and get to it first.
But we've been doing it tough.<eos> Len threatened to tell Mrs Stanley we'd found the gold seam if Nicholas didn't let us take half for ourselves.<eos> And then Isobel tried to blackmail him about the past with her letter.<eos> That £200.<eos> Nicholas gave it to you?
-Why not just answer "yes"?<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> Why not just answer "yes"?<eos> We have security measures when it comes to biochemical materials.<eos> -I do not know if he has taken it out.
- We know what did it?<eos> - Preliminary assessment says the weapon had heft and a sharp point.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, first thing we'll need is a list of her appointments yesterday.<eos> I already asked her supervisor to send it over.
Newspapers are very good for cleaning mirrors.<eos> Useful if you've got a lot of mirrors to clean, I suppose.<eos> Ah, the loft hatch is there.<eos> I'll have to move some stuff to get the ladder up.<eos> So long as you put it back in its proper place.
Material we care about is hidden.<eos> Routine examination by the police won't reveal it, but our client wants it secured.<eos> Then how am I supposed to get access to it?<eos> It's in evidence lock-up.<eos> Then you steal it or you pay someone to hand it to you or you burn down the building.
- Yes.<eos> - Jamie.<eos> You suffer from depression, but you're on medication.<eos> And I know a doctor...<eos> He'll backlog a prescription, make it look like you've taken it forever.
And this door has been forced open.<eos> Thievery!<eos> Cousin, phone the police.<eos> This is my shit!<eos> You sold it to us.
Naked.<eos> Of course.<eos> You're sure there were four smokestacks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw a distorted version of it when I read Fallon, and then I saw it
But fungi can also be very sinister.<eos> This caterpillar has a fungus growing from its head.<eos> It's a species of Cordyceps, a tropical fungus that has developed a gruesome power.<eos> They can infect the brain of an animal.<eos> One infects ants and causes ants to climb up a grass stem, tamp its jaws on the top, and there, high up on the plant, the fungus kills it.
And c batteries for Robbie!<eos> - You wanna ask her?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Cat, why do you have a giant box of c batteries?<eos> 'Cuz I "tapped it"!
I've seen guys waiting around in the evenings.<eos> No!<eos> You live in a house full of beautiful paintings.<eos> And you stick this crap on the wall!<eos> So what, as long as I like it?
She's not in right now.<eos> What's this?<eos> Discovery request.<eos> Parsons is demanding you hand over the Samurai information.<eos> So she didn't buy it from him after all.
Behave yourself.<eos> - I guess you didn't read my note.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I read it.<eos> Both sentences. Each so terse, I figured you must have written it at gunpoint.
Great that you two... Really.<eos> Well, I won't bother you...<eos> Just wanted... to return your keys.<eos> I left a few things in the basement. It was left when I made the bomb.<eos> Is it okay, if I... get it?
Marnie, you can't mother her like that.<eos> I'm not mothering her.<eos> I'm literally preventing a disaster from happening.<eos> Have you even read her novel?<eos> It's a memoir, and of course I've read it, I'm her best friend.
Lights out, girls.<eos> Holmvik.<eos> You shut down that party?<eos> Oh, hey, Lance, yeah. Dude, I went in there, and I was, like, "Who's clapping?<eos> Why are you clapping?" Then I heard music, and I couldn't find it at first, but then I found it... I shut it off, so we can hit the hay.
Absolutely.<eos> A meeting today still works.<eos> 2:00 p.m. is perfect.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know that you have my fingerprints on file, but if you should need a blood sample, I'm happy to provide it.
And my price is $22 million.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Your favorite nightmare.<eos> Should last about an hour.<eos> - How do I stop it?
At the east end, there's a passageway leading into the palace.<eos> Go pass the palace towards the east gate where there are no soldiers.<eos> Once you exit, Byeol Ip Si will catch up with you.<eos> Just pass the letter to him.<eos> Have you handed it to them?
Previously on Weeds.<eos> Gentlemen, I sell marijuana.<eos> The profits are almost instantaneous.<eos> We can funnel it wherever we need it.
- Debbie Weaver, a woman to be avoided.<eos> - Totally. - Yes!<eos> - That was my takeaway.<eos> But I have heard her story.<eos> And I would tell it to you now, but it's incredibly depressing, and I don't think you'd handle it.
Is this a trick?<eos> I don't do tricks.<eos> My milieu is the impossible, the unbelievable, the unfathomable.<eos> Now, please, all I ask is that you take a card and you sign it.<eos> Right, now, look at the card, and without showing it to me, you're going to rip it up into pieces and you're going to feed it to me.
Some of the stuff I can't get, some I can.<eos> I'm on the trail of a next-gen weapon right now.<eos> I was gonna pick it up this week in the Caribbean--<eos> St. Lucia.<eos> - And when you get it?
You can go places and talk to people we can't.<eos> Without you, he's as good as gone.<eos> Come on, you better get outta here!<eos> Meet me in the catacombs tomorrow morning if you're willing to do the right thing.<eos> Just go through the storm drain, you'll find it.
You're kidding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Already sold nine trees.<eos> Yeah, it's the first night, and I'm getting the stinkeye from the other salesman, Jose.<eos> He only sold six, but the guy crushes it with wreathes.
Daryl gave us those... his brother.<eos> Not sure I'd call him a friend.<eos> He is today.<eos> This doxycycline might have just saved your life.<eos> You know what Merle was taking it for?
But I did find dry blood on the floor.<eos> It was underneath the carpet.<eos> I spoke to the landlord, and he said that the carpets were installed in '95, which is after Harris went to prison.<eos> How much blood are we talking about?<eos> There were small stains on the baseboard, like somebody missed it when they were cleaning up.
Don't know the basic rules of the game!<eos> Killing someone should solve the problem.<eos> Not give rise to one.<eos> First, the guy who planted the bomb was caught.<eos> Now, the one who supplied it.
But I trust this too.<eos> Look, if I'm going to get killed, Annie, which at this point is fairly probable, then I have to get my story out.<eos> I have to.<eos> I made promises, and I want to keep those promises.<eos> How do you know they'll print it?
Hey, it's Fred!<eos> My life is a horror movie!<eos> It's so scary!<eos> I'm so scared!<eos> And you'll be, too, once you hear about it.
Scare-arr-red!<eos> That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined.<eos> Which is what you'll be.<eos> I'm gonna go get a snack.<eos> Do you want to hear about it or not?
And, there was a great deal of, I suppose, what we call decadence, but, of course, I didn't see any of that.<eos> I only saw the horses.<eos> Woman: Mrs. Vreeland had her own view of history.<eos> She would pick up certain characteristics of an era<eos> and perhaps magnify it too much.
You're the best teacher I've got.<eos> Can you make it to the service stairs?<eos> I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.<eos> Why don't use the old entrance?<eos> They closed it down a few years ago.
It was an entrapment, and they don't have a case.<eos> I'm still good to defend.<eos> He stole the hard evidence.<eos> He should've submitted CCTV file as evidence.<eos> We were going to, but he contaminated it.
Much better than this, of course.<eos> So where's all your stuff?<eos> If by "stuff" you mean my life's work, my genius made manifest, my exquisite symphony of scientific innovation--<eos> Yes, that stuff--<eos> The bastards stole it.
Let's order our favorites.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... You know what?<eos> Why don't you order it?
They must've realized the guns were junk.<eos> Junk that somebody is selling.<eos> It's a business.<eos> If someone sees these guns<eos> As a chance to make a buck, they'll take it.
Ape-walk!<eos> It's about throwing out a precious family heirloom!<eos> That wasn't an heirloom.<eos> Your Uncle Don got that bassinet at a garage sale.<eos> He only gave it to us because he wanted you to hug him.
Got any more ammo?<eos> I'm low.<eos> Yeah, we got plenty.<eos> Just run back past the zombies.<eos> It's in the van, where we left it.
There is a hat!<eos> Are you fucking me around?<eos> How will I look without a hat?<eos> Maybe you won't loose your fucking brain without that hat.<eos> I haven't got it, I didn't fucking get it.
So, Amita and I have a Bayesian filter, a spam filter, if you will.<eos> We set it loose in the message boards with the post about Don's gun.<eos> This message thread is for people who can't get police help-- cases of harassment, abuse.<eos> Yeah, by estranged spouses, business disputes, neighborhood conflicts.<eos> Right, we took the membership list, cross-referenced it with police reports, and got a high score on this name.
It was me, I gave it to her.<eos> What?<eos> You what?<eos> Cook, Cook dealt me the powder, that was it.<eos> I needed the money, and I just sold it to some random.
Yeah, to record my patient notes.<eos> You gave it to me...<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Yeah, the box that I brought in from the landlord, She said that her tenant had left things behind.<eos> What if he left it behind because he died?
"I said a lot of things to my friend, "but the one thing I never got to say was... Goodbye."<eos> Stop!<eos> I know what really happened.<eos> You do?<eos> I left a bag of chips near my bed. The raccoon must have smelled it. It's my fault he's dead.
She strolls the same area, but she doesn't know anything.<eos> She knows where to get a good hamburger.<eos> You ever have a burger at that place?<eos> They make them by hand, fresh meat.<eos> Versus places where the meat's rotten and robots make it?
Oh, okay, why don't I help you with that?<eos> Oh.<eos> I also have a spider bite on my tushy.<eos> She's so fantastic, I didn't even interview anyone else.<eos> She just knocked it out of the park.
White wine has less alcohol.<eos> Ooh, thinking wine.<eos> What is keeping bobby down?<eos> Maybe he's down Because his retirement plan is to die "early."<eos> Plus, on his boat, he has to keep his cholesterol medicine In a lockbox so the rats can't get it.
'Cause we have a crafty witch on our side.<eos> You discussed it with Bonnie.<eos> She agreed to anything she could to help us.<eos> It's Katherine who has the moonstone.<eos> She's not going to give it to you.
I don't think the post office put that there; this is one of those augmented reality tags.<eos> What is an augmented reality tag?<eos> This marking...<eos> Mm-hmm? ...it acts as a bar code.<eos> You hold it up to your Web camera, and certain Web sites recognize it and put all kinds of fancy 3-D graphics on the computer screen.

That tent. There it is.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Katie and Rachel, by the skin of your theeth, you are still in this race.<eos> You are team number eight.<eos> You played it real close.
There aren't any to wash yet.<eos> Let's talk food!<eos> Oh, I get it... hazing.<eos> Okay.<eos> And where would you like it, Mr. Duvane?
And for the Framingham police department.<eos> It makes it bearable.<eos> Well, you take care of your own.<eos> The plan for today Is to do the definitive repair of his mandible.<eos> It was shattered. So take those pieces, align them, And plate it in place
The big secret is, of course, what the people do there.<eos> And that's one of the things they will not talk about.<eos> PENN: And it's all this secrecy that creates the speculation.<eos> I believe that our government is using alien technology to build craft that behaves like alien craft, and they're using it for our own military purposes.<eos> And they test it out there in Area 51.
-What about the one in my hand?<eos> -It's fake.<eos> Liar!<eos> How can you say mine is fake?<eos> Because I was the one who switched it.
-Love you too.<eos> Mom, you do so much for us and not just at Christmas.<eos> And we really need to tell you more and how much we appreciate it. So thank you.<eos> Joy, we know how important Christmas is to you because we're so important to you.<eos> And you mean so much to us. You don't have to worry about this being our last, best Christmas. Because we have made the Robertson family demands and we have all signed it.
- I know.<eos> Is this all the candy you have?<eos> Uh, did you order more candy?<eos> Order?<eos> I thought the big truck just brings it.
9:00.<eos> If Kim Dong Seok is really coming to the ski resort, he'll probably attend, don't you think?<eos> He didn't come to ski, but probably came to see that.<eos> This brand obtained almost all of Grace Kelly's clothes.<eos> Even now, there is a limited edition of the Grace line, and apparently, the women are crazy about it.
I was waiting for you.<eos> Look, the photo of the blondes.<eos> - Give me my money.<eos> Look how good they are.<eos> Did the photographer give it to you?
Excuse me ladies and gentlemen.<eos> After twenty seven years in China... May I tell you if there's room for a hundred thousand chinese... And there is also room for twenty thousand.<eos> This is the least of our problems.<eos> What people need now is food and shelter.<eos> And it our task to provide it.
Gentlemen.<eos> We've turned this place upside down.<eos> If he did kidnap her, he must have taken her someplace else.<eos> Yeah, H, the pictures that Wolfe took--here was a box of Mylar heat blankets in Sheridan's car; we haven't found them anywhere on the premises.<eos> Mylar-- he may be using it to hide her. Check it out.
Looks like a wig.<eos> That is a magic wig.<eos> It changes the identity Of the dead.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I thought that's why You were putting it on The bodies at the morgue.
So looking younger could be a side effect.<eos> Pretty sweet side effect.<eos> Yeah. Well, that was the good part.<eos> The bad side effect was heart Num.2.<eos> I mean, theoretically, if you take a hypodermic syringe, filled with 19 different stem cells, you inject it directly into an organ, there's a chance it can overload.
Can you hear me back there?<eos> Natalie, hi.<eos> You look very nice today.<eos> I have lost my wallet.<eos> So, if you've seen it, please return it to me.
No,no,it's okay.<eos> At least it's not wicker.<eos> Excuse me a sec.<eos> Okay,I am going to go to the pharmacy and get your medicine.<eos> If you get it from Russell, count the pills.
Please.<eos> If you'd let me get a word in edgewise, I would've told you, I've already talked to my lawyers.<eos> I'm in. I want to invest.<eos> We're working up a proposal right now.<eos> I'll fax it to you in the morning.
I'm like a dolphin.<eos> no. forget it.<eos> no, I saw it.<eos> I saw freedom and autonomy.<eos> I had it in my hands.
I understand.<eos> And honestly, I'm not some Ivory Tower English-lit snob.<eos> Yeah, I beg to differ.<eos> See... I read your short collection of even shorter stories.<eos> - Ambrose left it for me.
- What's that make, nine?<eos> - Ten.<eos> How pathetic is that old bag?<eos> Ramirez pretends to be jaded, but she's got a secret stash of bodice-rippers in the van.<eos> - I've seen it.
- Oh, um, she is at a sleepover.<eos> Well, then let's get you naked.<eos> Peace offering.<eos> Corn bread chicken casserole.<eos> Momma used to bring it to the neighbors to make peace after Landry and Duke let their pigs out.
That was good of Dr Verrity to go public in our favour.<eos> Helps us.<eos> Yeah, yeah, till they get a look at the surveillance.<eos> It was trashed.<eos> I've already given it to Internal and Glen told them he found it at the mall.
Murli, you will call him and ask hi m to come meet you tonight below Rama bridge at 9:30.<eos> - Okay sir.<eos> As soon as Captain leaves the hotel.<eos> Simi, you by any means possible will get hold of his room keys.<eos> And hand it over to me.
And a young girl inside the freezer.<eos> And they accidentally locked up the door.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I've kept the key for you, do you want it?<eos> I am sorry, I failed to hold it.
I tried to tell you since March, but you didn't listen.<eos> Yeah, sweetie, but we do what teachers say here.<eos> OK, I thought you paid attention to the kids.<eos> That thing about participation and stuff, blah, blah, blah...<eos> Alright, let's do something. If you don't like it, you beat it, OK?
No, she's worse.<eos> You know, she'd really like another chance.<eos> Sam... I have a letter for you from your birth mother.<eos> I guess she's been sending them to the store, Hoping that i could help her get in touch with you, And somehow they ended up in junk mail.<eos> Yeah, i don't want it.
The sardines fall back on their instinctive defence, swarming into a huge mass that confuses a predator.<eos> But the dolphins have a strategy that turns this to their advantage.<eos> Working together, they separate off a pocket of sardines.<eos> In smaller numbers the fishes shoaling defence now works against them.<eos> The dolphins corral the bait ball and herd it to the surface.
No, I'm doing academic research, on my behalf, and, if I have time, baby boy, yours.<eos> Hey, Lucas, you've got family.<eos> ..likewise, after supper, He took the cup.<eos> And when He had given thanks to Thee,<eos> He gave it to them, saying, "Drink, ye all, of this."
- I'm gonna divide the house.<eos> The tablet!<eos> Okay, sure, you can have it.<eos> Just tell me who the boss is and I'll give it to you.<eos> Or should I give it to Kahmunrah? He's your master, right?
The game is called table tennis not table volleyball.<eos> Greg, you know where this is gonna end.<eos> Whoever saw a tennis court without a net?<eos> A little run-down park across from my apartment, growing up.<eos> Three courts, no nets, no one ever used it.
- Coke, dust, smack...<eos> - Ari, no!<eos> No, I took a sleeping pill.<eos> - Or maybe two.<eos> - Why didn't you take it at home?
- Yeah, clear in here, too.<eos> - You guys. Look what I found.<eos> - Jenna's comp card.<eos> - Comp card?<eos> Yeah, agencies use it to get models work.
Why is that?<eos> Does he bring 'em food or something?<eos> Better.<eos> He's got water.<eos> How's he bring it to 'em?
Check it out.<eos> It's identical.<eos> - it's a box designed for a professional keyboard.<eos> It's got two rows of keys.<eos> That's why the box has two levels. - can we trace who bought it?
One of our chickens?<eos> I give you one guess.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Shambo's feeding it.
Just kidding. That would be weird.<eos> - It's your porn collection.<eos> - It's my porn collection!<eos> I'm giving you my porn.<eos> Now that things are so great with Robin, I don't need it anymore. Wow.
And it's funny, because I didn't see this once... a woman coming up to a bar likeshe's looking for someone and then leave.<eos> Karaoke never fails...<eos> A Japanese that's being cheated on goes to the karaoke to sing "Ronda".<eos> And if you ask Ana to show you... people in bars ask for music in the napkins.<eos> So she keeps the requests in a brown paper bag... and brings it home.
The three of them always on the rug.<eos> Incredible. They threw their toys on it.<eos> It was a mystery to me, why they always stayed there.<eos> So one day I moved it.<eos> I put it in the hallway.
One that's made of gold.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - We have no golden ones.<eos> - No?<eos> We heard that you had it.
Come and get it.<eos> Come and give it to me.<eos> And the bag.<eos> There's a credit card missing.<eos> We used it on the arcades. we'll pay you back.
Let's see. Today's Thursday.<eos> Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo's.<eos> Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll bring it to your place.
My friends, my colleagues are free to do business or to not do business with whomever they please.<eos> But it is fascinating, don't you find?<eos> To see people operating on the basis of something other than the pursuit of financial gain.<eos> The company is ruined. Ruined!<eos> If you're no longer interested in controlling Darling Enterprises, I will buy it back from you at its current market value.
Oh, my god, it's real.<eos> Please, please! Can I?<eos> This section here was not on the photographs.<eos> We must decipher it.<eos> OK, now what happens is you give it back to me.
That's more of a hobby.<eos> Any second now, my alarm will go off and it's my second day at Park Vale - a new school with your dad as Head Teacher.<eos> Anyone would have nutty dreams.<eos> All right, this is what we do.<eos> When aliens come to Earth, and they do, all the time, if they're friendly and they need help, we give it.
How it tells now?<eos> We've... different backgrounds.<eos> I didn't say that words because I was afraid of this moment happening.<eos> With my personality, my word is my life commitment.<eos> Although I didn't say it,
I devoted myself to him. To raising him in fear and trembling, away from the sins of his father.<eos> Enough of your piety!<eos> I have, today, placed in the hands of Amy Dorrit, a letter.<eos> I want £2,000 today before the Marshalsea bell rings.<eos> If I have it, your secret will be safe.
Got trace off their shoes.<eos> Found identical trace at the warehouse in brooklyn.<eos> You were right.<eos> They're here for their coke.<eos> I told hawkes to take the test samples back to the vault, and then seal it.
Because mine's more accurate.<eos> I mean, does saying, "grasping at straws" tell you if they're made out of paper or glass or metal or polystyrene?<eos> No!<eos> I pride myself on the accuracy of my forensics, and lawyers...<eos> lawyers are questioning it!
I started to take an interest in samba... ever since I moved to Mangueira when I was 11.<eos> I got there... and I already was a Bohemian at heart.<eos> It was in my soul, in my blood. My dad played cavaquinho in Catete.<eos> I saw people playing samba, but I was still a kid, I couldn't butt in.<eos> I appreciated it from a distance until morning came.
[ Earl Narrating ] After /'d left the warden's... / went to f/nd Frank's old stealing'buddy.<eos> Paco, I didn't know you knew how to write music.<eos> Turns out it's easy.<eos> It's just dots and lines.<eos> When I get out of here, I'm gonna find someone to play it for me.
Please, thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's no rum in this.<eos> Yeah, that's a little game we play with the bartender.<eos> We ask for a rum punch with extra rum, he makes it with no rum.
They all died.<eos> Burned to death in a fire.<eos> What did these people believe?<eos> They believed that a messiah would return from the dead and lead the world to salvation.<eos> Not the proudest branch on my family tree, but people are interested in this stuff, so I keep it around.
It won't do at all.<eos> I have known Junaid since I was a child but we're barely on speaking terms any more.<eos> Nevertheless, the Commissioner feels and I agree, it might be best if you took some time off.<eos> A holiday.<eos> You look as if you can use it.
20 000 plants is a huge day - they are absent from the street and out of the hands of children.<eos> Cops won 1 - 0<eos> Sizes war against hard drugs, I do not care about it, but - seems ridiculous that marijuana is illegal at the federal level.<eos> It works.<eos> If people say that it works and helps, why deny it from them?
A small fish store in the dusk.<eos> Touching...<eos> Then you go home, prepare the clam soup and eat it.<eos> Oh, there's sand in the clams.<eos> Didn't he get rid of it?
Kid that age-- ain't easy surviving' a brand-new culture.<eos> And you would know?<eos> My dad-- he came here from Cuba when he was 15.<eos> This type of thing changes a person.<eos> We, uh, Photoshop her picture with Amish clothes, recirculate it, maybe get lucky.
So damn stupid.<eos> You're not, Francine.<eos> Whatever happened, you're not stupid.<eos> My mind hasn't been so sharp since I had the baby.<eos> And Carlton gave me a stack of mail, and honestly I think I just threw it away.
Mmm, I think I'll stick with these, thank you.<eos> - Did the pizza, I did the drinks...<eos> - You got ONE pizza?<eos> - The queue, the queue was...<eos> - Don't give it to them, give it to us. Oi, Dad!
Then he can do nothing.<eos> The Mayor will never admit we had that conversation.<eos> - I fear that this is not in the Minutes.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I have wrote it down.
-Hurry up.<eos> -Hey, hey, what are you doing?<eos> Dumbo, don't bruise the fruit.<eos> It's a product.<eos> If you bruise it, then no one will want it, okay?
If you master my 117 steps to dominating your employees, I personally guarantee you will have a team of little killer bees ready to live or die at your command.<eos> You can make them work for 72 hours straight at a time, especially if you put crystal meth in the water.<eos> Now, some of you may be asking, "isn't crystal meth illegal?"<eos> Technically, yes, but the U.S. Air force uses it to fuel their pilots when they're on night missions over Afghanistan.<eos> So it can't be that illegal if the U.S. Air force uses it.
Oh, Τracy!<eos> Yοur husband says there's a picture οf him hοIding sοme trοphy that yοu still have?<eos> What picture?<eos> Ηe has eνerything.<eos> Ηe claims it's his faνοrite picture, and you put it up where you stοre yοur suitcases.
I'm not leaving.<eos> Oh, Larry, come on!<eos> Private, I'm giving you an order.<eos> I think you guys forgot what our orders are.<eos> We're supposed to bring freedom and democracy to people that need it.
We've been taking steps to encourage that.<eos> You still paid Megan's bail.<eos> Well, yes, that may seem contradictory.<eos> You're not intending to stump up ã25,000 for David, are you?<eos> I know he's asked his father for it, and I don't doubt that he's asked you too, Mrs Mostyn.
Secondly, the key to my shed.<eos> My own key? - Your own key.<eos> Do not lose it.<eos> And thirdly, a list of things to be getting on with.<eos> I want you to read it to me now, so you'll absolutely know what's to be done.
Unless there are body parts in the bag, Mr Croft, I really recommend that you do.<eos> Confiscated.<eos> All this filth.<eos> I can't even put it in the bins.<eos> God knows how the boys manage to get hold of it.
That's the kind of legacy that lasts.<eos> Well, we've gone through all the books at school... and all the books here... and you can't seem to find anything that you're interested in.<eos> There must be something that you want to be able to read.<eos> Well... when my pa dropped me and Jacob off at the orphanage... he pinned this letter to my dress.<eos> - I was supposed to give it to 'em, but I kept it.
I'm keeping secrets.<eos> You might as well ask me to play a sport.<eos> So, how fun was that Egyptian pottery?<eos> The funnest.<eos> And that short film on how they made it? So interesting and...
I want to be the first to know.<eos> So hang in there, okay.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Nurse wells, bring me the bone marrow results for patient vasco.<eos> Perhaps i left it in my office.
You take a cheap bottle of wine with the right shape, you steam the label off, you slap on an expensive label,and you're done.<eos> and boom.<eos> Julian feeney.<eos> Busted for drunk driving.<eos> Now,the only reason his prints would be under the label is if he's the one who switched it.
I'm taking your picture.<eos> Smile.<eos> Can't sell that to you.<eos> What, you're not gonna sell it to me 'cause I'm crippled?<eos> No, I'm not gonna sell it to you 'cause you're 17.
Through the workings of the nervous system... and the particular way that it implements quantum effects- very distinct specific way... not general not fuzzy not imprecise- that it absolutely does open the door... for free will being a possibility... that does not violate modern scientific tenets.<eos> And that's consistent uh to a certain extent... with people's subjective impression that we do have free will.<eos> What separates us from all other species... is the ratio of our frontal lobe to the rest of the brain.<eos> The frontal lobe is an area of the brain that's responsible for firm intention... for decision making for regulating behavior for inspiration.<eos> It is the seat of what causes us... to take information from our environment... and process it... and store it in our brain to make decisions or choices... that are different than the decisions and choices that we've made in the past.
And they come to our parties.<eos> Maybe one of them was put off by being referred to as a target.<eos> We should take it to the lab.<eos> Mr. Reynolds, we're going to need your clothes for exclusionary purposes.<eos> Just make sure I get it back... this is my lucky shirt.
'Cause you're stuck with that amount of time for that activity for the rest of your marriage.<eos> You couldn't possibly be enjoying that donut.<eos> - Or that one.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> Then why are you eating it?
The "Puzzle Palace"?<eos> Look, if y'all still wanna jump in and help, I'm fine with it.<eos> That's about all the okay you need in my house.<eos> The Stricker Street situation is waiting in the office.<eos> Neighborhood squabbles, and my babies bring it in here.
So?<eos> Merrill gave Danforth some of his grunt candy.<eos> It wasn't grunt candy.<eos> The bottle was empty.<eos> So, I swabbed it and I ran it through the mass spec.
I am not an oaf.<eos> Chittering monkey, in the spring he climbs treetops, and thinks himself tall.<eos> You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.<eos> Whole seasons are spent mastering the form, the style, none calls it easy!<eos> I calls it easy!
Who has the creativity, the skill, and the drive to win Top Chef:<eos> Just Desserts?<eos> ♪ Top Chef: Just Desserts 1x02 ♪ Cocktail With a Twist Original Air Date on September 22, 2010<eos> Seth and I immediately formed a quick bond here in the house.<eos> Yo, can you throw me my hat, dude, if you see it somewhere?
It's disgusting. I mean, kids really don't even care about Rock 'n' Roll as much as they used to.<eos> As the other generations have.<eos> It's already turned into nothing but a fashion statement and an identity for kids to use. It's a tool for them to fuck and have a social life.<eos> And at that point, I really can't see music being of any importance to a teenager, really.<eos> I think they have just sounds and tones and use it in their virtual reality machines and just listen to it that way and get the same emotions from it.
It's just another kind of water.<eos> This is a halocline - a meeting of fresh and salt water.<eos> Fresh water from the jungle flows over the heavier salt water from the sea.<eos> The saltwater layer is extremely low in oxygen making it a particularly difficult place for animals to live.<eos> Yet some have managed it, like the remiped, one of the most ancient of all living crustaceans.
And there's a bloodstain on her clothing that matched Eglee's blood group.<eos> Yeah, but Yorkshire never followed through with the DNA because by then,<eos> Dr. Hill had got a full confession out of Eglee.<eos> So, we should do the DNA test now.<eos> Well, we need a sample, but he's unlikely to give it up easily.
It crosses all continents and has struck them all.<eos> One of the elements feeding it is poverty.<eos> Terrorism is a danger not only for Africa but for all of us.<eos> We want to fight it.<eos> And the fight against terrorism cannot succeed without the defeat of poverty and without giving hope in life to those who have lost it today.
I am so clearly more qualified than Doug Wilson.<eos> They all take stripper fitness class with Doug's wife, Dana.<eos> It's a whole bonding thing.<eos> Stripper fitness class?<eos> Kenneth doesn't like me to do it, 'cause he thinks I'll go lesbo on him, like when I took folk guitar.
Evening...? I'II settle it in an hour.<eos> Give me Rs. 10000 extra.<eos> - Rs. 10000?<eos> Won't you give me?<eos> I'II give it right now.
No.<eos> What's all this?<eos> Oh, some boy wrote Julie a note.<eos> It's all ripped up.<eos> Oh, she didn't want me to read it.
Yeah, hey, you know what, I don't blame you.<eos> The rock and roll legend hasn't written a half-decent song in ten years.<eos> Well, I got some bad news for you, rock star.<eos> I can prove I wrote that song.<eos> I made copies of the sheet music, sent it to myself, registered mail.
- All that?<eos> - Too much time.<eos> 12 days in Brasília, what do you want?<eos> No, let me do it!<eos> I got it, I got it.
Real Italian rolls, prosciutto, provolone...<eos> How far is Atlantic City from here?<eos> You have one day to live, and you want a sandwich?<eos> People on death row get a last meal.<eos> The state provides it.
Let's hang up.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> -You sent your family away?<eos> -They needed a little peace and quiet.<eos> -Who doesn't? -You won't have it if you stay here.
Don't subpoena Elliot Dasher.<eos> Anyone remember what we're looking for?<eos> Anything that ties Pruitt Fashions to dangerous working conditions at Hong's Fabrics.<eos> How do we know that what we're looking for is in these boxes?<eos> Because they can't risk violating the subpoena, so they swamp us, hoping that we'll give up or miss it.
Women...<eos> Children...<eos> I was the director of a company importing medicine... from Switzerland to Albania.<eos> Medicine that had expired.<eos> We put new labels on the boxes and sold it again.
Did you say a paralysis drug?<eos> When I was in Hanyang, a series of rapes were carried out by upper-class philanderers.<eos> They used this drug to paralyze women.<eos> Originally it was used by Japanese doctors for surgery.<eos> The young men bought it from Japanese diplomats at a high price.
I said he was not a photographer, he didn't do free-lance. "Where is he?"<eos> "At work, at TV Educativa." They asked for the address.<eos> "l don't know the address.<eos> I know how to get there, though."<eos> "Don't worry, we'll find it." They left, I called Vlado.
What?<eos> - This is interesting, Angela.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Does Booth know how this works?<eos> This computer program which I designed, patent pending, accepts an array of digital input, processes it, then projects it as a 3-D holographic image.
The Tinsleys died at home... alone.<eos> So, where's the gun?<eos> I went shopping.<eos> Bought every brand of hot dog for sale in Las Vegas.<eos> Who's paying for it?
Okay, show me what you got.<eos> Okay. Lifted prints off the gun I found in the car.<eos> No match in AFIS, but found traces of flesh under the nails of "the hand."<eos> Rick Amadori's hand.<eos> We sent it to DNA.
I'm Victor's cousin.<eos> Niece, I'm Victor's niece.<eos> So what do you do with that computer?<eos> And how did you get the password?<eos> Uncle Victor gave it to me.
What we having?<eos> - Shall I order us some champagne?<eos> - No, it's not appropriate.<eos> We'll have a lager.<eos> We'll have a lager each, down it and go home and watch telly.
My father. That he'd throw me out of the house.<eos> I knew I couldn't take care of a baby on my own.<eos> There are legal ways to terminate a pregnancy.<eos> Did you consider them? Yes.<eos> I tried to buy the abortion pill, but the pharmacist wouldn't sell it.
I mean, you're gonna need backup.<eos> - Let me rephrase that.<eos> - Thanks for the pizza, boss.<eos> - Thank the night shift.<eos> I swiped it from them.
She never loved me<eos> She was right it would have been better if I had never been born<eos> But then, I would never have known you would I?<eos> You have filled my life with joy<eos> But you have changed my life, too Esther, let me go on now, or I shall never manage it
See, Jessica.<eos> Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patterns of bright gold.<eos> Is not the smallest orb that you behold but in his motion like an angel sings?<eos> Such harmony is in immortal souls.<eos> But whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in,
How'd he manage that?<eos> He didn't know it was his first time!<eos> Goodbye<eos> This trash...<eos> I'll throw it out at home
If this works, I'll happily make your sick little fantasy come true.<eos> Uploading Rambaldi's equation now<eos> Oh, hey Syd<eos> Uh, listen, have you seen a USB key with a Speed Racer logo on it?<eos> Oh, it happens to have every single picture we've ever taken of Mitchell on it and well, I brought it in here to make duplicates, and of course, the genius that I am, I forgot to make a backup copy.

- Since when are you against leather?<eos> - You're not even a vegetarian.<eos> I'm not against the insides.<eos> People need meat to survive.<eos> You are aware they don't remove it from the cow surgically, right?
Well, I'm not sure of the best way to process the print.<eos> - You take digital photos ?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, hand them over.<eos> I'll load it into the computer, reconstruct the image while you finish processing.
But that's in the past, you know what I'm sayin?<eos> I did my time.<eos> Well you're about to do some more.<eos> I'm sure you're aware 10Large has a restraining order against you Mr.G?<eos> And you violated it.
Well, that's it, spanky.<eos> We's brokah than a newscaster of the same name.<eos> I guess that was our last pizza prank.<eos> [gasps] wait!<eos> Yo, princess, if you're looking for the pizza, You're too late. We ate it already.
But everyone knows she's done it with an Alsatian!<eos> OK, I think it's time to go now.<eos> I was going anyway because I well hate this shop!<eos> Bethany got a Saturday job here and someone found a dead rat in the chocolate raisins.<eos> Someone bought it and ate it and came back and said, "Have you got any more chocolate rats?"
Any ideas who could've done this? No.<eos> God, no.<eos> Do you have the address?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll get it for you.
There are people here expecting you to play.<eos> So what?<eos> Who's gonna know the difference?<eos> You've already got two acts and a DJ, right?<eos> I'll figure it out.
Unbelievable.<eos> Four yards, and I cash huge.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do - to those guys? - What?<eos> I'm gonna find out where they live, and I'm gonna set their houses on fire.<eos> And then when they ask me to put it out, I'm gonna say, "I'm sorry, guys, but I only brought four yards of goddamn hose. "
We can have someone read it for you.<eos> No.<eos> I showed it to someone, and they didn't think it was any good.<eos> Well, criticism can be difficult to hear.<eos> You may have interpreted it in a different way than was intended.
I have temporal lobe epilepsy.<eos> - Pernell--<eos> - No, listen.<eos> Before you speak, just let me say something.<eos> Napoleon, Julius Caesar, George Gershwin-- they all had it.
Your will be done.<eos> Water's perfect. You coming?<eos> I haven't been in the pool in five years.<eos> That's a fucking shame.<eos> People lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
Huh? You know how much I did without him?<eos> You think he had his hand up my ass making this city work?<eos> - Dad, I'm not sayin' that. - What are you sayin'?<eos> What are you sayin', boy?<eos> You sayin' I can't sit in this chair without some asshole pulling it out for me?
- I know where to get some.<eos> You achieved glory by killing a load of fascists, then just walked away.<eos> I left when it was over.<eos> Glory only lasts a second.<eos> I experienced it and then I split.
- He'd kill you.<eos> I know, but it makes me feel less alone.<eos> Hold out your hand.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Where did you find it?
How big?<eos> There's a safe.<eos> It's full of cash<eos> There's got to be $100,000 or more.<eos> I'm going to get somebody to open it this morning so I can clock the combination, and then I got an appointment with Mr. Success at 2:00 this afternoon.
Cap's right.<eos> Nobody asked you, no-neck.<eos> The protomolecule.<eos> What are we going to do with it?<eos> Simple, we stick it on the end of a torpedo and we fire it into the sun.
And until we do, that is too important to destroy right now.<eos> Well, I'm not keeping it on the roci.<eos> I won't take that risk.<eos> I sure as heck don't want to share a bunk with that.<eos> -Hell no. -Then we'll hide it.
So that, my hungry friends, is a kamal family recipe.<eos> It's a staple of the mariner valley.<eos> Now, granted, we had to improvise a little bit, without any real cheese, or wheat, or tomatoes or anything.<eos> Damn, Alex, you're getting us really excited about this lasagna.<eos> Now, don't go judging it before you taste it, earther.
How?<eos> By pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> "Appears to be."<eos> The evidence is more than credible.<eos> Saul calls it conclusive.
Uh, sure.<eos> I was thinking of how long it had been since I heard your voice.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> I was thinking of how long it had been since I heard your voice, and then I heard it.
- I am in the neighborhood.<eos> I gotta say, you picked an odd time for it.<eos> It appears Iran is violating the nuclear agreement.<eos> The evidence is more than credible.<eos> Saul calls it conclusive.
I got a call from the FBI to meet them at our office, and they showed up with warrants.<eos> Wait, what's going on?<eos> Back up.<eos> The van that delivered the bombs--<eos> Sekou was driving it.
I've got meetings this afternoon all the way up to the director, and all anyone will want to know is how that shitbag who we had in lockup got released to the streets.<eos> So, what are you gonna tell them?<eos> Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released.<eos> So I need to know-- That recording.<eos> Where did you get it?
- Well, right.<eos> But...<eos> The problem is, they know it must have come from the NSA.<eos> Your organization's gonna be looking internally, so it's not gonna be enough just to say that.<eos> I didn't give it to you. Really.
There's a whole bunch of things I can't say except in person, but you need to know something.<eos> About the recording I played you, that we were discussing earlier.<eos> What about it?<eos> It didn't come from my source.<eos> I don't understand. How did you get it, then?
I don't understand. How did you get it, then?<eos> That's just it-- I don't know.<eos> There's some third party involved.<eos> I have no idea who.<eos> But whoever it is, they delivered it right to my desk.
May we?<eos> Could we have some privacy, please?<eos> I'm sure you can guess why I'm here.<eos> My deposition--<eos> You want to know why I didn't go through with it.
Who's making you surf?<eos> My job.<eos> You're a professional surfer?<eos> No, I'm a writer writing about surfing.<eos> Although, what if the piece was about how I went out to the beach, hated it, went back inside, and never came out.
Fiske?<eos> It is true, Lord, we heard it from traders.<eos> Where are these traders?<eos> We heard the same story three times, five times...<eos> We heard it three times.
I thought they had gone, you see?<eos> Gone with everyone else.<eos> I never even considered searching for them.<eos> If I had...<eos> I took the cross from the chapel and brought it out there... To mark the place where they died.
And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and Putt-Putt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I... I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.

I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.<eos> But then the ball went into the aisle... and this usher ran down and grabbed it and he picked it up, and he just squeezed the air out of it.
Why would he wanna do that job?<eos> Why would anyone?<eos> Because if he doesn't... that ball is gonna go onto the field... and it would be fucking chaos.<eos> You can take the van.<eos> I don't need it anymore.
I lasted two hours.<eos> And then I went to a spa that cost $2,000 a night.<eos> I hated our house.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I mean, I didn't say anything because it was your money that bought it.
In a world full of orphans, they still had each other.<eos> And I was a ghost.<eos> I was a ghost who had no place there.<eos> And that, Kevin, is when I changed my mind.<eos> The physicists who sent me through told me the first person to use the machine was the guy who invented it.
That took a long time, too.<eos> But I found him and I asked him to make another machine because he already knew how.<eos> And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.
I called your father up in Montana.<eos> Still no answer.<eos> We can talk about that later too if you'd like.<eos> Look, all I wanna know is you come back here held up everyday, ...you don't speak to anyone Emilia, do you even want our help?<eos> I said I'd get my own fucking water if I needed it.
We were, he left the construction site heading east, but we lost him on 13th.<eos> I found out why Bin-Khalid's people wanted the strongbox.<eos> Inside there was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells that Bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.<eos> It looked like 15, maybe 20 cells but I didn't have the list for very long.<eos> He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
Thanks so much for coming.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears.<eos> Bin-Khalid's people... They found us.<eos> They killed the rest of the squad.<eos> There was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells, along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.<eos> - Are you saying Grimes still has it?

Take Agent Fox with you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> According to Carter, the list of sleepers is on a USB flash drive.<eos> We can't move in until we confirm Grimes has it.
I wasn't at campaign headquarters then.<eos> I take a run every morning at 6:00, right after I pray.<eos> I never miss either one when I'm in D.C.<eos> Show me your route.<eos> We'll see if we can confirm it.
The terrorists got away with the list.<eos> One of the men was Jadalla, Bin-Khalid's son.<eos> We have the list.<eos> It's a sign we're on a righteous path.<eos> Rebecca, the list of sleeper cells... the terrorists have it.
I just heard from Keith.<eos> An operation Eric Carter is running has turned up a promising lead.<eos> We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help.<eos> CTU's launching an operation.<eos> Keith's asked if I'll oversee it with him.
We're taking out Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Jadalla's flash drive is damaged.<eos> He told me to bring someone who could fix it and he's... He kidnapped my wife and my brother as leverage.<eos> I'm going with Carter to Jadalla.<eos> He thinks I'm gonna repair the flash drive, but I-I wrote a virus that'll destroy it.
What's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The same thing that made me... run the streets.<eos> The same thing that made me pick up a gun when I was 12, with my brother and his crew.<eos> I just... I'm still holding a gun, I'm just pointing it at different people.
This is where I do all my reading.<eos> I don't use the ballroom at all.<eos> You'll have to redo the floors.<eos> Laundry room.<eos> You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.
She left with an escort hours ago to make the exchange.<eos> You let her leave?<eos> Your men need to know my wife is not to be harmed. _<eos> English, God damn it!<eos> Even if that order could be given, no one would heed it.
I opened the gates for you.<eos> Handed you this victory.<eos> Your men need to know my wife is not to be harmed.<eos> Even if that order could be given, no one would heed it.
Woodes Rogers bears debts he cannot hope to repay.<eos> Given the ruin Nassau lies in, those debts could be purchased for a mere fraction of their value, for pennies.<eos> You could own Woodes Rogers and see him imprisoned.<eos> Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders, her real property could be bought for a song.<eos> I bring you the chance, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that runs it, and do it all while seeing justice visited on your granddaughter's murderer.
Do you know who I am?<eos> You're part of Long John Silver's resistance.<eos> I am Long John Silver.<eos> The resistance in the interior... I built it.<eos> I led it. It was mine.
But she'll keep on calling you.<eos> And when she does, you'll step into that painting and feel the swell beneath your feet.<eos> It'll all come back as if it were like yesterday.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I've watched you and yours handle the account since I and mine left it.
I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, it has over a million views.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You haven't watched it?
- I'm sorry.<eos> Assistants are stationary.<eos> - And you come and go like a tornado.<eos> - But... you need a woman researcher.<eos> This research is for women, and I know why I'm doing it.
Good morning.<eos> - Morning. The whole of it?<eos> - Everything.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Don't you sort it?
And the best thing is it gives me access to the world's most fascinating people.<eos> Like our next speaker, the finest performance coach there is.<eos> I'd advise you to give her your full attention.<eos> But I don't have to.<eos> She'll get it.
That's a lesson you only have to learn once.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I need to deploy your specialized computing skills, can-do attitude, the magic of your tech nerdistry.<eos> No one's ever said I have a can-do attitude before.<eos> That's because you hide it behind a superior, dismissive, and pessimistic mask, but I see past all that.
Right now, I'm just asking how your roach came by my car and what you might know about how my tire came to be flat.<eos> - Guys.<eos> - Well, I'm stumped, Officer.<eos> Tell you what. If you Agatha Christie yourself to the bottom of this, you come back here and tell me who done it.<eos> Meanwhile, why don't you take that roach and shove it up your ass?
- Guys.<eos> - Well, I'm stumped, Officer.<eos> Tell you what. If you Agatha Christie yourself to the bottom of this, you come back here and tell me who done it.<eos> Meanwhile, why don't you take that roach and shove it up your ass?<eos> - Shove it up my ass? - Yeah.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - We all forget things sometimes.<eos> No, the combo is a mashup of the girls' birthdays.<eos> I remember the day we chose it.
Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford Team, predicted that within a generation few compartments of the intellect would remain outside the machines' realm and that the problems of creating artificial intelligence would be substantially solved.<eos> We're no closer to catching this bastard, and now the whole world knows about it.<eos> We'll have every nutcase and lunatic in Oxford to claim responsibility and no way to sort the wheat from the chaff. Tessa!<eos> Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?
- Home. He was feeling under the weather.<eos> Gibbs said Dr Gould told him to reset JASON the night before the tournament.<eos> Yes, JASON had been behaving erratically.<eos> It's standard practice.<eos> You close the machine down and restart it.

- Their name was King.<eos> - How does that get you to Castle?<eos> What he wrote on the wall.<eos> Rook takes Knight.<eos> Rook is the proper name for the chess piece, only some people call it a Castle.
It's okay.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> How?<eos> We got the mountain bike in the back.<eos> - I'll take it.
Oh, and do you have any of those, um, how do you call 'em?<eos> Those... Islam head-cover thingies?<eos> - A hijab?<eos> - Hmm. How the fuck do you know the word "hijab"?<eos> 'Cause I learned it in church.
I guess.<eos> Have fun storming the castle!<eos> What... what castle?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You get the credit card, and you swipe it through there, and then...
Preparing to receive these samples... has been the purpose of our mission these last few months<eos> But the pilgrim capsule is damaged<eos> At 0630 UTC...<eos> Pilgrim was struck by debrief and we had off course<eos> Rory Adam whose space walk.. established visual contact with the incoming space capsule. he'll grab it with the remote arm
Like a bird.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I don't hate the chair.<eos> I love it.<eos> For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.
Come on, Miranda, get going.<eos> Initiating manual override<eos> This is Dr. Miranda North, Black box recording, in case of death upon re entry.<eos> The creature killed four of six ISS astronauts<eos> With fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumably dead, carrying it out into deep space.
Thanos possessed a lot of powerful artifacts, but nothing capable of this kind of mass shifting.<eos> Who cares?<eos> It's ours now.<eos> I do not know my purpose, but I am certain it is not to be a thief.<eos> We're only stealing this rock back from whoever stole it from Thanos, who probably stole it in the first place.
Get out!<eos> Mrs Kevecki...<eos> You... promised... to protect Teena.<eos> You promised justice.<eos> And we're gonna get it.
- Shut up, dipshit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she, she made me a pie for...<eos> Go again?<eos> I didn't eat it in time so the candles had melted.
Hi, how are you?<eos> Good. You?<eos> Good.<eos> Can I taste that lasagna?<eos> No, ate all of it.
Sorry nothing. Let's go to the police.<eos> They don't have security cameras.<eos> Did he try the "Find your iPhone" app?<eos> Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.
They don't have security cameras.<eos> Did he try the "Find your iPhone" app?<eos> Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.<eos> Uh... He turned it off because it'd be expensive for international data.
"He made sad noises while I sucked him off."<eos> And all of a sudden, she has something to write about.<eos> She has a story... she has an experience, okay?<eos> She has something that makes her different from every other creative writing undergrad that was bussed in from Virginia.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying about experience... the way people crave it and the way people use it?
You're copying the entire universe?<eos> ...symmetry down to every last quantum particle with one crucial difference.<eos> The echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds.<eos> Instead, it will be a lifeless cosmos providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power.<eos> Acting as a dimensional conductor the tower will create multiple gravity portals which will harvest the echo's mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy.
Just plug it in?<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> There's a terminal at the base of the echo tower.<eos> You jump over, take the box to the tower, plug it in and jump back in time for dinner.
You're above it all, are you?<eos> And why should I tell you where she is if you're only gonna kill me anyway?<eos> Did you think about that, Sheriff Lonely Heart?<eos> Listen to me, you piece of shit.<eos> I-I don't know what kind of sick fuck digs his mother's body out of a grave and moves it around, okay, and I don't want to know about it or what you did to it.
But even that mistake should be one... that you never tire of.<eos> Today she is Mrs Nair.<eos> A mother, a daughter-in-law.<eos> But to me, she's still my Bindu.<eos> She still comes into my dark life and brightens it.
John!<eos> Right. Now that we're all here, let's get on with it.<eos> By now you all know my obsession with time travel.<eos> Yes, how is your novel coming?<eos> Have you finished it yet?
You've taken this too far.<eos> And once you leave, can you come back?<eos> We don't want him back.<eos> The safety lock automatically returns the machine to its starting date, unless you have this key to countermand the device.<eos> Have you taken it for a testrun?
Some form of insight into how we're related.<eos> When you showed up in my life all those years ago, I didn't believe you.<eos> But I did what you said.<eos> I looked for the time machine.<eos> And I finally found it in your basement at 10 Mornington Lane.
Thanks for coming, but I'd rather be alone.<eos> He started touching my legs to take the ants off and he pulled my skirt up.<eos> I was hysterical because I hate ants.<eos> And he knew that. He was making it all up.<eos> In fact, he took a photo and said if I didn't undress he'd post it online and my parents would see it.
What about the fraud case?<eos> - Was it true?<eos> - I don't doubt it.<eos> It's fraud.<eos> First, he makes an inter-community acquisition in which there is a tax on consumer spending that is also deducted. When the merchandise enters the interior market, it has the output tax which gives the buyer the right to deduct it, but then he pays it...
Tell me the fuck who!<eos> Bitch been stealing my scores like white people been stealing from us since the beginning.<eos> Ain't nothing new here.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do though.<eos> I'mma grab her blonde hair and rip it out of her cracker-ass skull, 'cause I'm Minerva!
Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope.<eos> I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
We will, when he finally turns up!<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, Justine!<eos> I think I left my camera bag here.<eos> Well, let's see if we can find it, shall we?
Would you like coconut water?<eos> - That depends.<eos> I prefer fish milk. - Uh...<eos> All right, then I'll drink your coconut water.<eos> But you better believe I'm gonna pretend I'm sucking it from a fish's udder.
Is everyone okay?<eos> Just me and the big guy.<eos> There's a little doodle of a door on this wall.<eos> Do you guys see a lever on your side?<eos> I see it.
What's going on, everyone?<eos> The Undertaker saved me from death.<eos> Ironic.<eos> Where's your board?<eos> You destroyed it when you bumped Tank into Joe.
The diameter of the hammer's head suggests it was the same one used on Margaret Kwan.<eos> The size of the fractures are identical.<eos> However, the extent to which Mike Reiss was tortured far exceeds what was done to Margaret Kwan.<eos> Margaret's torture appears to have been an effort to obtain information.<eos> Once the killer had it, he quickly ended her life.
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?<eos> I'll make sure everything's okay back here.<eos> Tom, what the hell happened?<eos> Two gunmen ambushed the safe house.<eos> How the hell'd they find it?
Well, yeah.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> His hearing is in two weeks.<eos> You and Cam threw out the only evidence we have that would exonerate him.<eos> Well, we threw it out because your evidence was suspect.
Maybe a pipe, or a baseball bat?<eos> Until the skull's reconstructed, there's no telling if this beating was cause of death.<eos> The cell phone's motherboard was partially burned by the fire.<eos> So, what are you doing with the heat gun, burning up the rest?<eos> No. The hot air isn't gonna hurt it.
Uh... okay.<eos> Sounds... sounds serious.<eos> Do you like being here, Mr. Bray?<eos> Yeah, of course I like being here.<eos> I need you to answer a question, and answer it honestly.
The CIA has no Intel on this guy.<eos> Appears to be homegrown.<eos> We recovered a smartphone on him, but it's locked, and the tech company's putting up a legal fight.<eos> They aren't gonna give their help.<eos> We don't need it.
Did I think about killing him?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was... It was a genius move.<eos> But you made it very clear during the generals that you did not want my help.<eos> I didn't need it.
Uh, you mean, like, when you look at a light bulb and when you look away you still kind of see it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there's this more extreme version called palinopsia.<eos> It literally means "seeing again."<eos> I mean, the image just stays with you... And you see it again.
And I'm going alone.<eos> I'm surprised you called me.<eos> Well, someone had to call someone.<eos> I need a tissue sample from a body.<eos> I was hoping you would go in there and get it for me.
- Hey.<eos> I talked to Ali.<eos> I thought you would.<eos> And I think you can expect an apology from her.<eos> I don't need it, and I don't want it.
I'll show you.<eos> She's always brushing her hand up against Chelsea's thigh.<eos> Always?<eos> That was Coach Fields' first meet.<eos> I-I don't know why I can't find it, but if you saw this photo you'd understand why everyone's so uncomfortable.
You can't spell anonymous without A.D.<eos> Well, technically, there's no 'D' in anonymous but, whatever. I get your point.<eos> Are you sure that it's legit?<eos> The post has been re-blogged at least 500 times in the last half hour.<eos> I mean, what if Claudia Greco actually reads it.
They both think that Mary Drake made this special delivery.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> I-I just...<eos> Mary wrote this letter that makes me cry every time I look at it.
I sent that letter to you for a reason.<eos> Poseidon was monitoring my communications with everyone who could possibly be a resource or an ally, but not with people I despised.<eos> Give it to me straight...<eos> How you really feel about me?<eos> I figured if I showed grace to a man who'd never seen it before in his life, maybe he'd be grateful, do something for us.
Well, now, aren't you a sight?<eos> You're sure no one followed you?<eos> I've been avoiding trouble since well before you were born.<eos> Now, where's that little girl?<eos> Did you find it?
Hayley.<eos> You looked for five years.<eos> You found nothing.<eos> Suddenly, I get word of a lead.<eos> What if someone else found it, too?
You'll be okay.<eos> - You're gonna sleep, anyway.<eos> - Yeah, I'm tired.<eos> There's a bedpan here.<eos> So, if you need it...
He may know where Rip is.<eos> SIGINT has him headed to a meeting in Lagos Harbour.<eos> All right, White Squadron, we're on the hook for this.<eos> Sir, my team wants that mission.<eos> I already tasked you with it.
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.<eos> You think I care?<eos> Go!<eos> Open the door.<eos> I said open it!
The wives are coming over soon to prep for tomorrow.<eos> We could use a little help.<eos> I packed up most of his stuff from his cage.<eos> So much crap in here.<eos> Wonder why he kept it.
You don't believe me, I don't care.<eos> Why were you in New York yesterday?<eos> You're following me now?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
Oliver, I told you...<eos> Nate's on it.<eos> Okay, but if he doesn't find him, I have another idea.<eos> Kiddie porn.<eos> I read that the Russians put it on their enemies' computers.
Salamanca money!<eos> - Salamanca blood!<eos> - You have to calm down.<eos> That hacienda!<eos> I paid for it.
These people trusted you, Jimmy.<eos> Do you have any idea how much time I had to put in... listening to their incipient ramblings about their sciatica... or which grandchild disappoints them the most?<eos> Damn right they trust me.<eos> - I worked my ass off earning their trust.<eos> - Then you betrayed it.
You've got the rest of your life to at least try and earn that forgiveness.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Good place to start is wi' t'truth.<eos> I have told the truth.<eos> And are you still tellin' it now, in here?
Are you sure? Is everything okay?<eos> Really. Yes. We're fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, let me get Mike's bag.<eos> No, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it tomorrow.
Back in the city... I told you you would die.<eos> We will both die out American!<eos> Turns out that gas station outside Sana'a had a computer with Internet access.<eos> He sent this image from Yemen. Why?<eos> We're gonna find out as soon as as soon as we talk to the guy he sent it to.
Steganography is the practice of concealing information in the code that makes up digital files.<eos> Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.<eos> He's probably thinking if anyone sees this, this'll be as far as they'll look.<eos> But I'm already going inside the image, breaking down the data<eos> - that comprises it.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you falling asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, but... we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee... went bold with the extra salsa... and he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant... and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?<eos> Under his seat, between his legs.<eos> Nobody touched it.
There's not much we can do to improve the outcome.<eos> Sometimes patients partially or completely restored. But usually worsens the condition gradually.<eos> Are you saying that she can become blind?<eos> Permanent blind?<eos> I'm sorry, Mrs. Andrews, but I do not know. There is a great risk that she loses sight and will not get it back.
Are you right or left handed?<eos> -Right.<eos> -Perfect.<eos> Then lift your right hand like this.<eos> And move it outward to get him to move forward.
I'm gonna go down there. I'm gonna talk to it.<eos> No.<eos> You're not.<eos> We're going to shoot it, and we're gonna keep on shooting it.<eos> And if that doesn't kill it, we're gonna force it out the way it came in.
We just lost sight of it behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, aft.<eos> There's no good camera on that position.<eos> Keep moving to your left.<eos> It has to be down there.<eos> We would have seen it if it moved.
The device it tore out of its chest was a Fail Safe Regulator, some kind of command and control module.<eos> Control module, my ass.<eos> That was an incendiary device, you understand?<eos> A bomb probably designed to destroy that thing in case it got out of control, all right?<eos> And I wish we had known about that thing inside it before it ripped it out of its chest!
I'll hold it as long as I can.<eos> Go to the airlock.<eos> I'm not leaving you two.<eos> Your power armor is in the skiff.<eos> Why would you bring it?
It stopped digging.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It's heading back for Holden.<eos> If I can get my gun...<eos> We hurt it the first time.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Do not come any closer.<eos> I swear I'll lock it down for good.
Do you think that you could throw me in one of those cargo lockers?<eos> Maybe rough me up a little?<eos> Just so they don't think, you know.<eos> You just happened to have a nuclear warhead lying around?<eos> We took it out of a torpedo a while back.
Just so they don't think, you know.<eos> You just happened to have a nuclear warhead lying around?<eos> We took it out of a torpedo a while back.<eos> A good Belter never throws anything away.<eos> So we'll carry it out onto the hull until we get close to the cargo bay.
You just happened to have a nuclear warhead lying around?<eos> We took it out of a torpedo a while back.<eos> A good Belter never throws anything away.<eos> So we'll carry it out onto the hull until we get close to the cargo bay.<eos> And then I'll pull the shielding, and you'll throw it out away from the ship.

I think we've stopped.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You're sure it's gone?<eos> Damn straight.<eos> We stripped it right down to its nuclei.
Guns.<eos> Railguns.<eos> Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.
It's already scattered too far to ever be sure it'll all be gone.<eos> It's part of the equation now, and it will be from now on.<eos> We can't change that.<eos> We can't wish it away.<eos> Earth has it.
It's part of the equation now, and it will be from now on.<eos> We can't change that.<eos> We can't wish it away.<eos> Earth has it.<eos> Mars has it.
We can't change that.<eos> We can't wish it away.<eos> Earth has it.<eos> Mars has it.<eos> And the Belt needs it, too.
Did you know that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was just writing him a letter in the car ride on the way back.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> You don't mind if I read it to you.
Oh! Getting a little ahead of yourself. Aren't you, mister?<eos> Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?<eos> Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary. - And now I'm very careful.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - No, it's just easier if I type it in.
- Hey.<eos> - Are you not gonna correct her?<eos> - That's close enough.<eos> I don't wanna go to swim class.<eos> You have to go. We already paid for it.
When I was in college, I went to this party and I got, like, super wasted, and then everybody started daring me to... - take a shit in my hand.<eos> And, um... I did.<eos> - I... I took a shit in my hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
I... I know plenty of Downworlders who play by the rules.<eos> They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even... Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?<eos> No matter how good they try to be, Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Previously on Shadowhunters...<eos> Valentine wants to use the soul sword to decimate the entire Downworld, and he needs Clary to activate it.<eos> I'm losing my patience.<eos> - Simon, drink.<eos> If Jace touches the sword, his grip would destroy it.
Jace's plan is gonna work.<eos> Let's move!<eos> Jace!<eos> It'll kill you!<eos> He activated it.
Where to, Cap?<eos> All right, we're here.<eos> Get to the cargo bay.<eos> Ray, do not crash my ship.<eos> You break it, you buy it.
I don't do feelings.<eos> Run the test, fix my brain.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> Sara asked us to find any physical descriptions of the spear that might help us find it.<eos> She thinks Rip had it with him when he traveled to 1967.
Grey?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Brain surgery, what does it look like?<eos> - It's down there somewhere.<eos> - Good. 'Cause you'll never find it.
And if I didn't make it, I don't know how it works.<eos> Oh, you know enough about it to alter what it does.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You want me to alter it.<eos> Well, what do you want me to alter it into?
Fuck him.<eos> I'm so tired of his shit.<eos> He loves telling that stupid fucking story.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I feel like I'm the one who told him to tell it, so...
Listen, I wanted to tell you that, um...<eos> Jesus asked me to read the letter that you wrote him.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Not for me.<eos> He asked me to read it because his head hurt and his eyes were tired, and...
Birds don't type.<eos> So Jesus didn't read my letter.<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> - He definitely didn't read it.
- because he can't read.<eos> - What's that?<eos> It's the letter Emma wrote to Jesus.<eos> - What are you doing with it?<eos> - Emma didn't want anyone else finding it.
I'm done with secrets.<eos> Oh... so now you're done with secrets.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> What was this letter doing in your pocket?<eos> Emma asked me to take it so no one else would read it.
Oh... so now you're done with secrets.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> What was this letter doing in your pocket?<eos> Emma asked me to take it so no one else would read it.<eos> - Who's read it?
- Has Jesus read it?<eos> No, j... just me and...<eos> Grandma.<eos> - Grandma?<eos> - She read it to Jesus because
- Okay.<eos> - I just... I just found out, and I thought that you guys should know.<eos> - Did Emma tell you?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> Um, she wrote me a letter, but I couldn't read it.
Stadium's in the Glades, babe, in like the worst part of the worst part of town.<eos> I brought it with me last time I took Zoe.<eos> So you're admitting you broke the rule?<eos> Kind of what I do, babe.<eos> The only reason I agree to let you keep that thing in the house is because you said we needed it for home protection.
I don't think that will work.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> You said the hatch was titanium, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
The chemicals Sampson stole are more refined than the ones Justin Claybourne used and could produce a biological agent a thousand times more powerful.<eos> - And without a cure.<eos> - How would Chase distribute it?<eos> It's aerosolized, so pretty much any way he wants.<eos> We have to find out where Chase is storing this thing and stop him before he releases it.
- That's interesting.<eos> - What?<eos> - It looks like the second mark of belial.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Well it's rare, in all my life I've only seen it twice before.
- How's that?<eos> - You never faced anything like it before.<eos> Have you?<eos> - No.<eos> - So how are you gonna stop it?
Okay.<eos> You want me to call the archdiocese?<eos> - So, let's go through this one more time.<eos> - There's nothing father frank or I can tell you, that isn't on that camera.<eos> If you can find it.
We have waited too long to choose King Gareth's successor.<eos> No one can convince the King to stop searching for his son.<eos> And to give up hope that Walter might be reconciled to take his place as rightful heir.<eos> Walter is not coming back, Brother Osmund.<eos> If His Majesty dies today, the land has no crown, and no dragon to defend it.
I hope that thing does what we think it does.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?
How much do you know about the stick that he used to heal me with?<eos> Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?
Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.
No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.<eos> Kind of forgot I had it.<eos> Nick left it on the bed when he got out the stick to heal you.
It's Lake Lyn.<eos> The Lake Lyn?<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Because Jace requested a portal to Idris this morning.<eos> He thought he might have a lead on Valentine, but the Clave denied it.
The Clave is trying to prevent an uprising.<eos> If the Downworld finds out that we don't have the Soul Sword, there would be total chaos.<eos> But the sword's been deactivated.<eos> It can't be used on Downworlders.<eos> Not in the way Valentine used it before.
But the sword's been deactivated.<eos> It can't be used on Downworlders.<eos> Not in the way Valentine used it before.<eos> But it's still a Mortal Instrument.<eos> If you combine it with the other two Mortal Instruments the cup and the mirror he could use it to raise the Angel Raziel.
But this isn't murder.<eos> He killed himself.<eos> What?<eos> How can you tell?<eos> The blood from his eyes, I've seen it before.
Welostapod !<eos> Miller: I need these scientists alive!<eos> Nothing happens to this guy!<eos> The protomolecule wasn't sent here by accident.<eos> If we master it, we can apply it.
Are you starting with me again?<eos> Take a compliment.<eos> Texas looks perfect.<eos> It's your hometown, right?<eos> Your hometown's only named after you because your family infested it like some hyper-breeding rats.
We're complying with your orders.<eos> You lied to me, Doctor.<eos> You hacked into Eros.<eos> We found your dead colleague in the airlock.<eos> I told Dr. Kane not to touch it, but he never listens.
Now, I just don't want you to think I'm hallucinating or anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> You know those voices I'm hearing, I think this thing has taken the, I don't know, consciousness, some part of whatever it is makes us human.<eos> It's eating it, spitting it back out in some other configuration.
Previously on The Expanse...<eos> Shit. "Protomolecule."<eos> They gave the goddamn thing a name.<eos> What are we going to do with it?<eos> Stick it on the end of a torpedo, and we fire it into the sun.
The Rocinante and James Holden have gone silent.<eos> Along with Fred Johnson, and the Martian government.<eos> So we will just have to be insightful on our own.<eos> Where are we on the impact site mission?<eos> We've commandeered a civilian survey vessel and are refitting it with our best sensors and probes.
Caty would realize that I was in trouble.<eos> She'd figure out a way to help me.<eos> It was my only hope.<eos> My last chance.<eos> And I blew it.
Crows Wood.<eos> Well, you might bring me back some mushrooms while you're there!<eos> You know, this is a Hundred Acre Wood.<eos> We've as much chance of finding a bear of very little brain.<eos> And even if she had a bag, maybe the murderer stole it?
I'd say it's just taken a turn for the better.<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't... ..eat the soup.<eos> Something tells me this isn't good news.<eos> Gillespie poisoned it with destroying angels.
Of Sam. He blocked me on Instagram, and...<eos> I don't know, at first I thought it was just Emily and her bitchy ways, but then I realized he must have seen the photo of us.<eos> What photo?<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> I know I said I deleted it, but...
After every VC in town turned us down, we decided that the best way to stay alive until we got to a million users was to cut server usage. Remember that?<eos> The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours was to decrease server load, not keep it the same.<eos> Technically, the reason why we stayed up for two days was to maximize our ability to get a million users, and I just did that.<eos> Because who doesn't want 10 percent better image quality?<eos> Who doesn't want it?

Hey.<eos> Are you saying no?<eos> Drive.<eos> I really like this song.<eos> Will you sing it to me?
You can't take it, can you?<eos> I have to give it to you freely, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, you're fucked.<eos> I'm not going to give it to you.
Never ever ever.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Not not ever.<eos> Meat's going to slide off you sooner or later, dead wife.<eos> Sooner if you keep soaking it in hot water.
This Friday or not at all.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.<eos> I'm not a fan.<eos> I shan't be holding back.<eos> My audience expects the truth and I give it to them.
The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange... it's gone.<eos> Maybe Lucius took it.<eos> You're the only two with the combination, right?<eos> No.<eos> Lee has it, too.
I buried Jim Gordon alive in a location that you might find if you looked long enough, but certainly not before he runs out of air.<eos> Meaning, I'm the only one who knows where he is.<eos> But... Now here's the kicker... I left him a way out.<eos> You hear that, Jim?<eos> I left you an escape hatch. Have you found it yet?
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.<eos> No, not everything.<eos> We still have a piece of that Stone.<eos> Not for long.<eos> And once I have it, you and everyone you love will perish.
And then I'm gonna come for you... and Barry and your sister, and I'll kill everyone you love.<eos> No, you're not real!<eos> You're just in my head, just...<eos> Oh, I'm real, and I know the limits of your speed.<eos> After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.
- Yup.<eos> - And I build a trap for him?<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> He wants to kill you before you build it.
- Don't call me Jordy.<eos> - My apologies, Jordan Wilder.<eos> May I have your autograph?<eos> That coke wasn't mine.<eos> And if you didn't plant it, then that bitch you was with did.
Because it's a great opportunity, Paige.<eos> When Adam mentioned it, I knew that Jake would go for it because it's exactly what he needs right now.<eos> Yeah, maybe after he felt defeated because he got fired.<eos> But, come on, long term.<eos> You remember our freshman year when he wrote his first stage play and that creative writing class completely tore it apart in front of him?
You lied to me everyday for 23 years.<eos> When you tucked me in when I was little.. When you dropped me off at school when I played baseball all those years.<eos> At my games alone thinking I didn't have a dad.<eos> You lied.<eos> You stole that part of my childhood from me and I'll never get it back.
I'm here for the movie.<eos> I'm ready to go back to work.<eos> I think we should get you into a program or in to see a counselor or something...<eos> I'm an adult.<eos> I'll seek help if I need it.
One second.<eos> This isn't a good time.<eos> Well, this phone call's not gonna make it any better.<eos> I need the bell.<eos> I just had my dad take it out of town to hide it. Why?
This isn't a good time.<eos> Well, this phone call's not gonna make it any better.<eos> I need the bell.<eos> I just had my dad take it out of town to hide it. Why?<eos> Because I'm gonna give it to Sybil.
Damon's humanity is on, which means that he's all emo and afraid of owning up to what he did when it was off.<eos> When we were kids, he used to hide out every time we did something wrong, until I'd find him and tell him everything was gonna be okay.<eos> So, all you need to do is find out where he's hiding in there, and do the exact same thing.<eos> By the way, why are you helping them?<eos> I need the Maxwell bell before my sister uses it against me.

There's got to be more to it than that.<eos> What are you not telling me?<eos> - Why do we have to ring it?<eos> - I know.<eos> It's a silly rule, but your bloodline forged it, so your bloodline has to do the honors.
You're not destroying our town.<eos> Aren't I?<eos> Because it's caused me nothing but trouble, and the emotional hold it has over Damon is worse than a Hallmark card.<eos> You're forgetting one small detail.<eos> You need a Maxwell to ring that bell, and I'm not touching it.
Kai siphoned me like a juice box.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I want the ashen dagger.<eos> The one weapon that can kill me.<eos> Well, you're out of luck, because I don't have it.
Well, if we're gonna be a family again, we need to be honest with each other.<eos> Okay, then yes.<eos> Yeah, I... I finished in time to take a shower so I could get here a little early.<eos> And where's the dagger?<eos> I gave it to Stefan already.
You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.
Sorry, Castiel.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> There's always a cure, and we will find it.
All of 'em?<eos> Seriously?<eos> So I guess that means, safe to say that, black bill is definitely connected to the plant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or the family that runs it.
Yeah, but, uh, this is what we need right now.<eos> Witch killing bullets.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Uh, with magic.<eos> Nah, I don't have it.
I gotta say, a, uh, hole in reality to a bombed out Apocalypse world?<eos> I'm gonna go with 11.<eos> Sounds right.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> The child, he opened this door. He'll close it.
Budmouth Taxis, how can I help you?<eos> Could you hold on a minute?<eos> Do you have a list of the ones he did and didn't carry out?<eos> Somewhere back here.<eos> Let me see if I can find it.
- When was this?<eos> - Last night.<eos> - Has she still got the card?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She showed it to me when I picked her up.
What was that light, Miller?<eos> Yeah, there's a security light.<eos> It could have been that.<eos> Often on a motion sensor.<eos> What would have tripped it?
Who are the flowers from, Trish?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They were left on the front doorstep.<eos> There's a card.<eos> Do you mind if we take it?
Not now.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Someone took my phone.<eos> And they went through my photos.<eos> And in my photos there was a picture, and they sent it to everyone.
And in my photos there was a picture, and they sent it to everyone.<eos> What was the photo, Daze?<eos> Don't make me show you.<eos> Oh... sweetheart, no.<eos> Everyone in the school saw it.
But, yeah, with you, a little bit.<eos> I'm angry because we have to fight this.<eos> We cannot let men get away with doing these things to us.<eos> I don't want that responsibility.<eos> I know you don't. But tough luck, cos you've got it.
- It's gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> When I found it, yeah.
Right, come on.<eos> Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.<eos> That bag wasn't there.<eos> You want us to believe you see a suspicious bag inside one of your sheds, pick it up, leaving your fingerprints and DNA.
And I hate not being in control of my life.<eos> My bedtime's when I say so.<eos> I don't let some pyramid tell me what food to eat.<eos> And I don't care what Titus says, I put my mittens on before my jacket.<eos> Then how do you zip or button it?
[gasps] What is this place?<eos> Does it appear for one day every hundred years?<eos> Don't disappear, magical office.<eos> This is my company.<eos> I was running it out of my dorm room, but after I developed the soups and wet foods algorithm for Nom Nom, some major funding came through.
You lied to me about not knowing Kevin Jones.<eos> He was a member of your congregation.<eos> Kevin had a tattoo on his arm of the cross from your church.<eos> Half of London decorate their bodies with the cross.<eos> The tragedy is, they don't take it into their hearts.
Okay, stop, Frankie.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks again for the soup.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> You're welcome, even though you don't deserve it.
Well, you are hereby refired as my secretary with an 8% increase in salary.<eos> The Baudelaires will be sent to a suitable guardian and this series of unfortunate events has come to a close.<eos> As for you, Count Olaf...<eos> I'll get my hands on your fortune if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And when I have it, I will tear you and your siblings from limb to limb.
The word "hackneyed" here means<eos> "used by so many writers, it is a tiresome cliche,"<eos> while "meanwhile back at the ranch" is a phrase used to link what is going on in one part of a story with another part, and has nothing to do with cows or creamy salad dressing.<eos> When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch," what I mean is, meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room, the adults were having an adult conversation.<eos> If we place the peaches in a line leading up to the cage, perhaps the snake will follow the trail and then we can trap it inside.
Take the week.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Aaron told me himself.<eos> He shared the information with Speaker Hookstraten... She leaked it to Abe Leonard.
I've seen bare-knuckle campaigners barely make it through a single term as president.<eos> You can't learn on the job.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's taken everything in my empty soul to get back in this game, and there's zero chance I'm gonna let some amateurs in diapers push me out again.<eos> There's a connection between MacLeish and the shooter, and I'm gonna find it.
Slow.<eos> Polymer electrolyte membrane.<eos> You got it for me online. It cost $87.<eos> I remember that.<eos> I used it to make a hydrogen fuel cell that propels the vehicle.
-Seek Harmony.<eos> I guess this vessel will do.<eos> -Hey Y'alls, Be right careful out there. You hear?<eos> -How's your head?<eos> -It feels like Paseo just split it open with a jackhammer. and filled it back in with concrete.
I've tried to go easy on you because of the loss of your father.<eos> I-I just can't ignore your behavior anymore.<eos> You are so smart and so pretty, and you're just throwing it all away.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I asked Savanah to hold it for me.
If I help you... It will just be a fact-finding mission.<eos> Okay? Of course.<eos> You cannot take anything.<eos> I won't touch a thing.<eos> And if the card is in that safe, you're going to keep it there and we are going to call the cops, okay?
- Write it down.<eos> - Uh, I can drop a pin for you.<eos> No, man, on paper.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's how hard I threw it.
Is he in his van now?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> That's Chris Junior you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, Christian got him that van for his 16th if he got all B's.<eos> He flunked, but he got to keep it anyway.
- Yeah.<eos> - Anyway, I read in this one this thing, and I... I just want to know if it's true.<eos> Yeah, you know, I don't really remember much from back then.<eos> Your 11th birthday.<eos> Our moms got really drunk... making the cake, and... When they brought it out, apparently, my mom just, like, fell and went face first into the cake.
Oh, you shouldn't have.<eos> Say hello to your new best friends.<eos> Panic Alerts.<eos> I have enough best friends.<eos> This seems like a joke, but I don't get it.
I haven't.<eos> I don't have a clear picture in my head at all.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> But you love that farm.<eos> I loved it when I was 50.
Do you see what he's done here and why I'm congratulating him?<eos> Look how straight his label is.<eos> This is our goal.<eos> As opposed to... this.<eos> Now, I'm not asking who is responsible for this abomination, but why don't you take Sol's box back out and use it as a model.
Let. It. Go.<eos> No! I can't.<eos> "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."<eos> My father had that quote framed and hung in our living room.<eos> I saw it every day.
Get in!<eos> You know where she is.<eos> Why?<eos> We thought we could get a bomb on that ship.<eos> We needed someone to detonate it during launch.
You think the pilot might still be alive?<eos> He escaped into the bloc.<eos> So we have to find him before the Occupation.<eos> The dead jumper had a radio in his backpack.<eos> I memorized the frequency and then scrambled it.
Look.<eos> Look at the eye.<eos> Heather.<eos> Heather.<eos> Interesting, you had a gun but you didn't use it. Why?
Let your fingers do the walking through the Yellow Pages.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - That is a Christmas present.<eos> - So it's one of those, too good tn be true type of deals.<eos> - We don't know what's in the fucking safe until we open it, right?
I can't remember.<eos> Something to do with the Bram, maybe, the stream that runs through the valley.<eos> So why did he end up with a tarot card in his pocket?<eos> I did a reading for him.<eos> And he took it.
We can't be realtors if we don't have listings.<eos> It's so basic. It's so fucking basic.<eos> [Sheila] Oh, my... [grunts]<eos> - Would've been nice to have the lid.<eos> - [grunts] I couldn't find it.
- Would've been nice to have the lid.<eos> - [grunts] I couldn't find it.<eos> Right. [grunts]<eos> You'd think it would've been stored with the container, is all.<eos> I can look for it when we get home, sweetheart.
- She's great.<eos> We're gonna take such good care of you.<eos> - Yay. And you remember the beautiful master bedroom, with south-facing windows and impossible-to-stain texture-plush carpeting.<eos> Mm, I love this room.<eos> Then you should buy it, along with all the other rooms.
Yeah.<eos> Now grab your stuff, and let's get the hell out of here.<eos> These are the symbols I saw on the dead guy's face in hell, or wherever it was he took me.<eos> And everything else is what Diana saw.<eos> Did the Crusaders make these marks on the cloth, or was it already there when they got to it?
I can't explain anything that's been going on.<eos> I keep thinking I need to be carrying that stick.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - No.<eos> But it's like... you get used to carrying your weapon, and when you don't have it, you feel like you're missing
I put it back in the tunnel.<eos> Don't you think you should put it someplace a little further out?<eos> No, I wanna understand what happened.<eos> I wanna know where it came from.<eos> I wanna know why the men who found it buried it and I wanna know what's written on that cloth that's wrapped around it.
Maybe that plays into this.<eos> On it.<eos> I know you love Juliette.<eos> But you have to end it and never see her again.<eos> You want the truth, you're gonna get it.
- Hey, guys, what's up? - Hey.<eos> We just got back from the M.E.'s.<eos> We got a dead body full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<eos> It's something found in bug saliva.<eos> Hoping you might know of a Wesen that uses it to kill its victims.
Exactly.<eos> And where you gave me the key.<eos> Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here, I'm giving it back to you.
Just try.<eos> We can't hide out here for the rest of our lives.<eos> We won't have to.<eos> This thing is gonna find us one way or another.<eos> And when it does I'm gonna kill it.
I wish I'd never heard of those damn keys... or Black Claw.<eos> Or Bonaparte or this.<eos> Am I ever gonna be able to take this damn thing off?<eos> You never tried after Bonaparte died?<eos> He said that great harm would come to my children if I ever took it off.
That doesn't need to happen.<eos> None of this does.<eos> The stick is what you want.<eos> It is.<eos> You can't kill me as long as I have it.
What the hell is going on?<eos> You can have it.<eos> No, Nick!<eos> You can't give it to this lying son of a bitch devil.<eos> If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?
"Your laptop's probably already in Mexico."<eos> And then a few days later, I got an e-mail from someone claiming they had found my missing computer and offering to return it for a cash reward.<eos> But you didn't take 'em up on it?<eos> I could buy three new laptops for that amount of money.<eos> If only I could've pressed a button and blown up he computer while the guy was holding it.
Entropy, you're under arrest for causality violations in Continuum Sector 818.<eos> Nice moves, Crono Teens.<eos> Thanks for leaving that note.<eos> Wait, we didn't leave a note.<eos> Guess I left it for myself.
It's talking about me.<eos> Episode 23.<eos> The problem with paradoxes, in about 30 seconds I'll be a girl who remembers a show that never existed, which makes me a living, breathing paradox.<eos> And you can't return to the present until the paradox is resolved.<eos> How do I resolve it?
Grandma.<eos> I almost lost my job today picking her up.<eos> Now what the hell happened?<eos> There was a tournament today. It was a big one, I...<eos> I couldn't just miss it.
I'm glad this nightmare is over. You can relax now.<eos> Not yet.<eos> He thinks he left his cigarette case there.<eos> It's got his name on it.<eos> I need you to use your contacts to find out if the police found it.
I need you to use your contacts to find out if the police found it.<eos> I'll do what I can, princess.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can we trust her?<eos> If the police have found it, she'll know.
He must have a say in things.<eos> Francisco has no power right now.<eos> But he could...<eos> Did you find the cigarette case?<eos> Victoria says the police don't have it.
Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> I'd ask you to join me for dinner, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what you came here for.<eos> Mike Ross got out of prison.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to practice law again.<eos> I don't disagree, but technically, he didn't practice it in the first place.
These kids need your help.<eos> I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Difference is, clients actually want my help.<eos> Michael, these kids need it.
She came to my house to tell me that if I even so much as try to get a job at a legal clinic, she's gonna make it her life's mission to stop me.<eos> - She can't do that.<eos> - Did you hear me?<eos> I wasn't even on her radar.<eos> I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me just because you can't accept the fact that I don't want to come back here.
- They can't do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it's unfair?<eos> - Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.
I hate what you did, and I probably always will, but I don't hate you.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's... it's just, I had your painting on my wall for the longest time, and I just realized... how much I missed it.
It's proof your client spoke to mine for an average of two minutes per call, and it wasn't to talk about the weather.<eos> Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me a copy of this nonsense 20 minutes ago, and he specifically agreed it wasn't relevant.<eos> That... that is a lie. Because I have a phone record of a two-minute call that I made to you ten minutes ago.<eos> Your Honor, she called 20 times.<eos> Yeah, probably to say why her rent was late, because she never paid it.
Did you think I wouldn't check up on you when all of a sudden, a Queens legal clinic starts acting like a Midtown law form.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> And if this goes to trial, he's the one I'm up against, and we all know what happened last time.<eos> You wouldn't be here if that's all you wanted to tell me.<eos> So why don't you give me a number, and I'll take it to my client.
We don't give out that kind of money.<eos> If you lose, you're going to be giving out a hell of a lot more than that.<eos> Look, I'm telling you, I can get her to agree to this.<eos> And I am telling you, you've had your offer.<eos> That's all your gonna get, and if you don't take it right now, we're going to trial, and I am gonna wipe the floor with this kid.
- You're back.<eos> - You better believe I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing and why you're doing it.<eos> There's really not much to find, Mr. Specter.<eos> Well, let me lay it out for you.<eos> Velocity Data Solutions stole your technology, and they're rushing it to market, so you want to orchestrate a takeover and get back what's yours. That sound about right?
- Why not?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> Yeah, I'll tell ya why you can't.<eos> Because a squeaky clean guy like you doesn't come to a guy like me unless he's got no choice, and you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you, so why don't you give me a call when you're ready to tell the truth.<eos> They got it from me.
You're not an officer of the court.<eos> They will not grant it, and that is not your place here.<eos> Then at least I can sit near him, and I can...<eos> You hear me right now!<eos> I gave you a chance, because I needed it, but if you risk the reputation of this clinic over one housing case, I will fire you and make sure that you are banned from ever sitting foot in a courtroom again.
Is that clear?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's clear.<eos> This is a nice place you got here.<eos> When are they condemning it?
I'd say that's not possible, because she didn't.<eos> Well, you've got documents, and I have one too.<eos> This is a copy of a certified letter from my client to the remaining tenants three weeks ago, stating that construction will begin, giving fair warning to the occupants.<eos> Your Honor, my client's never seen that.<eos> Well, she might not have seen it, but she got it.
Yet another lie.<eos> You didn't paint this.<eos> You got Janet to do it.<eos> No, no, no, Chidi did it.<eos> I got you an awesome painting, but then he switched it to this one because he said you'd like it more, and he made me memorize stuff to say to you so you wouldn't be so sad.
I'm just trying to stay alive.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> I made a deal with your dad to get me my key.<eos> If I let you go, he's got no reason to do it.<eos> What if he doesn't bring it?
Well, what about cameras?<eos> I mean, a guy like this would have security cameras.<eos> Mrs. Chandler said she prefers her privacy, and she's lived here much longer than the victim.<eos> Sir, her first husband, Richard Bloom, bought the house in 2000.<eos> Wife got it in the divorce in 2015 and remarried 11 months ago.
My ex-husband installed it. It was one of the startups that he was investing in.<eos> Do you know your OffKey security user name and password? Yes.<eos> It's...<eos> ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God.<eos> Tom changed it every seven days.
Tom loved his work...<eos> And yet another candidate for Assistant Chief finds a reason just to drop by. Hmm.<eos> No matter who gets that job, it's going to be bad for us.<eos> I was put on alert this morning that Mr. Chandler's personal computer had left its residence.<eos> When they tracked it to PAB,
Well, Criminal Intelligence was helping Chandler develop... let's call it new surveillance technology for the LAPD.<eos> The Feds allowed me to pull Wescott's confidential files from your victim's computer and leave you everything else.<eos> Well, I'm surprised.<eos> Usually, when Criminal Intelligence takes possession of evidence...<eos> No one ever sees it again, that's right.
- What's there to say?<eos> He's a liar.<eos> There are other things.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.
Is he telling the truth?<eos> Well, I think the story's best read as an allegory.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> So, you mean, um...<eos> Well, he's using it like a fairy tale which to explain himself.
♪ But in every place They said to his face now ♪<eos> ♪ Get out of here ♪<eos> ♪ Get out, get out ♪<eos> I love this song.<eos> This guy's butchering it.
Bleeding ear!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> This place is awful.<eos> Right now, I'm staring at a People magazine from the '90s with Tonya Harding on the cover.<eos> Her face is all red and puffy from sick hands that have touched it.
- Cool.<eos> No hardcore porno.<eos> We had to make a "no hardcore porno" rule, because the last guy fried the computer.<eos> I'm not allowed to tell you his name.<eos> We call it the Dave Rogers rule.
- Oh, Sophia.<eos> It was a pleasure and an exhilaration to be you for a day and see art through a non-artist's eyes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Again, thanks.<eos> And since I sweated my ass off in this thing, I cleaned it...

Wanna bet?<eos> You basically started a riot over that ball you're holding.<eos> It belongs to a five-year-old kid.<eos> No, I caught it.<eos> You ripped it out of his weak little hands.
And Oprah told me that 99 percent of women are wearing the wrong bra size.<eos> So, I go to Victoria's Secret, and find out that you get half off a bra if you open a credit card, so, I did.<eos> But then I moved.<eos> Never got the bill.<eos> Hence, never paid it.
My apartment is too crowded.<eos> With no room for new inventory, these awesome graphs I made will start going in the opposite direction.<eos> For your perusal.<eos> Now, I have a lead on a new office space and enough cash to put down months of rent up front.<eos> The jerk-off landlord won't rent it to me without a cosigner.
Made a homemade suet...<eos> First off, it's Nasty Gal.<eos> Second, this message board should be called David Lynch's Elephant Man, because it's full of freaks and sad as fuck.<eos> You all saw that post, right?<eos> It's gone now, but I saw it.
I just don't know what to do.<eos> This is your Sliding Doors moment.<eos> You know, I never saw that movie.<eos> I bought a ticket and then didn't go.<eos> I always wondered where my life would be if I'd seen it.
It belongs to the old ball and chain.<eos> Wore it the time we went and visited that big-ass cave up in Kentucky.<eos> That's great.<eos> See, all of my current misery can be traced back to the decision to sell that jacket. So...<eos> - I need it. - Hell no.
Four, three, two, one, Happy New Year!<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> Please, say something.<eos> All right, fine. I don't like how you're using this song to manipulate my feelings.<eos> I didn't ask them to play it.
Raina!<eos> Front of your cells.<eos> Shut the fuck up for headcount.<eos> Move it, Teresi, or I'll put you in a wheelchair.<eos> You put a hand on me, it's the last time you'll see it.
Voices on a phone, right?<eos> - Ah. - Great.<eos> I'll tell you this much, though...<eos> Snooty freakin' bastards.<eos> 'Cause I remember, I told 'em to send me his audition tape 'cause I wanted it for, like, his actor reel, right?
They sent it to you, this tape?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's on it?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I didn't watch it.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.<eos> We need to wrap him up in something that doesn't leak.<eos> We're gonna have to get him to the car in something that doesn't look suspicious.<eos> With a body in it, that trunk is going to be heavy.<eos> Then we won't carry it.
I'm so sorry, Maya.<eos> You said that you care.<eos> - You don't even care.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I give you a chance right there, right now, and you didn't take it.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Can you back that up a couple frames?<eos> And also, do you know the IP address of that camera?<eos> 'Cause we're going to need it for the evidentiary record. I can get it.
What?<eos> No...<eos> Are you... 99.9% sure.<eos> Forensics analyzed a coffee cup with his saliva on it.<eos> Who sent it in?
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.<eos> I graduate in five hours!<eos> We'll get you another cap and gown.<eos> That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.<eos> I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
You need the car.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How 'bout "nailed it"?<eos> I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.
Good Humor ice cream bars added to your shopping list.<eos> I'm... I'm still on hold.<eos> With?<eos> Microsoft Azure. Yeah, I...<eos> I'm trying to negotiate a lower cloud storage rate because we're gonna need it if, or more realistically when, Richard finally decides to pay that patent troll.
It's kind of like that old fraternity game, uh, the limp biscuit.<eos> Sorry, I wasn't in a fraternity. What is that?<eos> Oh, I-I... I don't think we need to get into...<eos> It's where guys stand in a circle and masturbate onto a cracker.<eos> And then the last guy... eats it.
Yeah?<eos> The patient is a panda bear.<eos> A panda?<eos> Atrial septal defect.<eos> Can you fix it?
Excuse me, please.<eos> I just called the pharmacy.<eos> Dad hasn't filled Gabe's chemo in three months.<eos> He's withholding his medication.<eos> Maybe he filled it someplace else?
- We're on it.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Jeff.<eos> - I'm with ya.<eos> - Go back that strip in, got it?
- Maybe I should just go. - No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm so sorry, but I gotta put you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold...<eos> For your own good. What?<eos> Seventy-two hours?<eos> You wanted my attention, and now you have it.
Good luck?<eos> Ethan, are you kidding?<eos> Nat, I've met combat vets who have been paralyzed.<eos> The feelings of inferiority can be overwhelming.<eos> If you told them a bottle of snake oil might help them walk again, they'd drink it every time.
You're welcome.<eos> Okay, this isn't how I wanted this to go.<eos> Uh, we're both Inhuman.<eos> And as you say, we're stuck with each other, so why not make the most of it?<eos> I read your written statement, and I believe it.
Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...<eos> - Cyanide?<eos> Why would I ...<eos> - Or, like, a paper bag.<eos> You put it over my head, you suffocate me really quick.
Radcliffe said she was in the Framework.<eos> Yeah, but this is a contained prototype.<eos> - It's got limited simulations.<eos> - If Radcliffe said he built a world, he must have built a separate, more powerful version.<eos> - But if it's separate, how will we find it?
You're in danger.<eos> I have so many memories of snow.<eos> My first time ice-skating on my neighbor's pond.<eos> A month stationed near the French Alps.<eos> But the truth is... this is the first time I've seen it.
- Yes.<eos> But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.
See?<eos> Good as new.<eos> - And stronger, it seems.<eos> - I know what you did.<eos> You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine.
We'll change the world.<eos> Fitz, this is wrong.<eos> This... this is crimesagainst-humanity wrong.<eos> These are Inhumans.<eos> You've been a great asset, Skye, but unless I ask for your opinion... don't give it.
More like a mass grave at the Academy.<eos> The story's a cover-up.<eos> I think Hydra murdered me.<eos> Did you find the extraction beacon?<eos> Exactly where we programmed it.
how about if we...<eos> Make some popcorn and watch a video?<eos> "Chopping mall"?<eos> Again with that silly robot movie?<eos> Don't pretend you don't love it.
The Russian has a base under a drilling platform in the Baltic.<eos> Go and save them, and leave us in peace.<eos> How do we get out?<eos> Did you build an exit back to the real world?<eos> Of course I did, but I suspect Aida's discovered it by now.
I could've changed my life that day.<eos> But it seemed like too much responsibility.<eos> I didn't want to shoulder it.<eos> But now I think maybe I should have.<eos> Well, when I got that offer, i took it.
Slow down.<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
Right, so, Wave and Mikey stay in the car, they handle first contact with the cat.<eos> Find out what he wants, take the cash, then send them over to the youths.<eos> Where do you think he's going?<eos> To get the stuff for...<eos> Exactly, so he's going to go off, get the food, and then bring it back to the cat and then back to square one.
Kevin Sherwood.<eos> It's best if you leave it alone. Is that a warning?<eos> You need to let me in.<eos> It's kill or be killed, boys.<eos> I've got bleach and I will use it in your fucking eyes!
Right, what do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> Like, who else was involved.<eos> All right, just take the gun out my face.<eos> I've got bleach and I will use it in your fucking eyes!
I am profoundly glad to hear it.<eos> Do you still wish to leave Mrs. Quigley's pay?<eos> It is a blight on both our lives.<eos> I know of a house that you could take for a while.<eos> I offer it as charity, of course.
I can see why.<eos> - Was yours as cool as Rick's?<eos> - It was pretty sweet.<eos> '83 Triumph Daytona.<eos> - Do you still have it?
And there is nothing that I can do about it.<eos> There's something you can do about it, you just don't wanna do it.<eos> You're talking about that woman.<eos> You want leverage on Palmer?<eos> She's the one who's got it.
Yes, I did.<eos> Finally.<eos> Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.
She died rushing from her job to pick up our children.<eos> What the hell does any of this have to do with smoking?<eos> It shouldn't have anything to do with it, but this company is not in the business of helping people.<eos> It's in the business of making money.<eos> So if they can find any reason not to honor a claim, they'll take it.
We got 5 million for it...<eos> Looks like you're going home soon.<eos> You did what?<eos> Shit.<eos> We caught a break and we took it.
It's all here. Um...<eos> Oxy, Percocet, speed, pregnancy tests.<eos> What's the ketamine for?<eos> Some of the guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies.<eos> But the girls use it, too.
- This movie with a lot of wet...<eos> - Daya, maybe it's, uh, time to rest?<eos> Yeah, I just gotta get my gun back from Pidge.<eos> What?<eos> Still can't believe you let her have it and not me.
- Daya, maybe it's, uh, time to rest?<eos> Yeah, I just gotta get my gun back from Pidge.<eos> What?<eos> Still can't believe you let her have it and not me.<eos> She's ready to hand it back.
He's my business partner.<eos> Cal Roberts.<eos> Where's Mr. Lane?<eos> He is the coowner of the house.<eos> We're in the process of him signing it over to me.
Where are you, Eddie?<eos> You're a denier.<eos> You're the son.<eos> What's behind the door?<eos> If you don't open it, you'll never escape it.
I'd like you to keep a leash on your son.<eos> And I'd like you to help us with the other people.<eos> The ranch ain't my autocratic plaything.<eos> Its residents don't bend to my whims and wills and fancies.<eos> It's a place for free people who only ask for help when they need it.
You were right about that thing on Ganymede, ma'am.<eos> It was a weapons test.<eos> Me and my team and your marines too, we were caught in the middle.<eos> That test nearly triggered a system-wide war.<eos> The weapon's up for sale and Mars wants it.
What was it?<eos> You used the protomolecule on children.<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> We made the protomolecule do what we wanted.<eos> We made it in our own image.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper, Martian Marine Corps.<eos> I am requesting political asylum on Earth.<eos> You were right about that thing on Ganymede.<eos> It was a weapons test.<eos> The weapon's up for sale and Mars wants it.
107 years old...<eos> I love that about Earth.<eos> Well, you know what, you take that bottle.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> But as for the protomolecule, Sergeant Draper was witness to a game-changing technology, and there can't be peace if one of us has it and not the other.
Absorbed instantly through the skin, without a trace.<eos> Cardiac arrest.<eos> An act of God.<eos> I mean, this stuff was staggeringly effective.<eos> But then, they banned it under the Brussels Act.
Sweaty but ready.<eos> All right, can y'all folks lock up?<eos> I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.<eos> My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.<eos> I got to talk to him about removing it.
Uh, and I'm gonna need you to zip that dress up.<eos> This movie's PG.<eos> All right, I'll zip up.<eos> Guess you guys don't want a sequel.<eos> The door, much like the man who put it up, is well hung.
I have to go.<eos> Enjoy the scotch.<eos> Hall!<eos> Sandicot's not getting the gaming license.<eos> The commission went another way, gave it to a town in the Catskills.
Okay.<eos> My friends will become your friends, and your enemies will become mine, as some already have.<eos> About that clerkship, you can put that - out of your mind.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> I'm sure my granddaughter has put it out of hers.
Besides, you know I wanna be on the outside, rocking with the marauders.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You went with a sailcloth option.<eos> Tent.<eos> Yeah. Lara picked it.
I don't know yet.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Forgive. If you can.<eos> Axe is asking if you have the Klaxon research.<eos> I got it right here. Just haven't signed it yet.
I hope so.<eos> Forgive. If you can.<eos> Axe is asking if you have the Klaxon research.<eos> I got it right here. Just haven't signed it yet.<eos> So, should I tell him he's getting it?

Cross the Hudson wearing rebel blue?<eos> Wandering where their commander scarpered off to?<eos> He had it coming.<eos> I know precisely who and what you are.<eos> Please, this is where we report the war, not wage it.
But you require my permission, unlike your last raid in Setauket. Yes, sir.<eos> Why 50?<eos> Why not more?<eos> Well, Culper... they said they ain't got no cannon at the fort, sir, only muskets.<eos> Sir, do you think that we should not risk this action or do you not trust me to lead it?
Excuse me.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> First, there are the hay collectors, then the hay inspectors, then the hay weighers.<eos> There are five clerks for the work of one man.<eos> I do not make the law, I mere enforce it.
- And it's not what they say.<eos> - And what do they say?<eos> About you?<eos> What, in camp?<eos> They say that if you were ever to be captured, they'd cut off your leg, the one that was wounded in Saratoga, and they'd bury it with honors.
Because I was the one who urged Congress to declare bankruptcy last year.<eos> Well, you did not sign up to be a politician as well as a general.<eos> But still... can't you allow yourself even a moment of relief?<eos> That damned candle.<eos> I told Billy to change it.
Each man is driven by something.<eos> Now I remember... watching your uncle shake with palsy at the trial.<eos> Remember?<eos> That sort of thing runs in the family, doesn't it?<eos> You know, I may hate weakness, but you fear it.
You're a guest here, son.<eos> Get right with the past or get off my land.<eos> It's their land.<eos> The land belongs to whoever can hold it.<eos> The Indians couldn't, gave it up for beer money.
Get right with the past or get off my land.<eos> It's their land.<eos> The land belongs to whoever can hold it.<eos> The Indians couldn't, gave it up for beer money.<eos> I held it, I hold it, so it's mine.
Why do they even have a wax figure of Ford?<eos> - I don't know. - The real one was made of wood.<eos> Get them to move me next to... to Lincoln or to Mao - or some other game-changing icon! - Aw, yes.<eos> That's what I am. Don't make that noise!<eos> Just do it before I melt down that whole collection and use it to wax Madame Tussauds' big, fat, nasty snatch!
The Ethics Committee is debating ending its probe into Representative Lawler's Nantucket trip.<eos> You will vote yes despite the strong evidence of cocaine use and reckless boating.<eos> - That guy knows how to party.<eos> - Then Tuesday, you have the White House meeting on raising the debt ceiling.<eos> Unless they try to kick it down the road for a couple of months and hope we get hit by an asteroid.
- So he says.<eos> I'll go and speak to them, just like I'll speak to everyone else, including the brewery.<eos> Inspector...<eos> If you do visit the brewery, you may discover I have an arrangement whereby Brian there sells me the more... vintage bitter at a favourable rate.<eos> We've drunk it for years.
Mine got me kicked out of the army.<eos> They asked; I told.<eos> Let's dive in!<eos> Everybody get behind your chairs.<eos> I'm gonna show you the routine and then I'll break it down.
Should we steal some snacks from the diner before we steal Han's car?<eos> Earl, what are you doing here?<eos> You know you're off today, right?<eos> Uh, I forgot my weed here.<eos> Then I smoked it.
You can't bring outside food in here.<eos> It's not food.<eos> It's a severely injured squirrel.<eos> All right, well, sit wherever.<eos> Just don't let it out of the box.
- I mean, girls usually don't go on play dates with their rapist.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Unless there's something wrong with the girl, unless it's the girl that the mist wouldn't touch.<eos> I didn't ask for your opinion.<eos> Too bad. I'm giving it to you.
No, no, no!<eos> Please don't!<eos> I'm hosting a party at my country home.<eos> I would be very pleased if you could come as well.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.
It's the doctor.<eos> Neil sent me.<eos> Put the gun away or I'm leaving right now.<eos> What about you?<eos> I keep it 'til I know this place is safe.
You ain't got nothing on me, Detective.<eos> And we're back. Nice work, Murphy.<eos> Okay, getting warmer.<eos> Just keep him in that chair.<eos> There's duct tape in the supply room if you need it.
I wrote a letter to Pablo.<eos> What Pablo?<eos> Your Pablo?<eos> He's not my Pablo. Well, yes he is.<eos> I gave it to someone...
-What does it say?<eos> -I don't remember.<eos> Marga! Marga!<eos> The note, where is it?<eos> I put it in the mailbox first thing.
Sword and spear, Lord, but a man tires of sticking ironware into the bellies of other men.<eos> I would have enjoyed a cup of ale with you both, but I must leave you.<eos> You have the letter secure?<eos> I do, Father.<eos> I've put it right next to my ball bag.
In fact, it was never taken out of its holster, so... if you didn't shoot him, then who did?<eos> My old lady kicked me out that night.<eos> I got a little crazy, you know, fired off a round at the building, but I didn't aim it at nobody or hurt nobody.<eos> I tossed my piece in the bushes when Koblinsky rode up on me.<eos> That's it... he tossed it in the bushes.
One of a kind.<eos> I've heard the stories about this blade.<eos> Nearly a thousand lives claimed by its obsidian steel.<eos> The man who wielded this sword would never part with it.<eos> How did you get it?
Any other direction, he'll have his route blocked by one of Banneker's wards.<eos> I shall intercept him.<eos> Lure him here.<eos> How are we gonna get this entrance open?<eos> The others are negotiating it.
But, I just wanted to let you know, I've won every single competion I've ever entered, and I'll have you kicked out of the program for good if I even catch one whiff of you trying to sabotage me.<eos> Ethan, I'm just here to help out. Good.<eos> Because maybe I'll even get you kicked out of the school too.<eos> In the mean time, could you help me with this homework?<eos> I trust you not to mess it up.
- Hold it up to the light.<eos> "Maly Dolek, Jezyna Dolina,<eos> - Mala Wioska."<eos> - These are the villages and towns selected for upcoming purging actions.<eos> I couldn't take the list, but I borrowed it long enough to poke a few holes.
The Dow, NASDAQ, and SP are approaching Black Monday-type losses.<eos> The Dow Jones Industrial Average has already plunged a staggering 2,000 points in one day, after the shooting of President Kirkman.<eos> You better not be eating my jello.<eos> It's my jello.<eos> I earned it.
We have so many questions left unanswered.<eos> Obviously, we still don't know who we can trust in the government.<eos> I know.<eos> I keep on thinking about the Designated Survivor call.<eos> And if Langdon didn't make it, then who did?
Well, it's business.<eos> Does that mean you're buying?<eos> Same thing?<eos> I left a bottle in the desk.<eos> I assume you found it. Uh...
This is how that plays out.<eos> And that flash, is that the grenade going off?<eos> Yes.<eos> At first we thought he was shot before he could throw it, but the coroner's report was inconclusive.<eos> He may have detonated it deliberately.
Until things went south.<eos> Yeah, I heard...<eos> Scandals and lawsuits.<eos> Company went under.<eos> Yeah, but not because he couldn't afford it, because he felt betrayed by his own government.
Abe Leonard's running with the story that Al-Sakar didn't blow up the Capitol.<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> We have the FBI, the CIA, and half a dozen other agencies on record saying they did.<eos> Yes, I know, and the last time Leonard ran with a story that I thought was crazy, and then POTUS confirmed it. Remember?
He was with a group of music students from a high school in New Orleans that had just been named after his father.<eos> Now, he told me that their music program was gonna lose their funding.<eos> How familiar are you with the federal art grants that make these kind of programs possible?<eos> I remember that bill.<eos> The sunset clause was added to get it past some of my more conservative colleagues.
Woodhull.<eos> Not Woodhull from Long Island?<eos> The magistrate's son?<eos> Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Any idea of the rebels behind it?
I just want the chance to fight.<eos> I was ambushed by men who meant to burn me alive.<eos> And Providence spared me so that I could stand before you today.<eos> And seek revenge.<eos> And you shall have it.
From Sandstorm?<eos> I thought you said they went dark before Jane showed up.<eos> They did.<eos> But before that, they sent me coded messages through this marquee.<eos> I still check it every morning.
Today is about establishing a contact and trust.<eos> Okay, um, so I don't need a gun or anything?<eos> No, you do not.<eos> No, I'll have mine.<eos> But we won't need it.
The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication.<eos> But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.<eos> Although this is a more serious surgery, I've performed it many times.
Anyone gonna... you know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ron?<eos> Was it that bad?<eos> I have to say, when Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, opposite the girl who wrote it, I said to myself, "Ron, old boy, you've won three Tony Awards, and here you are, directing a failed sitcom actor's vanity project."
Babe, I...<eos> I forgot my wallet.<eos> Um, did you, um, did you check the coffee table?<eos> Yeah, it was... it was on the dresser. Good.<eos> Okay, I'm glad you found it.
Okay.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Everything's gonna be okay. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll stop it.
I miss them, too.<eos> Jack...<eos> Somebody replaced the soap dish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you want to see if we can... break it off again?
And then...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Philly left.<eos> And I decided, you know, what was the point?<eos> You know, when a plate breaks, you don't fix it.
Hey, would you... hold on.<eos> It's lady stuff.<eos> They've got this candy bar.<eos> It's new.<eos> I saw it on TV, with nougat and chocolate and, like, this crispy wafer.
What?<eos> Lem's friends... You trust them?<eos> I don't know them.<eos> I don't know you either.<eos> I know a grift when I see it.
Or turn a family man into a bomber.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Give me the access code.<eos> What access code?<eos> Kaufmann emailed it to you.
Oh, my God.<eos> You sound like a Protestant.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> If any of you have any information about the whereabouts of my video camera, or if any of you happened to steal it, bring it the fuck back now.
♪ I wear these glasses on my eyes One day I'll win the Nobel Prize ♪<eos> - ♪ GLOW, GLOW, that's the name ♪ - How did you shoot this?<eos> Oh, on the video camera I found in my locker.<eos> My video camera was in your locker?<eos> Oh, yeah, well, someone put it there, yeah.
Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.<eos> We all saw it.
I couldn't find you, I couldn't even talk to you.<eos> I had to get some power back in this situation.<eos> - The balance was off.<eos> - Well, it's too late.<eos> I already made another copy and sent it to my lawyer.
But... All right?<eos> Here's the "but." He puts the wrong date in the machine, and he goes back in time instead to the 1950s, where she's just a horny teenager, and she spends the rest of the movie<eos> Lookit, I've seen that movie.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I haven't made it.
For years, doctors, hospitals.<eos> God, he was so sweet.<eos> But he... he moved.<eos> He moved a room, sometimes further.<eos> You'd heard his voice, and you'd follow it.
On and off for three years.<eos> Why off?<eos> People with schizophrenia are subject to delusional thinking.<eos> When David was on his medication, he was open, almost desperate to work.<eos> But when he went off it...
So you're just gonna whip up some kind of peace accord, what, before lunch or by dinner?<eos> Babe.<eos> I don't care if you save me or the world... if you don't save yourself.<eos> You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia?<eos> - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.
You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia?<eos> - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.<eos> That's the trick.<eos> The mind killer.<eos> Your disease convinces you, you don't have it.
Klaus, fire! Turn off the machine!<eos> Nice try.<eos> But did you really think we'd use the same word on your bratty brother that we used on the mill workeroaa? eea<eos> You will never find the word to save your brother.<eos> And you certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.
Encountered grief in many forms.<eos> Tears. Laughter. And stony faces.<eos> But yours... confounds me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You wear the mask of loss, but you do not feel it.
I'm happy to prove myself against you, Brother.<eos> It was a joke, Charles.<eos> Besides, I promised Mother I'd stop challenging the king of France.<eos> Don't let my crown get in the way.<eos> I know how much you want it.
It was a joke, Charles.<eos> Besides, I promised Mother I'd stop challenging the king of France.<eos> Don't let my crown get in the way.<eos> I know how much you want it.<eos> In fact, I'll wager you for it.
There's a piece broken off the dryer, and there's a chipped tile, here.<eos> Small piece of the hair dryer, breaks off the tile, landed here.<eos> Someone threw it in.<eos> Probably from around here.<eos> I saw it...
I saw it...<eos> And I got it, what's your point?<eos> - The point is it's garbage!<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> We found it in the trash.
There's still a dose left!<eos> Where?<eos> What are we waiting for?<eos> A few weeks ago, I gave a syringe to major, just in case.<eos> He never used it.
Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?
Seattle pd. My associate Olivia Moore.<eos> Is winslow around?<eos> My wife is picking her up from school.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> That flatbed truck out front, who drives it?
Sure.<eos> So, that letter...<eos> - What?<eos> - The letter.<eos> When did you get it?
The entire nazi machine, everything...<eos> Planes, tanks, troops...<eos> They all run on oil.<eos> If we cripple the supply, it makes the war smaller.<eos> We end it sooner.
Clever.<eos> She ignited the bullets as a distraction. To get himmler's guards away from voigt. Why?<eos> To kill him.<eos> There was a syringe with a lethal fluid hidden.<eos> In the painting. I came to see who would retrieve it.
Agent Keen.<eos> Did you forget her agent status was revoked?<eos> I did not forget that, or the plea agreement I worked out with Laurel Hitchin that kept her out of jail after she shot your Attorney General.<eos> You don't want to dwell on the past, then dwell on this-- the loss of her badge was a stain on Elizabeth's name and reputation, which you are ultimately responsible for.<eos> Your presence in her life has turned it into what it is today.
You really should try Ginny's Cheeseburger Chowder.<eos> The ground chuck and spices, the melted cheese.<eos> I highly recommend it for the inaugural balls.<eos> If you think you can maintain your immunity agreement by blackmailing the President-elect for allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Alexander Kirk, you're not as smart as everyone says you are.<eos> Marlin, your boss made a campaign promise to me, and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
You had access to that chip.<eos> My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.
My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.<eos> I think you sold it to them.
I think she still gives a fuck!"<eos> Yeah.<eos> Quick story.<eos> Me and my wife bought a house in 2011.<eos> And by "me and my wife" I mean I paid for it.
Well, I bought over there, and I bought over here, so I'll put my fucking shoes wherever I want to.<eos> Oh, shirt's coming off!<eos> Where's it going?"<eos> Right?<eos> So we get into the house. She's scoping it out, because she's smart.
I'm guessing the R stands for Raymond?<eos> I've never seen that letter before in my life.<eos> That is true.<eos> It came first thing this morning.<eos> I opened it, I read it and then I threw it away.
I get the picture.<eos> Why was he digging a hole?<eos> He was burying something.<eos> A wooden box. Beautiful carved thing, it was.<eos> Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to go and then I dug it up.
Nothing odd.<eos> Then, why steal the miniature?<eos> Because, presumably, there's something in it that's not in its life-size counterpart.<eos> Well, I made that miniature.<eos> If there was a clue, I would've seen it.
What are you talking about?<eos> You are Inspector Mallory's only alibi.<eos> The only person who can exonerate him.<eos> You want me to tell my husband that I practically did a striptease in front of one of his colleagues?<eos> I'm not saying the conversation won't be awkward, but if you don't have it, he will hang.
Every time I look, the baby's eating sand.<eos> I turn around, sand.<eos> Where does this sand come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, I let them eat it.
What the hell happened to me?<eos> I promise, I'm going to tell you everything, but it's gonna have to be in person.<eos> Roman, look in your pocket.<eos> There's a coin in there, it's a very special coin.<eos> I gave it to you when we were little.
So long as you're not looking, it's okay.<eos> Do you want some of that pizza?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> We're not gonna eat it, so.<eos> If you're... if you're not gonna eat it, why did you order it?
- Why?<eos> - No clue.<eos> DeLuca.<eos> DeLuca, wait!<eos> So, you called a meeting, and they ignored it?
Actually, I don't want to get into it.<eos> We're in it.<eos> You're on Bailey's side on this.<eos> Richard, you're going to have a lovely dinner tonight.<eos> Don't ruin it.
I am Dr...<eos> Not Dr. Grey.<eos> She's not Dr. Grey.<eos> Where's Dr. Grey?<eos> Dr. Grey is unavailable to perform your surgery, Lynne, so, uh, Dr. Kepner will be performing it with Dr. Pierce.
Yeah, I need you to be off leave.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's this sweet little old nun, and she needs open-heart surgery but she can't have it until her brain aneurysm is clipped.
- Thanks.<eos> You lived here with your parents, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I lived here pretty much my whole life.<eos> Um, you know, my mom left it to me and Andi-Rae.
We're all trying to survive up here...<eos> I got my childr... and you're taking more than everybody else!<eos> We all need this water!<eos> They all need water!<eos> We all need it!
Send the old guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No problem.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's your magic wand when you need it?
Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Well, Frank, I'm really sorry about that hose thing.<eos> Oh, no hard feelings.<eos> Shirt needed freshening anyway.<eos> I haven't washed it since we stopped to take pictures at Smokey-Top, Utah's longest, continuously burning tire fire.
Overruled.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Fisk?<eos> They kept changing the broadcast date.<eos> They kept pushing it back, over and over and over again.
We are dealing with people who are coming at us for the smallest infraction.<eos> So, how do we defend ourselves?<eos> Mere puffery.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I haven't used it since law school, but, hey.
But... why?<eos> We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.<eos> You can only relate something that is true or potentially true.<eos> God, I love the law.<eos> And everybody takes it so seriously.
I wasn't.<eos> He asked me to step out of the car so he could search it.<eos> Then he handcuffs me and says I'm under arrest for possession of heroin.<eos> Were you in possession of heroin?<eos> No, he planted it.
Because I was young, woefully foolish and...<eos> Unarmed?<eos> You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...
We have everything we need to go home.<eos> Azrael's blade.<eos> You're sure?<eos> I am.<eos> So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...
So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...<eos> I just wanted you to tell him what you told me, before I make a mess.<eos> What mess are you going to...<eos> That's where it's been this whole time?<eos> Put it somewhere I could keep an eye on it.
Wouldn't want someone to incite another stabbing rampage, now, would we?<eos> Well, it's not my fault humans can't handle the divine.<eos> Besides, if I hadn't done that, we wouldn't have found out what that blade actually is.<eos> And you really think that this is the Flaming Sword?<eos> I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so I wouldn't use it against Him.

No, verbally vicious.<eos> - Terrible grammar. - Mmhmm.<eos> Got you.<eos> Did you see the fight?<eos> Everyone saw it.
Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete.<eos> Dad supposedly destroyed the Flaming Sword after the rebellion.<eos> So, are you saying he just broke it into two pieces?
And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.
- Brother...<eos> - That Father's favorite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.<eos> Look down.<eos> Is that the key around your neck or are you just happy to see me?<eos> He entrusted it... to you, brother.
It's Cheval something or other.<eos> It's valuable, so it must be good.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you or your... deadly light back so soon.<eos> Well, something's been bothering me.<eos> When you first saw my wound... you asked if Lucifer had done it.
- I know.<eos> And she doesn't care who she hurts anymore.<eos> Linda. I'll go check on Linda.<eos> You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.<eos> But, Luci, don't you dare promise her that piece, because I won't give it to her.
The car bomb.<eos> It was as if his security detail knew where to look.<eos> - And you think I told him?<eos> - No one else knew.<eos> Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it.
What exactly kind of problem do you think we're having?<eos> Well, over the past millennium our magnetic field has been decreasing by over 5% per century, and in the last 100 years that accelerated to over 10%.<eos> I'd like to focus on preventing mega solar storms from destroying our nations infrastructure.<eos> That is what I am talking about, Madam President.<eos> If our magnetic field were to dwindle or disappear entirely due to a polarity reversal, then the same storm would cause epic tectonic dislocation and atmospheric sputtering. And the end of all human life as we know it.
- Your invitation.<eos> So what about it?<eos> I can see receiving it upset you.<eos> Look, I-I didn't even know if I should send it.<eos> Held onto it for a long time, but then I thought, if you weren't invited, you would be hurt.
And that's what I'm making.<eos> Now, a Leyden jar is basically a container made of an insulating material, such as Cynthia's bottle... filled with salt water from the ground up roots.<eos> Then I wrap metal... around the container.<eos> Then spike this... down the center.<eos> This spike collects ambient electricity and stores it.
He's been watching her for weeks.<eos> She's had no idea.<eos> Matty, if, uh, you want to step outside, maybe...<eos> No.<eos> No, the key to catching this bastard is somewhere in this room and we're gonna find it.
Yeah, and then they got married.<eos> Then they got pregnant, and then the kid has a tumor in her heart.<eos> I thought you had a TMR.<eos> Yeah, I thought you had a ventral hernia repair.<eos> I did, and I pushed it.
She asked me to hold on to those until you needed them.<eos> I think you needed them.<eos> Put yourself in Pandora's shoes.<eos> She's given a gift a wondrous box, filled with things she never even knew existed.<eos> Of course she opened it.
Don't worry.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Good.<eos> How's your hand?<eos> Hit it on something.
So maybe this is another Black Spring?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I spent six years in jail for doing some pretty awful things, so, if that was the case, I'd be the first one gone.<eos> What were you looking at?<eos> That gray shape out there, you see it?
I love that song.<eos> Mm, me, too.<eos> I find it comforting.<eos> My father would beat my mother.<eos> My sister would bring my brother and me into her room, and she'd play it, turn it up as loud as she could.
I had never held a guy's hand.<eos> I always wanted to... but you know how people are.<eos> I thought he was gonna kill me, so I promised myself, if I survived, I would do that.<eos> I would hold a guy's hand.<eos> I would hold it... walk down the street, and not give a shit about what anybody thought.
All I know.<eos> And what about the night before last?<eos> He tell you anything about that?<eos> He was here.<eos> Rented a movie at Blockbuster, watched it after Raimy went to bed.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What movie?<eos> "Twister""<eos> - You seen it?
We're the only things standing between those monsters and home.<eos> If we run, they'll kill everyone.<eos> How can we possibly win?<eos> This blade... it's called Hrunting.<eos> It was enchanted with light magic to ensure that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed a hero.
Papa.<eos> Don't listen to him, Bae.<eos> He's just jealous.<eos> Maybe, Papa, but he's right about magic.<eos> The war's over. You don't need it anymore.
Think your boy can stop me?<eos> You may have ended The Ogres War, but I'll be remembered as the hero who defeated the Dark One.<eos> This book contains the spell to repair the sword.<eos> Restoring its power is gonna be more difficult than you think.<eos> It requires the blood of the person who forged it.
Ask yourself a question:<eos> What will a Magician need if dark days come?<eos> Answer: magic.<eos> But if it is gone, it is gone, you say.<eos> Not so, if you store it like a battery.
I'm just a big, fat, no-talent loser.<eos> Even your magic pills couldn't help.<eos> - What magic pills?<eos> - The ones in your purse.<eos> I filled it with other pills so I wouldn't get in trouble.
You received everything you desired, and now you realize you don't want to sacrifice your soul, so you're trying to cheat your way out of it, aren't you?<eos> How?<eos> Finally.<eos> Where is the last piece?<eos> I don't have it.
Finally.<eos> Where is the last piece?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I swear to you<eos> I don't have it.
These could shed new light on those events.<eos> And crucial information about the philosopher's stone.<eos> Indeed.<eos> This particular missive contains hidden information on a clandestine meeting between Washington and Benjamin Banneker.<eos> Mr. Banneker, you've found it, haven't you?
Go! Go! Go!<eos> Who is shooting those at us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We must be right on top of the talisman piece.<eos> I'm guessing something doesn't want us to get it.
Their version was a fairy tale that highlighted the creature's deadliest trait.<eos> Its ability to adopt human form.<eos> Not only that, it would disguise itself as someone trusted, someone close to them.<eos> In the case of the pilgrims, the dead girl mercy Bradford's father, captain William Bradford.<eos> Ultimately, they subdued the creature, buried it in an underground chamber, sealed with an enchanted rock.
I got to get patted down by the guy, and I say, "Buy me, uh, dinner first."<eos> One time, he did.<eos> Very awkward.<eos> Well, listen, I need a little pick-me-up.<eos> The bucket is here if you need it.
She is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> This is Artie again, Titus.<eos> Ugh, but the lyrics.<eos> Oh, if you sell it, nobody cares what a song is about.
Uh... uh, let's see.<eos> She specializes in experimental drugs that reverse brain degeneration.<eos> Have you got a photo?<eos> Yep.<eos> Sending it to you guys right now.
It's a joke that thought to do without you.<eos> - I have not seen reason to change it.<eos> - I do.<eos> It's what they expect from me.<eos> If you need more confidence, will you throw it away?
- When?<eos> - Soon.<eos> How?<eos> I am waiting for a signal from the FSB.<eos> When I receive it, I will have to take you to a place... 5 hours drive from here.
Because I begin to understand how they work.<eos> We use what works.<eos> Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, did not he?<eos> The exact same.<eos> Do not ever put it on, it's a pity.
On the left, the one who holds Malotru.<eos> They look the same.<eos> But there are differences.<eos> On this I ask you a question.<eos> And in this... I answer it.
A good father.<eos> Yes, it can be said that has been our father.<eos> We would give everything for you and to please you.<eos> - Then give me your youth, Marie Jeanne.<eos> - He has already taken it from me.
- Were you trying to fiddle the insurance?<eos> - That is outrageous!<eos> Did you kill Walter Dunn?<eos> What?<eos> Did you kill him, take his gun and use it to rob your own post office?
Perhaps Alice killed him and you needed to get her away.<eos> I was at the dentist the night he died.<eos> She was at the church.<eos> You've got the receipt.<eos> I've never seen it before.
I've never seen it before.<eos> I don't know how it got there.<eos> A button is missing.<eos> Like there's been some kind of struggle.<eos> I've never seen it before.
How did it look?<eos> Devonshire was beautiful, Lord.<eos> God be with you.<eos> What binds a man to his land?<eos> What power within allows him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
I'm gonna send you a picture of a map from his house.<eos> It's all the places Lydia's been to, operations she's been on.<eos> I'll see if it matches with any AIC activity.<eos> I'll bring the proof.<eos> You sell it to him.
I know.<eos> Time to grow up, Kar.<eos> Time to fight your fight.<eos> How does this work?<eos> It poisons the light as the beast eats it.
If it helps, I do have a plan.<eos> It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here, Drive it back through the gate.
It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here, Drive it back through the gate.<eos> But how do we keep it there?
Hey. [ Snaps fingers ]<eos> Someone over-caffeinated this morning.<eos> You said you had a case.<eos> Your government's Witness Protection list has been stolen.<eos> You know who stole it?
Giannusa's New Jersey mob.<eos> Justice has a pending racketeering case against him.<eos> Not if their star witness is dead.<eos> If Giannusa gets us to the WITSEC list, why don't we go after him ourselves?<eos> Because you don't know if he has it or where to procure it.
She knows you're FBI?<eos> Keen, we gotta pull you out.<eos> Margot's contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong.<eos> We have no jurisdiction there.<eos> Our only shot at recovering the WITSEC list is to have The Harem steal it, and I've got to be there.
You act like it's too late.<eos> It isn't. You could still get out.<eos> I dream about that, the life I had, wishing I could get it back.<eos> [ Whispers ] I can help you.<eos> The WITSEC list, when we get it back, I can get you on it.
Eva Taylor and Lily Hum.<eos> Aram, can you--<eos> - Tracking them as we speak.<eos> - Look, what about the list?<eos> Emma took it.
There are!<eos> Like fine wines!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> I can't wait to get back to Chiswick.<eos> Yeah, because London piss is like sparkling water, you just drink it straight back down again.
Go into the right-hand wardrobe.<eos> No, not the left one!<eos> Do NOT go in the left!<eos> Right, inside, you'll see a grey safe.<eos> I need you to open it.
I can barely even remember what being human is like.<eos> Liv.<eos> The syringes... They're gone.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?
I can't imagine a life without all that.<eos> So, Tinker Bell was wrong, then.<eos> That isn't your happy ending.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> But it did give me hope when I needed it most, and that was just as important.
Got a mouth on him, hasn't he?<eos> Keep an eye on him, Carol.<eos> Despite not having the first fucking clue about golf, it wasn't going to stop me looking the part.<eos> Or, to be more precise, looking like a kids' TV presenter who got dressed in the dark.<eos> Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick was discovering that new technology is only ever as reliable as the fuckwit operating it.
I can show you how it works.<eos> So, 10 minutes prep, and you pop it in the oven for 35 minutes.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - That's all.<eos> You know, I used to make my own tomato sauce, but now with my schedule so crazy, I just buy it out of a jar.
They've stood for something larger than themselves, and that takes courage.<eos> And you've shown a lot of courage, too.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Despite all the garbage that you have had to deal with, you asked for the truth, and you faced it.
I got a permit for this, I'm in the military.<eos> He does.<eos> I want to see some ID.<eos> - Right now.<eos> - I... I don't have it on me.
It's a gift from our youngest daughter, and it deserves a place of honor.<eos> Oh, I just can't stand it.<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> Marilyn!<eos> I'm putting it in the basement.
A doll's foot, I hope.<eos> A farm-to-table dog bakery.<eos> Ooh, Stella and I went to one of those in Solvang.<eos> She got a quiche.<eos> It looked so good, I almost split it with her.
I need a scotch and a James Bond marathon.<eos> You may be out of luck.<eos> The TV wasn't working a minute ago.<eos> Sounds like the satellite dish.<eos> Big Hands probably messed it up poking around in my gutters.
Hold on, Bob. It's my son.<eos> - Luke, what's up?<eos> - Dad?<eos> I think something's wrong with the dryer.<eos> But I-I fixed it.
So you mean Laurie still has a chance to survive this coup?<eos> Well, then why did you say I should bro down with Ed Chen?<eos> I say a lot of things, Monica.<eos> I say a lot of things.<eos> I know you think I'm some sort of crusading badass who built a ticking time bomb and slipped it to Gavin Belson to bring him down as retribution for his wrongdoings.
I just think it's all over for me now.<eos> No, it's... it's not over.<eos> Look... I chose to partner with you. That...<eos> That says something. You didn't want me. You wanted the patent.<eos> If I had just given it to you, you would've walked out that door and never looked back.
We got to get the lights back on.<eos> Come on, let's...<eos> Ryan, stop, stop.<eos> My gun.<eos> I think someone took it.
The fence is electric.<eos> It's not a cross.<eos> It's an imprint of the fence.<eos> You'd have to hold his hand there for a long time.<eos> Or somebody else held it there.
I got to go check on him.<eos> But I promise you guys it won't take long.<eos> Save me a piece.<eos> Hey, and, Raims, put back the spare key.<eos> I didn't take it!
Police!<eos> Show me your hands!<eos> Drop it!<eos> The deed to the house is still in my name, isn't it?<eos> Decker get it in the divorce?
I need your help.<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> Sorry about this...<eos> There is a list of names in there.<eos> I need you to show it to me.
"Loretta Dunkel"?<eos> Haha! - Now I know where you live.<eos> - I want my money!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - I earned it!
- This is such a glorious day...<eos> Courtney?<eos> Actually, I'm Courtney.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Did you make it yourself?
Actually, I'm Courtney.<eos> I love your hat.<eos> Did you make it yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I bought it from a hat maker.
_<eos> Maybe we shouldn't either.<eos> We put it in the milk!<eos> We tell Voss, new idea.<eos> We suspend the coke inside a container-load of milk, ship it across the border then bake it back to its crystal form.
You're pathetic, Novak.<eos> I'm done with you, man.<eos> All the charges against the Mennonites have been dropped because of your incompetence, Novak.<eos> Not his, yours!<eos> So if you can still find your own badge, I want it on my desk.
You'd kill me, like you killed my father?<eos> You know what, arman, you know a lot but more important what you don't understand which is that money sometimes requires a sacrifice.<eos> Bytheway,you finish Olga'sportrait?<eos> - I have a recent shotofher.<eos> I'm gonna send it right now.
Yeah, the DA's showing a lot of trust giving Chantal first chair, could be a career-maker.<eos> But after Roy's outburst at her office, her boss is worried her head's not in the game.<eos> He might pull her off the case.<eos> I just, I don't want what I did to cause her any grief.<eos> This impression, you see it?
Well, one of 'em has to be Fen.<eos> Okay, bottom line it for me.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> I'm sorry, Your Highness.<eos> But this magic, I've never seen it before.
Uh... Dad.<eos> Oh, Evan, hi. What's up?<eos> I have a problem.<eos> The letter was right here, stamped and addressed, and now it's gone.<eos> So? Your mom probably mailed it.
No way.<eos> You know, $5 could de-barnacle a whole pod.<eos> Okay, now let's go over the plan again.<eos> I pretend to lose my car keys down this grate, then when the mailman comes to help me,<eos> I hit the mail out of his hands, you grab the letter and rip it up.
All right, last question.<eos> Have any famous dogs stayed there?<eos> Maybe that dog from The Artist might have stayed there once.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, guys, a table just opened up if you want to grab it.
Oh, man, I got songs.<eos> I got a bunch, man.<eos> I just haven't gotten a chance to get in the studio professionally.<eos> I've got a demo tape i can get ya.<eos> Look, I love Nashville and I love country music, and we honor it and respect it.
And she was refused help.<eos> But she never gave up.<eos> She didn't stop.<eos> She did not choose the easy way out.<eos> Had she seen any other viable option, she would have taken it.
- Like who?<eos> People.<eos> - Do come back soon, Leif. - Yes.<eos> Would you give me a hand moving our old fireplace out?<eos> Someone's picking it up later.
- Naustvik.<eos> - Naustvik.<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> But Leif, the information I give you when we meet...<eos> What do you use it for?
I know. I not only wanna have sex in this truck... I wanna have sex with this truck.<eos> Damn.<eos> It's like what the pope would drive if he was a redneck.<eos> - Where'd you get this?<eos> - Got it last night from Neumann's Hill.
Oh, hey, I, uh... I brought you somethin'.<eos> Whoa! Shit.<eos> It's, uh... my, uh, Saint Christopher's medal.<eos> I know it's silly, but when I was playin' football, I had, like, four surgeries on my knee.<eos> I wore it every time, came out fine.
Thanks.<eos> "Genital Warts and You."<eos> Why are they kayaking'?<eos> All right, Ma...<eos> I thawed out that pipe in the attic... Flushed it and replaced the section that burst.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> Shit, we should do it.<eos> We used to own that thing in high school.<eos> We can use my uncle Jimmy's fishin' hut.<eos> I mean, he's not gonna need it for the next three to five years.
You were together a long time.<eos> It's been years since Jim passed and he's still on my mind.<eos> Just the other day, I was cleanin' out the garage, and... I found an old T-shirt of his that he'd worn on our honeymoon.<eos> And I smelled it just to bring him back, I guess.<eos> Forgot that we'd turned it into an old turpentine rag.
Sulu.<eos> Magnify the primary hull.<eos> The Defiant?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> The ship's wave signature is out of phase from when we last encountered it.
I did what I needed to... to save him.<eos> When I found him he was as young as you.<eos> Now he's a shadow of his former self.<eos> Take care.<eos> A shadow can be larger than the man that casts it.
Go talk some sense into him.<eos> To what end, doctor?<eos> You and I both know he will not change his mind.<eos> Samara and I will tow the Enterprise to a safe distance.<eos> Then we'll enter the rift and seal it.
Doesn't that seem weird to you?<eos> I always thought it was a little odd.<eos> Why? Why odd?<eos> Well, your brother... He seemed to have that camera glued to his face all the time.<eos> It-It just didn't make any sense to leave it behind.
Shit!<eos> Okay, we're gonna use this as a flashlight.<eos> Okay, just flash it in front of me, all right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't drop it.
[Greengrass] Then he takes the rushes.<eos> He knows what he's got.<eos> He didn't just want it to be rushes to be cannibalized by the Department of the Navy or bureaucrats somewhere else in the Pentagon.<eos> He wanted to make a film.<eos> He got the film and got out and brought it to Washington.
He wanted to make a film.<eos> He got the film and got out and brought it to Washington.<eos> How he did it, I don't know.<eos> I suspect he said it was a box of cigars or something.<eos> I don't know how he got it out, but he got it out.
This book was written 20 years ago.<eos> The plan which it foreshadowed has become a reality.<eos> [narrator] Audiences saw a portrait of black America that no mainstream movie had ever attempted.<eos> The film was given a wide theatrical release in both black and white markets.<eos> The writer and poet Langston Hughes praised the film, calling it "distinctly and thrillingly worthwhile."
"We don't need this anymore."<eos> Not only from a practical point of view, but from a human point of view.<eos> [narrator] After three days with no sign of surrender from Japan, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.<eos> [General MacArthur] I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to sign the instrument of surrender at the places indicated.<eos> Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always.
Instead, in the 1950s, he reemerged as one of Hollywood's most thoughtful and respected directors of drama.<eos> I hated to see him leave comedy for the other stuff that came later on, for the more serious stuff, because nobody could do comedy quite like he was doing it.<eos> [narrator] Stevens had taken all of the footage he had shot throughout the war and at Dachau and locked it up in a warehouse.<eos> He retrieved the reels only once, in 1959, when he was preparing to direct The Diary of Anne Frank.<eos> He went alone to the screening room to watch the footage, put on the first reel of film, and after about one minute, turned it off.
Go!<eos> Chomping at the bit. What's going on?<eos> We need 24hour watch on Guero, and we need it now.<eos> For more bullshit about Phoenix and Middle Easterns?<eos> You don't buy a shirt unless there's a girl around to take it off.
She's our child, Camila.<eos> Listen, how much is the payment to this man?<eos> $3 million.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna get the cash to cover your first payment.<eos> Then I'm gonna take the coke you got from them, move it myself, and pay off that psychotic zealot.
I should've taken care of it in Bolivia.<eos> He can't stay here.<eos> I'm not ready to make that decision yet.<eos> We first have to move the product.<eos> You're not giving it to Epifanio.
You needed an army?<eos> I got us one.<eos> The tunnel is under the van on the left.<eos> Damn. You weren't lying.<eos> Coke comes from Mexico through the tunnel and then the vans take it to Dallas.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> Like the societal event of the season... her son's engagement party.<eos> We've used my personal life already.<eos> - We're not using it again.
Better.<eos> Swelling went down.<eos> We need to keep rubbing that coneflower on you, mornings and night.<eos> Those savages know about coneflower?<eos> They call it tuka natsu.
- You have to go.<eos> - No. Why?<eos> No one wants you here. Do you understand that?<eos> They've all been waiting for an excuse.<eos> My father gave it to them.
That's all good friend stuff.<eos> Okay, let me, uh, toss out a hypothetical to you, okay?<eos> Nick has a piece of lint on his sleeve.<eos> Do you go, "Hey, bud, you got some lint on your sleeve"?<eos> Or do you pick it off?
A little piece of lint on his sleeve.<eos> - I wouldn't do anything.<eos> - What would you just want to...<eos> Fine!<eos> I'd want to pick it off with my bare hands!
I'll tell her Don burned it and I'll be free from the shackles of this lie forever.<eos> Just promise me you'll keep my secret.<eos> Uh, it's okay, Lowell, everyone has secrets.<eos> Andi's famous ginger chicken soup?<eos> We bought it at a gas station.
Uh, it's okay, Lowell, everyone has secrets.<eos> Andi's famous ginger chicken soup?<eos> We bought it at a gas station.<eos> It was really just chicken soup that we poured ginger ale into.<eos> - I'd throw it out.
Not without some buffalo tranquilizers.<eos> Don't put my pants on the fire!<eos> Calm down, sis.<eos> Of course, we own the house.<eos> Mom and Dad left it to all of us.
Shouldn't come as a surprise, he's a lot like you.<eos> He's nothin' like me.<eos> My father gave me that knife. I said, "Thank you, sir," and shook his hand.<eos> You know, that's the warmest memory you ever shared with me.<eos> And later that night, I stuck it through a possum's head that was eatin' my mother's garden.
Yeah, but I call your office,<eos> - you won't call me back.<eos> - I get lots of calls.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Put your concerns down in a letter and I'll read it, I promise.
We made it through that.<eos> I don't know why I'm on birth control anymore.<eos> You guys know that there's now a male birth control pill.<eos> Do you know this?<eos> They're still testing it, but I want him to go on it immediately.
I'm probably still the voice on his answering machine.<eos> You told me that was your mother.<eos> Um... can I have my soda?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll give it to him.
- I am a little cold.<eos> - Really?<eos> I'm warm.<eos> I'll open the window.<eos> If you're looking for your drink, I moved it over there.
It's good.<eos> After this one we can change it.<eos> Are you flashing the light?<eos> I'm flashing it.<eos> I'm-I'm shaking it.
This is tearing us apart.<eos> Bob, you're ruining the egg hunt.<eos> No, you are!<eos> Stop!<eos> You both ruined it!
And Tina and Gene feel the same way.<eos> Okay, she's right, we do.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't like the egg hunt?<eos> It's not that we don't like it, it's just that we hate it.
Okay, she's right, we do.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't like the egg hunt?<eos> It's not that we don't like it, it's just that we hate it.<eos> You hate it?
How did he do...<eos> Smartest one in the room.<eos> Hello.<eos> Paige, we can't turn the music off in this thing!<eos> I didn't know that when I rented it; just check the manual.
Isn't it beautiful?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's certainly interesting.<eos> That's a lot of dirt up there.<eos> Sal says I'm hoarding all the power, but I need it.
Who you calling reject, you tailless, bulb-headed hack?<eos> Hack?<eos> The High Evolutionary is no hack!<eos> Let me demonstrate.<eos> I have absorbed the raw genetic clay from thousands of beings and modeled it into perfection.
What did your brother know that you didn't want brought to light?<eos> Look, Roman would have killed me or died trying before letting me bring him to the FBI, so wiping his memory was the only option I had.<eos> And this call that you made to erase all the knowledge from your most valuable asset, was that made with Assistant Director Weller's approval?<eos> No.<eos> I made it on my own.
Yeah, sure.<eos> I've dragged you all the way here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know all your stuff's getting damp?<eos> The people who had the house before me said they damp-proofed it in the '90s.
I thought you were a PE teacher?<eos> Argh! Jesus Christ!<eos> Is that my money?<eos> - Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.
- Give me the card!<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!
- Give me the fucking card!<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> I don't have it on me!<eos> It's in the post.<eos> I sent it to your wife.
I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood.<eos> Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom.<eos> She'd walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse.<eos> Wouldn't say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit.<eos> Then she'd walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table.
- I'm afraid that won't be possible.<eos> Krilov is a person of interest in a criminal investigation.<eos> I want to be cooperative, but he's a guest.<eos> And that letter is private property.<eos> I can't let you take it without a warrant.
Priority three.<eos> There were three men.<eos> I didn't see a body, at first.<eos> Just a... a rug or a rolled up tarp.<eos> But when they put it in the back of the van, it...
Krilov was hired to adjust someone's memory.<eos> We confiscated his lab.<eos> So he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.
We confiscated his lab.<eos> So he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.<eos> That's why we needed you to get it back.
All right, now, we're officially out of "Reader's Digest" territory.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Okay.<eos> The Soyuz is kinda like a space taxi.<eos> So, if we can just get them to just drive it out there to the satellite.
We recovered that murder weapon from the shooter's home. I went over the report six times before I called.<eos> Seventeen years ago, you recovered a gun that was the same caliber, make and model.<eos> But the bullet itself was too disfigured for a conclusive ID.<eos> Luckily, microscopy's gotten a little better since then.<eos> So I pulled the original slug and I tested it against the one in the killing today.
Apparently the same weapon was used in the Ruffalo murder.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> That's what I said, but...<eos> - Well, who ran it?
- Hm. Yeah, so did I.<eos> You know who else looks different these days?<eos> Terrance Valentine.<eos> The man you put in prison for a crime you did. Wrong.<eos> The gun... the one you kept all these years... your son used it to murder somebody last night.
And so, uh, I pulled the gun out.<eos> Just to, uh, show him I was serious.<eos> And, uh, and he said, "Bitch, you gonna bring a gun? "You better be ready to use it."<eos> And I don't even remember pulling the trigger.<eos> But after it went off, I dropped it and ran.
I worked a lot of cases with the guy.<eos> He had no problem cutting corners.<eos> Why'd you keep the gun?<eos> I didn't know it was the same gun.<eos> Otherwise, I would've thrown it in the river.
I am and so is Anna, but she also knows that if treatment stops working, extreme measure won't turn the tide.<eos> Look, this isn't a white flag.<eos> It's a worst case scenario.<eos> She said she had a fever.<eos> She does, but we're treating it.
I can't find my wallet.<eos> Let me get it.<eos> My coffee, her yogurt.<eos> Come on, go sit down.<eos> I think someone stole it.
I'll have someone come grab you, okay?<eos> Dr. Stohl, I... I found your mug.<eos> Where?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll, um, call maintenance to get it down.
If I'm successful, you'll have more benefits as the boss.<eos> If I fail... I'm going to die anyway.<eos> Rules are rules.<eos> And you broke all of them.<eos> I saw the opportunity... and I just took it.
No, you're missing the point.<eos> I just want you to admit you only stopped me because I'm black and to apologize and say you won't do it again!<eos> Hey, look.<eos> We wouldn't even be having this conversation if you had your badge on you.<eos> Next time, don't forget it.
Won't check what?<eos> Christina!<eos> How are you?<eos> Great jacket. Where'd you get it?<eos> You know, I got it at Mervyn's.
Captain Holt's mom.<eos> The creator.<eos> Widowed at age 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt singlehandedly raised two children and still managed to become one of the first black, female federal judges.<eos> Wow, someone read her Wikipedia page.<eos> No, Jake, I wrote it.
A place with so many stains that the new ones just blended in.<eos> Where the couch cushions were so worn down, they comforted all butts, large or small, flat or juicy.<eos> - Juicy?<eos> - Gross.<eos> We built a masterpiece, and you amateurs flushed it down the toilet.
Well, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Alas, we are not cowabunga people.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Once again, I am so sorry about your tire.<eos> Just accidentally slashed it with my knife.
- No, you are!<eos> - Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.<eos> Yes, it's all no one is talking about.<eos> Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and...<eos> I lost it.
- He's real clumsy.<eos> If the wrong person saw that tape, they might get the wrong idea.<eos> You know, I saw the tape, and it was shocking how clumsy that guy actually was.<eos> - Right?<eos> - And the funny thing is, I meant to save the file, but I deleted it by accident.
- Hey!<eos> Do you know what went wrong with Phil?<eos> Yeah, I couldn't stop the bleeding.<eos> Bleeding couldn't be stopped.<eos> But what went wrong was that we made you think that you two had to stop it alone.
But if we can create a 20,000 volt lightning strike in the sand pit...<eos> That'll create a glass barrier in the middle of the coal vein, cutting off the fire from the depot.<eos> Okay, but how are you gonna create a lightning strike?<eos> Sand's an insulator.<eos> We'll wet it with saline solution so it conducts electricity.
Happy, where are we on a solution?<eos> I think we've got something.<eos> The chief's firehouse covers the airport, which means it carries a tank of high-expansion concentrate for jet-fuel fires.<eos> We're going to remove the nozzle from the hose.<eos> Cabe slides it in through the cracks in the rocks.

I think he wins.<eos> My dad left, and every time she looked at me, I was just a reminder.<eos> - Oh, that's so sad.<eos> - What about my story?<eos> It's sad, too. I've just heard it a lot.
How long were we gone?<eos> - Home. - BONNIE:<eos> Kitchen.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm trying to get him to take his pill, but he keeps spitting it out.
- Yeah, plus, remember how much time you spend on the floor when you have a baby?<eos> I can't do that anymore.<eos> I'll be down there till the kid's old enough to help me up.<eos> Well, that's a great point.<eos> The other day, I dropped a strawberry and just kicked it under the fridge.
If, in addition to this journal, you've found a small skeleton in an elf costume, you now know why.<eos> After the dinner incident, things just got more tense.<eos> But some desperately held onto hope.<eos> For that bottle to reach Allie, it would have to get down to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, get swept up into the Benguela, caught in the South Equatorial stream, switch to the North stream, somehow find its way to the Gulf Stream<eos> and hope that some Florida fisherman found it and mailed it to her.

You're on my team.<eos> I sincerely hope you haven't come here for the radio.<eos> Walt, we need it to monitor the storms and locations of other ships.<eos> You'll sink it.<eos> Besides, we need it for its crank and some of its components to create a charge on the magnet.

We got a problem here.<eos> Where's the crank?<eos> The radio's useless without it.<eos> What are you trying to pull?<eos> I swear, this is where I hid it.
You've had a lot of fits and starts with EQ, but you've always seemed to be on a forward path.<eos> You know, my overwhelming emotion right now is that I... I feel...<eos> Well, a little sick to my stomach.<eos> Mmm, do you have a bottle of wine upstairs?<eos> Uh, someone gave it to us after a-a job.
I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will be enjoying the blood money he's earning as soon as Houston Spivey's name is called in the draft.<eos> Well, the lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk was a match for the victims.<eos> And he knew about the murder weapon.<eos> He knew about it, couldn't produce it though, could he?<eos> He said he threw it off the Staten Island Ferry.
But like I said, it was the worst pitch of your life.<eos> The blood of both victims and your fingerprints are all over it.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did you think you heard someone coming?<eos> You panicked, threw it as far as you could?
Where's my hoverboard?"<eos> "Fuck you, Joe.<eos> Fuck you."<eos> Don't buy that hoverboard.<eos> I don't even know why they sell it in America.
[Yorkey] We wanted to begin by telling the truth about what effect these events would have.<eos> We felt like if we could tell a story, not only with integrity, but hopefully one that had a chance to really resonate with young people who don't necessarily get a steady diet of truth in their entertainment,<eos> [shrieks, then giggles]<eos> [Langford] With the photo that's taken of Hannah, it was innocent, but an unflattering photo out of context, posted by a guy with a particular rep, or saying something, or spinning the story some kind of way can destroy someone.<eos> And when Bryce takes the photo from Justin and sends it round the school, it's the beginning of the end for her.
You gotta start opening up to us, kid.<eos> Just, you know, let us know what's going on.<eos> It's hard to be the parent of a teenager.<eos> The teenagers are trying to establish some independence.<eos> Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they're also pushing it away.

I'll kill myself."<eos> You can do that.<eos> You can do that once.<eos> But you can do it.<eos> It's interesting because even when life gets bad, people choose it over nothing.
They never know.<eos> "Do you know anything about the dog?" "Uh, she's afraid of pennies.<eos> So, we think maybe somebody's been throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.<eos> But, otherwise, no."<eos> So, you take this random dog and just put it in your house with your family, and watch their personality unfold.
"Hi, what is this job?"<eos> And they say, "Okay, here's what we need you to do.<eos> We need you to make children know math."<eos> "Do they wanna know math?" "No, they don't want to know it.<eos> You need to make them know it against their will.
But anyway... [audience laughing]<eos> We had a whole other thing going on.<eos> This building's not here anymore.<eos> But...<eos> You're watching it on a dusty thing, and it's all rubble.
And every time I'm flipping around and it comes on, I always stop.<eos> And then I play a little game of chicken with this movie.<eos> I stop because it's a good movie.<eos> It's well made, directed by Steven Soderbergh, good director.<eos> And so I get into it, I get into the story, and then they start stripping.
The Zombie Titular.<eos> I'm not a Goddamn...<eos> I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again...

They got no issue killing cops, Bob Lee.<eos> Ain't gonna be no different with a war hero.<eos> I appreciate the concern, but Dobbs was my brother.<eos> There's a neighborhood, if you can call it that, out off Highway 7.<eos> You'll know the house when you see it.
Bolivian coke.<eos> Hmm. Purity?<eos> 98%.<eos> This ends now.<eos> Did you pay for it or steal it?
Hesitation is a stutter step.<eos> I needed to take a full one.<eos> I had to force you to the table somehow.<eos> Well, you wanted my attention, Ms. Vargas.<eos> Now you have it.
Here, take your car.<eos> Meet Devon.<eos> We'll get him help.<eos> Well, you wanted my attention, Miss Vargas.<eos> Now you have it.
Take the elevator to P3 and wait for me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I have a plan.<eos> I've been mourning my dad long enough. Pendejo didn't even leave me his motorcycle.<eos> You would have wrecked it anyway.
While you guys debate the bioethics of invisible snakes, I think I know a way to see it.<eos> Anacondas and pythons can survive for 14 weeks without food.<eos> Our window for catching this thing is, is closing.<eos> Think your white whale's here, Max.<eos> No, don't kill it!
Yeah, I got it.<eos> Make it all electric-y.<eos> Okay, we're close.<eos> That thing's pretty slick.<eos> Dr. Abe just whipped it up in a matter of minutes.
Granting you immunity in exchange for your testimony takes away your right to plead the Fifth.<eos> How-- how can they do that, take away my Constitutional right by granting me something that I don't want?<eos> I... I don't want immunity.<eos> You can...<eos> Um, I refuse, uh, to let you grant it.
I'm sorry, um... why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I meant what I said.<eos> I'm angry that you still don't know why Reddington walked into your life.<eos> The blood on this shirt from Raymond Reddington has been sealed in an evidence locker for over three decades.<eos> I procured a sample and submitted it for a DNA profile.
No, our question to you is: did you know?<eos> Because if you did and you're withholding evidence that could put Ukhov away, then obviously that would make you an accessory to murder.<eos> I swear to you, if I had known a thing about what you're saying, I would've called the cops myself.<eos> I have no idea what Ukhov did with that info.<eos> I e-mailed it to him yesterday, and we haven't spoken since.
But it's information on him that we need.<eos> Now, in a moment-- if you agree-- you and I are gonna call a bank in the Cayman Islands, and we're going to request information regarding an account there.<eos> The account belongs to a company which has billed your husband's company millions of dollars over the years in "document handling fees."<eos> The truth is, these charges are fabrications.<eos> Your husband owns that company as well, and he's using it to hide money.
Are you a man or a woman?<eos> The first answers were something like:<eos> I am a man.<eos> And I am using a language, culture, etc. which is given to be feminine.<eos> I am invading this field and claiming it for my own use too.
Actually, we already checked.<eos> At the time of Nanette Vlasik's death, your camera was recording footage of different costumed characters around Times Square.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I was looking for my next target in the game.<eos> Problem is, whoever was wearing that camera never spoke, never turned it on themselves, never filmed any reflective surfaces.
So, Clem and her being pregnant, how does that factor into all of this?<eos> The child has a unique protein.<eos> Unlike anything I've ever seen.<eos> It displays even greater potential than the NLRP2 protein at synthesizing the reproductive hormone that we need.<eos> I'm going to call it the CLM-protein.
Misfortune has been continuing for the past few years.<eos> Our family for one, but our neighbor as well.<eos> There once was a prolific author living there, but passed away from illness. It's been empty since.<eos> They say you can hear the piano playing nightly, and see a ghost in a white dress.<eos> The community around here calls it the haunted mansion.
My heart, only when free, can spread the wings of creation and flutter!<eos> This is weird. The other day, I thought she was a cool person.<eos> Anyway, Masamune, let's do some cooperative play.<eos> Hey, Yamada-sensei. Weren't you going to create the ultimate light-novel?<eos> I will create it, of course.
I never visited the crime scene.<eos> I never spoke to the friends and family of the victim, or the alleged killer.<eos> You were never asked to.<eos> And the chain still hasn't been found.<eos> What if that's because Luke Munro was telling the truth, and the real culprit took it with him when he fled?
You mean before your failed operation.<eos> What went wrong there, guys? Look, a few days ago I went to Mr. Folsom's home with two of our consultants.<eos> One of them noticed an encryption device in his apartment.<eos> Now, it could be Mr. Folsom noticed him noticing, realized that we could get up on their communications.<eos> The operation this morning, we went looking for a smoking gun, we didn't get it.
I've seen plenty of ODs. Normally, with coke, a patient presents like somebody who suffered cardiac arrest.<eos> They're drenched in sweat, but that's about it.<eos> This guy's eyes were really red.<eos> And it looked like there was a chemical burn in his nasal cavity.<eos> Pretty sure it was bleach. We found his stash at the scene, sent it to the lab so they could test it, but I thought I smelled traces of chlorine.
I don't want to brag or anything like that.<eos> But it's in my belly right now as we speak.<eos> And I realized that you... you eat at a restaurant different than you eat at home, you know?<eos> Like, at home you would never cook up a pork chop on your skillet, you know, and make it nice and hot on one side, then turn it over, make it hot on the other side, and then cut into it and see how it's going in the middle. And then you go, "Man, I'm going to love eating this delicious pork chop."<eos> As soon as it's hot enough to eat, I'll eat it.
I mean, you're the victim in this whole thing."<eos> "I remember at the vows, I kept thinking,"<eos> I am going to seduce "every member of my wife's family."<eos> "Regardless of gender, I'm going to fuck all of them."<eos> "Then, afterwards," I'm going to invite them over to the house "and set it on fire, killing them all."
- It was crazy fast!<eos> - You're fast.<eos> - Mike, seriously, I appreciate you being so understanding.<eos> The appointment is tonight at 7:00.<eos> - Rachel, I have a meeting tonight with my pro bono, and I can't put it off.
Thinking it's time I got a raise.<eos> - Easy, tiger.<eos> Mike, seriously,<eos> I thought you were busy with that pro bono.<eos> - I am. Donna said you needed my help, so... I gave it to you.
- Anything else you want me to fix for you - before I get back to my case? - I'll let you know<eos> - after I see Louis. - What do you mean?<eos> - I mean if he couldn't stop Bratton from poaching his client, us doing what we just did<eos> - But you said Louis made it clear he doesn't want your help.<eos> - He may not want it, but if that shit's not taken care of, he's getting it whether he likes it or not.
And breaking attorney-client privilege is a dis-barrable offense, and if we find out that's what's been<eos> - happening here... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.<eos> Like you said, I used a loophole.<eos> 'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.<eos> So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson Specter, they're not getting it from me.
This is a fight you started.<eos> And this is a fight that you cannot win.<eos> So you give me back my clients, or your legacy at Pearson Specter Litt is going to be that you were the one that put them in the ground.<eos> - Let me get this straight.<eos> I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life, and you want me to turn it down based on a feeling that whatever happened to Chris
- I don't know what that means.<eos> - Then listen to me right now.<eos> I know that you know my parents died in a car accident.<eos> But what you don't know is that after they did, a lawyer... came to my grandmother and made her an offer.<eos> She took it, instead of going to court.
I've spent the last 30 years as a freelance writer... going wherever I could to do my job and make a living.<eos> It's been a life of wandering around... and finding a good story, getting an editor to agree to cover it... and assign me to it.

As soon as, uh, it was done and over, "Thank you very much,"<eos> I'd throw it in a box like these boxes you see...<eos> There are other rooms downstairs.<eos> ...and start cranking on the next one.<eos> Damn it, where the hell did I put it?
And I've served Mass for different priests.<eos> And one day, we were getting ready for Mass...<eos> You know, the altar boys, we'd get there a little early.<eos> He'd come into the sacristy and, um...<eos> He takes a handgun out of his pocket and put it on the... the counter in the sacristy.
And that's when I heard the police officer say:<eos> "I don't want to," and Maskell encouraging him.<eos> I was sitting across the table from him... and he had a gun.<eos> And he's taking the bullets out one by one. And he's saying that if my father ever found out that I was whoring around...<eos> And then he took the gun, he put it up to my... my temple, and he pulled the trigger, and he said he will do the same thing, but he'll keep the bullets in.
On one side, it's marked 1712.<eos> "Right and prosperity to Scotland."<eos> That would've been prior to the 1745 rebellion.<eos> So, this sword's been around.<eos> I'd love to know who carried it.
She ran interference.<eos> How did she run interference?<eos> Ask for a warrant. "I'll have to look at it.<eos> I don't know."<eos> If you got information, and you don't get it within the first 48, it's gone.
I never experienced any pressure from the Catholic Church not to investigate.<eos> I didn't always get, necessarily, the level of cooperation that I would've liked.<eos> I wasn't and still am not Catholic, so, I didn't have any issues that, you know, challenged my faith or upset my idea of right and wrong.<eos> No. You know, no.<eos> The allegation was made, I looked at it.
But Jane is the link between Joseph Maskell, the abuse at Keough, and Cathy Cesnik's murder.<eos> This is really her story.<eos> When the Facebook group started, when the two ladies decided they were just going to start a conversation about the death of Cathy Cesnik... I waited.<eos> Back in 1992, '93, I was using my voice and I thought it was going somewhere.<eos> And instead, they silenced it.
Edgar was a man who lived a complicated life.<eos> I mean, he was arrested for car theft two years after Cathy was murdered, and he was loitering at the middle school trying to pick up middle school girls in a stolen car.<eos> And literally, the middle school is here and Cathy's apartment complex is here.<eos> They butt up against each other at parking lots.<eos> We looked at him because Edgar's first wife, who I believe, she gave us this complicated story, and we researched it and looked it up, and everything was true.
It was a black... No, no.<eos> The vagina was wrapped in newspaper.<eos> So, it was...<eos> It looked like a heart wrapped up.<eos> And he threw it on the table.
I called my father, who'd worked for the post office.<eos> He said, "Tell me everything that the postmark says."<eos> He said, "Marilyn, it was sent after Cathy went missing.<eos> It was not sent before.<eos> Stay there and don't move and don't open it, because it could be evidence.
He said, "Tell me everything that the postmark says."<eos> He said, "Marilyn, it was sent after Cathy went missing.<eos> It was not sent before.<eos> Stay there and don't move and don't open it, because it could be evidence.<eos> So, please, don't open it, Marilyn."
Do you know who did it?<eos> But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?<eos> Could I just look at it?<eos> Could I read it?<eos> They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.
They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.<eos> It existed.<eos> There's no doubt it existed.<eos> There's no doubt it was given to the police.<eos> There's no doubt the police had it.
My understanding from her is that the letter is lost or has disappeared?<eos> Yeah, well, I know about the letter.<eos> I have information about the letter, that there was a letter received by her sister afterwards.<eos> But as far as I know, the letter isn't a part of the evidence anymore.<eos> The city would have had possession of that, and we've never seen it.
Is anyone out there?"<eos> And it's still silent.<eos> But we're hearing each other... because we're all coming up to the crack.<eos> And what's happening is, is we're bumping into each other, coming to the crack.<eos> And before you know it, the pressure of that voice seeping through the crack is going to shatter it.
- Only if you have time.<eos> Excuse me, you've dropped your boot.<eos> Oh!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Should I put it on for you?
- Well, straight home now.<eos> - Yeah, I am!<eos> - Come with me to my...<eos> I do not need this fucking shit, Callum!<eos> I don't fucking need it either!
So, the first shot they do, they do a big, wide shot of the whole scene with all the characters and everything.<eos> They do that a few times.<eos> Then they go in close and they shoot, like, a tight shot where it's just, like...<eos> You only see, like, three of the characters.<eos> And when they exit that scene, like, in our minds we see the whole room because we've seen it before.
And I... It felt...<eos> It was, like, so much relief.<eos> And then my friend John was standing in the corner.<eos> And I guess... I don't remember this. I was told this.<eos> I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John.
And then my friend John was standing in the corner.<eos> And I guess... I don't remember this. I was told this.<eos> I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John.<eos> And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down.<eos> That I served it?
- Not yet, but if you take care of something for me,<eos> - Lockwood's launching a solar panel?<eos> Since when are they in the renewable energy business?<eos> - Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne. - No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.
Almost.<eos> See if you can increase the through put by another ten percent.<eos> I'm not sure what the rush is.<eos> We can't even launch the thing.<eos> The Russians are just gonna shoot it out of the sky.
Okay.<eos> Whatever we stole from you is retribution.<eos> Retribution for what?<eos> Something called Atlas.<eos> Grace Barrows got this information from the Russian ambassador and kept it from us.
I'm with my family.<eos> Katya, things are urgent.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, you wanted Darius's attention, and you got it.
There's a record of the call in the log.<eos> And I gave my personal code?<eos> - Absolutely, sir.<eos> - That's odd, I have no record of that call on my phone.<eos> My cell didn't record it, either.
You go to 44th and 8th to that hand-job parlor?<eos> What's it called again, Shake Shack?<eos> [music stops] Oh, yeah, come in our Wacky Shack and we'll shake you off, and there's a line of goddamn families going out of there?<eos> While you're waiting, here's a vibrating butt plug to stick up your tush.<eos> So I take this nasty thing and shove it in my prostate, while I give myself a shake off.
And if time runs out on this and I couldn't get him justice...<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Stephanie, we need to talk about this assignment.<eos> - Is there a problem with it?<eos> - Yes, the problem is you didn't do it.
- Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About the fact that I'm pissed off.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she handed it off.
It's one pro bono.<eos> He just took it.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> - I gave him my word.<eos> - And you once gave your word to me and went back on it and I let it go.
Someone needs to convince her to let this go, and it needs to be a lawyer I can trust, but it also needs to be someone who's close to her level, or she's gonna feel attacked.<eos> Then I think I have the perfect choice.<eos> Katrina.<eos> I take it Louis got my lawsuit.<eos> He did, and I'm here to ask why you're bringing it now.
Well, I finally started, and I think because of that, it allowed me to get past my anger and make peace with Stephanie.<eos> I'm glad to hear it, Louis.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Like I said, I wish I had listened to you sooner.<eos> But every bit of you hammering away at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.
He's gonna come out courageous.<eos> He's still gonna be what he is, and he's gonna be the champion.<eos> And he's gonna get his belt back.<eos> Peter Quillin had a reputation of being just one of the meanest men in the ring.<eos> Now he's on the cusp of real greatness but he hasn't really hit it yet.
It was just easier when we went for pizza.<eos> Why don't we do something with your hair?<eos> Just for a change.<eos> This is looking better.<eos> So that scar... did you ever find out how she got it?
And we love their Kung Pao chicken.<eos> But...<eos> Julia thinks I'm ready.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about if I see anything that's cute, I'll take a picture on my phone and send it to you, and then you can shop from the comfort of home?
She wants me to do a best orgasm piece. Oh, those are fun.<eos> This is your worst nightmare in the best possible way.<eos> Yeah, I can't write this.<eos> Sure you can.<eos> Just open a bottle of gin, chase it with nothing, start typing.
It's amazing.<eos> I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay, forget the money.<eos> What's your dream?<eos> Fashion.<eos> I've always loved it, but it's too risky, you know?
I have to pay one million yen every month, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It said so on the invitation.<eos> Can you show me that invitation?<eos> I don't have it.
Yes, I guess so.<eos> Even so, he's really popular.<eos> Did he come up with this pretentious cover too?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've finished it, so you can have it.
Are you interested in it?<eos> A new emotion?<eos> Those losers have it all wrong.<eos> I will give it a proper judgment.<eos> If you have an idea for your next work, could you tell us about it?
By normal logic, it's only natural.<eos> Then why?<eos> In order for me to give birth to a logic that only I can create,<eos> I will find a new logic yet to be expressed in this world.<eos> I will explain to everyone why we need it.
That's gonna be you next year. Fresh start.<eos> Hi, Sam.<eos> That's my sweatshirt.<eos> You're wearing my sweatshirt.<eos> When I was locked in your closet, I got cold, so I put it on.
It was me.<eos> - Lena Luthor?<eos> - Lemme guess, she told you to stop by and make sure the amethyst is ready for transport.<eos> The amethyst?<eos> So, you have it?
We'll see about that.<eos> Let's get 'em, girls.<eos> Don't bats like to spend their time upside down?<eos> I'm stuck.<eos> Normally I set my gun to five, but for you, I'll turn it up to 11.
Mr. Norris.<eos> Hey, Barry.<eos> Mike.<eos> Leandra, will you set up that Caracas call for 2:00?<eos> I'll put it through.
As a jumper he was so disrespectful... of the sport that I'm afraid he's gonna do the same thing now as a coach.<eos> Thank you, Warren.<eos> Certainly sharp words from Warren Sharp...<eos> No pressure there, then.<eos> Where's my jacket when I need it?
I need to boil some water, to make a tea.<eos> I'll fetch you a bucket.<eos> I can fetch it.<eos> No, you stay here.<eos> I'll fetch it for you.
With guns, ammo, and artillery.<eos> What's that got to do with my farm?<eos> It has everything to do with your farm, ward.<eos> H ow?<eos> 'Cause they are the folks that burned it.
Not that I'm trying to tell you how to run this place or anything.<eos> I'm just a little curious.<eos> Michelle...<eos> Say, how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit?<eos> You think she touched it?
I'm just a little curious.<eos> Michelle...<eos> Say, how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit?<eos> You think she touched it?<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.
Roads... Temples... Ancient symbols...<eos> What?<eos> El Dorado?<eos> No, gentlemen!<eos> - I call it "Zed."
Over there!<eos> There's a little beach.<eos> We made it!<eos> Go on, Tatty, you name it.<eos> I hereby name this Walker Island and claim it for our own.
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.<eos> Okay. That's obviously who I meant. That's...<eos> Hi, Junior. If I may, when is the last time the paranormal entity was actually seen?<eos> And if you were to rank it, let's say between probably a T1 and T5...<eos> Garret here saw it on Tuesday, and I believe it made him soil himself.
Till she dislocated her jaw and ecto-projected all over you.<eos> Yeah, that stuff went everywhere, by the way, in every crack.<eos> But, I got to say, even that was kind of spectacularly beautiful.<eos> I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.<eos> I mean, I could smell it.
Oh, no!<eos> Yes!<eos> I wish we still had this presentation.<eos> I mean, it was pretty great.<eos> I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.
I promise.<eos> Tom Cruise has died.<eos> This footage just coming in from a Church of Scientology service Cruise was presiding over when apparently... and details are still coming in... he spontaneously exploded.<eos> You're right.<eos> Can I have a bottle of 10-year whiskey, if you have it.
Come on, now.<eos> I came back to...<eos> Years ago, I made a promise.<eos> I broke it.<eos> I broke it 1,000 times.
Man, they cut open your fucking eyes so you can't shut them, and then they're gonna bring in your little fucking family.<eos> They'll cut your son's head off with a cheese wire.<eos> They'll do the same to your little girl.<eos> And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off right in front of you and they won't feel a fucking thing.<eos> Last but not least, they're gonna cut your fucking head off and send it to your buddies down at Customs.
Here you go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, I was thinking.<eos> Maybe there's another way to go to sleep. What about the infirmary?<eos> I've checked it out.
It's the biggest story there is.<eos> But you won't know any of the people who were reading it.<eos> But they'd be reading it.<eos> Well, they would have been.<eos> I'll never write it now.
Welcome to my island.<eos> Your island?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My grandfather and I used to come out here and fish.<eos> He left it to me when he passed on.
So Amelia had a second print? She had a copy?<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> And she gave that copy to Misty.<eos> So she comes here, checks the film against that wall...<eos> Lily sees it through that window.
Oh, my God, you look incredible.<eos> How do you get your hair to...<eos> It's magnificent.<eos> Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but there's been some foul play.<eos> Do you know that that suitcase that you gave us, somebody switched it out?
Can we go in?<eos> Nobody entered the cell.<eos> Strange.<eos> Did anyone tamper with the surveillance camera?<eos> Nobody touched it.
Delicious.<eos> Maybe you'll try something?<eos> It's all organic, here.<eos> Too much onion.<eos> As for me, before putting the onion into julienne, I scald it first.
What should I do?<eos> Take the fingerprint and pass it to me.<eos> Can you take another blood sample from Barkov's body?<eos> No, the blood has coagulated.<eos> But I don't need it.
Yes.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Yes, and one more request...<eos> Don't tell anyone about the incident for now.<eos> I just gave him the vaccine, he bought it from me, that's all!
When Ivanova was in our hospital, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our hospital.<eos> I was preparing a photo album.<eos> I was taking pictures of wards, patients with their parents, all that.<eos> So, once I was taking picture of our corridor, and Ivanova's father got in the picture.<eos> He came up to me without saying a word, grabbed my camera, took out the film and spoiled it.
And for now, you'll live in the guest box.<eos> It's small, but only temporary.<eos> We'll create a full-fledged laboratory for you.<eos> -What about my collection of smells?<eos> -We'll bring it here.
- Look, I don't know what everybody's angstin' about, but I can say with some certainty, that I didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> - She was found with drugs.<eos> Methamphetamine.<eos> You don't know nothin' 'bout that?<eos> - Meth or how Kami got it?
Thank you.<eos> I'll tell you where he is.<eos> He's out there rotting.<eos> There's some shit in that woods.<eos> And cousin Henry's spreading it around.
I'm goin'. I'm goin'!<eos> I'm goin'!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Them kids got disease.<eos> - They just gave it to Dennis.
- I don't know what to do with you.<eos> - You can tell me who's jacket it is.<eos> - It's your jacket, it was in your car,<eos> - whose would it be?<eos> - You left it in my car.
Sorry. sorry, may I speak?<eos> Is it my turn to speak?<eos> I think you need to find some inner peace.<eos> Mr. Yelling Lawyer Man.<eos> So why don't you shove your head up your anus - and look for it?
They've actually said, "There's got to be more than this."<eos> And I'm like, "There is."<eos> Jesus loves you!<eos> - UNITED, baby!<eos> - It's like you have the most valuable thing and you know people need it. But they don't know they need it.
There are satellite churches today from London to Paris, Kiev to Capetown.<eos> You don't feel judged at all when you walk in.<eos> - I found love here.<eos> - I was using heroin for 12 years.<eos> I walked away from it Monday morning.
♪ How holy ♪<eos> ♪ How wonderful You are ♪<eos> ♪ How mighty ♪<eos> ♪ How strong is Your great love... ♪<eos> It's impossible to know, really, if a song is going to work until we play it live.
It carries a lot of blood, and fast.<eos> - Dr. marks, my patient is in a delicate state.<eos> Are you sure an incision medically necessary?<eos> - You need circulation.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
- Sunflower seed?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> How is the change up coming along?<eos> Mm-mm.<eos> I don't know. Sometimes, I think I'm getting it, and then...
- Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sign the ball, please.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Sign it?
Honey, I have to get up early tomorrow.<eos> Fine. Okay.<eos> I won't tell you.<eos> It's a good story, though.<eos> Okay, fine. Let's hear it.
I used to burn sage in our house once a month just to cleanse the negative currents.<eos> I'm going to book a flight out there for next week.<eos> No, no, no, no, that's too much, that's not necessary.<eos> I appreciate it though. I'm coming either way.<eos> If the house doesn't feel right we'll put it right back up on the market.
So, I need to get some stuff from the store.<eos> Put your shoes on, we're gonna take a ride. No.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> We're watching a movie.<eos> Then you can put it on pause. We'll finish it when we get back.
Hi, I'm Majorie from the bureau.<eos> Just this way.<eos> I've located the house where your sister was found.<eos> It belongs to her ex-husband.<eos> He told the police that he had loaned it to her until she relocated back to Chicago with their daughter.
Judging by the level of decomposition, we believe that the deceased committed suicide three days ago.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Anna had no reason to kill herself.<eos> The autopsy revealed that your sister was suffering from Huntington's disease.<eos> Her 12-year-old daughter also has it.
- How is she?<eos> - In bed.<eos> What is it?<eos> That thing you have in there, it can give people a real scare.<eos> I nearly died of fright when I saw it.
I've always wanted to know...<eos> You really hit the nail on the head with that one, Tribeca, except I wasn't a gym teacher yet.<eos> I was on my way to a gym-teacher job interview.<eos> Getting the picture?<eos> But I missed it because of you and your stupid coffees and your stupid handwriting.
Okay, three candidates.<eos> We've got the scholar, the medium, and the entrepreneur.<eos> The first guy is Dr. Ben Ellison.<eos> We create the world around us with our consciousness, and that is why adults rarely see ghosts.<eos> They've closed that door, they've shut it up tight with skepticism and suspicious questioning.
Good bye.<eos> - Ms. parks, wait.<eos> Have you ever seen anything like this before?<eos> - It's a magic bottle.<eos> I made it myself.
He's murmuring something called...<eos> He's saying, "Juicervose, juicervose."<eos> Now, Cornelia thinks he wants more juice.<eos> She gives him the sippy cup.<eos> He doesn't want it. He knocks it over.
The boy was a criminal.<eos> He is the voice of the evil Jafar in Disney's Aladdin and now my official buddy, pal, and friend of the family.<eos> So, Jonathan and I first became pals and friends for my 19th birthday weekend when me and my mom and dad went to New York to see Disney's Mary Poppins on Broadway.<eos> - I saw that!<eos> - And he was the Admiral, and my dad wrote him a note and sent it to him, and he called me up on my birthday, and Jonathan is a great friend of mine now.
Look, this guy doesn't want to play.<eos> Can somebody let him out?<eos> Open the door, please!<eos> Would they really lock us in?<eos> Open the door before I kick it down!
Tiny. Size of nothing.<eos> You could fit it into a laptop...<eos> Boom. I could do no wrong.<eos> And you were using it for insider trading, is that right?<eos> She had secret information, I traded on it.
It's not the reason.<eos> The rising is doomed to failure. it must not happen.<eos> Again, not the reason.<eos> The true reason behind yer certainty remains carefully hid.<eos> And you're hiding it from me.
Again, not the reason.<eos> The true reason behind yer certainty remains carefully hid.<eos> And you're hiding it from me.<eos> You're right.<eos> We are keeping it hidden.
You're having some differences of opinion.<eos> We're deadlocked.<eos> No you're not.<eos> I don't like that word.<eos> I'm not going to let you use it.
- AC.<eos> Did you say Macy's?<eos> Macy's? Macy's?<eos> - Air conditioning.<eos> Sometimes Conner just gets an idea, and he runs with it, you know, and he's right, like, 99.9% of the time, so you've just got to trust that he knows what he's doing.
My fans ask me to sign them all the time because they love me, and I love them, Lawrence.<eos> And you know what? You need to grow up, dude, because this right here, this is what it's all about, my friend.<eos> Making art.<eos> Connecting with people.<eos> This is that rock star life, my man, and I'm slurping it down like a big old fat milkshake.
- Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Honey, what are you gonna name it?<eos> I'm gonna name it Maximus.
When did this happen?<eos> What year?<eos> Your mother said I was seven or eight when she last saw me, so it must have been... 1947 or '48.<eos> My father kept this... lockbox on the top shelf of his closet.<eos> I knew where he hid the key, so one day, I opened it.
Mostly academic stuff, but... there was this one letter.<eos> The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and my father, and the way he phrased it made me feel like it was something big, maybe something terrible.<eos> Definitely something he didn't want to spell out on paper.<eos> It scared me for some reason.<eos> I put the letter back in the box, locked it, and never looked at it again.
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.<eos> Why art thou patient, man?<eos> Thou shouldst be mad.<eos> York cannot speak without a crown.<eos> Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates.<eos> Are you now tomorrow to dispatch this thing?<eos> We are, my lord.<eos> And we come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is.<eos> Well thought upon, I have it here about me.
What the hell am I looking at?<eos> You're looking at, I don't know, some kind of bio-weapon?<eos> Where'd this recording come from?<eos> Phoebe, that's what I think. - Phoebe Station.<eos> - I meant where'd you get it?
Phoebe, that's what I think. - Phoebe Station.<eos> - I meant where'd you get it?<eos> Julie Mao.<eos> She bought that from a data-broker.<eos> She gave it to Dawes.
And we're the fugitives.<eos> And as far as they're concerned, we're the ones who blew up the Donnager.<eos> And I am not spending the rest of my days in a Martian gulag.<eos> How much justice do you think you're gonna get for the Canterbury inside a prison cell?<eos> If the price of justice is more innocent blood, then I don't want it.
It's pronounced "Anoobis."<eos> Egyptian God of the dead.<eos> "Ann-you-bis" works too.<eos> Okay, people, let's review.<eos> Right, so the crew of this badass ship boards the Scopuli, uses it as bait to nuke the Cant, then spaces the crew except for Lionel Polanski, who somehow survives.
There's something in the reactor.<eos> It looks like it consumed everyone else.<eos> If it's a bio-weapon... I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I have to get off this ship.<eos> I'll set up an O.P.A.locator beacon, and park it where no one else can find it.
This was planned.<eos> They have assignments.<eos> They knew it was gonna happen.<eos> How could they know a ship was going to blow up in the docks?<eos> They blew it up themselves.
I'm sorry, I should've woken you earlier. But I didn't dare.<eos> Was I snoring?<eos> - No, you were sleepwalking.<eos> - What? You were sitting next to Louis, and then you got up and came over here.<eos> And you just sat here for a while, and then you took out your prescription pad and wrote out a prescription, and then you crumpled it up and threw it in the trash.
Well, she need never know.<eos> - God's blessing on you both.<eos> Perhaps there is some way I can be of service?<eos> Your friendship is service enough.<eos> Then you shall have it.
Come on! Great show.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Hey, did you get my friend request?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I noticed you didn't accept it.
It was so hard not to say anything.<eos> You're dead to me.<eos> You're dead to me.<eos> Get used to seeing this face, sir.<eos> Because you are going to be seeing it all the time!
And after this trip, I hope I never have to see you again.<eos> Okay, um, you seem upset.<eos> Because you sabotaged and then stole my proposal.<eos> I didn't steal your proposal.<eos> You gave it to me.
Making sure I say everything I want to say.<eos> Oh. Well, yeah, you know, I know that that's going to be fine.<eos> But I meant, how are you holding up with the whole Todd thing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's pretty clear that he took your proposal or maybe you gave it to him?
Bimse?<eos> - We're going to check out an old car.<eos> - The Mustang. We have to start it.<eos> Do you have the key?<eos> No. I assume the owner has it wherever we have to start it.
In cities, they live wherever they can find an opportunity to move into without being discovered.<eos> Streets begin to get undermined.<eos> The sidewalk begins to break up.<eos> Right here, and you can see, right below our feet, you have a major crevice there.<eos> As the rats dig it out, notice the stress cracks.
and scientists after us can go back and look at these rats so they can compare their rats in the future to the past.<eos> Still smells a little rotten.<eos> First we want to prepare a proper specimen.<eos> We prepare them as museum-quality specimens,<eos> There you go. -which is where you save the skin, and you stuff it so it's preserved for posterity.
Yeah, why not?<eos> Hm? I thought maybe you'd want to stay in Dad's room.<eos> Why? You want me to?<eos> No, it's just a better room.<eos> And he's not using it.
I made good use of the space. I was there before.<eos> And how was your breathing?<eos> Breathing?<eos> - Did you try out the technique?<eos> - No, I didn't need it this time.
No, no, I can't risk that.<eos> Where did I put the key?<eos> Unlock them, I have an appointment.<eos> I'm getting picked up.<eos> I don't have it.
Where did I put the key?<eos> Unlock them, I have an appointment.<eos> I'm getting picked up.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I don't have it.
I thought you want to try.<eos> You have a seat. And I bring the coffee.<eos> So please sit down, here.<eos> Yes. Thank you.<eos> We take this tool. And you put it in hot wax.
Technically, it isn't any.<eos> - Is this your car?<eos> - Yes, I just got it.<eos> Can I see your driver's license, please?<eos> Sure, have it right here.
A lot of people have paid good money for your resurrection.<eos> It's important that the world meets you, Marc.<eos> Of course.<eos> Would you like to give it a try?<eos> I'll put it on you for a few seconds.
But now isn't the right time either. Because he's decided to have his body cryonized. And needs to commit suicide before the disease destroys his body.<eos> Dear Marc,<eos> I've written this letter a thousand times.<eos> I've tried to fill you in on what happened throughout the years to the people you loved. But it seems unfair to summarize their lives in a few lines.<eos> Do you want me to read it for you?
And I don't care if you live or die.<eos> It'd be very easy to cross the line and take revenge.<eos> But you haven't got the guts.<eos> I crossed the line and Project Lazarus is all I have left.<eos> If you cross it, you'll be left with nothing.
- His real name is Wylis.<eos> And he could talk and fight and-- and then--<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.<eos> And we're going to fight it in there?
This is great, man. Congratulations.<eos> This...<eos> I thought you might need it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm giving it to you.
Ah, but only blessed, right?<eos> - I respect that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Listen to you, all polite and shit.<eos> See, the reason it feels like silk is because from the day it's born, they keep it in a dark crate, so small they can't even turn around.
Yeah.<eos> These mannequins, and his artwork would definitely qualify him.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. Do you have a letter from your uncle?<eos> You talked about that.<eos> - The lawyer handed it to me with the deed.
Give me back my baby.<eos> "So long as we desire, we can do without happiness.<eos> "We expect to achieve it.<eos> "If happiness fails to come, hope persist,<eos> "and illusion's charm lasts as long as the passion causing it.
- Argentina.<eos> I thought we agreed that we wouldn't talk about it.<eos> - Well, maybe I do want to talk about it.<eos> - We were on a break.<eos> - The situation was this, an opportunity presented itself to you, and you took it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yo, you serious?<eos> You really got that shit? - Yeah.<eos> I just picked it up.
The Good Masters of Astapor and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.<eos> With help from their friends in Volantis.<eos> You see?<eos> You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.<eos> We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
Yeah, I know what a sheet is, but what does it matter? She's the victim.<eos> What, Naz isn't, too?<eos> If I was still his lawyer, I'd at least pretend I thought so.<eos> It's like having a nuclear arsenal.<eos> You don't want to use it, but if the other side knows you got it, they tend to come to the table sooner.
But okay.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> God gave you one face.<eos> Why would you change it?
I tried.<eos> It's too late.<eos> So what, that's... that's it?<eos> Did you know this show's about me?<eos> A loser who had one shot and blew it.
- Look at this shit.<eos> It's a real fucking palace.<eos> Hey, beggars can't be choosers, Cinderella.<eos> I wonder what kind of factory it was.<eos> Well, whatever it made, nobody wants it now.
But she didn't.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Her face was fine.<eos> You've seen it. Yes.<eos> I've seen it.
Ah, go on.<eos> You tell the story. You can tell...<eos> No, go on, please, go on.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> I mean, Joanne tells it better, but...
Bring her home.<eos> What a beautiful table you keep, Sister Julienne.<eos> Family meals are very important at Nonnatus House, Mrs Busby.<eos> It was never like this at that nurses' home, was it, cariad?<eos> I still wish they hadn't demolished it.
Unfortunately, that was the implication.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> Another day and baby would've been seriously dehydrated.<eos> I'm sorry, Sister, but you have such influence.<eos> Please take care how you use it.
Typhoid is complicated.<eos> Sometimes two people can have completely different symptoms.<eos> Do you think Angie's right?<eos> Could it be me?<eos> Do you think I picked it up in China as a kid?
That's all I ask.<eos> I can't imagine living up here.<eos> Like a bird in a nest.<eos> Look.<eos> Hot water, whenever you need it.
If I get a degree, I can be a teacher.<eos> Or write for the papers.<eos> I could work for the BBC, making programmes about poetry.<eos> I could put better food on the table than you've ever seen in your life.<eos> I could be proud of how I put it there.
Well, that was fun.<eos> He gets his jollies pushing around alphas because he can.<eos> We had this commander back in Ranger school, he was a real cockbag.<eos> So on our last night, me and a buddy, we stole his beret.<eos> The whole barracks chubbed it.
- Within you.<eos> - I might have to think about that one.<eos> - Ooh, ooh! - Be here all night.<eos> - All right.<eos> You know, I do have a gun in my cubby and I will use it.
Hey, inside the TOC, do you see us?<eos> We need to come in.<eos> You know that thing where the initial assault is just a ploy to draw people in for the real attack?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Open your door or I'm gonna fucking blow it open!
Hi, this is Peter's uncle.<eos> Oh,hi.<eos> He's embarrassed.<eos> He lost his wallet last night.<eos> Did he by any chance leave it on your nightstand?
You think I asked for any of this?<eos> I was framed, beaten... and put in some tank like an exotic fish.<eos> Came out with... abilities.<eos> Saved your life.<eos> More like ruined it.
That's what I'm telling you.<eos> And as a proud NYPD detective... see, my partner and I, well... we're accountable for each other.<eos> We need to know each other's whereabouts, 24/7.<eos> And thanks to my partner's GPS on her phone, I got Mr. Cage's home address.<eos> And I will give it to you... if you're a good boy.
That's his son, Earl.<eos> Never knew he had a kid.<eos> Earl's dead.<eos> Scarfe forgot to lock up his gun one night.<eos> Earl found it and accidentally shot himself.
- I noticed your hair was wet.<eos> - I took a shower.<eos> Crime scene officers combed every inch of Harlem's Paradise.<eos> We also noticed that the shower in Mr. Stokes' private bathroom had been used.<eos> - I used it.
The 4K one.<eos> Luke Cage is going at it.<eos> You still hit like a bitch.<eos> - The folder.<eos> - You don't have it?
There's a guy that can fake something.<eos> He's got a bulletproof vest on, - he's 50 feet from the hotel.<eos> - How do you know where he is?<eos> Because of that fountain.<eos> I saw it from my room last time I was there.
How can you destroy it?<eos> It doesn't...<eos> You can't even...<eos> Shall I just swallow it?<eos> Yeah, swallow it so they can trace it straight to your ass!
I would!<eos> alright.<eos> I Iove this house.<eos> It's so quiet here.<eos> That's why I bought it.
This is for you.<eos> You wanted to go crazy, right? Yeah.<eos> Well, this is going crazy.<eos> All right, Gypsy, you ready?<eos> Dude, if you don't want the hummer, I'll take it. That'll be the one freebie.
Well, where is it?<eos> Uh...<eos> You...<eos> I got it.<eos> He probably lost it.
Uh...<eos> You...<eos> I got it.<eos> He probably lost it.<eos> No, I didn't lose it.
Oh, shit.<eos> The garbage was today.<eos> I didn't put it out. It...<eos> I'll see you.<eos> I told you he lost it.
Salome.<eos> Okay.<eos> Break legs.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about that song.<eos> I really love it, and I want Joan to hear it. Could you play it for her?
Me too.<eos> Les Skunks!<eos> Really?<eos> I want you to play "Devil's Kind." I love that song.<eos> She listens to it all the time.
But first... I need you to do some business for me.<eos> Into this.<eos> Dear Marcus, I can't see you.<eos> You'll only run away from me again... this time when you see the scar across the width of my wrist.<eos> Had you seen it the night of our date... I would have honestly explained it to you.
Right.<eos> And that's not nothing!<eos> Alright.<eos> So how does it work?<eos> Well, the guy you hire takes the card the usher hands him at the door... and when he hands it back at the end he's signed your name on it.
We'll see which it is.<eos> What? I mean, that's his name.<eos> What do you want from me? I didn't name him.<eos> It's a wild coincidence the pharmacy's there?<eos> I didn't put it there.
There used to be stories about an Elf who lived in the Vale.<eos> He'd gladly tell you his wild tale of how he single-handedly won the War of the Races with nothing but a magic sword and three humble Elfstones to aid him.<eos> Well, my father taught me not to believe anything I didn't see with my own eyes.<eos> You think just because those pointy-eared bastards tell us that magic's dead, that's the truth?<eos> What makes you think I haven't seen it, hmm?
Put it down, you little asshole.<eos> What the hell is going on out here?<eos> Little shit pulled a gun on me.<eos> Isn't this your gun?<eos> I was gonna let him use it, but then he pointed it at me.
I was just showing my son...<eos> License and registration.<eos> See, I built the trellis, and...<eos> And your license. I'm sorry.<eos> I don't have it on me.
I left the truck alone.<eos> No.<eos> No, Anthony.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> No, I left it unlocked.
I like more money.<eos> What took you?<eos> Do not want to still the key?<eos> -No thank you.<eos> I'm not offering it to others.
No, I don't think so, why?<eos> Maybe she overdosed.<eos> I still haven't received the autopsy.<eos> You should have.<eos> When did you send it?
You should have.<eos> When did you send it?<eos> I can't recall.<eos> When you asked me.<eos> You sent it here, or to the office?
- You guys have to hear this.<eos> You wanna hear the frogs sing? Yeah, sure.<eos> - Of course they wanna hear it.<eos> - Really? Play it.<eos> She played it for me and I cried.
You fell under that bus, and I thought that was water under the bridge.<eos> It was a dry riverbed, and you know it.<eos> - Didn't we bury the hatchet?<eos> - You buried the hatchet.<eos> It was my favorite hatchet, and I never found it.
And, I just, I just don't think my work measures up.<eos> You on a scholarship?<eos> I am.<eos> And it was really hard to get.<eos> - And I really don't want. - To lose it.
I lost everybody I ever had.<eos> All I got left is scars.<eos> Father say when this box empty, we leave Gold Mountain and go home.<eos> Last leaf inside for two years.<eos> I never take it out.
She's in Vermont with the kids.<eos> You here, family back East, that don't seem like you, Jim.<eos> Mining has helped me figure things out, Bohannon.<eos> Life is simple down here.<eos> Cut a vein, bleed it dry, scrape away until there's nothing left.
Oh, and I'm not?<eos> We need a solution, Kevin.<eos> We need it now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And we'll get it.
I'll complain about it, but I can live with it.<eos> It's the trademark suit that's got me fuming.<eos> I take it you did not agree with the judge's decision.<eos> I completely agreed with the judge's decision.<eos> And I told Thompson six months ago that we would lose if we tried it like a trademark dispute.
You think you know me well enough to make that prediction?<eos> No.<eos> But I am a pretty hopeful person, so I'll just say, I hope you do it.<eos> We should probably get to the meeting.<eos> ♪ It may cause concern ♪ ...Denby of "New York" magazine thinks Spike Lee's new picture is gonna cause them black folk to riot, but Chicago's native son Roger Ebert calls it a masterpiece.

You saw the corporate culture, the racial culture.<eos> You knew the score, and you still said yes.<eos> You sure it's the firm you're frustrated with?<eos> That's the second time you've asked me that question.<eos> It's the second time you haven't answered it.
Thanks for inviting me.<eos> It's been a while since I've had that kind of connection to real-life struggle.<eos> Me, too.<eos> In high school, my typing teacher gave me an A minus.<eos> I wrote her a letter every day until she changed it to an A.
Did you all find your footballs?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> See..when you were busy finding your ball..<eos> ...you couldn't find it.
Yes.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Leave this stuff with me.<eos> I thought you said we'd never find his signature.<eos> No, I said you would never find it.
When did that happen?<eos> The night you hit the Pot Palace.<eos> Wanna explain the gun in your waistband?<eos> I found that.<eos> I didn't want some kid to pick it up.
So, put the video on for me please.<eos> - You said you would.<eos> - Let's go outside and let the man work.<eos> How many times have I told you not to say we have a vcr, in front of a stranger?<eos> Do you want the authorities to find out and take it away?
Just like you didn't move my workout video, I suppose?<eos> I said I didn't touch your workout video!<eos> How did it end up in the bin then?<eos> The doll is around here somewhere.<eos> It hasn't left the house and nobody has taken it.
You're saying that you've never used the "N" word?<eos> What's this got to do with the case?<eos> Detective, have you used the word?<eos> Has anyone told you that I've used the word?<eos> So if the defense calls a witness that testifies that you've used it, how do you respond to that?
Other than the night in question.<eos> No.<eos> Not that I can recall.<eos> So let's be clear.<eos> In all your years as a detective, this is the only instance that you took evidence from a crime scene, you put it in your car, you drove it home and didn't book it until the next day.
I then showed Detectives Lange and Vannatter what I had observed and, in discussing the situation, we became concerned that it was possible Mr. Simpson himself might also be in danger.<eos> Injured, or worse.<eos> Well, that makes total sense.<eos> What did you do in response to this reasonable concern?<eos> I went over the wall and around to the gate and manually opened it.
But that is the verdict, that is the jury's, uh, position.<eos> That's their voice.<eos> And I accept that verdict.<eos> Uh... we came here in search of justice.<eos> And you'll have to be the judges, I expect, as to whether or not, uh, any of us found it today.
The race card was surely played.<eos> Barbara, my position has always been the same:<eos> race should not and would not be part of this case.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> We not only played the race card, we dealt it from the bottom of the deck.
Curly, Charlie.<eos> Kitchen, five minutes.<eos> Actually, we were told on the train there'd be cocaine.<eos> Jeremiah, John Boy, kitchen, let's go.<eos> I swear to God, them fucking cavalry boys are asking for it.
I can't stay here, not after what happened.<eos> There's only one place we can go.<eos> Home.<eos> Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?<eos> We'll take it back from them.
I need your word.<eos> If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.<eos> You have my word.<eos> You have until nightfall.<eos> You gave it to me for a purpose.
Right.<eos> Three lords walk into a tavern-- a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.<eos> They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup.<eos> The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.<eos> The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
What?<eos> Afraid you'll like it?<eos> You and Cephalo deserve each other.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.
Your blood is the key.<eos> Don't let them leave without you.<eos> Proposition... your help in exchange for your freedom.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.
Kael Pindanon would not dare harm the son of King Eventine.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because there is still honor within these walls.<eos> This letter bears my seal.<eos> I need you to deliver it to bring back the support I need to win over the Council.
And I'm sorry.<eos> We'll watch next week. I'm actually due down at Emily's right this minute, so...<eos> I thought we were gonna see boobs, but if you'd rather hang out with a girl...<eos> Oscar, are you cooking?<eos> - I'm reheating a pizza. - Did you take it out of the box?
Sure.<eos> Blue works, too.<eos> Yeah, I mean, either/or... Orange or blue, whatever one you're standing on, it's gonna look good.<eos> I was thinking about that, um... you know the blue rug.<eos> Maybe we don't get it, like, for my place, but... Like, what if we got it for, like, our place?
Oh, foot!<eos> You can fly?<eos> Apparently, yes!<eos> Are you sure it isn't the sword unfindable?<eos> I think I found it!
Thank you, Beetle.<eos> To know Kubo has someone to watch over him when I'm gone.<eos> That would be a fine way to end my story.<eos> Your story will never end.<eos> It will be told by him and by the people he shares it with.
Is this a good dream or a bad one?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> My father's fortress. Yes.<eos> The last piece of the armor. It's here?<eos> Follow the setting sun and you'll find it, in the place that might have been your home.
Dislocated shoulder.<eos> That boy will never bother you again.<eos> I could have hurt him worse, and I wanted to.<eos> When a hero fights the dragon is he worried about hurting the beast?<eos> No, he takes his sword and drives it straight into its heart, and the crowd loves him for it.
You want a slice?<eos> - Have some chips and then you can play.<eos> - I don't want pizza.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't put it on the table, though.
Thank you.<eos> Well...<eos> I'll go then.<eos> Are you wearing Xoan's sweatshirt?<eos> Xoan gave it to me long ago.
Then Antia told me... Each of us got what she deserves.<eos> You were brought up with the same freedom as my parents raised me.<eos> When we moved to Madrid and I was in that depression, you didn't say anything, But I stifled a tremendous sense of guilt For the death of your father and the man in the train.<eos> I always avoided talking about it, I wanted you to grow up guiltless.<eos> But you perceived it...
I refrained from you for years, But I made a mistake, lying about the hope of finding you knowing about you.<eos> That absurd hope has devoured the weak base On which I had built my new life.<eos> Now I have nothing left.<eos> Only you exist.<eos> Your absence fills my life completely and destroys it.
- No. It's really worth it.<eos> I used to see the city only from above.<eos> Do you see your home?<eos> - No.<eos> There. Four blocks past the church. Do you see it?
And I will do it again if you don't come out and give the royal blessing like the Khan you are.<eos> Brother.<eos> You would call me "brother" now?<eos> The news was coming.<eos> The only question was who carried it.
You are beautiful, truly.<eos> And you are most handsome.<eos> I know that this is beyond your choosing.<eos> And I have been foolish to not recognize my blessing.<eos> I give you my word, and I stand by it.
This song is mine.<eos> Nobody in this place can have it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can wait till you share it with me.
Night, where you going?<eos> To get a ride.<eos> Are you the mother or the sister?<eos> For you I'm not either.<eos> And I know a hyena when I see it.
For dinner.<eos> They make excellent grilled meat.<eos> It is not grilled meat I need today.<eos> I have come to sell you this piece.<eos> My mother gave it to me.
- Bellamy, where are you?<eos> I had him.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> We got the beacon, didn't we? Uh!<eos> Yeah, but where did they get it?
Okay, here we go.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, but that flower crown is corny as hell.<eos> Mom, no one asked you.<eos> You have a beautiful forehead.<eos> Please do not cover it.
Out on that field all that matters is who wants it more.<eos> And here at Rydell, we want it!<eos> And when we finally get it, we're going to come back here and ring that victory bell.<eos> Ring that victory where the hell is the bell?<eos> We think that maybe someone stole it.
What we're looking for is a true representation of American youth.<eos> Principal McGee, we need your help.<eos> What is it, fine, wholesome students?<eos> I want to have my rocket club meetings in the all-purpose room on Thursdays.<eos> And I want it for future homemakers of America.

So if I cut the rope, at least I can be rescued?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't cut it.<eos> Then you die together.<eos> If the partner is you, I cut it immediately.
Not a place where you can climb.<eos> But Habu...<eos> Staring at the cliffs ahead.<eos> I got goosebumps.<eos> He had that expression, I'll never forget it.
Should I ask you how your day was, like a good wife?<eos> No.<eos> I'm guessing that means your day was not as successful as mine.<eos> Well, depends on how you measure success.<eos> See, personally, I measure it in sapphires.
How do you know the paper cash combination?<eos> Tommy talks in his sleep.<eos> Shut up, Esme.<eos> He's changed the combination.<eos> You've put it in wrong.
- Keep us posted, won't you, sister.<eos> - I will.<eos> (Fucking hell! )<eos> So, Arthur tells Linda everything, eh?<eos> She's stolen his soul and taken it to a better place -- the suburbs -- where men are honest with their wives.
She will love him as her own.<eos> I know this is a harsh ordeal.<eos> But it can strengthen your faith and your calling.<eos> The diocese still hasn't found anyone to replace the late Father Piasecki.<eos> As for the vows ceremony, I've postponed it twice. I cannot do it again.
Somebody set me up.<eos> blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> Captain, listen to me.<eos> Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.
Hmm. It's the same.<eos> Hmm. Still, beats my slut mother's goulash, no?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> Ring the bell again.<eos> Hmm. I doubt they'll hear it.
Forged by the monks themselves.<eos> It's said to hold supernatural powers.<eos> Theo knew this.<eos> It's possible he'll attempt to steal it back.<eos> Does your grandfather still have it?
Close your eyes.<eos> Imagine that I am God.<eos> All-powerful.<eos> I am God, and I absolve you of all of your guilt.<eos> I put that guilt on you, and now... I take it away.
- What?<eos> He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing it.<eos> Because he's a genius.<eos> He's writing the word "case" over and over again.<eos> Oh, now he's spelling it with a K.
- I can't believe you knew about Sheila.<eos> - I also knew about Wendy.<eos> And Bonnie.<eos> - Bonnie who wears a wig?<eos> - She left it in our bathroom.
Nicky Baxter, the vet from Bolton Brow, he's managed to get up there sooner that he'd anticipated so he's given the sheep a fatal injection.<eos> I thought I'd finished the poor little sod off, but God knows, I mustn't have.<eos> So, the sheep's got pentobarbital seeping silently through its veins, and guess what?<eos> The dogs.<eos> Whether they're the same ones who mauled it in the first place or a whole new pack, they decide to have another go at it.
As an apology.<eos> Beyond that, go fuck yourselves.<eos> Let it go, Johnny.<eos> You can buy me a drink.<eos> I'll have a bottle of scotch, but we drink it together.
I served, too, 2002.<eos> - Operation anaconda.<eos> - Your boys did a fine job.<eos> Why, thank you, sir. What's the name of your mission?<eos> Oh, you know, we named it go fuck bin laden.
These warriors went and captured a teenage girl from a rival village.<eos> Course, she had to be beautiful.<eos> But the young thing, before she knew it, was tied up to a... Wooden frame stuck in a bear den.<eos> See, there was a drought.<eos> The sacrifice was to cause as much blood as possible to rain down upon the earth and fertilize it.
You're lucky.<eos> The bullet went into your head but didn't do any critical damages.<eos> Your bodily functions are not affected.<eos> But the bullet is a foreign body.<eos> If we don't remove it, it may cause hemorrhaging, pus, and infection, and may kill you.
Whatever...<eos> Where are you going now?<eos> I want to get you a surgical gown.<eos> You know where it is?<eos> Let the nurse get it.
Kam.<eos> Yes.<eos> The latest 33-inch TV set.<eos> Good stuff.<eos> I'll give it to you, too.
I've watched her follow madmen.<eos> I've watched her follow rich men.<eos> I've watched her bow before tyrants.<eos> But now, it's time she had a king.<eos> When we're ready, when he's ready, he'll step into the role we've created for him... and lead an impossible army into an unwinnable war... and win it.
Ugh. Don't become some d-bag lacrosse player.<eos> Honey, we invented lacrosse.<eos> I don't think that's right.<eos> Anthony, this sacred pipe, the chanunpa, was carved nine generations ago.<eos> It survived Wounded Knee, and we used it to pray for our brothers in Vietnam.
It's a tobacco vape, Dad.<eos> Katherine Heigl uses one.<eos> Smoking kills, you guys.<eos> Where is that pipe, Jackie Lynn?<eos> I held it in the air, and a hawk took it.
Those toppings are wrong.<eos> I will agree with you in 20 minutes.<eos> But it doesn't matter, does it?<eos> 'Cause this is New York, where everyone's moral relatives.<eos> Just order a deep-dish ham/clam, and some sicko will make it for you.
Forensic accountant. Did he call you?<eos> He had some questions I tried to answer. Didn't add up.<eos> Somebody's playing shell games.<eos> No, no, if richie drained the goddamn company,<eos> Why didn't he unload it when he had the chance?
My last name is gross.<eos> Spelled like "wow, that was really gross."<eos> You get an idea, you can't shake it.<eos> Hum along with it when you're on the train.<eos> You like it for a minute, but then you hate it.
I love this song.<eos> No, I have to go.<eos> I love you!<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You still have it?
So, what's the matter with you, young Rostov?<eos> Nothing at all, Captain, except retreat isn't what I went to war for.<eos> I know.<eos> You want to put that fine young horse of yours through his paces, eh?<eos> Well, you'll get your chance, by and by, and you may not care for it when you do.
What high school do you go to?<eos> I'm only 13!<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Where does your shirt go?<eos> I took it off.
- Bruce, will you post it? Here.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> - Want to see it? - Get me out. Goddamn it.<eos> You better not have gotten it.<eos> I told you not to take it.
Yeah, you had better because I'll tell you what, I have barred people for less than this.<eos> Listen, sweetheart, do me a favor?<eos> Could you hold that bet back until the race starts?<eos> Look, alright, fine, okay.<eos> I'll stall it and I'll phone head office and see if they can hold on, okay, but only, only because you asked me, Yiannis.
God, woman, I'm a doctor, what kind of gypsy customs...? Don't you want your grandchild to be born?<eos> Fine, lady, you're in charge.<eos> Quickly, Irene, take this.<eos> - What do I do with this? - They're forceps.<eos> With the paddles, first one side, than the other you grab the baby's head and pull it out.
That flu killed 50 million people in one year, five times more that World War I.<eos> - But that was in...<eos> Almost a century has passed since then...<eos> And the population has lost it's immunity.<eos> If we bring it here, we could have a situation like in America.
How did you manage to stop the pandemic?<eos> Sadly, we didn't manage to stop it.<eos> It simply wore itself out after a year.<eos> We didn't even manage to get them to stop calling it "Spanish".<eos> I've read that they called it that because Spain was the only country - that didn't censure the news. - That's true.
Americans, Americans, Americans.<eos> What is it with the Americans?<eos> Do the Americans do everything right?<eos> Yes, yes, movies, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, all totally bitchin' but the Americans, they've got their problems too, yeah?<eos> Just so you know, the United States will save Europe again in the Second World War, but in exchange, they'll invent the atomic bomb and launch it over Japan.
Real love is always worth waiting for.<eos> Regal, strong, virile, aquiline.<eos> That's what I asked for.<eos> And this, this is what you give me?<eos> Did you just grab a cock from the body shop and jam it between his eyes?
Let's go to the sheriff.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Hey, nice backpack!<eos> Is that new?<eos> Yeah, my folks just got it for me.
We'll run 'em.<eos> We got a lot of solid citizens the Feds don't.<eos> I also need a warrant.<eos> You want me to write up a warrant?<eos> I'll write it up.
What?<eos> It ain't right.<eos> Why would he keep it?<eos> He whacks Allen in L.A., he pitches the gun, throws it down a storm drain.<eos> Maybe his mama gave it to him for his birthday.
Oh, yeah, and stick that smile up your ass, you fat fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'll take the gun back to L.A. tomorrow.<eos> How quick can you get it done?<eos> I'll walk it through ballistics myself.
Before we waive extradition...<eos> What?<eos> You're not fighting it?<eos> Well, what would be the point?<eos> You got the murder weapon and you tied it to my client.
There must be a way to correct this somehow.<eos> Fortunately, Gideon is just showing us a forecast of the future you've all created.<eos> Time is like cement.<eos> It takes time to become permanent.<eos> In this case, until Savage's team have worked out the mystery of your future technology and molded it to their own ends.

The first time I ever saw a magic trick, I was with my mom and dad on the Venice Boardwalk.<eos> And there was this guy, this old Italian guy with this little Jack Russell.<eos> He had this small stand where he performed.<eos> He did a lot of card and coin stuff, but there was this one thing he did that just stuck with me forever.<eos> He took a pocket knife and pressed it into the center of his hand.
Please, we have been lying to ourselves for years.<eos> I want you to get your things and get out of my house.<eos> -Your house?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> It was ours before you destroyed it.
- Whoa! - I Torrented it, and...<eos> Which is fine because I do get the word out on this one. - Please check it out and...<eos> - Wow!<eos> You don't have to give this to me.<eos> Watch it and then call me, and we're gonna talk about it.

I'm sleeping at Yolanda's 'cause it's easier to sneak out.<eos> DJ Malibu is spinning there tonight.<eos> There's a dance competition. The winner gets to have dinner with Malibu.<eos> That's what the tape's for.<eos> I'm gonna win the dance-off, get him the tape so he can listen to it and say:
I understand that it might make you feel uncomfortable to share it.<eos> But take a look around.<eos> The Bronx is a war zone.<eos> Our community is dying.<eos> And it's gonna take leaders to save it.
That's where I keep my custom AJ Lesters.<eos> - Custom? - Custom?<eos> - Hoo-hoo!<eos> Yo, so how do you rig up the electric?<eos> You wired it yourself?
He will be your perfect weapon.<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> Okay.<eos> When I hold you, go ahead raise your hand.<eos> You see, when I raise your hand, you go up, when I raise it down, you go down.
You were supposed to show me how to do what you do.<eos> Do not underestimate the crayon.<eos> I promised you the secret, not the answer, Grasshopper.<eos> To earn the answer, you must solve the mystery as one.<eos> And when you unlock the gate, we will walk through it together as one.
It's rare.<eos> It's dangerous to own."<eos> Dangerous?<eos> It's a fucking cassette tape.<eos> So, I listen to it, right?
Here's the tune.<eos> - "Oogie Boogie Disco Biscuit."<eos> - It's a party anthem.<eos> In a 4/4 beat, but with subtext.<eos> I wrote it.
Pretending to scratch and spin, charging at the door.<eos> Fools was falling for it, too.<eos> It was straight up blasphemy, son.<eos> Word up. -You think Shao made this tape?<eos> -No. They got it from a store.
Fools was falling for it, too.<eos> It was straight up blasphemy, son.<eos> Word up. -You think Shao made this tape?<eos> -No. They got it from a store.<eos> We went to the spot, store guy just said he got it from somebody black.
Now, understand me.<eos> In order for Ed and I to make the changes this city needs, we need a mandate.<eos> And to get that mandate, Ed here needs to win by at least ten points in November.<eos> So, I'm not just asking you to deliver the Bronx.<eos> I'm asking you, Francisco, for you and your people to tear down the competition... wherever you find it.
-I know.<eos> -No, you don't know.<eos> Music is the only reason.<eos> It'll... it'll move you forward and open up doors that everyone says are shut, Shao.<eos> It'll give you the whole fucking world for free if you just love it and hold back nothing.
A written request...<eos> Over a year ago, but I never got a reply.<eos> Do you think I should resubmit it?<eos> Well, depends on what your request was.<eos> Maybe I wrote it shoddily.
Remember?<eos> You'd sing me to sleep.<eos> I don't recall tucking you in or singing you to sleep.<eos> And I wish I'd written that song!<eos> Yeah, I might've composed it... but I gave it Gino.
[chuckles] A-holes.<eos> Liza and I are just finalizing the details for the launch party this Friday.<eos> Oh, well, do share.<eos> I have been on pins and needles ever since I learned it would be in an old bone boiling plant.<eos> [chuckles] The Glue Factory is the hottest party spot in Greenpoint, and we didn't really plan it as a typical imprint launch.
Well, this is pretty much the highlights reel right here.<eos> Shh, we don't want people to know that we're from New Jersey.<eos> We got fake IDs saying we're from Oregon.<eos> - I love your shirt. - Oh, thank you.<eos> My daughter gave it to me 'cause I'm kind of a foodie.
How you feeling?<eos> So stupid.<eos> I'm sorry I ate your lollipop.<eos> It's okay.<eos> For future reference, though, you're supposed to lick it.
What?<eos> See?<eos> I knew Hector and Dorff would love the sculpture.<eos> I told 'em we'd stop by before the opening.<eos> I can't wait to see where they have it on display.
What the fuck is going...?<eos> Try it now.<eos> I forgot my key card the other day, too.<eos> - Key card? - Yeah.<eos> You know, I just keep it around my neck.
I don't believe that.<eos> Oh, it's boxy on me, dude.<eos> As your boss...<eos> Javier, I need you to put your shirt on.<eos> I need you to put it on... your mother.
That's good, 'cause I love cheese.<eos> All kinds of cheese.<eos> Orange cheese, pizza cheese...<eos> I love all parts of pizzas, especially the dough.<eos> Once I asked for a ball of dough, and they gave it to me and I took it to a park and ate it.
If you don't see how, well, that's 'cause they're tipped against you.<eos> Still, by way of gratitude, I can supply you a night with some very amenable women.<eos> I've fucked enough whores.<eos> You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.<eos> How about I sweeten it by killing you quickly?
You did so because there was a competition between warders to see who could collect the most, wasn't there?<eos> I was ordered to do the work.<eos> Please look at this photograph.<eos> These are the washers you collected before you were arrested, correct?<eos> This photograph was taken at your house when the police searched it.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Oh, my God, you actually won it.<eos> How?<eos> Yo, that claw machine is hella hard, but I got it on the 15th try. That's a personal best, all right?
They can't really do this, can they?<eos> I think they just did.<eos> You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman, and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal," but you took it anyway because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life?<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> Well, you basically just loaded a gun and handed it to Hanneman, and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga, and then Raviga just fucking pistol-whipped you.
- Thanks, Mama.<eos> - You want me to burn that sausage?<eos> Yeah, burn it black.<eos> - What?<eos> - I said burn it good.
I didn't promise you nothin'!<eos> Mama said you'll be in trouble next time.<eos> Shut up, okay?<eos> Just go get the ball.<eos> Find it?
- No, that's okay.<eos> Or do you want to take a helicopter there?<eos> You could take photos for your Instagram account.<eos> You read the interview?<eos> - My mom gave it to me.
- You're welcome.<eos> All right.<eos> You think it's hot in here?<eos> I often get really hot here, and I keep the door open.<eos> You mind if I open it?
- No.<eos> Will you get cold?<eos> -just open it.<eos> Open or closed?<eos> Maybe I'll open it for just a moment.
Of course.<eos> So I'll just, uh... Just back it up here. Ooh.<eos> - This is heavy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You mind if we just set it down?
Sorry, I had to pee so bad.<eos> - Oh, we managed. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, I left my wallet at this place, Bliss House.<eos> I went there last night and I think I dropped it in the collection basket.
Oh, I love him!<eos> Hey, I got him!<eos> How do you know about this movie?<eos> Gus told me about it.<eos> He said they filmed it near here.
Well, I'd have thought you'd had toxic shock by now.<eos> Your skin gone clear, your organs gone liquid or...?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You know anything about this shit?<eos> Well, yeah, I know enough to know banging it with a hammer's not gonna fix it, so...
"We are afraid the information given so far is too optimistic." That's where we seem to stand.<eos> When was it agreed, do you know, to allow the terrorists to go... from the building to the helicopters?<eos> What is that?<eos> The guy's pump is fucked.<eos> Can't afford a new one, so I told him I'd fix it for him.
So what it's in the press?<eos> So Irving got what he came for.<eos> You know, he wanted headlines, he got 'em.<eos> "No holes, no Holocaust!"<eos> He wanted a catchy phrase, he's got it.
This judgment is gonna stand against him forever.<eos> Now, some people are saying that the result of this trial will threaten free speech.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> I'm not attacking free speech.<eos> On the contrary, I've been defending it against someone who wanted to abuse it.
- Tranny?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't want to fight, he's almost here!<eos> You always want the last word!<eos> Think I'll give it to you?
Aren't you a little late to the party?<eos> It may be too late.<eos> There was an archaeologist, Carl Bugenhagen, who visited Thorn's father 25 years ago.<eos> Bugenhagen wrote the Vatican saying that he and Thorn believed the young boy to be the Beast from Revelation.<eos> That letter sat in the Vatican archives until I found it.
Smoked turkey necks, half a cup of sugar, and a pinch of bugs.<eos> Bugs.<eos> So amazing.<eos> Did you find the sweet potato pie recipe?<eos> Oh, God. Mom made it so often I don't even think she wrote it down.
Yeah.<eos> Hi!<eos> Did you remember Maddie's backpack?<eos> Shoot.<eos> No, I left it in the car.
Well, you know what I hear?<eos> I hear that Westmoreland's gearing up for another Operation Linebacker.<eos> Nixon gets reelected, we can all go back there, right?<eos> Well... I hear peace is finally at hand.<eos> Well, I'll believe that shit when I see it.
Eleanor McGovern.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'm here among my friends in South Dakota where this campaign began almost 22 months ago.<eos> It's...<eos> And, uh, we now... we now bring it to an end tonight, and I have just sent the following telegram to President Nixon.
Well, we're not doing that, so...<eos> He said we could get eight and a half grand for it.<eos> That's good to know, Joni.<eos> We're not selling the house.<eos> Mac, he already listed it, okay?
Everything has a foundation. Shakespeare sonnet, bookcase, the Empire fucking State Building.<eos> E.<eos> A.<eos> B.<eos> You start with that framework, embellish it a little.
Still the same number?<eos> - Same number.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Toby, who are you building the house for?<eos> What makes you think I'm building it for somebody?
Goddamn right it is.<eos> Think about what it would have been like as a child in 1939 or 1964 to get taken by your parents to the New York World's Fair, right?<eos> So they take you to, I don't know, say, the Chilean Pavilion.<eos> And you're smelling Chilean food for the first time.<eos> You've never even seen it before.
And I'm now going to go into the attack and defending portion.<eos> "Attack abilities and attacking a monster.<eos> The type of symbol shows whether it is a melee ability or a ranged attack ability."<eos> Yes. Adam, I have a question.<eos> Is it... okay, I can answer it because I think I know what you're going to say.
Well, that's perfect!<eos> You know, I don't even wanna go.<eos> It sounds boring.<eos> How's that for reverse psychology?<eos> A little tip: when you're using reverse psychology, don't say you're using it.
So, you want a hat or something?<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> It's an autographed two-time Cy Young award-winning Tim Lincecum in-game jersey.<eos> He's my favorite pitcher of the modern era.<eos> We'll take it.
I've still got my Swayze moves, too.<eos> Our favorite movie was Ghost.<eos> How could I forget that pottery scene?<eos> That was our make-out movie.<eos> You know, I rented that in 1991 and never returned it.
Thank you.<eos> If you believe it will happen, it will happen.<eos> Right.<eos> My mom always says stuff like, uh, "Thoughts become things," and mostly I just tune her out.<eos> But I really think that if I just harness all the energy that I have, and put it into getting back into a major market, then...
Hannah!<eos> That song sounds so sad.<eos> Not as sad as Luther Vandross' Dance With My Father.<eos> Oh, God, that song tears me up.<eos> Every time I hear it, I just wanna go, "Where's my daddy?"
- Get down.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Shh...<eos> Let's get back to the road.<eos> If we follow it, we can find some place.
I go all out for my kids.<eos> So I feel like when it's time to do something for me, put the same time, energy and effort into it that I do when I do shit for you.<eos> This is what made me mad.<eos> For my birthday, my son gave me a handprint.<eos> This boy dipped his hand in paint, put it on a piece of paper, said, "Happy birthday, Dad. Love, Hendrix."
He said, "My jeans must have rubbed it off." "Nigga!<eos> "You're not about to give my kids no jean-dyed peppermint!"<eos> "Fine, more for me."<eos> Takes the peppermint out of his pocket, puts it in his mouth.<eos> Five minutes go by, I saw my dad take that peppermint out of his mouth, put it back in his pocket.
A pocket pussy is a pussy you put in your pocket.<eos> I don't know, people.<eos> It's self-explanatory.<eos> I think the definition is in the title.<eos> All I know is, I didn't put it in my bag.
"You put the numbing cream on your shit before you do it,<eos> "it'll numb you up, you'll last forever."<eos> I said, "Nate, I need that tonight."<eos> True story.<eos> I go to Nate's house, he gives me the cream, I put it on at his house.
"Am I getting a latte or am I baking a fucking cake?<eos> "Just let me...<eos> "Let me get a banana.<eos> "Can I get that banana?<eos> "Just put some water in my hand "so I can put it on my face real quick."
I like it.<eos> I'm gonna put the kitchen back. Right back here.<eos> Richard, stop this!<eos> I don't know what you're saying.<eos> I bought it.
Many years ago.<eos> My friendship with August Corbin was strained, but there was... always mutual respect.<eos> Oh, here it is.<eos> The Elder Edda.<eos> If there's a clue in the Ragnarok myth, you'll find it here.
Cooperate.<eos> This group of energy trades... I'd like you to supply the research behind them.<eos> I was tasked, so I supplied it.<eos> Right, but going through your reports, I see gaps.<eos> Like this boardwalk pipeline move... what supported it?
- Regarding the captain's family...<eos> - No problem.<eos> I'll call Copenhagen<eos> - What's the address?<eos> - Only sent it to you
Mm-hmm. Well, you weren't lying when you said you was gonna knock your father off.<eos> Look, Ma, I know that you are somehow caught up in his web right now, so if you are coming to tell me to pump my brakes, just please...<eos> That's not what I'm here to tell you.<eos> I think competition is healthy.<eos> As long as you're using it to push yourself.
When people come and go, they're gonna look back. Steve Aoki's gonna have a huge impact on what happened.<eos> Even though you may not say Steve Aoki made EDM huge, Steve Aoki was one of the step stones.<eos> [Will.i.am] When it comes to passionate people, go-getters, hustlers, manifesters, whatever you wanna call them,<eos> Steve Aoki is that guy.<eos> There's a wall in front of him? He's a hustler. He goes around it, over it, under it, through it.
Relax, honey.<eos> Okay, I did kill her.<eos> But there were extenuating circumstances.<eos> Ms. Groves, I think I should speak to the Machine one-on-one.<eos> The Machine, I killed it because it lied.
She's only acted defensively.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> It's possible the Machine could have sent the assassin after John.<eos> What if it comes down to the Machine or us?<eos> Do we kill it?
Yes, we have to get that camera.<eos> Catch Maggie on her dinner break.<eos> Cut the camera strap with...<eos> With that.<eos> Bring the camera back here where I'll remove the memory card and clone it onto the laptop's hard drive.
Look, getting the gun was a bad idea, but I've been robbed before.<eos> Amir, if you want to get out out here, you got to tell me where you got that gun.<eos> Yes, yes, of course.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> I got it from a gun show in Cleveland six months ago.
So I did some digging.<eos> How he hires everyone.<eos> Three different shell companies, same P.O. Box, but I followed the courier... who took me to my true employer.<eos> You know his identity?<eos> Figured I might need it someday... and here we are.
Oscar, the horses!<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah...<eos> Oh my God, you kept you kept this place the way it was.<eos> It's awesome!<eos> So why don't you use it, it's so great?
Oh, yeah, yeah...<eos> Oh my God, you kept you kept this place the way it was.<eos> It's awesome!<eos> So why don't you use it, it's so great?<eos> Well, I told you I didn't really need it.
Oh my God, you kept you kept this place the way it was.<eos> It's awesome!<eos> So why don't you use it, it's so great?<eos> Well, I told you I didn't really need it.<eos> Didn't really need it.
You know, I mean look at this things, there's not many people in the world, look..<eos> OK, OK, you're right, you're right, never mind.<eos> Projection screen's down.<eos> - What?<eos> Screen, still down, you leave it like that overnight it'll warp.
Come on, Gloria, have a beer.<eos> I tell you what.. If you drink that beer, I'll go take a walk to the park later.<eos> What? Are you kidding?<eos> Drink it.<eos> Please know that I'm only being this pushy because deep down I know you want it.
This is where we live.<eos> We have a great backyard.<eos> This is me, sparrow McGee.<eos> I'm on the way to the best party ever.<eos> We only do it once a year 'cause it takes a year to recover...
And guess what, all your problems are solved.<eos> We're getting off the welfare.<eos> This should be good.<eos> We're gonna take life by the horns...<eos> Throw it on the ground...
What's e-cow?<eos> It's a good concept, I'll give him that.<eos> All right, you sponsor a cow, it's $2 a day.<eos> We send you pictures, you get updates and that.<eos> And eventually, you get to eat it.
I can help stimulate the recovery of your memory... If you let me.<eos> You see these sine lines?<eos> They're remnants from an old trauma, twenty years or more.<eos> Your wife's skull was fractured in seven places.<eos> Scar tissue can impede long-term memory, kind of like a splinter in the brain, waiting for the body to push it out.
Patrick?<eos> You're the spitting image of your mother.<eos> We tore down the old barn, turned your father's fields there into corn and soy bean, if you believe.<eos> Your foster parents sold me the fields on the condition that you keepin' the house.<eos> Can't say I much wanted it on account of the memories good and bad, you know?
I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song? I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!<eos> Now you tell me where you heard it! I don't know-
I swung by that place down the street and got you some dinner.<eos> It's that shrimp thing you like.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna leave it right here, in case you haven't eaten.<eos> Hey, don't keep leaving the food there.<eos> He doesn't eat it.
- It's a lot more complicated than that.<eos> - Is it? We love this man.<eos> And he's not just a boss, he's a friend.<eos> Howard is a brilliant, creative, charismatic guy who used to be fearless.<eos> He used to love life, and right now, he hates it.
So you're gonna stalk me?<eos> Well... Yes, basically.<eos> Well, what if I get a restraining order?<eos> Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to do that.<eos> Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.
Well, what if I get a restraining order?<eos> Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to do that.<eos> Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.<eos> Well, for your information, they're free.<eos> Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.
Well, for your information, they're free.<eos> Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Mom says you butcher that word.<eos> Not when I say it to you.
Your sociopath of a son punched a kid in the throat.<eos> The victim didn't report it because he feared reprisal.<eos> That boy has a lacerated trachea and is unable to sing at Nationals.<eos> So, I don't give a crap where the violence comes from and why.<eos> I don't want it in my school.
And at that time, if you had that kind of money, you paid some of it to the Voi.<eos> We lived in a secret enclave just outside Moscow with many of the other recent rich.<eos> And the snow was seven feet high, but you could still make out many big houses behind big gates lost in the white.<eos> You asked me how I got my sight.<eos> The better story is how I lost it in the first place.
Jesus.<eos> Did you just... throw up in our fuckin' water?<eos> I need water.<eos> No drinking water right now.<eos> We're using it to wash up.
Homer... what happened?<eos> Homer?<eos> A family was gonna live here.<eos> Probably not.<eos> They just built it and then the economy went to shit.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I... I read about that.<eos> A guy in Detroit talked some girl into emptying out her entire bank account.<eos> Scopolamine.<eos> Some people call it Devil's Breath.
Is that 'cause, like, eating creates warmth?<eos> Uh, I got it from French.<eos> That was my last one.<eos> - Oh, that's cool, I'm good.<eos> - I can split it with you, if you want.
It will be very... painful.<eos> But you must stay alive to give this to them."<eos> And a white moth flew from her mouth into mine.<eos> I swallowed it.<eos> I have held it inside me, waiting for you to come.
I have held it inside me, waiting for you to come.<eos> Would you like to know what it is?<eos> Come closer.<eos> It's almost over... but I get to hold my Stan one more time.<eos> Will you guard it with your lives?
Okay. All right, all right.<eos> Okay? Now kick it over to me, very softly.<eos> I got hobbs's gun, okay?<eos> I know exactly where it is.<eos> I'm reaching for it, okay?
We were done after that.<eos> The second time, they sent me a picture of my sister.<eos> So it happened again, and now it's happened three times in the last month.<eos> Look, I didn't ask for this, flores.<eos> The offer doesn't come unless you're asking for it.
Listen, the driver, in case...<eos> In case they get corralled by cowboys like you guys, they're supposed to make a run for it.<eos> If they can't make a clean getaway, then they're supposed to go to the river and dump the shit.<eos> Tio, he's got a lot of boys working for him in the river with ferries.<eos> They pick up the merchandise, they transfer it to another car, and they send another driver.
Hi, Mom.<eos> It's me.<eos> I just miss hearing your voice.<eos> Where d'you get that drive?<eos> I didn't get it, I created it.
Make a statement, deny it.<eos> Goddamn it, deny what?<eos> There's only one place the leak could've come from!<eos> So what do you want me to do?<eos> Find the son-of-a-bitch who leaked it.
To some, Talia Freeman does not warrant a moment of consideration.<eos> Yet to others, her death is a cause for sadness.<eos> It's a source of great frustration and anger and violence.<eos> I myself have been a part of this violence.<eos> I've encouraged and provoked it.
I'm saying I did not kill Talia Freeman.<eos> I know how the media is trying to portray me but the fact of the matter is I did not kill Talia Freeman.<eos> Portraying you as a man who refuses to answer a straight question.<eos> I'm answering a straight question.<eos> I'm answering it in a straight manner as we speak.
No.<eos> There's nothing in the system.<eos> So, they took prints but they didn't take any other information, is that what you're trying to say?<eos> No, no.<eos> They took it down, they just didn't put in the system.
Oh, my God.<eos> More gravy, Mummy?<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> So, the showing went really well.<eos> There were over six bloggers there covering it.
What the hell is that?<eos> Salad. What?<eos> I'd like to see you do any better.<eos> Never eaten a slug before.<eos> Where did you get it?
Her mother died young.<eos> Her father was an actor.<eos> He was blacklisted in the '50s, couldn't get a job.<eos> I guess he drank himself to death.<eos> Christ, the story get worse and worse every time you tell it.
And what is the point?<eos> You're going to leave this briefcase in that phone booth.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And then a man is going to come and make a call.<eos> A... a real call, or will he mime it?
Don't let them take that from you.<eos> So?<eos> You're looking at the chief of staff to the next proxy governor.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
Bye.<eos> - Lonnie.<eos> - Chuck. What's up?<eos> Uh, do you happen to catch the science section on Tuesday?<eos> I may have skipped it.
Relax.<eos> Peyton Automotive, it's gonna rise out of all these ashes.<eos> - It just won't be with Matthew Peyton.<eos> - I didn't sign up for this.<eos> We gave him a chance to sell this place, and he didn't take it.
I've worked damn hard to run this place!<eos> You idiots want to ruin me.<eos> It ain't happening!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Let them see it!
Knock it off!<eos> I'm sorry. I've never seen such a big octopus.<eos> I'm just too excited!<eos> Excitement is good for young people,<eos> But personally, I think you should focus your energy on girls... instead of wasting it on an innocent octopus.
Sometimes, you hope it lands on you.<eos> Sometimes, you wish you were invisible.<eos> Because when it does land on you, he sees everything.<eos> No, no.<eos> I did get the offer, but I did turn it down.
No, no.<eos> I did get the offer, but I did turn it down.<eos> That's what I was coming to tell you.<eos> Good.<eos> Because it seemed like maybe you were trying to tell me if I didn't match it, you were gonna leave.
8%.<eos> 8%?<eos> This must really matter to you.<eos> It does.<eos> Well, I'm long the stock, obviously, which is on quite a little tear, but if you're right and this company tanks, my position is screwed and I'll be holding it forever, waiting for it to recover.
Let's stomp it to the ground.<eos> Hello. Welcome to Isodyne.<eos> Is there anything... We have a warrant to search the premises.<eos> You can help me by opening the door<eos> - or we will open it by force.
- You think this is a gift?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To be at the whim of a force that's trying to destroy me?<eos> Only because you resist it.<eos> If you accept it, then you control it.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?<eos> No, your clumsy wife managed to knock it off the wall and break the glass.
So, um, let's just maybe cut to the chase here.<eos> Um, girls, maybe we'll just start talking about why you don't like each other.<eos> Sarah, you want to start?<eos> Uh, Kelly photoshopped a picture of me,<eos> - put it on Instagram and it made my...
You know that film with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino?<eos> I can't say I do, no.<eos> Action movie, full of explosions, guns.<eos> Oh, class.<eos> Do you have it on DVD? No, video.
Seven million euros worth of cocaine pour out this bag?<eos> How didn't you notice it getting lighter? !<eos> How didn't you notice it coming off the back of my bike? !<eos> 'Cause that wasn't my fuckin' job!<eos> - I gave it to you to look after!
So, like stenography? Kind of.<eos> Yeah, that's a good analogy.<eos> But if you're interested, there's a TV movie from the sixties that depicts the séance.<eos> It's really tacky, but seems accurate.<eos> I'll find the title for you, but if you type in like: "Hugo+Jersey+Turning Tables" on YouTube, you will find it.
He seems fine.<eos> I just don't want him to be, like, pissed off at me and then, like, get revenge on me with the food, or whatever.<eos> How?<eos> By poisoning you?<eos> No, just, like, by... I don't know, messing with my food. You know, like, not washing his hands and touching it.
Thank you, Doctor...<eos> Wilkes.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life.<eos> How about dinner and dancing?<eos> Now hand it over.
Yeah, there you go.<eos> Go build a robot.<eos> Uh, all right. What'd you find?<eos> I did an ISP search on all the e-mails that Khaled gave us... and, um, you're wearing my shirt.<eos> Do you want it back?
Surely you can handle my father.<eos> Why have you stopped?<eos> The song ended, my king.<eos> What if I choose for the song not to end?<eos> You want me to play it again?
Can I have some of those fucking things?<eos> Just be cool...<eos> Jesus, Ricky, be cool!<eos> Your ladder's not very strong, Bubbs.<eos> Well, it is, if you use it like a fucking regular human would.
Look, Inspector, I do not spend my days monitoring the bay.<eos> - It's a really beautiful view.<eos> - Yes, but I don't see it anymore, OK?<eos> It's normal<eos> - I've spent so long looking at it, I don't see it anymore!
This is something entirely different.<eos> This is professional.<eos> It is clinical.<eos> It's someone who wants information.<eos> Probably just should've given it to him.
With me, your dope would be safe.<eos> Come in.<eos> From Samir?<eos> You robbed him?<eos> No, he left it lying around.
Rebuilt.<eos> After the fire.<eos> Yes.<eos> History is full of darkness.<eos> If you would like to leave a note... I'd happily pass it along to Mr. Pembroke.
Yes, that's right.<eos> I'm not a patient.<eos> I was in an accident.<eos> You signed the admission form.<eos> I have it right here.
We were born in space.<eos> They told us the ground was uninhabitable, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed.<eos> Some of us have been broken by it, but most of us are still here, searching for other survivors from the Ark, trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness... a home.<eos> Our leaders believe that to survive, we need to make peace with the Grounders, but peace is a foreign concept here.<eos> I found it, John.
We go around the dead zone.<eos> Let's get a move on, you two.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> We head west towards that rise.<eos> You know, this whole helpful guide act, I'm not really buying it.
You mean the drone. Yeah.<eos> That's how she found us, too.<eos> So what do you do for her?<eos> We collect tech.<eos> You mean steal it.
So what do you do for her?<eos> We collect tech.<eos> You mean steal it.<eos> When we have to.<eos> We bring it to the island, to him.
_ _ _<eos> Wanheda... vengeance is yours.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know if your death would bring me peace.<eos> I just know I don't deserve it.
If you care for Clarke, you will send her home.<eos> It is the only way that she will be safe.<eos> Don't make her pay the price for your mistakes as Costia did.<eos> My mistakes?<eos> Azgeda cut off Costia's head and delivered it to my bed, and still I let them into my alliance.
In my tribe, if a man loses his sword to an enemy, he's no longer fit to be a warrior.<eos> Really?<eos> We let him walk into the mountains and die alone.<eos> And what if he loses his sword to some half-grown Warig?<eos> Ah, then we usually just get it back.
I don't know. Was I supposed to memorize it?<eos> It was the nine of clubs! That was her card, guys.<eos> The nine of clubs.<eos> Trust me, it was the nine of clubs.<eos> He just said to look at it.
Oh, my God.<eos> Arya and I are such good friends now.<eos> She is way cooler than that stupid tour.<eos> The studio tour is bullshit.<eos> My uncle went on it and he hated it.
There must be a way to correct this somehow.<eos> Fortunately, Gideon is just showing us a forecast of the future you've all created.<eos> Time is like cement.<eos> It takes time to become permanent.<eos> In this case, until Savage's team have worked out the mystery of your future technology and molded it to their own ends.
I remember it well.<eos> Though, as you can see, I can make the dagger do its work without it.<eos> Carter!<eos> This was your lover's blade.<eos> It must be her hand that wields it.
- but given the circumstances...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> The circumstances are that I tried to help you guys out and this is what happened?<eos> Yeah, I'm a little bit fuzzy on how you were able to do that...<eos> Mr. Dinard gave me a lead and I followed it.
Promise.<eos> I'm gonna get your house back.<eos> I promise. I...<eos> I shouldn't have put my name on that deed.<eos> You know, maybe it's not such a bad thing I don't get it back.
The flash drive...<eos> From Mia's bag?<eos> The Russians...<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, put the mask back on. - The Russians.<eos> The Russians, I got it.
And leave the drive?<eos> Yeah, fuck the drive.<eos> Okay?<eos> I don't need it.<eos> We don't need it.
I'm talking about your retirement party.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I have few more rounds left in me yet, Marty.<eos> What?<eos> I swear to God, I've found this old lamp and whenever I rub it, a genie pops out and grants me.
- On?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Whether you're a welching coward or not.<eos> That fucking bet was no good.<eos> And still you took it?
- You taught me that.<eos> - Don't try to confuse matters.<eos> You've not talked of heaven to your friends, but of this world.<eos> Come, sit down.<eos> Your lie... is harmless for those who hear it,
I'll go fishing.<eos> Could it be because your answers have become too harsh?<eos> You're so pessimistic.<eos> You're depressed, Cavalieri.<eos> I have a letter here, I'll read it to you.
I thought the chariot scene was fakey.<eos> How is he going to jump from one chariot to the other going full speed?<eos> Well, we can look at that.<eos> But as for the religious aspect, does the depiction of Christ Jesus cut the mustard?<eos> Well, the nature of Christ is not quite as simple as your photoplay would have it.
Don't play dumb, Eddie.<eos> I am talking about<eos> On Wings as Eagles.<eos> What?<eos> Running it tomorrow.
What?<eos> Running it tomorrow.<eos> First of all...<eos> First of all, there's nothing to that story.<eos> I've heard it, it's been around forever, and it's never been confirmed.
What a bore.<eos> I rather thought we might go to Lake Onondaga for the weekend.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> Don't have my valise.<eos> I left it in your foyer.
Baird Whitlock, your biggest star, got his first major part in On Wings as Eagles by engaging in sodomy with the picture's director, Laurence Laurentz.<eos> Oh, we've all heard the story.<eos> But here's something you haven't heard.<eos> Your source is a communist.<eos> If you print it, it'll be dismissed as a commie smear tactic, and you'll be dismissed as a commie stooge.
Just tell me what you know about Mr. Flaherty.<eos> When is Mr. Flaherty coming back?<eos> Is your real name Cowboy?<eos> Who names their kid Cowboy?<eos> My daddy says that you can have his gun when you take it from his cold dead hand.
Everything's okay.<eos> But for how long?<eos> Mom, I really, really miss you.<eos> Also, I have a field trip form that needs to be signed for school.<eos> I think if I mail it to you at the prison it's still easier than getting it from Dad.
I don't know, somebody could be out there, Max.<eos> Ma, where's my bag?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - Yeah, that's a shock.<eos> Found it.
They're just trying to help me figure it all out.<eos> Yeah, Shecky, I mean, do you have any files we can look at?<eos> Anything that would help us?<eos> My house got broken into and they stole my laptop and my cell phone.<eos> So you had a formula that actually works on cancer and you lost it.
- Find anything?<eos> - Negative, Kojak, we're still looking.<eos> Hurry the fuck up, Charlie.<eos> We gotta find that formula.<eos> Listen, we're gonna find it, we're gonna give it to these Nazis, and then this nightmare will be over.
Max, I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, I'm just trying to think of a way out of this, all right?<eos> Shit.<eos> You know, he's right about not giving them the formula.<eos> But none of that matters if we don't find it.
You're all right. You're all right.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Who's "they," Shecky?<eos> Trojgaard are the world's largest chemotherapy company.<eos> - Ronald didn't wanna sell 'em the drug, because he knew they would bury it.
- What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I'm looking at it right now!<eos> Ronald disguised it as an app on his tablet!
He's out of control!<eos> You were right, I think he's just doing this for the money.<eos> You have to leave his mom's house right now, it's not safe.<eos> Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes and bring the tablet.<eos> We have to make sure we get it into the right hands before Max finds it.
Here, take the dinosaur.<eos> Yeah, go play.<eos> What is it?<eos> We fished the tablet out of the water.<eos> I had my best tech guys take a look at it.
What are we going to do with it?<eos> - Let's kill it.<eos> Let's release it.<eos> - Let's eat it.<eos> Shall we release it?
Please go back to your place.<eos> Nice house.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This belongs to an acquaintance of Elis.<eos> He doesn't use it.
We bought the boat together.<eos> We designed it together.<eos> Yeah, but we skipped the part when we talk about when and how we're using it.<eos> You hate this idea?<eos> No, I don't, 'cause I see how much you love it.
It's also very dangerous.<eos> Look at her shoulders.<eos> Bitch has a snatch like a bear trap.<eos> She'll tear your dick right off.<eos> She'll tear it clean off if she wants to, gone.
He makes these amazing baked eggs with green tomatoes.<eos> You give us supplies, we'll save Craig and take care of Negan and the Saviors, permanently.<eos> I'm sorry, I find this whole conversation pretty funny.<eos> I mean, you balked when I proposed that your people work for our supplies, but now... isn't that exactly what's happening here?<eos> See, I had leverage and I used it.
I don't give a shit about Chuck Rhoades.<eos> I care about protecting this family.<eos> We're gonna be pariahs.<eos> The kids got uninvited to the Bancroft party, and nothing's even happened yet.<eos> So if there is even close to an easy way out of this, I hope you would take it.
Check the cybertrail.<eos> Our guys gave it one of these and it's clean.<eos> I'm doubting you're even for real.<eos> You need evidence...<eos> Bobby Axelrod trading material nonpublic information... and you need it in a week.
I'm their boss.<eos> Hit me with some of the worst.<eos> "The man fucking creeps me out.<eos> Is he even a man or some kind of alien magi?"<eos> "His eyes see the dark truth inside us all, a truth that wasn't even dark until he looked at it."
Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming down.<eos> I did it.<eos> Butch Probert. "The Pouch."<eos> Took an old Wells notice and doctored it.
About once every seven sleeps.<eos> And was it warm, the food?<eos> That's what made it good.<eos> Three miles from the road and eight from the edge of the woods, but the food was warm?<eos> Maybe he hiked it in in some kind of insulated bag.
Mayor Claire Warren lit up social media tonight when she vowed to microchip convicted sex offenders if elected governor.<eos> Stay tuned for more updates on the story after this.<eos> I got your story.<eos> Have you always owned that truck?<eos> Never loaned it to anyone?
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.<eos> Let me ask you something, Nathan.<eos> What's your opinion on infiltration?<eos> Well, how do you mean?<eos> How do we prevent it?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?<eos> It's the nature of the work.<eos> No!<eos> This... this happened because of your pet theory!<eos> And like an idiot, i went along with it!
What?<eos> Your hobby.<eos> That's where you touched a scorpion.<eos> No.<eos> Though I practiced it as a child.
Vanessa.<eos> And where is she?<eos> When did we lose her, Ethan?<eos> She was standing in a quiet room, gazing up at a cross.<eos> She reached out, took it from the wall... and put it in the fire.
I think I know where Reverend Corby keeps the key.<eos> Great.<eos> Follow me.<eos> The hasp was found on the same day that Cicely Milson was unearthed.<eos> Dexter Ingram logged it as "unidentified metal object".
I think about what it means that the dad pulls off the mask, and he's not only seen but loved for who he is underneath that hard metal exterior.<eos> Well, that guy's a hero.<eos> He deserves the love.<eos> And you?<eos> What happens when you take it off?
Melly's innocent.<eos> He's innocent.<eos> - Give me the tape. - Why?<eos> What you gonna do with it?<eos> I'm gonna take it to the chief, shove it up his ass and press play.
From now on, you shall be known as the Falcon.<eos> No, I prefer Kestrel.<eos> Kestrel's fine, too.<eos> Where's the tape?<eos> I made a copy of the tape and put it in your car at Mindhorn Heights.
- Richard.<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> - Thank God you're alive. Where's Melly?<eos> In a cave.<eos> He made a copy of the tape and he's hidden it at Pat's.
Quick.<eos> It's time for the Apocalypse of Justice.<eos> Baines, don't shoot.<eos> We've got the tape.<eos> Richard has it.
That's what got Monroe killed.<eos> You're crossing a line, Kane.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I crossed it.
Whoa, whoa, hey.<eos> It's ok.<eos> The bag blocks the signal.<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Who put it in there?
The technology that Clarke carries, it belongs to me.<eos> No way.<eos> Clarke, just give it to her.<eos> Clarke!<eos> If you let Raven die, you'll never get it.
I'm sorry, did that sound in any way optional?<eos> Because it could save your life one day.<eos> Now... inhale!<eos> Whoo. The Colombian cartels... their time is over!<eos> Now, it's the Mexicans moving powder up I-90 and delivering' it to our neighborhoods, like the fuckin' UPS guy!
So, what I learned from that is, don't give Chapman the chance to retaliate.<eos> Take her out first.<eos> Come on, now you're just tryin' to... scare me. I'm...<eos> Do you think that I should get a shiv?<eos> What, so they can take it away from you and stab you in the throat?
Why do you think Lucy wanted to murder Sister Fabian?<eos> Because Sister Fabian murdered her.<eos> Lucy's music brought joy to this miserable place.<eos> Her favourite song was When You Were Sweet Sixteen.<eos> When she played it, it made us... happy.
I don't want to fight.<eos> I just... I just want to tell you...<eos> Ken, where are you?<eos> Home.<eos> That's what we still call it, right?
What happened?<eos> Even John makes better tea than this.<eos> - Yes.. but..<eos> Something must be wrong with the milk.<eos> Who brought it?
I can get your job done.<eos> I've many contacts.<eos> But if you want to deal with some other agent, then that's different.<eos> No, no, just give me the address.<eos> A friend of mine needs it..
But you weren't sure whether she's dead or not.<eos> That's why you erased all the evidence.<eos> You just removed.. all evidence.<eos> It was clever of you to borrow Kumar's black van.<eos> The van couldn't have led anyone directly to you.. ...because many people would hire it.
I work directly with the owner.<eos> Francis really needs this win in South Carolina.<eos> He sure does.<eos> Let's release more of the strategic reserve.<eos> That might slow down the price inflation, but it won't halt it.
They reset the cameras every morning.<eos> I asked what she looked like and all the manager said is that it was a Caucasian brunette.<eos> Nothing strange about her.<eos> All right. Bring the box back here.<eos> Don't let it out of your sight.
-Very convenient. Thanks.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I'm David Grimes with the Cleveland Plain Dealer.<eos> Where's your credential?<eos> I was an idiot and left it in the car.
Now, Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to that meeting.<eos> He hated himself for taking that photograph.<eos> But he would've hated himself even more if he'd lost our farm... if he hadn't been able to provide and support his family.<eos> Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you to forgive him being in that photograph.<eos> He probably thought no one would ever see it.
You mean get our own chickens, feed them, love them and eat their eggs?<eos> Check.<eos> Mate.<eos> Urban poultry farming is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint.<eos> Or maybe increase it, I'm not sure.
Well, your Ironhead's in great shape, and you're never home to ride it anyway.<eos> Maybe I ought to...<eos> Never ride my bike ever?<eos> Yeah, I love that idea.<eos> I mean, I thought you were gonna finally ride it when we drove to Baja.
I've got this, Lisa.<eos> What? There's not many of them.<eos> No, no, look at them.<eos> Okay, you've got, like, five dozen different recorded versions of that play you completely missed right there.<eos> Why don't you just walk over there and ask one of them to replay it for you, then you'll see you're wrong, we'll win the game and then you can stumble home with your seeing-eye dog.
I just don't have the right to speak.<eos> - Brooke, what are you doing?<eos> - Not unless you are called as a witness, young lady.<eos> If I put her on the stand, what am I gonna hear?<eos> That she asked a question and I answered it.
You just reported that the South is not secure.<eos> - I did. But there is...<eos> - No, there is no but.<eos> Even a dog unknowingly craves discipline.<eos> And by the time he attains it, he has forgotten how hard he was beaten.
Spoken by the son of a murderous, thieving bitch.<eos> You curse my mother, you curse a Mongol queen.<eos> Who pushed aside my father's line.<eos> Who schemed to win power for her sons.<eos> Still your tongue, or I'll take it.
I hear her voice in the house, still.<eos> She had a very soft voice... like a little bell.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> So... this is life again.<eos> I've barely seen it for the past year... especially in such abundance.
I'm afraid Division won't wear it.<eos> You are to remain suspended from duty.<eos> Thursday.<eos> Before the Blenheim Vale files were sealed one final piece of evidence was abstracted.<eos> I don't suppose anyone will miss it in 50 years.
She hasn't even spoken to Fitz in, like, five years and now if he did this for her they're gonna be bound together forever.<eos> Not because of the tape.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What?<eos> You erased it?
Shut up and listen, Harry.<eos> Your debt is useless to me.<eos> I can't sell it on.<eos> No-one will touch you.<eos> So I'm calling it in.
Kissing your ears.<eos> My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.<eos> And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.<eos> -No, no, no, tear it off.<eos> -Pulling it off.
Frank, what the hell is going on?<eos> This is Jorge Mendoza and his clan.<eos> What are they doing in our yard?<eos> I rented it to them.<eos> If we let you take the house, will you rent it to us?
So if you can call us back when you have a minute, that would be swell.<eos> Thanks, Patrick.<eos> 72 hours to vacate the premises.<eos> What happened to our flour?<eos> Debbie used it as an imaginary baby.
You just got out of juvie and you have $3,000?<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> What, you don't believe me?<eos> No, I believe you, I just don't want the state seizing our house 'cause we bought it with drug money or whatever it is that you're into lately.
But I got the money.<eos> Took me a year.<eos> I got it.<eos> A bike just like this one.<eos> Had it for one day before Pops traded it for a rock.
- Hey, ease up!<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen.<eos> I want that paper, Butch.<eos> I told you, I ain't got it. Uhh! I told you I want that paper, Butch!
We need to send a message, it has to be done.<eos> Southpaw sends a message, I mean, he'll never use his right hand again.<eos> Look, if he's lying, I'll kill him when we get back.<eos> Okay, Clayton.<eos> Go take a photo, we may need it, quickly.
If we lose Ethan to evil, the night will never end.<eos> And if it is a prophecy, what role do you play?<eos> Are you the savior?<eos> The warrior that ends the night?<eos> Or are you the wolf that loves it?
Well, her mission must have succeeded, despite General Howe siccing a monster on them.<eos> Lafayette and the French forces joined the Colonials against the British.<eos> They must've found a way to turn the creature back to stone.<eos> So how do we do the same?<eos> Well, Abbie and Crane usually take a lesson from the past and use it to find clues to help with the present.
We're both an hour ahead of form.<eos> Did you know they lock the doors at 6:30?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Nor that you were a patron of the opera.<eos> Oh, at Oxford, I lived and breathed it.
You know what I remember?<eos> your voice.<eos> Used to read stories to me, sing songs.<eos> I loved that voice.<eos> And I'm sorry you haven't heard it in a while.
We know you're not on our side, Theo.<eos> You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you left Eichen with something else, didn't you?<eos> You mean the mask?<eos> Are you worried about that?<eos> Did you put it on?
Or... or... or...<eos> Start up here and then swing it around down here and get him right there in the shin.<eos> You see that?<eos> You see that, fa?<eos> Took it clean off.
Excuse me, where are you going?<eos> Trying to figure out how to use this against Zoom.<eos> You remember Zoom?<eos> "Cisco, please join me.<eos> "We'll use your idea and take it to new scientific heights and save the world."
It's a famous painting, apparently, recently recovered from Markovia.<eos> The painting is on loan to the museum from the Silverberg family.<eos> Jacob Silverberg himself said,<eos> "The painting's safe return means more to us than all the money in the world "<eos> It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it.
Where are you... finding Turtle is what's important right now.<eos> Yeah... this is important to me too.<eos> But we need to see if your speed still works.<eos> I think... I think it still works.<eos> We still have to find out how Turtle drained him of it.
Yes, sir.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I've got a mission.<eos> Honestly, it's more of a chore.<eos> For a chance to see my brother, I will gladly accept it.
Elijah, Rebekah, even Hope... sometimes you do them more harm than good.<eos> What?<eos> What you just said, keeping Rebekah safe.<eos> I know what the weapon is.<eos> I made it myself.
If there was any way to bring Aiden back, I would, no matter what.<eos> If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with...<eos> You got to do it. I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?
Traitor to my family,<eos> - thief of that which is mine.<eos> - Don't be dramatic.<eos> Like I said, I just wanted your attention.<eos> And seeing as you're here, I'd say I got it.
'Maybe that's what you heard, Aria, but the rest of us' heard Ezra kick us out of his apartment.<eos> Guys.<eos> And every member of this police department is taking this case not just seriously but personally.<eos> 'Without going into detail that can harm the investigation' 'I can tell you that we are narrowing down' 'our list of suspects.'<eos> We're confident we know what the murder weapon was and we will find it.
Put the funds toward mom's victory party.<eos> Hey, umm, how did you break your suitcase?<eos> - What?<eos> - I told him about it. 'Cause he just really likes to fix things.<eos> What makes you assume I broke it?
- What?<eos> - I told him about it. 'Cause he just really likes to fix things.<eos> What makes you assume I broke it?<eos> Well, when did you notice it was broken?<eos> When I pulled it out of the cab from the Philly airport.
You do, right?<eos> I do.<eos> I'm here to turn myself in.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I removed a firearm from Evidence lockup, and I gave it to Detective Malcolm Graham.
It's in the bag.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You don't need to do this, Malcolm.<eos> I know, but I was gonna shoot you at Palmetto, and now I feel like I've been given a second chance here, so I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it.
Where are you going?<eos> To my own house, Sol.<eos> Where I live. To take my medication.<eos> What is it?<eos> Maybe we have it.
Oh, I gotta do something about this.<eos> - Where are the guys?<eos> - I kicked 'em out.<eos> After I gave them lasagna.<eos> I thought you wouldn't eat it. But if you're trying to fill out that bowling shirt...
Of course she does.<eos> It's the basis of her entire personality.<eos> - What have you lost?<eos> - Cigarette box.<eos> I threw it away.
I don't like murder.<eos> Even for murderers.<eos> It's not murder.<eos> It's justice, Sidney.<eos> People need it.
Why are you showing me this, man?<eos> It happened a long time ago, Emile.<eos> I thought you might need a refresher.<eos> Recognize that weapon?<eos> Recall when you last saw it?
- No!<eos> Listen.<eos> This is what people are going to say.<eos> You got out of prison.<eos> You recovered the weapon from where you'd hidden it.
You got out of prison.<eos> You recovered the weapon from where you'd hidden it.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - You used it to kill Tamika and her baby, and you put it in his church to frame Reverend Price.
Did Daniel and all his gang find Jesus at once?<eos> Or did they find a safe place to land to process and distribute heroin?<eos> Not to mention money laundering.<eos> Any luck?<eos> This heroin is from the 28th Street Bloods operation, but the boy who sold it to me already has defense lawyers.
_<eos> _<eos> Well, one of these searches is me... when we first found the weapon in the church.<eos> Sharon: Yes, I see that, Mike.<eos> But before we found the gun, Francine, you I.D.'d it from its casings.
But I thought being your son meant that I couldn't talk to criminals when... when...<eos> Well, if they'd invoked their rights, but Gary has decided to defend himself.<eos> You can ask him anything you want.<eos> And... And can I, um... can I record our conversation?<eos> The county will record it for you.
Pero... no.<eos> It's my baby."<eos> And I said, "Well, could you?<eos> 'Cause I'm trying to watch this movie."<eos> "And... your baby's ruining it."
"I have...<eos> When... When Jeanette came by, she... she didn't...<eos> she brought the yellow cup that... she didn't want to kick the ball back, but I said, can...<eos> 'Cause Brian's cup is red, that if you... if you...<eos> if you don't have it now, then you don't have to bring the blue...
By the way, is anybody listening?<eos> Does anybody care about us?<eos> Yes.<eos> The University of Paris has asked me to do a lecture, in fact.<eos> I'm going to be doing it via Skype from right here.
You're not the most meticulous of people.<eos> This guy isn't very neat, is he?<eos> He walked right through the trash.<eos> No, Jai.<eos> Any normal person would have walked around it.
To promote construction, the government makes the railroad companies an unprecedented offer... millions of acres of free land.<eos> For every mile of track that a railroad would build, Congress would provide the company with land on either side of the track.<eos> The land grants that Congress provides really is the sweetheart deal of the century.<eos> 175 million acres are given to the railroad companies... more land than the entire state of Texas.<eos> The railroads then take the land they got for free and sell it to the settlers... using a massive advertising campaign that promotes the West as an uninhabited paradise.
Grant realizes the only way to defeat the Indians is to send his best commander from the Civil War... a man stationed 2,000 miles away in Texas who's famous for both his victories and his unconventional commanding style.<eos> His name is George Armstrong Custer.<eos> George Armstrong Custer was very flamboyant.<eos> He had flowing blond hair.<eos> Some say he curled it himself.
There's a place called Wood Cave there that many of us believe that's where we came from.<eos> We value the land and the animals just as much as we do people.<eos> Gold had no meaning, no value to us.<eos> Of all the places the United States could've wanted the Lakota to sell... the Black Hills were the worst place that they could've chosen.<eos> Sitting Bull famously picks up a little pinch of dirt and he holds it up, and he says
Looking to make it big in the booming cattle industry,<eos> Tunstall has bought a ranch outside of Lincoln, New Mexico, and in just two short years has become one of the most successful cattle barons in the territory.<eos> But with his success, he's upset some very powerful men.<eos> Lincoln was the wildest of the Wild West.<eos> The law was almost nonexistent, and the people who controlled it were generally corrupt.
- He's a cheat.<eos> - Easy there.<eos> - The guy cheated.<eos> - Put the gun away.<eos> - His gun, did you see it?
No one could tell the outlaws what to do.<eos> A lot of Americans could imagine,<eos> "Boy, if things had been different, I could be as bold and brave as daring as Jesse James or as Billy the Kid.<eos> The Old West engaged your imagination in a way nothing else has ever done.<eos> And it really is that eternal American figure, that guy who faces adversity and comes through it.
She doesn't have the option.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hey, look, that thing you wanted, that charm or crystal or whatever?<eos> The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?<eos> Yeah, this guy I was with, he grabbed it.
Damn it.<eos> Quentin! - Oh, no.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> I told you, keep up with that stupid song, and I'd come right into your brain and rip it out.
Hey! Hi.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> Sorry, I don't know if you remember me but I got your bag.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course. Hi.<eos> I'm really sorry, I just took it by mistake.
Ugh. About 20 blocks to go.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - This old water tunnel.<eos> So, the silver powder...<eos> how do we disperse it?
That's what you do.<eos> Puzzles.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> It's scary.<eos> I've had a wonderful life and now I'm going to forget it all.
Easy money, really.<eos> I imagine the temptation was just too great, eh, Freddie?<eos> Chief!<eos> You were right.<eos> I searched Freddie's house and found it.
How do you sleep at night, Lord Ecbert?<eos> How do you sleep?<eos> Your Grace, I wish to commend you for everything you've done for me, and for Paris.<eos> And for me.<eos> I gave you my word. And I kept it.
Why did you look at me that way?<eos> In that fashion?<eos> Why should you pity me?<eos> I think you carry a terrible burden.<eos> And you carry it alone.
Where are you?<eos> Are you at my house?<eos> I found the backpack.<eos> The dead kid's best friend, a nice young man named Liam.<eos> He took it.
Just breathe.<eos> The drug will take her soon.<eos> Narcan.<eos> Heroin antidote.<eos> All the agents looking for you have it.
I wasn't. Not a wink.<eos> Too excited. A little nervous.<eos> When do we leave for the first interview?<eos> We should get in the car as soon as you're done with your blood transfusion, which should be starting now.<eos> Or have you already done it?
No.<eos> We need to set the tone for today.<eos> Lookinglass and this announcement need to own the news cycle.<eos> If I cancel interviews, then that is what they will talk about.<eos> Your transfusion. You need it.
He's clean.<eos> Please remember your camera's in your contact lens.<eos> So do us all a favor and don't look in the mirror.<eos> This scar come with a story?<eos> I got it saving his uncle's ass.
- I had to get some air. - Oh.<eos> That was, um, some song you sang with Piggy.<eos> Well, it-it was just an old corny number.<eos> Yeah, I'm not really talking about the song. Hmm?<eos> I'm talking about the way you looked at her when you sang it.
Not on the licence.<eos> The Fontaine woman says the wife is dark skinned and a bit of a slattern.<eos> I haven't heard that word in a while.<eos> When was the last time you heard the word "slattern"?<eos> I've never heard it.
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.<eos> Didn't your girlfriend just break up with you?<eos> - Yeah? - Pretty sure she just did.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> Wait, so if that app gives you eyes and ears all over the city, then why don't you use it to find the next Ms. Right?
I did it.<eos> What?<eos> Whoa, whoa, what is that?<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom.
No, I actually learned it in a book.<eos> - I di... Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> There it is again... that song.<eos> That's the third time I've heard it today.
No doubt.<eos> Demand and supply.<eos> Don't you mean supply and demand?<eos> No, they've been teaching that wrong for years.<eos> You see, demand comes first, and whoever supplies it profits.
You know how to use that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Look.<eos> I should've told you first.<eos> I won't bring it around if you don't want me to.
It could be cheese. It could be cheese!<eos> I don't think we have room for any more cheese.<eos> -I will make room for cheese.<eos> -I'm putting that on your tombstone.<eos> And don't try to make a wig out of that stuff, 'cause I'm not gonna wear it.
-No.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Grace!<eos> -Sir, you need to pay your bill.<eos> I haven't brought it yet, but I was going to.
You can't match $100 million in ad buys.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Flush your money down the drain.<eos> The Democrats lost that battle decades ago.<eos> And you'll lose it again.
Not if Conway is busy fighting public outcry.<eos> Think about the data they have already gathered.<eos> When you sold us this, you said it was going to be a last resort, not the only resort.<eos> There is no risk in getting surveillance approved.<eos> Then we either use it or we don't.
They're going to fight this tooth and nail.<eos> Well, of course they are.<eos> And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.<eos> Oh, it'll pass.<eos> Because you are going to push it until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.
I-I-I can't.<eos> Look, every safety deposit box requires two keys.<eos> The bank... has one and the box renter holds onto the other.<eos> Now, I'm betting that Bob doesn't have his key anymore.<eos> I think the man who killed him has it.
- What the hell?<eos> - Norman! Hey, quiet down now or we'll throw you out.<eos> Hey, get your hands off me, man!<eos> I'm just looking for my friend, man!<eos> Shut your mouth now or I'll shut it for you.
What did you do with the evidence we collected from the camper we found?<eos> Boxed it up like you told me to.<eos> You said you were going to take care of it.<eos> I know what I said.<eos> First thing tomorrow morning, I want you to ship it out for analysis.
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.<eos> I felt slower.<eos> I did it.<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom.
Often,<eos> Frantz played the violin for us.<eos> It was not a great musician, but he played with all their heart.<eos> Your room.<eos> It is just as he left it.
He apologized.<eos> All is forgiven youth.<eos> Mi querida Anna.<eos> I write this letter in French, so that my parents can not read it.<eos> I hope you get it.
I had to see him off, you know.<eos> They are doing so great!<eos> Oh, they're struggling, like everybody, believe me.<eos> I mean, we bought a house, and I'm the only one who's had a chance to see it.<eos> What if they hate it?
I guess we'll be living off Big Mart for a while.<eos> What's this?<eos> I kind of put off telling you, but the gas range is broken.<eos> - What?<eos> - But they said they'd fix it.
Yeah, Mom.<eos> It's guy talk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you get that hat?<eos> Oh, I grabbed it for him out of the old Lost and Found.
Suzy, nice and slow.<eos> - _<eos> - Once we find a tower, we have to keep the calls short.<eos> Our signal's hot.<eos> Anyone watching will catch it fast.
Now you have to take up ceramics.<eos> You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> I bet she still has it.
Whoa! Oh, hey, guys.<eos> Now, that is how rumors get started.<eos> This is not how it looks.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it looks like you got a sex doll and you dressing it up to look like Amy.
I mean that literally.<eos> Well, Helene's 40.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll stop by after the barbecue.<eos> A bunch of firemen are throwing it.
Homeless?<eos> What happened to that two grand you got from Gus' ring?<eos> I can't use that.<eos> I got to give the ring back.<eos> Well, you know you always have our place if you need it.
Uh, so it's a long story.<eos> Um, someone got a hold of my phone, and they-- they sent out this picture.<eos> Professor Runyon?<eos> That was you?<eos> Jesus Christ, you saw it too?
This is ridiculous, okay?<eos> We have no porno!<eos> I'm on eBay.<eos> I'm bidding on another copy of "The Nutting Professor."<eos> It's gonna be delivered to the office where it's gonna require a signature so no one can steal it.
It was a disagreement over their priorities.<eos> Hank and Malik fought for the basic rights of the Egyptian people when their own freedoms were still in jeopardy.<eos> And he could identify the others in the picture.<eos> The unsub was using Hank for information.<eos> When the unsub gets it, Hank is as good as dead.
I cannot turn my back on who I am.<eos> Didn't your hair used to be darker?<eos> I'm just saying this is a great opportunity for our sauce.<eos> "Our sauce"?<eos> All of a sudden, Cam is calling it "our sauce"?
Didn't your hair used to be darker?<eos> I'm just saying this is a great opportunity for our sauce.<eos> "Our sauce"?<eos> All of a sudden, Cam is calling it "our sauce"?<eos> I got that recipe from my great aunt who got it from her mother who stole it from a blind maid.
Teach me.<eos> Reach to the sky! How are you better at this than Jane Fonda?<eos> Mitchell, you can't talk and feel the burn at the same time.<eos> Donkey-kick like you mean it, Jennifer.<eos> I'm just curious, because this tape was on its way to goodwill, and all of a sudden, you pulled it out of your back pocket.
But she's never going to stop until she gets that painting.<eos> She's sent me six text messages since we hung up<eos> -and they all say "Kenny Loggins."<eos> -Here's what you do.<eos> You go to the garage, you dig it out, you say you got it back from him, and he sends his best.
Shit!<eos> Come on, Dixon!<eos> What about the Russians?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We provided an exit. Son of a bitch turned it down.
Hey, you two, keep your distance.<eos> Yellow jacket, miss, back up.<eos> Stay patient.<eos> Everyone will receive a box.<eos> Once you receive it, please just move quickly to the left.
Why should I risk everything I have for this?<eos> It won't bring them back.<eos> - Won't save any lives.<eos> - No, it won't.<eos> But our friends died searching for the truth, and you're just a few keystrokes away from finding it.
All About Eve, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> 'Cause Adam...<eos> Adam told her not to eat that apple.<eos> And she ate it, she became wise.
I didn't say he fucked her.<eos> Well, why else?<eos> Dude's weird.<eos> He came over to my place last week, we have a couple of drinks, and this cockroach crawls out.<eos> But instead of stepping on it, he... put it in the blender.
You're coming with me to the baby product convention this weekend.<eos> Rusty bailed on me, so I need your help with the diaper boxes.<eos> Ugh. How much does it pay?<eos> A lumpy bed and your mom's cooking. ♪ ♪ Where's the table?<eos> Couldn't find it.
What... did you go to the car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I checked the trunk, but there was just a tabletop... no legs.<eos> It's a folding table!<eos> Didn't you lift it up and see that the legs are underneath it?
Yes, it is.<eos> Gotta start pinching pennies around here.<eos> Diapers are like 30 bucks, and formula's like 25 a box.<eos> - Well, why formula?<eos> - I told him to get it.
They're real. [Fork snaps]<eos> I broke another fork.<eos> New one coming up.<eos> This pepper's out.<eos> I'll refill it right away.
Jimmy Jam: You guys don't look like you had a very good time tonight.<eos> Whoa! Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!<eos> Janet's producers!<eos> Uh, they're crazy.<eos> [Indistinct shouting] I'm gonna get my taser, and I'm gonna set it to "kid."
We've been through Halloween vandals, black mold, termites.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And after all that, we're only gonna break even.<eos> We're supposed to make money on this house.<eos> And if we rent it out, we will.
Exactly.<eos> And after all that, we're only gonna break even.<eos> We're supposed to make money on this house.<eos> And if we rent it out, we will.<eos> "We" rent it out?
We're supposed to make money on this house.<eos> And if we rent it out, we will.<eos> "We" rent it out?<eos> That man was right.<eos> Why buy a sickly cow and fatten it up and then sell it for beans? No.
Well, maybe now they do, but...<eos> Wait.<eos> It gets better.<eos> So the next day, my picture is on the front page of every paper in the city.<eos> They even used it for the recruiting poster.
Why'd you write it?<eos> And why'd you leave everything in?<eos> I want people to know what we did.<eos> I'm proud of it.<eos> This city was an ugly mess, and-and we took it back block by block.
That's a comedy, genius.<eos> And at least that movie came out this century.<eos> Sean.<eos> My favorite is actually a made-for-TV one.<eos> Saw it when I was a kid.
The fail safes were disabled.<eos> This was deliberate.<eos> The lens array is totally fried.<eos> Someone put it in backwards.<eos> Instead of focusing the temporal stream, it dispersed it.
She seemed very protective of him.<eos> So I'm just trying to figure out who to go at next.<eos> - So Denny took the gun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If he did, he'd have thrown it in the river.
You know, I also wonder, what happened to Clara Riggins?<eos> Well, the bedroom down the hall is untouched.<eos> Looks like it's been that way for a while.<eos> This house is well cared for.<eos> He looked after it.
I have to find him right away, but how?<eos> Excuse me. Did you say "Galavant"?<eos> Oh, I hear he's staying at his father's place just a five days' walk away from here.<eos> Oh. And I just found his sword.<eos> Do you want it?
Leo wants me to quit my job.<eos> What?<eos> Abby, you can't quit.<eos> Leo, by the way, he took a campaign in Texas.<eos> He hates Texas, but he took it because he says it didn't matter, he never sees me anyway, and I was ready to get mad, but... He's right.
I remember some fucking soppy note coming through the door, saying, like,<eos> "How can we go on like brothers?"<eos> It was like, "Fuck right off!"<eos> So that got rolled up and then another line of crystal meth went up the old fucking tubular bells.<eos> So, I woke up in the morning and I found a note underneath my door and I opened it up, and I knew it.
No rule book, with his big, mad laugh, going, "Yeah, let's fucking have it!"<eos> They were the best times I ever had recording.<eos> It's gorgeous and sexy, and... Have your priorities right.<eos> Liam was extraordinary.<eos> And they had this freaky thing where Noel would play the song once on an acoustic guitar in the control room, to Liam, give him the words and he'd fucking sing it.

Sounds like a plan.<eos> Paul Bunyan's sister, go to the freezer, get me the emergency ice cream cake, stat!<eos> Everybody gets a piece.<eos> Is there just the one emergency, uh, ice cream cake?<eos> Because someone might've eaten it last night.
So if Heavy puts the video online, who's he trying to take down?<eos> The Senator?<eos> Or The Lance?<eos> Maybe both.<eos> If there's a connection between Heavy and the Senator, we're gonna find it.
Thanks.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You gotta show me how you do that triple round kick combo.<eos> Why?<eos> So you can use it on me?
- intended for the Governor?<eos> - Out of 100 or so?<eos> - That would be quite a coincidence.<eos> - Right. Which means the only possible way of getting poison into the victim's glass would be...<eos> By adding it to the glass after the Commissioner picked it
- up off the table. - Which he's not going to like.<eos> Merci.<eos> No-one else is ill.<eos> And none of the other glasses or the bottle appear to contain cyanide.<eos> So, let's try and establish who could have added the cyanide to the glass, once you'd given it to the Governor.
So, where was the President standing?<eos> - There.<eos> - Fine.<eos> And so where did you go with the glass after that?<eos> I brought it over to the Governor.
And they can't tell us anything for certain about the computer or<eos> - the printer that was used.<eos> - No fingerprints on the letter itself and only one set on the envelope - the Governor's.<eos> So, it was handed to Caroline by someone wearing gloves?<eos> Or someone in gloves left it in her handbag.
- the printer that was used.<eos> - No fingerprints on the letter itself and only one set on the envelope - the Governor's.<eos> So, it was handed to Caroline by someone wearing gloves?<eos> Or someone in gloves left it in her handbag.<eos> A place they knew she'd find it.
So, did you send your reply? Er...<eos> Yes, Dwayne.<eos> In the end, I decided to go with my own version, I hope you don't mind.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - I went round the houses a bit on a couple of things and finally sent it off about 4am.
That is assuming we discount the Commissioner himself here.<eos> - Which we do.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> But, in the end, that is how the cyanide got into Caroline's glass.<eos> It was added after the Commissioner picked it up.
While everyone was looking at Caroline, and after she was already dead, only then did you put a lethal dose of cyanide into her glass.<eos> Knowing that we would presume it was this cyanide that had poisoned her.<eos> But that wasn't your only stroke of genius, Ellery, was it?<eos> Because it was also what you wrote in this letter.<eos> You knew that when we opened it we would find apparent proof that
Let's just say, when I do, it doesn't make me any happier.<eos> Happiness is a myth.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I had it before.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> I see why my brother likes you.<eos> - James. - When you see ol' Dave, tell him there's a new sheriff in town.<eos> The Author's power is far greater than that bearded old man wanted you to believe.<eos> And when you broke the quill, you sent it right down here to the Underworld.

And you're going to send me back to our world.
It's yours. I think we both made mistakes.<eos> Killian's been fighting darkness his entire life, and you pushed him off the cliff.<eos> I was trying to save his life.<eos> And it was a bloody selfish thing to do.<eos> He had a chance to die a hero, to move on, and you took it from him.
Let me guess.<eos> You went in search of the Eye of the Storm?<eos> If you ask me, you got what you deserved.<eos> You may be right, but that gem is no legend.<eos> You found it.
Or if you just want to stay up here and be a teenager, that's... cool, too.<eos> Wait.<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> The Author's pen?<eos> I thought you destroyed it.
- I don't think so. - Mom.<eos> And my Blockbuster original series has been keeping me very busy.<eos> I still don't get how that's gonna work, at all.<eos> Babe, it makes total sense.<eos> They make the whole season, put it on six DVD's.
And my Blockbuster original series has been keeping me very busy.<eos> I still don't get how that's gonna work, at all.<eos> Babe, it makes total sense.<eos> They make the whole season, put it on six DVD's.<eos> People go to their local Blockbuster Video and rent it out one disc at a time for five days each.
I don't want to talk to you.<eos> I want to tell you something, but it's very confidential, okay?<eos> Mommy is going to free Tibet.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Catherine, come on, honey, remember when you were little and you had that "Free Tibet" sticker and you put it up on the wall and we couldn't get it off, remember, because you put it on wallpaper inexplicably.
I'm shadowing Keith. - Yes, he did.<eos> - Definitely. I was there. Don, again.<eos> Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan has always been... entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox?<eos> You know, you give the platform away free to consumers, and then once you have a big enough user base, then you sell premium services to businesses.<eos> If we're giving it away now and waiting until later to sell it, what are we doing here now?
Listen, we have to do neural net for deep learning.<eos> Look, once we get enough data flowing through the system, it will be able to recognize long-range patterns and actually learn.<eos> It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own, increasing our already superior speed and efficiency. Right?<eos> Pretty cool, huh?<eos> But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.
The ultimate enterprise data storage solution.<eos> Now that's what I'm talking about.<eos> This is the game we're playing, team, so let's win it!<eos> You guys, check it out.<eos> Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon and filled it with watermelon jello!
Just for a little bit?<eos> No.<eos> Whoa, whoa, hold on. You're wearing a gold chain?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, I've had it for a while. Just kind of throw it on every now and then.
- It's Baal. - It's Baal.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> We need the Kandarian dagger.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Oh, someone confiscated it.
And it works, too, sweetie.<eos> That's something that Mother told me that works.<eos> Okay, you pour the hot water into the pot, all right?<eos> Swirl it around a bit.<eos> And then you pour it out, okay?
Monica, do you really need to be here?<eos> - Geek Squad.<eos> - The computer's right here.<eos> You're not wearing the shirt.<eos> I spilled coffee on it.
We could go to the border, the river.<eos> Yeah, but people pressing in from both sides is dangerous.<eos> - But water.<eos> - That's why it's dangerous.<eos> Everyone needs it.
- Stop. Secretariat in theaters now.<eos> - How exciting.<eos> - Please stop. People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you, all over the country.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Or not. Maybe nobody's seeing it.
So I drove here, right?<eos> I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card.<eos> I gotta drive all the way home to get it.<eos> When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere.<eos> Suddenly, I remember: I put it in the glove compartment.
It might be worth something someday.<eos> You're sweet, Todd.<eos> You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it.<eos> Hey, you want this plum?<eos> I found it in the kitchen.
Well, then, work around his schedule.<eos> You're overplaying your hand, PC, and I'm calling your bluff.<eos> I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko, and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> I was clearly establishing a poker metaphor, you just changed it to a game of chicken.
We're in a fragile period, still finding our feet.<eos> Just give me six months and then you can go.<eos> I promise, I'll never ask anything from you again, but please, give me six months.<eos> Sorry, I left my coat here.<eos> [waiter] I got it.
Excuse me? Do you know you're breaking the law by giving everybody water?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I want the water. Yeah, we all want water.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> In the state of California, it is illegal for a restaurant to serve people water before they ask for it.
Hey, Elisabet?<eos> Hi.<eos> Before you go, I just wanted to say that I thought your last commit was very impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it.
I actually kind of liked her.<eos> Too bad Richard's going to fuck it up.<eos> So, you moved the swimming pool?<eos> Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far from the house, like, crazy far.<eos> So I had this company come and just move it closer.
We are not releasing the beta.<eos> We integrated the neural net a week ago.<eos> The platform is full of bugs.<eos> But that is what a beta is for.<eos> You give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.
What about... what about the interface?<eos> Did people have any issues with that?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Do you have any issues with the interface? I...<eos> I haven't actually had a chance to look at it yet.
They must know it's us.<eos> - That hard drive is fucked.<eos> - This is my personal laptop.<eos> You opened a stolen beta on your personal computer?<eos> Yes. And I installed it on my phone.
But somebody like me could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there are some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.<eos> Did you like the movie, hon?<eos> No, it sucked!<eos> I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now.<eos> "Dude, don't bother with new 'Ghostbusters.' Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it."
I noticed your jacket.<eos> Do you work for Pied Piper?<eos> - Dude, your app is killin' it.<eos> Everyone I know is installing it. Do you seriously?<eos> I just downloaded it last night.
- "The president stated that since the..."<eos> Are you serious right now?<eos> !<eos> Get off that computer!<eos> Mom, we were just using it to look at the news.
What are you saying?<eos> Saying that Mateo wasn't trying to stop Barrios.<eos> He might've been involved.<eos> Mrs. Ortega... I have to ask you:<eos> The van at your house... You know if Mateo used it three nights ago?
You broke into my office.<eos> With due respect, sir, you broke into my mind.<eos> I built your mind, Bernard.<eos> I have every right to wander through its rooms and chambers and halls, and to change it if I choose, even to burn it down.<eos> After all this time, I know it almost as intimately as my own.
What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.
Will you tell me?<eos> "Prune, that last evening we spent together "meant a lot to me.<eos> "I think about it very often.<eos> "I relive each moment...<eos> "I'm going to take it with me.
Is it time for you to have "the talk" with your dad?<eos> Because he's gonna have to read a few things first. No.<eos> I'm tearing it down.<eos> Ralph has a cool treehouse, and mine sucks.<eos> Well, Bart, your father built it, and he did the very best he could.
Well, Bart, your father built it, and he did the very best he could.<eos> I did my job.<eos> Now it's your turn, tree.<eos> Get growing.<eos> I'll tell you what, why don't I spruce it up for you. Huh?
But someday you'll understand that providing our family with a better life...<eos> Something I've never been able to do.<eos> ...is the most important thing in the world.<eos> We've been given a third ball.<eos> Let's not throw it away.
I am a hypochondriac.<eos> I've been taking my own blood pressure since I was nine.<eos> Why is Sylvester administering you medical care?<eos> My doctor says my numbers are up.<eos> He wants me to check it every morning.
It's working. They're moving!<eos> Smart thinking, son.<eos> Hey, Doc... Hmm... Oh, it's good to hear your voice.<eos> Are we... naked?<eos> Yeah, I saw a chopportunity and I took it.
Meghan, I gotta come right out and say it, you made a piece of shit, tonight!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> ! Dad, we're eating dinner.<eos> This is our special family time.<eos> I can't be expected to have shit put in front of me, and eat it, and be ready for my race tomorrow!
Ready.<eos> Bryan Iguchi showed me a lot more than just how to kick out a method.<eos> You know, he handed down the modus operandi, a certain way of living.<eos> He is the humble master.<eos> I had a vision of what the potential of snowboarding could become, and he realized it.
No.<eos> Where is the flash drive?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The flash drive you traded for Mateo.<eos> Who did you give it to?
Where is the flash drive?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The flash drive you traded for Mateo.<eos> Who did you give it to?<eos> We gave it to Rose.
What are you talking about?<eos> The flash drive you traded for Mateo.<eos> Who did you give it to?<eos> We gave it to Rose.<eos> No, she doesn't have it... who does?
So, while we're waiting for the sun to go down, I want to show you something.<eos> I was going through some old stuff the other day, and I randomly came across this old letter it's from our Camp Canyon Grove...<eos> Oh! Days, yeah.<eos> And I was like, "oh, my God, I have to show Josh this letter."<eos> So, do you, do you want me to read it?
I'm the one who messed up.<eos> All you ever tried to do was help me.<eos> All you ever tried to do was help me!<eos> You came for an apology, Joe.<eos> I'ma give it to you.
Not his bloodline.<eos> Don't talk to him.<eos> You are making the rules?<eos> I have the sword, you're tied down.<eos> You have the sword, but you won't use it.
Finding someplace safe to disappear.<eos> I spent months moving my Emperor from one hiding place to the next, and you still found us.<eos> You're fooling yourself if you think those Mongol soldiers are the last ones to come your way.<eos> Our protection is your best bet.<eos> And if you want it, you have to earn your keep.
Yes.<eos> And then I spent the next three years traveling by your side.<eos> Right up until you abandoned me.<eos> What was your plan then?<eos> I simply saw an opportunity to gain favor with the Khan and I took it.
There was this girl.<eos> I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony... smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.
I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony... smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.<eos> She'd pull it up.
Blake, get me the ambassador, will you?<eos> So, is there anything else that I should know?<eos> Yes.<eos> He and President Dalton have been friends since college.<eos> Maxwell inherited a large sum of money and invested it in some high-risk enterprises.
You read the whole thing?<eos> It's like a horror film.<eos> Bioterror weaponry, diseases that jump from animals to humans, accelerated climate change, demon robots who will take over the world.<eos> Well, a demon robot is welcome to take over my world as long as he cleans my bathroom and organizes my stuff.<eos> You know, I'm gonna get a 3-D printer, use it to make another 3-D printer, then return the first one.
The ambassador has a gun to President Shwe's head.<eos> And this action seems to be linked to the trade agreement.<eos> Are we sure the gun is real?<eos> Where's a Buddhist even get a firearm?<eos> Probably brought it with him from when he was an average American citizen.
Just hear me out!<eos> I've been hearing you out.<eos> Now you need to hear me out.<eos> I'm done with that life.<eos> I don't want it.
I'm done with that life.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I don't miss it.<eos> Well, that's just a flat-out lie.<eos> I don't want it.
Eugene loved her, too.<eos> One day, he gets the courage to confess his love, and she rejects him.<eos> Now, any normal kid would sulk, nurse his broken heart, let it go.<eos> Not Eugene.<eos> Eugene got a shotgun, put it to her head, and blew half her head off.
Okay.<eos> I-I know how much the church meant to you.<eos> What about the church?<eos> Well, y-you don't know?<eos> Well, they're tearing it down.
Well, y-you don't know?<eos> Well, they're tearing it down.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Preacher, he... he gave it to Mr. Quincannon.
What?<eos> !<eos> Preacher, he... he gave it to Mr. Quincannon.<eos> Well, at least, he was supposed to.<eos> He gave it?
Uh-huh. Come on.<eos> It's like "Lady and the Tramp," except with our butts.<eos> Jesse Custer, do not come near me with that thing.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Oh, you know you want it. You know.
I am the Alpha and the Omega.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I am the bright morning star.<eos> I just saw you picking your nose.<eos> No, my son, I was scratching it.
Okay, you do it.<eos> Well, I would, but Ms. Grant needs me to proof a column for her ASAP.<eos> I'm sure one day she'll give you more editorial responsibilities too.<eos> Fine.<eos> I know you see yourself as a plucky heroine who broke a story as big as Watergate and then gave it to my biggest competitor, and I know you think that once the Daily Planet runs the story that you will have a fancy job there,
Well, you can't.<eos> I also can't refuse someone who asks for help.<eos> Okay, Dr. Meyer says tween years are the most vulnerable. I wouldn't be in this situation if my dad would let me leave school, like I want to.<eos> It can be a dangerous time, Eddie.<eos> But isn't that the point? For him to get through it, so he can learn the skills he needs to deal with the IS?
- No.<eos> Well, I got to clean up and get this one started on his homework.<eos> Oh, can...<eos> What?<eos> The door. Could we open it?
I realized the Kryptonians were using my LTE interface system.<eos> That's why they broke into my lab over Christmas.<eos> They're using my satellites to send neural signals directly into the minds of everyone in National City.<eos> These scramble the signal before they reach my brain.<eos> If you invented technology that blocks Myriad, why didn't you give it to the DEO?
That's awful.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.<eos> Uh, why... why would you sue us?<eos> I never gave permission for the school to use it to put on that play.
Maybe he could use a friend.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You're Ezra Bridger.<eos> I heard your transmission.<eos> Yeah? My parents heard it, too.
A curse was put on the family along with a prophecy.<eos> Harmony would be restored when the raven took over.<eos> I have raven-coloured hair!<eos> So you went to see Francie and had her read your palm, hoping for confirmation?<eos> And did you get it?
-Just shut up and drink, quiz fucks.<eos> Drinks, I say!<eos> I think my father is calling me.<eos> Look what I found.<eos> Naman takes the bottle... uncorks it... and sniffs it deeply.
I wouldn't kid about a mask like this.<eos> What is this, some kind of magic?<eos> Something like that.<eos> What does it say?<eos> It says you'll pay me half of what you earn for as long as you wear it.
Hey, maybe... Maybe we should head back, huh?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Why don't you run home to Mommy?<eos> We came here chasing death.<eos> We should not be surprised if we find it.
Aldrich!<eos> Let 'em go.<eos> What do you care about them?<eos> They took your payday.<eos> Yeah, I'm taking it back.
You want to go out like your friend, like a warrior.<eos> Just give me what I want, and I'll be happy to oblige.<eos> No more shame, no more guilt.<eos> Unless, of course, you don't have the card.<eos> You gave it to the girl.
You're welcome, sweetie.<eos> Let's talk tomorrow.<eos> Do you not see the big picture here?<eos> What, that you're pimping out your daughter?<eos> Ah, so you do see it.
We should have a charades night.<eos> - Okay, Rebecca...<eos> - I haven't seen anyone since the beach.<eos> Rebecca, wait, wait, someone broke into your house?<eos> Yes, yes, they broke in, and, um, they-they smashed it, uh, with a big...
No. No, just the rock through the window.<eos> So I was scared, and I came here, and the door was unlocked.<eos> Oh, man. I mean, you know, I do that sometimes.<eos> Did I leave the fridge open, too?<eos> Yes, you did, and I closed it, and I saved a lot of cold cuts.

It's all academic.<eos> I've no more to invest.<eos> But I do.<eos> I have an inheritance ...<eos> and I want to put it to use.
No!<eos> George killed a man.<eos> We have to bury the body.<eos> I have an inheritance.<eos> And I want to put it to use.
Your father... used to take you on walks.<eos> He'd have Martha by the hand and you up on his shoulders.<eos> All the way up to Castleberg Crag.<eos> Oh, he could turn a Sunday walk through the Dales into a right adventure. Do you remember?<eos> He once made a den out of sticks and he called it a castle.
You want a big overblown ceremony costing a fortune while the rest of the country is on rations, have it. But don't come bleating to me when your head and the heads of our children are on spikes.<eos> If the people are hungry, they want something that lifts them up.<eos> And how do you propose lifting them if they cannot see it?<eos> The people look to a monarchy for something bigger than themselves. An inspiration. A higher ideal.<eos> If you put it in their homes, allow them to watch it with their dinner on their laps.
Disconnect from Arkadia.<eos> That would be unwise.<eos> The migration is still incomplete and the backpack is now compromised.<eos> Without Arkadia's mainframe, the mobile unit would be my sole power source.<eos> If they destroy it... I will be terminated.
Tim was a decorated and respected member of this department.<eos> He's entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise.<eos> Witnesses saw him shooting up a subway car.<eos> And we have a man who has Tim's wallet.<eos> I don't think Tim gave it to him.
I served your father with distinction for 20 years.<eos> You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.<eos> This has got nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course it does.<eos> The city is going back to the wolves 'cause you tied the hands of the people that saved it.
- I like that server.<eos> Writer Bae.<eos> - Mom!<eos> Isn't it that computer?<eos> Were you the one who took it?
Isn't it that computer?<eos> Were you the one who took it?<eos> We were scared that it disappeared!<eos> Oh, this?<eos> There was a lot of dust in it, so I cleaned it off outside.
I don't need to move, plus Cameron's cool.<eos> Oh, I will miss his sheets.<eos> That thread count was ridiculous.<eos> I don't think Cameron really liked us on his bed.<eos> As if Lord of the Purity Rings ever used it.
There were no reports that did not lead anywhere.<eos> You, Steinar.<eos> You did not do your shooting test.<eos> -I'll do it.<eos> If it happens to you something and you have not done it ...
He shot at me, I returned fire.<eos> Had not Mary sitting there so had I put a bullet in the shoulder at him.<eos> How was it that you went there?<eos> -To The summer cottage?<eos> Jens bought it seven years ago as a gift for his mother.
One's about your writing... and you know what it is.<eos> Please.<eos> Please make some copies.<eos> You know that I know your poetry is really, really good.<eos> And some day you might just decide to let the world get to read it.
That would be... amazing honey.<eos> And you know what else?<eos> My guitar should arrive today.<eos> My Harlequin guitar direct from Esteban.<eos> Is Esteban going to deliver it personally?
Where is this coming from?<eos> From Janice.<eos> What?<eos> You showed her her own commemorative action figure the same day that she died.<eos> Bet you didn't think she'd take it with her, did you?
From Janice.<eos> What?<eos> You showed her her own commemorative action figure the same day that she died.<eos> Bet you didn't think she'd take it with her, did you?<eos> See, we found it... in her hand... clenched up like this.
I don't think anyone starts out wanting to be a portraitist.<eos> Yeah. But in your search for your métier, you've tried a bit of everything.<eos> That's true.<eos> I came to painting quite late.<eos> And now that you've found it, you'll never leave it, yes?
"My heart's careless today."<eos> "You're in control... of me today."<eos> "Let the crazy world say... what they want to say."<eos> "It's full of opportunities... life's like a Ferrari."<eos> "Life is just like you lived it till now."
- What?<eos> What?<eos> Finders keepers, don't be too smart.<eos> What happened?<eos> - He stole his wallet and not is returning it.
This is my lucky purse.<eos> Inder.<eos> Inder.<eos> It's someone's wallet.<eos> Why are you throwing it away?
Don't you, sir?<eos> Look, we should be halfway to Havana by now.<eos> Why?<eos> She obviously doesn't want our help.<eos> Maybe or maybe not, but she needs it.
Braving the elements!<eos> Keeping the family dry!<eos> That is fur!<eos> What's the plan, Luke?<eos> There are no bad ideas, but waving a metal shovel around in an electrical storm could have a downside, so let's put it back in the garage, huh?
Jay!<eos> Jay.<eos> The water is coming inside the house from the pool!<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Because Phil was supposed to pump it out!
We're taking you to the hospital.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not the patient.<eos> The bullet's lodged at the base of the neck.<eos> We need you to get it out.
Just go take a walk, please.<eos> He's just like your fuckin' father.<eos> Get out!<eos> We needed that house, nina.<eos> We needed it.
I'll manage.<eos> Just... Let me talk to jp, okay?<eos> He will calm down.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Just tell jp he can have it.
Just... Let me talk to jp, okay?<eos> He will calm down.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Just tell jp he can have it.<eos> He can sell it.
Just tell jp he can have it.<eos> He can sell it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> He can't have it.<eos> Dad left it to you.
You couldn't let me know what's going on?<eos> If I had known that you'd been arrested, I could have done something!<eos> I could have moved the hearing!<eos> You get one call, man!<eos> And you can't fucking use it?
Guns are not like dogs.<eos> They don't recognise their owners.<eos> If I shoot, you'll get shot.<eos> Why did you buy a gun if you can't even use it?<eos> I didn't buy it to kill someone.
They don't recognise their owners.<eos> If I shoot, you'll get shot.<eos> Why did you buy a gun if you can't even use it?<eos> I didn't buy it to kill someone.<eos> I bought it to protect myself.
And I, and I couldn't stop thinking about that.<eos> We were on the road.<eos> Another trip.<eos> I... waited until he fell asleep, and then... I went into his bag.<eos> And I took out the straight razor he used to shave and I held it right up to his neck.
Don't forget, repeated use is supposed to turn people who use it into monsters, okay?<eos> So, look, if you go in there, do not mess with this stuff.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> See if you can get a sample of what he's selling.<eos> We take it to the lab.
Perhaps I might act for you.<eos> There's a great deal of business that needs to be attended to.<eos> The despatch boxes are probably already on their way to you with documents that require your signature.<eos> Tomorrow is the Privy Council.<eos> Thank you, Lord Melbourne, but when I require assistance, I will ask for it.
And I know... one thing.<eos> One thing for sure is that... I'm scared and you're not.<eos> I don't know any prayers or anything like that, uh, but, uh...<eos> David put his hand in the bag,<eos> and took out a stone and slung it, and... and struck the Philistine on the head.
And then you'll have the power to steal this brain and enact my time-travel spell... for you!<eos> And only you!<eos> Because that's what I would do.<eos> No.<eos> You want revenge and until you get it, you will never be satisfied.
Fuck me.<eos> This is going to bury us.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Look, she found the letter after he died.<eos> If she'd found it before he died, then he could have just come across as a guy who's pissed off about work and he's blowing off steam, not like some guy who's going to blow himself up.
Yeah. Don't listen.<eos> But I got news for you, pal!<eos> It's not your blood that's thick, it's your head!<eos> Where'd you get that cookie?<eos> You know damn well where I got it.
Nice shirt.<eos> 20 bucks.<eos> Sold.<eos> Yeah, I used to have one just like this.<eos> Heather gave it away. (laughs) Oh, wow.
I am ready for war.<eos> And not just to sit in a comfy chair and watch up on a hill while eating cucumber sandwiches, although that was delightful.<eos> No, I am actually ready to stand next to you and fight.<eos> Sounds like you found your manhood, Richard.<eos> Bobby found it...
I'm not going to miss you.<eos> This pathological liar brain is gonna get me in trouble.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Not with me.<eos> I'll know the truth when I hear it.
He's payin' off some old debts.<eos> Remember his nickname?<eos> - No.<eos> - Chinatown.<eos> 'Cause you gave him a corner right in the middle of the Blue Cobras' territory, told him it was his if he could hold it.
Right. I get it. I get it.<eos> But look, a deposition's not rocket science.<eos> There's a way to deal with them.<eos> You know? There's really five simple rules.<eos> When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, just ask them to repeat it.
It was Michelle's idea to serve it privately.<eos> She insisted.<eos> God is she weak when it comes to you.<eos> Why do I get the feeling that the actual restraining order might have been your idea?<eos> I might have suggested it as a friend and a colleague.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> He's gone!<eos> Let's start in the garage!<eos> Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.
N-No.<eos> No.<eos> You wrote a great apology.<eos> You drove across town.<eos> You slipped it under my door.
- So... when Glen and I first got married, his parents gave us, as a wedding gift, um, a little house that they had in Pennsylvania.<eos> They had it since they were married back in,<eos> I don't know, '69, and now they spend their summers in a bigger house that they moved into that's right near the little house and I think that they partly gave it to us so that they could see Glen's kids more,
-I don't need a child.<eos> He's gonna set the whole place on fire.<eos> - Oh, hey, Lorelai.<eos> - Hey. This kitchen's awesome.<eos> Sookie set it up perfectly.
"Hello, Pater--"<eos> -"Father," British or Latin.<eos> -Sure.<eos> She used the word "ontological" three times.<eos> She used it last time.
- No problem.<eos> We got some extra link sausages if anybody wants some.<eos> Babette, did you hear what I said about food purchased outside?<eos> I didn't purchase this.<eos> I brought it from home.
- Lorelai, hey!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Oh, it's great.<eos> I love this kitchen. - Mmm.<eos> - Sookie set it up so great.
Let's put it that way.<eos> I had this notion that somehow my extensive familiarity with Nick Cave, and Radiohead, and a smattering of Stravinsky destined me for success.<eos> So I'll never forget the day that I realized my composition class required composing.<eos> But I did it.<eos> I composed the melody, I added the harmonies, I drew those treble and bass clefs, I wrote those whole notes, those half notes, those quarter notes, those rest stops, and... while you'll never witness a public performance of my composition... because of that experience, I can see music when I hear it.

Call her Mom.<eos> Uh, didn't Lorelai talk to you about this?<eos> This has nothing to do with Lorelai. This is about you.<eos> - Did you lose that card I gave you?<eos> - I gave it to Lorelai.
- Number two.<eos> - You'd have to blow out the back.<eos> - He's in default.<eos> He can't complain.<eos> Yeah, blow it out.
It moves.<eos> Yes. Flour moves.<eos> - Hey, what is going on out here?<eos> - Where? Diner of the dead.<eos> Oh, yeah, some jackass asked me for the Wi-Fi password and a bigger jackass gave it to him.
To... my family's house in Maine.<eos> It's a great place.<eos> Private, on the water.<eos> It's empty.<eos> No one ever uses it.
It's a great place.<eos> Private, on the water.<eos> It's empty.<eos> No one ever uses it.<eos> My dad only bought it because Martha Stewart wanted it.
I'll go to your nutty therapist.<eos> I'll open up a franchise if that's who you want me to be, I'll run the kitchen at your inn.<eos> I'll give you back the entire closet.<eos> I only took that half because you insisted I do it.<eos> I just figured you would take it back eventually, anyhow.
It's like this story has been sitting in my brain for years,<eos> - taking up space.<eos> - Like the lyrics to "My Sharona."<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's been there, waiting for me to put it down on paper.
You're selling the house.<eos> Oh. Yes.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Why?<eos> Did you want it? No!
Did you want it? No!<eos> God, no! No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - So, no?<eos> - Sorry, but no.<eos> Since you and I don't want it, I thought I'd sell it to someone who does.
God, no! No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - So, no?<eos> - Sorry, but no.<eos> Since you and I don't want it, I thought I'd sell it to someone who does.<eos> Or someone who'll pay me a lot of money to tear it down.
Yes, there is. So would you like something to eat?<eos> I have Berta puffs from today and some mystery soup from last night.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Grandma, why is there a TV in here?<eos> One of Berta's cousins heard me talking about a live opera that was coming on, and it was during dinnertime, so they brought it down and set it up for me.
She doesn't need to be embarrassed by you!<eos> It's on the house tonight. Go! Go!<eos> She was unbelievable.<eos> Right out of left field, crazy Lorelai face appears.<eos> I've seen it before, but only when somebody cuts off her car or at a shoe sale.
It's on the house tonight. Go! Go!<eos> She was unbelievable.<eos> Right out of left field, crazy Lorelai face appears.<eos> I've seen it before, but only when somebody cuts off her car or at a shoe sale.<eos> I saw it when Marla Tipton's mom called you illegitimate.
And this was the test performed by Kurt McVeigh, the expert hired by the SA's office?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what test did you perform?<eos> An elemental composition test.<eos> He would've performed it, too, if the bullets hadn't been lost.
It's a hoard of around 200 rare antique silver coins.<eos> Sorry, do you mean, like, actual treasure?<eos> It's not quite the terminology we'd use, but, in layman's terms, yeah, treasure.<eos> And that's why you're here, to find the silver?<eos> Well, we already found it.
I knew the children in child pornography had been abused, and they suffered horrible consequences for the rest of their lives.<eos> Sometimes I would just stare at these kids and wonder like, you know, where are they now, and what horrible things they've gone through in their life.<eos> You think about it sort of in the abstract, but it doesn't stop you from doing what you're doing.<eos> [narrator] Psychologists call this "dissociation"... a screen allows you to detach your real self from your online behavior and create an alternative reality where social norms no longer apply.<eos> [David] I'm not defending looking at child pornography, but if people weren't producing it, we wouldn't be looking at it.
You waited until now because you think the committee won't have time to stop you.<eos> I'm Chief of Surgery, Alex.<eos> There's not a chance in hell I'll approve this.<eos> I'm not asking for your approval.<eos> And as Chief Innovations Officer, I no longer need it.
Where's my...<eos> Or a stab wound involving the subclavian artery?<eos> Hmm.<eos> - It's a rash.<eos> - Please don't tell us where. I think I got it in South America when I was volunteering for Doctors Without Borders.
- You cannot think that we...<eos> - I don't want to hear it!<eos> I know how the world works.<eos> I made a tape.<eos> I gave it to a lawyer.
Okay, we know Sasha Boyd's our target.<eos> What's her next move?<eos> You see the Web address within the HTML?<eos> That's the next photo Sasha embedded into the site, so the next victim, having something to do with the drugs, will be in that photo.<eos> Okay, so can we view the photo without triggering the site to send it to every
I will never allow that.<eos> Never.<eos> You want to talk about the blood, well, my heart, it has been bleeding for a while.<eos> And I think your voice is the only thing that can save it.<eos> I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it.
You want to talk about the blood, well, my heart, it has been bleeding for a while.<eos> And I think your voice is the only thing that can save it.<eos> I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it.<eos> I was 13 years old.<eos> Maestro Rivera brought it.
I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it.<eos> I was 13 years old.<eos> Maestro Rivera brought it.<eos> And it was you in "Tosca."<eos> I heard it over and over again.
Hi, is she up yet?<eos> She's not answering her phone.<eos> I haven't seen her this morning.<eos> We have a 9 AM appointment to get a pedicure.<eos> I'll do it for you for half of whatever they're charging.
Yeah, I know what you mean.<eos> Sit down. Come on.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Eggs Florentine.<eos> I tweaked the sauce a little bit, and, uh, well, you know, spiced it up.
Different streets, same avenue.<eos> Here on the South Side of Chicago, what you post on social media can make you rich and it can get you killed.<eos> You take everyday life in the streets -- weapons, the drugs.<eos> Basically, the streets inspire the music.<eos> And then you make it into a song and you take all your anger and you turn it into hyperactivity.
Okay.<eos> Sly.<eos> Happy.<eos> Did you see how he opened the door for Cabe?<eos> He lifted the handle and he turned it.
All of you trying to steal what's mine?<eos> How dare you accuse us...<eos> Open their bag.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I suggest you hand it over.
And do not call me Vicky!<eos> Whoa. You go, baby sis!<eos> Hey, that's my sister!<eos> Now, if you royal Spartax brats are finished, I, Ronan the Accuser, pronounce sentence.<eos> This refinery will be delivered to the Supreme Intelligence after Nebula has rigged it to explode.
I know it just grew back.<eos> What do you want me to do about it?<eos> He is asleep.<eos> Quill, where'd you get that tool bag?<eos> Sort of borrowed it from my dad.
What...<eos> You should be excited about this.<eos> I am excited about this.<eos> It's just... Evan's made his peace.<eos> He asked me for the truth, and I gave it to him.
What's on your mind?<eos> So...<eos> - I got my car all packed.<eos> - Good.<eos> And I was throwing the ball for Mojo for old time's sake in the backyard, but when it was time to go, she just sat there with that ratty old ball in her mouth, waiting for me to throw it again.
So I did... but when she went to get it, she tripped and fell.<eos> She's, uh, 13, and she's... starting to have some issues.<eos> I know.<eos> It didn't stop her, though.<eos> She wanted me to throw it again.
I would assume control of West Point while General Arnold would wait to surprise the reinforcements led by you, sir.<eos> When did the correspondence begin between yourself and General Arnold?<eos> The first inquiry was in September and done through Arnold's contacts on the black market.<eos> Smugglers, as they are, pledge true allegiance to coin.<eos> I don't know how much Arnold paid the fellow to drop a letter through my door, but it must have been enough that he didn't break the seal and read it.
Castle: Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon. It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No. And here it is.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> We'll take it in together.
It shows how the world is changing, how it's becoming much more dangerous and how much more people are suffering.<eos> And we are also seeing eruptions of xenophobia. When, for instance, someone says in Europe that Muslim refugees are not welcome, it gives a pretext for the propaganda that Daesh makes about the attitude of the Western World in relation to the Muslim world.<eos> This cannot go on.<eos> (panicked shouting) Now the flood of refugees coming out of Syria has been one of the largest humanitarian crises of our modern age.<eos> But the global response to it transformed overnight due to suspicions that a member of the ISIS attacks on Paris may have entered the country posing as a refugee, which has sparked a number of complex and contradictory reactions around the world.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.<eos> All you had to do was break a few bones. It was a small matter.<eos> Sir..<eos> Where's the bottle of water?<eos> Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.<eos> She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"<eos> Why are you roaming here in disguise?<eos> I thought to myself that something is wrong.<eos> I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'<eos> 'All the students had gone home. Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'<eos> 'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'<eos> 'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'<eos> '..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did you know that Norman had this letter?<eos> It's... it's meant for Emma.<eos> It's from her mom, and, uh, I found it here the other day.
You know what?<eos> Fine. But why did Norman have this letter?<eos> Oh, she tried to give it to me too.<eos> I wouldn't take it.<eos> I-I guess she gave it to Norman.
I know a great little jazz club just a couple blocks away.<eos> What do you say?<eos> I'm very proud of my husband's accomplishments and his contribution to science.<eos> He's definitely the spy.<eos> He's the one that took the photo of us and showed it to Bill.
No.<eos> I'll take a drink, though, if you're pouring.<eos> I noticed on Saturday that the back porch light was out.<eos> I thought I'd fix it.<eos> Fixed it myself.
They figured out how to get around the bedrock!<eos> Hey, sis!<eos> Starting again, isn't it?<eos> We need that gun!<eos> Wyatt Earp christened it Peacemaker.
- Wynonna, get the gun!<eos> - Wh-what?<eos> ! What gun?<eos> Where gun?<eos> Bossman said I'd never take it from you.
- This time, you're the law, and innocent people are depending on you.<eos> - Now, your gun.<eos> - What?<eos> They're not gonna let you in there with it.<eos> I'll get it back to you, Earp.
You did not bring a hair dryer?<eos> -I did. You brought a hair dryer on The Amazing Race?<eos> And a curling iron.<eos> Does your dad know that you brought a hair dryer?<eos> He's carrying it for me.
Ashley's got a satchel.<eos> Does not every bag have an emerald?<eos> That is not green.<eos> I'm looking for an emerald.<eos> Got it. Found it on my first try.
Once they've constructed a shady shack, they must call in the locals, who will drive in the tunes and help get the party started.<eos> Colombia's culinary delights are a wonderful mix of African, Spanish and Indigenous recipes.<eos> And this country's beach cook-ups are among the world's best.<eos> 'Parilla' requires teams to prepare some tasty barbacoa.<eos> After serving it up to the partygoers, they'll receive their next clue.
You'll be awake and able to play.<eos> No, for you.<eos> I mean, I don't know if you know what happens when... when women hear me play.<eos> Your hand is gonna get a little shaky.<eos> Well, I'll push through it.
And it still always works, you know.<eos> Omar, he farms.<eos> He brings his grain here to make flour.<eos> It's okay like that.<eos> People from the villages bring their grain, grind it here, and after they don't pay by money.
And if you look inside, you can see that there's bubbles everywhere.<eos> Air is mostly what you're eating when you eat bread.<eos> Bread is a fascinating combination of cooking and biology and physics.<eos> Biology is involved because bread is alive before you bake it.<eos> If you take a bunch of flour, uh, of almost any grain, and you mix it with some water and you let it sit out on the counter, in somewhere between a couple hours to a couple days, it'll be bubbling like crazy.
And you can see the little network of these gluten molecules, and it's almost like a fishnet.<eos> Gluten is basically two proteins.<eos> And when you moisten flour, these two proteins, they kind of mesh together.<eos> And when they do, they form a substance that's very stretchy, extensible, but it also will return like a balloon.<eos> The head chef at Modernist Cuisine took a ball of dough and washed it in water, stripping away the starches, and leaving nothing but pure gluten.
They're everywhere.<eos> From the air...<eos> They're just always there, omnipotent, omnipresent.<eos> Sourdough culture is this mixed ecosystem of bacteria and yeast that were used to ferment bread for millennia.<eos> You expose some wet flour to the air and stir it, and you will get a sourdough culture that transform the wheat into a very nutritious substance.
Here, eat it.<eos> All cooking is alchemy, right?<eos> I mean, it's transformation.<eos> But bread is the greatest alchemy of all.<eos> Take a small amount of food and turn it into a large amount of food that can feed a lot of people.
May I?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not gonna do it here, I promise.<eos> First, I'd swing by Home Depot.<eos> Pick up a nice, polyethylene plastic sheet, lay it out nice and neat so as not to make a mess.
Not a chance;<eos> Eugene wouldn't do that... he's a politician.<eos> Every word out of his mouth is calculated.<eos> You really think that he's running a sex trafficking ring?<eos> Or protecting it.
I still can't make sense of the dead cat in his trunk.<eos> Unless it was a pet he just couldn't say good-bye to.<eos> - Any luck with the computer?<eos> - No, it has a password.<eos> I'ma have Tech get into it.
What do you think?<eos> No, what do you think?<eos> I think you have more anger than you know what to do with.<eos> Hey, you didn't answer my question.<eos> I think there is a choice even when there appears to be none, but it's the reaction that determines whether the choice is good or bad, not the person who makes it.
We can't assume that those are safe.<eos> But I didn't do anything.<eos> Unfortunately, knowing Hank is enough.<eos> So lock the door behind me.<eos> Do not open it again unless it's me or Hank.
You'd be surprised.<eos> I believe the flood is coming, Rebecca.<eos> It will make all things new.<eos> We need an ark.<eos> I need you to design it.
- You can do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Put pressure on the thigh, and have your fingers find the artery.<eos> Dig your fingers in there!<eos> Okay, I think I found it!
Crashed out of the Marines.<eos> Drug dealer given a second chance.<eos> Pilcher chose everyone for a reason.<eos> Yours was "resourcefulness."<eos> Hmm. But instead of using that skill to ensure the preservation of our species, you used it to help yourself.
Kerouac is, for sure.<eos> - Who is Paul Robeson again?<eos> - Where is that scene?<eos> 'Cause it seems like it doesn't exist.<eos> Or, well, maybe I'm just not cool enough to find it.
Is something wrong, honey?<eos> No. I'm just thinking about the movie.<eos> About you and the movie.<eos> And what was it you loved so much?<eos> When you first saw it, I mean.
- No.<eos> - Are you sure you didn't mean...<eos> Yes.<eos> Gerald gave me some real intel.<eos> All I'm asking for is a small window of time to pursue it with the prisoner who gave it to me.
Do we look like we're selling candy to you, huh?<eos> I got some candy for you ass...<eos> My badge. Where's my badge?<eos> Did you lose it?<eos> I mean, maybe he lost it.
Except for I don't.<eos> I'm lying to you.<eos> I'm-I'm actually pretty lonely.<eos> This is The Sleeve Cleaver.<eos> It'll take any shirt and turn it into a tank top in less than a second.
It's tick for tack.<eos> She wanted to see the D. You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So I sent her a picture of my dick, and instead of sending it to her, I posted it on the Instagram.
I don't want to be left alone!<eos> I owe you a heap of thanks.<eos> And my life.<eos> Well, keep your life, Doc.<eos> I'd only mess it up.
I won't have Mary's conduct impugned by innuendo.<eos> What is it that the eavesdroppers have heard?<eos> - What's this accusation?<eos> - There has been an offer made.<eos> And who made it?
George Hancock suffers from severe psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions.<eos> He's on medical leave.<eos> If you exploit him for ratings, our lawyers will bury you.<eos> There are two versions of the story.<eos> And one, the Army took your technology and used it to massacre a million people.
Legendary.<eos> You Anderson guys really do live up to your reputation.<eos> We're gangsters.<eos> How's your leg, by the way?<eos> Better now that Joe ain't tugging on it.
He and Spencer Strasmore are tight.<eos> Okay, we got off track here, Jim.<eos> I'm just saying that Jerret sounds like a very compelling story on which you happen to have pole position.<eos> Completely accidental pun.<eos> Well, you want that story, put Mitch on it.
Like... the shed?<eos> I've never even thought of that.<eos> Honey, do you ever have a bad idea?<eos> (Footsteps approach) Eh?<eos> What do you think? I took your idea and ran with it.
Just go home and tell my wife that I'm gonna go on a road trip with my old girlfriend!<eos> So, uh, why aren't you guys having this yard sale at your place?<eos> Uh, "a," no yard, and, "b," in our neighborhood, 2 bucks for a chair is pretty steep.<eos> You know what?<eos> Wherever you do it, it's a good idea, you know, fresh start.

Now third person's trying to hack in.<eos> What's on that laptop?<eos> And how is this hacker involved?<eos> Well, now you can ask him.<eos> So, I traced the hacker's IP address, connected it to a physical address in Baton Rouge.
Otherwise known as a bug.<eos> So someone was spying on Zorn?<eos> Oh, and here's the kicker.<eos> All the information on the laptop was being transmitted to a server at the Houston Globe.<eos> I would love to tell you who was receiving it, but too many firewalls on their service.
God save her.<eos> And you are?<eos> Better you don't know.<eos> There's a mechanical clock in the corridor leading to the Great Hall.<eos> Hide the pistol inside and I'll retrieve it when the time is right.
- Go home!<eos> Hello?<eos> Fuck!<eos> I have never seen your stupid fucking show.<eos> Hope they cancel it!
She's right, you should do it.<eos> - What for?<eos> I mean, give me a reason to do that, why would I $3 million.<eos> - Then what? I mean, that's-<eos> You get that kind of money when you're young and you use something to build it with, right?
I don't know what you're talking...<eos> The vault, the pass code.<eos> Back off.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yeah, we changed it, actually, several times.
The vault, the pass code.<eos> Back off.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yeah, we changed it, actually, several times.<eos> You're coming with me, and you're going to open it up.
Uh, here he is.<eos> Ugh. Auditions girls from all over the country.<eos> Detective, I take it that you are checking to see if any of those young women are underage.<eos> Or if Bo was maybe "rehearsing" with them before their birthdays, but couldn't prove it.<eos> Any chance this Bo guy resented your investigation and took it out on Hudson?
There's a post geo-tagged in Salt Lake on Bo's Instagram account... two months old.<eos> Caption reads, "Scouting new talent in Utah.<eos> Can't wait to give Madeline the ultimate birthday present."<eos> Did Madeline post this photo, too?<eos> Did he send it to her?
Give me what I need.<eos> No murder charges, no consecutive sentences.<eos> We take the max on manslaughter and possession with intent to distribute, all served concurrently... nothing else.<eos> That depends on what her hypothetical statement sounds like.<eos> I-I never gave meth to anybody that didn't want it.
The Asians' merch is now part of our inventory.<eos> I said keep Chu out of our territory, period.<eos> Do you even think before you do things?<eos> When you mentioned it, I assumed...<eos> I never said steal it!
What, the coke shipment that... That I told you about.<eos> Our mutual friend's got it, right?<eos> Couldn't say.<eos> I'm thinking he does, and he's too smart to put it on the street right now.<eos> But nobody keeps cocaine as a hobby, and when he sells it, there's gonna be a lot of cash.
This first one is the brochure.<eos> This second one is the crime scene.<eos> Oh, i see.<eos> In the brochure, the utensils are all facing the same way, But in this still from buzz's video, The grill press is turned around.<eos> It was, so i examined it very closely And found trace amounts of a very expensive Cleansing solution not typically used on grilling utensils.
Uh, well, of course I didn't intend to kill her, But before i say anything else, why do you already think that?<eos> Uh, oh! Well, because you didn't bring a weapon with you.<eos> You were arguing in the backyard.<eos> She turned away from you, and in the heat of the moment, You grabbed the grill press and -- and swung it at her.<eos> Then afterwards, you, uh, You cleaned it off with disinfectant
What if that guy comes back because i talked to you?<eos> Hey, the longer we're here, The longer you look like you're cooperating.<eos> You want us gone?<eos> Tell us what the gun looked like.<eos> I didn't see no gun until he fired it.
Amy, uh, amy, have you got the bullets Out of the victim yet?<eos> To see if we have a match,<eos> I'm gonna have to fire this sucker And then get the gun's serial number So you can find its registered owner.<eos> And that's all we can do?<eos> Well, if i pop it into the sterile saline fast enough, I might could pull a few sebaceous fingerprints, But i doubt it.
Mm. Do you always dress this way for work?<eos> What way?<eos> This is a formal investigation.<eos> Itlookslike my gun.<eos> I usually keep it in the nightstand.
In the past nine hours, yes.<eos> Well, mr. Ogden,<eos> Apparently there's nothing we can tell you That you don't already know.<eos> Apart from what happened to the guy with the gun.<eos> Uh, it turned out he sold it to someone else, Who we are still trying to identify.
Cash spends easier, and you can use it anywhere.<eos> Like at the airport to buy a round-trip Business-class ticket to los angeles.<eos> There's nothing illegal about that.<eos> He's right. It's not against the law to carry cash, no matter how much.<eos> Listen, i admit to buying the gun, But that doesn't matter Because i sold it a couple of days ago.
Um, so, did he ever suggest that he had enemies at work?<eos> Well, sure. [Chuckles]<eos> And, uh, he resented the hell out of his old company, too.<eos> The doctor who botched his knee surgery and refused to fix it.<eos> Oh, and he hated our lawyer, the bank that foreclosed on our house, the people who bought it for half what we paid for it.
Munro is too well protected.<eos> Even if the Scottish army could break through his defenses, he'd just melt into the forest.<eos> Disappear.<eos> We may never get another chance like this again.<eos> Munro already took my sword, and even if I had it, I can't get close enough to Munro to kill him.
Come on,Buzz.<eos> You're lying, Mr. Hetch.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Your fingerprints match up exactly to a partial that was on the bank card one of the victims dropped during the assault. You picked the card up.<eos> You put it in the ATM. Who cares about a fingerprint?
Make your point, if you have one.<eos> I do.<eos> Dr. Bowman, am I correct in stating that on July 16th of last year, you predicted that I would be at one of 12 addresses in Pasadena using this gun to execute a married couple who was intent on diluting the purity of the white race?<eos> We narrowed down the date and some potential targets in such a way to affect your arrest if that's...<eos> So, I stand here today on trial for my life, partly because you took my individual nature and reduced it to a pattern?

Do you want me to take on wildred Darnell for you?<eos> You'd really rather do it yourself?<eos> Father, I'm in a strange place.<eos> I don't want to be the kind of person who takes human life without feeling.<eos> And if this job has done that to me, and if I really am confessing, knowing that I'm supposed to seek absolution, but not really thinking I need it...

♪ ♪<eos> The white, cloudy, substance you're seeing is the cataract, which is a cloudy lens, so I'm just very gently teasing the lens until it's free, and now we're going to remove it from the eye.<eos> Ooh, that's it?<eos> That is the cataract, and it is gone.<eos> That's incredible that you can just get rid of it in a matter of seconds.
Yeah, there's another one, right.<eos> Do you feel like it could be useful?<eos> Is it like, the greatest thing in the world, to have, you know, this limited vision?<eos> I can't say yet, but I think it's better than not having it at all.<eos> Although the Argus II shows promise for patients like Anthony who once had vision and lost it, some experts are warning that for all the advances we've made in fighting blindness, we haven't actually stopped to consider what it means to restore sight to someone who's never had it at all.
And people say, "Well, shut your eyes and do things blind," but it's-- you can't do that. It's a big difference.<eos> When I was blind, I didn't see black. And now, when I shut my eyes, I see black.<eos> It's not the same as being blind.<eos> Would you advise someone who was in the same situation as you to have that surgery?<eos> Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it.
Look, I know that I'm just here for support, but why would Jackson do that?<eos> Because it's exactly what I would advise her to do.<eos> Whether you meant it or not, April, this restraining order started an arms race.<eos> The restraining order was a mistake.<eos> Can't we just take it back?
- No, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, that's not the problem.<eos> You guys have a pretty significant earnings disparity.<eos> Well, I... I don't know if I'd call it "significant."
This isn't like any dungeon I've ever seen.<eos> These bars are enchanted.<eos> Magic won't get us out of here.<eos> What about the wand?<eos> Do you still have it?
I-I-I was a doctor, b-before the Warden took control and ruined everything.<eos> He... he made me a prisoner. Look, we need magic so I can fix this wand.<eos> I-I know exactly where to go.<eos> The hospital lab, but... I can't take anything without the Warden knowing that it's missing.<eos> You'll have to give the pieces to me so I can fix it there.
The crystal.<eos> Gold must have done something to it.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> He's not gonna give that magic back to anyone.<eos> He's gonna keep it all for himself.
The Groundsman promised to fix the wand and bring it back to us.<eos> Unfortunately, I was only able to keep half my promise.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where's the wand?<eos> I repaired it, but then the Warden took it from me.
He attacked me!<eos> That is bullshit!<eos> I tried to tell you that's the guy.<eos> I don't care what you tried to do.<eos> You wanted an emergency, now you got it.
That's exactly why I did not want to tell you.<eos> Look, these guards are corrupt.<eos> You go to the warden, it gets back to Gallo, he's gonna come after me twice as hard.<eos> It's one week instead of two years.<eos> Look, we got a chance to get him outta here, I'm gonna take it.
Goddamn!<eos> The surge.<eos> The what?<eos> Ok.<eos> Two years Before wynonna came to town We all felt it.
No.<eos> I'll get nicole to drive her home.<eos> How many times do i have to tell you? That stuff is poison.<eos> I've been dressing her wound for the past two days.<eos> And i've been re-dressing it.
what's the lead?<eos> That's just it.<eos> He's been obsessed with her i'm...<eos> Willa was right.<eos> He had the lead and then he lost it to constance.
- What do you mean, you got her?<eos> - I found her and I chloroformed her and I tied her up.<eos> All by myself!<eos> Can you come and get her? - Yes.<eos> - And bring your head so I can chop it off to get the antidote for me and my dad.
Get behind that bed.<eos> Hey.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Little snitch Waverly took it.
No way. We'll box that up.<eos> - We already got the tab.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Bad news about the minivan, babe.<eos> Started making this little click, click, click noise, so I had to bring it into the shop.
Helping Natalie with the baptism. Uh-huh. She wants you to do that?<eos> Course. Why wouldn't she?<eos> What?<eos> You want my opinion?<eos> Sounds like I'm going to get it.
That shit's for gummers.<eos> Come on, I'm 40.<eos> 41 and your hip thinks you're 80.<eos> Okay, my ball and socket are just fine, okay?<eos> Maybe I banged it up a little bit, but I've been walking on this thing for years.
Everybody, down!<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you get the zip gun?<eos> I printed it at home.
- Mm-hmm. - Interesting.<eos> I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.<eos> Why do you have a storage unit?<eos> (SIGHS) Just wait.<eos> How long have you had it?
I'll tell you what Gwen said about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey. Where are we on the waste-management company?<eos> It's a new entity called Bullseye.<eos> We're not sure who's running it, but rumor is it's a new player on the scene.
Alright, baby. No big deal.<eos> Let's shake it off. We can get it.<eos> She's going faster than I can pull.<eos> She never quits.<eos> Back on a second time to get the clue and I was very, very careful about where I put it this time.

Now we're headed to Planpraz Gondola, so another gondola station.<eos> I'm guessing we're going to be going back up for some more funky stuff in the cold.<eos> We're only doing freaky stuff today. Whoo!<eos> Oh, there it is. I see the clue.<eos> See it? -Yeah.
I got a visit yesterday<eos> - from Frankie Vargas's brother.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> He offered me dirt on Susan Ross if I gave him dirt on Edison.<eos> I didn't think I needed it, so I sent him packing.
Actually, booth, i'm-i'm not sure we need dna<eos> To prove that he did this.<eos> And why exactly is that?<eos> Because as you strangled her, she took this dagger<eos> And swung it backward, Hitting you...
The Devil freed you?<eos> In all of recorded history, such a thing has never happened.<eos> Given your history of saying and doing anything and everything to get your way, I don't think I believe you.<eos> Believe me or not, the Devil is here, Cotton Mather.<eos> And whether he merely walks this earth or rules it, may be up to the two of us.
Here.<eos> Drink it, all of it this time.<eos> And you, too, shall be free of my hold forever.<eos> But I've given you your freedom.<eos> I do not want it.
A surgeon's no use.<eos> Only blood can save me now.<eos> I haven't the heart to take their blood.<eos> No, Mistress, no need to take it.<eos> We give it to you freely.
- And miss this?<eos> I'm still a member of this distinguished club, Mellie.<eos> Just a non-voting one.<eos> You know, there is one way out of this.<eos> Nobody's mentioned it yet, but I'm sure we're all thinking it.
Oh, Mathilda.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Mathilda.<eos> He Would not open it and set about the suspect, Mr. Buckley.<eos> Mr. Reid took Mr. Buckley's head between his hands and well, I cannot think of a better word for it, popped it against the wooden pillar.
She's got cash, and if we string her along, We can pay for the vo and go to the timber sports games.<eos> Yeah, these are things that i know, because i'm in charge.<eos> No, no, no, you're an idiot, and i'm in charge.<eos> Of what, cranking down?<eos> 'cause that lotion is not where i left it last.
That's not true!<eos> What's the Ivory Tower?<eos> A safe house for fundamentalist groups.<eos> Garcia, we got a location.<eos> I need you to give it to all available SWAT resources.
You better Kim Chi that walk, girl. - Yes.<eos> - But my fear for Kim Chi is that she is a look.<eos> Because she's had such success with who she is visually, shehasn'thad todeliveraperformance.<eos> She just had to be really cute and kind of nerdy and anime-y, but I think there's a personality in there.<eos> I just want her to unleash it and let us have it.
That's what they said about Ted Bundy.<eos> We got the results of Ruby's ultrasound back.<eos> She is seven weeks pregnant, which means it's Stommer's.<eos> I called the owners of the house on Bristol.<eos> They told Stommer to put it on the market six months ago
We got the results of Ruby's ultrasound back.<eos> She is seven weeks pregnant, which means it's Stommer's.<eos> I called the owners of the house on Bristol.<eos> They told Stommer to put it on the market six months ago<eos> He didn't list it on MLS till last week, which means he's been sitting on the house. Yeah, to hide Ruby.
I don't know what you see in her.<eos> I look at her and all I think about is... sexually transmitted disease.<eos> They say we came here on a convict ship.<eos> Prove it.<eos> If there's one scrap of evidence, let them produce it.
- Is it done?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> All right, Fabien?<eos> You know, there is going to be a war.<eos> You just don't see it yet.
The song you were humming...<eos> My mom used to sing that to me as a lullaby.<eos> "Little Sparrow."<eos> Your mom and I used to fall asleep to that song.<eos> Your grandmother used to sing it to us.
I visited Jenna in a blind school in Philadelphia but not this place.<eos> The school operated here until 2009 and then it was relocated to Bridge County.<eos> So Jenna could have come here when she first lost her eyesight.<eos> I didn't lose my sight.<eos> 'You took it from me! '
They modeled the guy who ran Cobra Kai after my sensei.<eos> Why?<eos> I've been trying to find a medical explanation as to why you think you're dead, and I discovered Cotard's delusion.<eos> Named after a French neurologist, Jules Cotard.<eos> Basically, people who have it think they're dead, or in some cases that they don't even exist at all.
Wait, so I'm not actually dead?<eos> I'm alive?<eos> Thank God, I'm still alive.<eos> But wait, how do you explain how cold I am?<eos> People psychosomatically manifest symptoms of a disease if they truly believe they have it.
We have about three minutes until that heart tissue dies.<eos> Brock, come on.<eos> Well, there was this song my au pair sang to me when I was a kid.<eos> She sang it to me when she put me to bed, and it always calmed me down and helped me sleep. Okay, what's the song?<eos> The Chanels and I will sing it to you.
Nice choice.<eos> And what's your excuse?<eos> I just like drinking at lunch.<eos> So, the official SwapMeet offer is happening today?<eos> Yes, John Bosworth is taking it over later this afternoon.
I'd think you'd be happier.<eos> I am happy, very.<eos> I'm just a little surprised by how completely off-book you went.<eos> I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it.
Pack up your stuff.<eos> Starting tomorrow, we'll be working out of my place.<eos> What'd you do that for?<eos> If you can find someone willing to pay north of $350, you should go for it.<eos> When you see an opportunity, you take it.
Very embarrassing.<eos> I know that Sara told her father she was leaving to protect history.<eos> Why?<eos> Why does history need protecting?<eos> Because the idiots who were protecting it...
"Hey, you're a regular Einstein."<eos> They'll say, "You're like one of the Einsteins."<eos> That's so crazy.<eos> I can't believe we just changed history.<eos> No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.
You get word a body's dropped, you check it out, and maybe you even kill the thing that did it.<eos> But that person is still dead, and maybe a few more.<eos> But my people?<eos> We plan ahead.<eos> We study lore, and we use it against our enemies.
Hey, guys.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> It's me.<eos> I-I understand you wanted a picture, but I have to ask you to treasure it privately and not tweet it out.
You think you can win against this thing?<eos> You can't.<eos> My life is over.<eos> My life has been over for a century and a half, Stefan.<eos> Since you took it from me.
Caroline, I want you to be happy.<eos> Okay, I want our girls to be happy.<eos> And one of these days, I plan on being happy, too.<eos> Look... we can't escape this life, Care.<eos> So shouldn't we make sure we're at least living it right?
More importantly, this book is one of the greatest love stories of all time.<eos> You're an incurable romantic, aren't you?<eos> When it comes to you, love, I would never stop fighting.<eos> I would brave the oceans and sail past the Sirens to find my way back to you.<eos> "Meanwhile, I took a large round of wax, cut it up small with my sharp sword, I took all my men in turn and plugged their ears with it."
My friend here and I have a particularly innate sense of smell, not to mention an immense appreciation for blood, and we just couldn't help but notice that the red that you use, very liberally, I might add...<eos> Maybe a bit too on the nose...<eos> Has a very familiar scent.<eos> Care to explain to my friend and I why you are indeed painting with human blood?<eos> And more importantly, what the hell did you do to the person you got it from?
Where am I?<eos> Buenas noches.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you know who I am? El Oso.<eos> Listen, you get me a lead on Zamacona, and we will run it. Yeah.
- Watch what?<eos> - We don't say that word in here.<eos> - That's where you draw the line?<eos> - Yeah, don't say that word in here.<eos> - You don't say it?
I'll help you if I can.<eos> I want to be the judge's next victim.<eos> - A sting?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I'll arrange a drop, stake it out, and catch the jerk red-handed.

Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.<eos> I don't have a mythology, I have the unerring word of God.<eos> - But that's very interesting.<eos> I didn't mean to disparage your faith.<eos> Actually, I admire it.

Yu Xiaohui!<eos> You always make this fridge smell like Chinese medicine.<eos> How are we supposed to use it?<eos> It won't be smelly.<eos> I always cover it with layers of plastic film before I put it in.
Okay... hum...<eos> Give me the letter back.<eos> We knew Yu Xiaohui had a crush on you,<eos> However, we knew nothing about the letter.<eos> Yu Xiaohui gave me that letter and asked me to pass it to Liu Bo.
Everybody laughed about it.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Where's the letter now then?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Do you have it?
Oh, come on.<eos> Well, roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs.<eos> I've been avoiding these things all my life.<eos> And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.<eos> The difference is, she's bringing life into the world, and you sucked it out.
Yesterday, I opened the security box for the first time... since the tragic death of poor Nicotra...<eos> - and I realized that the weapon was not.<eos> - Who would take it?<eos> - Commissioner.<eos> I'm sorry to have to say it, but I think that Nicotra himself took it.
I took the opportunity to catch my motorcycle and leave quickly.<eos> Following the same path as Nicotra, but I never reached it.<eos> No, I did not even see it.<eos> And... what did you do with the gun?<eos> I found it in my pocket when I got home.
- And who speaks of that!<eos> - Commissioner, are you kidding?<eos> - No. Do you have in your head to go to jail?<eos> To listen to Rosales we need the authorization of a judge!<eos> - If we do not have it, it is because we have not given, finished!
- Tell me where you been. What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?<eos> When'd you start wearing lipstick?<eos> Where you been?<eos> Tell me where you been and don't lie.<eos> Don't tell me you been at Tina's, 'cause your mother already colluded on that lie and I'm not buying it.
- I mean, just so I can call you when we figure out what we're doing, 'cause Iâm not sure what we're doing.<eos> - Okay, Iâm gonna give you a phone number.<eos> I don't really have a phone, but I know this guy--<eos> It's a long story.<eos> It's this guy I dated for a long time, he was actually an alcoholic and gay and he came to my house and he drank all the sangria and then I had this watermelon and he picked it up and he threw it on the floor
Iced macchiato.<eos> Hi.<eos> The register won't open.<eos> Shit.<eos> Did you, unplug and re-plug it?
I know we won't.<eos> The house is just right up the path here.<eos> What am I saying?<eos> You know where it is;<eos> you stormed it earlier.
She should know.<eos> So, what's the point of your visit this time?<eos> Did you consider my proposition?<eos> To let me take district three?<eos> I didn't take it seriously.
I was hoping that would happen.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that.<eos> No, it's been like this since I broke it playing football in high school.
- (knock on door) - I hope it's Brandon.<eos> He has a key.<eos> Hey, look, look, look,<eos> I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?
Okay.<eos> So, how does Grandma know that I'm loaning Cort money for her divorce?<eos> 'Cause I told her.<eos> And how do you know?<eos> When I was at the apartment, yesterday, your checkbook was sitting on the table, so I looked at it.
(stutters) I mean, no.<eos> No, I'm not high right now, but yeah, I... I have a medical marijuana card.<eos> - How?<eos> You're fifteen.<eos> - My mom got it for me.
Yeah, so...<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I don't think I'm really ready to smoke pot.<eos> Uh, uh, okay. Um...<eos> The thing is we're not smoking it.
The blues were born right here in the Mississippi delta.<eos> John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, BB King, Jessie Mae Hemphill,<eos> I can't see 'em anymore, but their spirit lives on, right here.<eos> I can lose myself in music.<eos> Hear it?
That's what I used to do as a child.<eos> Lay out my mother's clothes on her bed, in her shape, imagine she was there.<eos> It aroused me.<eos> When I was a wee bit older, 12, 13, whenever I could, I would obtain female underwear.<eos> I'd use it to masturbate.
"In olden times, when wishing still did some good there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful.<eos> But the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, who indeed has seen so much, marvelled every time it shone upon her face.<eos> In the vicinity of the King's castle there was a large, dark forest and in this forest, beneath an old linden tree, there was a well.<eos> In the heat of the day, the Princess would go out into the forest and sit on the edge of the cool well.<eos> To pass the time she would take a golden ball, throw it into the air and then catch it.
Dance.<eos> Dance!<eos> He wants to dance?<eos> The mind is like a brain-shaped piñata, Deathstroke.<eos> As we beat it to shreds, the hard candies of random memory spills on the lawn of destiny.
It splits the body into pieces, but life remains.<eos> - That's horrible.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why it's called the forbidden move.<eos> Then why show me it at all?
- You really are the Boy Wonder.<eos> I wouldn't have had to save you if you had listened to me in the first place.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> And when Batman gets back, he's going to give me "the look."<eos> Because he loaned me a perfectly good city and I broke it.
Now, oh, yes.<eos> In most good debt payer's eyes, I would say you are seen as an irresponsible thief, and we are just collecting what is owed to us.<eos> Now I'm going to ask you one more time.<eos> Do you have the amount due?<eos> I don't have it.
I've had one for a long time.<eos> - You have a gun. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why?<eos> Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?
I wanna know where it is.<eos> It's in a box under the bed.<eos> It's under our bed?<eos> !<eos> That's where we'd need it.
Jo, he's still alive.<eos> Barely.<eos> You know, back then, I... I didn't value my life all that much, but it's different now.<eos> I've outgrown this.<eos> I don't need it anymore.
Barely.<eos> You know, back then, I... I didn't value my life all that much, but it's different now.<eos> I've outgrown this.<eos> I don't need it anymore.<eos> I don't want it.
Why the hell would you make me run?<eos> I didn't make you run.<eos> You wanted to run.<eos> You dangled the carrot.<eos> You dangled it because you didn't want this wedding to happen, so you dangled.
Never knew how appropriate the name was until now, did you?<eos> Anyway, they became Mum and Dad.<eos> They had a whole litter of kids, including yours truly.<eos> And they built a house.<eos> They called it Heaven.
No one's stopping you.<eos> There was blood all over you.<eos> - You should be dead.<eos> - Well, par for the course for our adventures, Detective. What's new?<eos> I have a sample of your blood and I'm gonna take it and test it.
So, you know there's a lot of ways it can play out.<eos> There seems to be one obvious one.<eos> Not really... because someone who goes to the trouble to stage a big show like the one that we just saw, doesn't make the mistake of leaving a gun in his locker, right?<eos> - It's my dad's gun. - Yeah.<eos> I carry it to protect myself and my friends.
Hey, where's Touie?<eos> Oh, he said he, uh, went to go play basketball.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, did you see the picture that she sent?<eos> She sent it to you, too, right?
I might steal your motorcycle and take it with me.<eos> Go for it.<eos> - I think it likes you.<eos> - Can I take it?<eos> Yeah, as long as you get it back, I don't care.
- Have fun and take chances.<eos> - I will.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> As soon as I was on the bike, I felt buckled down to the road.<eos> That kind of connection is super rare, and I was honored that Roland let me borrow it for the rest of the ride.

Just stay here.<eos> I want you here.<eos> I need you here.<eos> It's not like you can go back to that shitty relationship.<eos> I faked it for an entire year.
Hi, Rafe.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Johnson.<eos> - Why don't you come on in?<eos> - Oh, awesome.<eos> So I bring it over to her place and Melanie's there.
Elliott was kind enough to let me borrow you.<eos> Stand here.<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> Stand here.<eos> When I give you an instruction, you follow it the first time I ask.
Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Those guys hurt my back.<eos> There's a bag up there. Can you reach it?
Is that a bloody kite?<eos> I smell coyote babies.<eos> The other house was just too expensive.<eos> Yeah, this place is actually perfect.<eos> Or at least it will be, once we redo it.
What do you say, uh, you and me just take the car and go out to the lake like we used to?<eos> I can't.<eos> There's a Hitler Youth meeting this afternoon.<eos> So you'll miss it.<eos> Miss it?

You're running Thomas Shaw.<eos> And in order to keep that a secret, you've been trying to kill Daniel Miller.<eos> Who the fuck does that?<eos> Now you give me Shaw, and we'll straighten this mess out.<eos> You, on the other hand, are trying to frame Steven Frost for the Iosava rendition, when we both know he didn't order it.
Your hands are full of germs. Didn't mommy tell you?<eos> Don't rub your eyes.<eos> What happen if the germs go into your eyes?<eos> Don't play with this doll now.<eos> You play after I wash it clean for you.
Obviously, he had to be moved, right?<eos> But he was too drunk and wouldn't listen to me...<eos> That rattled me... pissed me off!<eos> I found a rock next to him...<eos> I picked it up and smashed his fucking head.
What happened at the rehearsal?<eos> Um, everything's fine, but Mrs. Golishevsky fired us as godparents.<eos> She really did not like Caroline.<eos> I am not the one she put a thousand year curse on.<eos> I got it down to 500.
Aw, yeah, that would be great, Mrs. Golishevsky, 'cause I shattered the last one.<eos> Call me mama.<eos> Aww, okay, mama.<eos> No, that doesn't work.<eos> So I'm just gonna put the holy water back where I got it, and it'll be like I never stole it at all.
Aww, okay, mama.<eos> No, that doesn't work.<eos> So I'm just gonna put the holy water back where I got it, and it'll be like I never stole it at all.<eos> I can't risk the wrath of God.<eos> Or have I already suffered it?

Alice told me that her brother preys on anger and regret.<eos> I really don't want that to be all that's left of us.<eos> You mean all that's left of me.<eos> Barnes asked me to put you on a 48-hour suicide watch.<eos> I've already signed off on it.
It's a long way to the basement.<eos> So...<eos> The little minx was a no-show.<eos> Well, it seems a frightful shame to let this beautiful meal go to waste.<eos> What say we wrap it up and have it for lunch tomorrow?
The badge holds expectations.<eos> People want a hero.<eos> You know what makes a hero, son?<eos> A man who values protecting others above protecting himself.<eos> A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail. A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.
- That's cool.<eos> - Honestly, Cap...<eos> Look, I know I've been away...<eos> Maybe that's why you've forgotten how things go around here.<eos> I give you an order and you follow it.
Let me go.<eos> If the cops want to hunt me, fine.<eos> But you... let me go.<eos> I won't do that.<eos> You would condemn this city when I would save it.
You mean the key, don't you?<eos> You're not getting it back until I talk to the people you work for.<eos> Maybe we just kill you and take it?<eos> You think we're stupid enough to bring it with us?<eos> You really want it back?
What, like, some kind of... weapon?<eos> Well, honestly, we don't know.<eos> We captured a member, but even he didn't know what's inside the safe, only that the Court fears it falling<eos> - into the hands of their enemies.<eos> - Wait, wouldn't they know you stole it?
Tell them we are joining forces with the boy. I will brief them tomorrow night myself.<eos> Volk!<eos> Dmitry, eyes.<eos> We know you've been searching for the second key.<eos> Have you found it?
Or do I?<eos> You gonna arrest me, Jim?<eos> Do you want to look even more like the paranoid ex-lover?<eos> I'll only pass the test again.<eos> We'll find out how you beat it.
Or someone?<eos> You think this is about Alchemy?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> I think he found it back on that archeological dig.
One night, I was there alone, and she came back to me.<eos> She stood right in front of me, clear as day... a ghost or a vision, I don't know, but... she was real.<eos> What happened?<eos> She told me about the stone.<eos> She told me where to find it, she told me that if I got it, then it would bring us back together again.
That's what I did.<eos> I mounted an expedition to India.<eos> Days we searched, weeks.<eos> Nothing.<eos> And then we found it.
Jay's right, the stone has been the key to everything.<eos> So we destroy the stone and Savitar is gone for good.<eos> It's impossible to destroy.<eos> It's been around forever, there's a reason for that.<eos> Why don't we just bury it again, put it back in the ground where you found it?
It's impossible to destroy.<eos> It's been around forever, there's a reason for that.<eos> Why don't we just bury it again, put it back in the ground where you found it?<eos> "Jumanji."<eos> Someone would just find it and we'd be right back where we started.
- What?<eos> - Trixie's best friend Landa got a new All-American doll, and now Trixie wants one.<eos> So what does she do?<eos> She destroys her old doll,<eos> - expecting me to replace it.
See?<eos> He's innocent.<eos> Tina, I can tell your dad loves you very much, but... this video doesn't prove anything.<eos> His lawyers had this tape for 16 years.<eos> He made them promise to give it to me when he died.
Pop-Tarts.<eos> Mr. Glory has a second home in Ventura.<eos> If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Okay, we'll check it out, but...<eos> Luci, if he's the one with the blade, he's much more likely to go on a killing spree than to stash it.
Laws of the universe and all that, so...<eos> I didn't ask to come back here.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> And you hate it.<eos> The look in your eyes, I've seen it before.
- You kept it very quiet.<eos> - This isn't what I wanted.<eos> We'll do a real proposal later, with a ring and a photographer.<eos> - To the wedding of the year!<eos> - Exactly. And we'll celebrate it at the spa, now that the subsidy is all settled.
You just said he planted the same kind of device.<eos> And with very good reason.<eos> One I'm not inclined to disclose at the moment.<eos> Have it your way.<eos> If I had a white flag, I would wave it.
I'm looking for your father.<eos> I haven't been able to track him down anywhere.<eos> He's travelling today.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I got this letter by courier, just a little while ago, and the man who delivered it to me said that he stood by and watched your father write it.
The sooner we find out what's going on, the sooner we can lay Dad to rest.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Where's the box?<eos> Wasn't it right there?<eos> You said you wouldn't move it.

Since the hostage crisis in 1979, our relationship with Iran has been America's most intractable foreign policy problem.<eos> But last year, Iran and the major world powers signed a landmark agreement that eased years of economic sanctions in exchange for Iran's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program.<eos> Under the nuclear deal that we, our allies and partners, reached with Iran, it can begin to receive relief from certain nuclear sanctions and gain access to its own money that had been frozen.<eos> Now this deal has been intensely controversial here at home, with 47 senators signing a letter saying they had the right to rescind the agreement.<eos> I signed that letter. I stand by it. Smith:
So basically what's happening now is, as you can see, there's farmers, there's villagers, there's a village right over there.<eos> So Davondan is spreading his team out, deploying them, to warn off people that there's about to be an explosion.<eos> (technicians speak on radio)<eos> Larsen: This container has the blasting caps in them.<eos> Once he takes that blasting cap and he puts it right into the top of this explosive, it's placed down in the hole and explodes that bomb, hopefully in a safe manner.

He saw I was in a state and asked why?<eos> I explained.<eos> And he gave me a bottle wrapped in brown paper.<eos> He said it would do the trick.<eos> Beryl found it in my pocket, while she was looking for a cigarette.
Do we just go in there and interrogate her?<eos> It depends what kind of condition she's in.<eos> The killer planted that tape for me.<eos> There's clearly some connection with Ms. Lang.<eos> Either she gave him that tape, or he took it.
The killer put it there.<eos> That's how he knew about the recording.<eos> He hasn't been watching us.<eos> He's been listening!<eos> He knew I would take it.
He must have bent over backwards to get something like that.<eos> I feel very lucky.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio and then I tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you.
Well, I'll call it more of a hesitation.<eos> I'm reading this comic book... I think the young people call it, uh, a graphic novel.<eos> It's called, uh,<eos> Zombie Pandemic.<eos> Uh, a constituent gave it to me.

We'll have to destroy everything they left.<eos> No one will eat it.<eos> We can replace that, okay?<eos> They destroyed the cooler.<eos> Broke it and took the parts.
She smashed her head...<eos> onto the desk, hard.<eos> Then she... she pushed me over.<eos> That must've been when the bottle smashed.<eos> Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.

- It was?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom, why do you even set it?
- Just one.<eos> - Well, I'll have you know, I've been weeding out.<eos> I got rid of several papers yesterday, and I've got a bag in the garage ready to donate.<eos> Do you want to see the shoes I got today?<eos> If you have a bag ready to donate, can you give it to me, so I can get rid of it for you today?

Why...?<eos> - The tree, the rooster...<eos> I did that.<eos> The baseball, too.<eos> I hired some kids to throw it through the window during your séance.

He didn't tell you?<eos> That's interesting. The Russians are claiming there's a missing piece of evidence floating around.<eos> Evidence of what?<eos> Well, I don't exactly know, but it's making them very nervous.<eos> Meachum wanted to know if Dimitri had it.

You're on.<eos> I run the homeless shelter.<eos> Maybe you saw me on the news.<eos> Anyway, the washing machine is a hindrance to the safety of my community.<eos> It was nice of some good Samaritan to donate it, but it's not safe in a house with young kids and very little sober supervision.

You're starting to sound exactly like me.<eos> Holy shit, Dirk, I get it.<eos> I get everything.<eos> Listen, before we go into the hotel, now is the time for us to take a moment, and think, really think about how we're going to do this.<eos> We have a unique opportunity here, and we need to be careful how we use it.

Your future self, hired me... to investigate this whole... "you dying" incident.<eos> Well, me and him, we're future us.<eos> We found your time machine, about a week from now, and used it to come back here.<eos> Impossible.<eos> When I took the machine out of Springsborough, I buried it...
Well, me and him, we're future us.<eos> We found your time machine, about a week from now, and used it to come back here.<eos> Impossible.<eos> When I took the machine out of Springsborough, I buried it...<eos> We dug it up.
But you didn't.<eos> You deliberately hid things from me.<eos> - You lied to me!<eos> - I didn't lie.<eos> I-I just... didn't tell you the whole truth because I didn't understand it, and...
So, 100 years ago...<eos> All right, I'm gonna need you to shut up with that shit right now.<eos> I thought you said you wanted answers.<eos> I want reality!<eos> I want my reality back, and I want it back right Goddamn no...
You were supposed to protect him.<eos> That's not the first time that's happened, is it?<eos> I was supposed to bring you there, too, so...<eos> And you did the thing.<eos> And now that you did it, maybe you're gonna leave and...
Farah, help me. Patrick Spring.<eos> Crazy to see it up close, right?<eos> So much money, and then...<eos> Where's the head?<eos> We're keeping it separate.
That's what we do.<eos> You're investigating me?<eos> We told you before, Todd, you're what we like to call "a person of interest."<eos> Who's getting more and more interesting all the time.<eos> Your parents told us you have this medical condition, runs in the family, your sister now has it, too.
I didn't even know about this place.<eos> So... the unlimited energy device, that's the machine those guys are after?<eos> The bad guys, right?<eos> The bad...<eos> Yes, but no one ever found it.
There appears to be some kind of body-swappy thing going on with the bad men.<eos> Gordon Rimmer, it would appear, used to be Lux DuJour.<eos> I don't want the things that Lux wanted anymore.<eos> Where's the head?<eos> We're keeping it separate.
All part of the job.<eos> No, it absolutely wasn't.<eos> Unless you're talking about your job at my detective agency.<eos> The machine!<eos> I left it in the car!
Don't worry.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I have a theory.<eos> I have a theory, and I don't like it at all, but it's... it's my theory right now, and right now that's all I got.<eos> So, uh... I'm gonna explain it to you, and... if you understand it,
That dog... is the most important thing here.<eos> Because it's Lydia Spring.<eos> Yes.<eos> How did they turn her into a dog?<eos> Oh, they-they didn't, they took the soul out of her body and swapped it with a dog.
You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.<eos> This "machine," where is it?<eos> Here, right here.<eos> We put it together ourselves, so some bits might be on backwards, but...
I have the other machine!<eos> So that means you follow me now.<eos> So you are gonna go off and collect whoever you can, whoever hasn't run away.<eos> My men are bringing in the relevant parties.<eos> I will have the machine tonight, and I will have it at the temple, and you will meet me there.
Well, uh...<eos> Red did.<eos> I see.<eos> Senator Wheatus.<eos> And did he get it from a valet or...?
So, I'm like, trying to, like, you know, "Oh, I'm gonna make the soup.<eos> Okay, this is what they want.<eos> I'm gonna make that, taste it.<eos> I'm gonna add that flavor."<eos> And then the chef tastes it, "Oh, this is good."
And we... The first stop was in Cuquila.<eos> So it's a coffee farm. There's this guy named Roberto. He was making a sauce.<eos> And I was starving because it was a long trip.<eos> Directly, I went to the kitchen to grab something to eat and I saw Roberto.<eos> He was making the sauce and I ate it.
And when you start failing, people start panicking.<eos> At some point, I thought maybe I should close Pujol.<eos> It's the worst feeling on Earth.<eos> Just one day, out of nothing, I walked into the kitchen, and every time they had... They had music on when I was not there.<eos> And I walked in and they turned it off.
That sauce evolves and it's this living thing.<eos> When I was in, uh, Mexico City, I think it had been going for 453 days.<eos> He said there's probably a hundred ingredients in there.<eos> It's a very, very complex sauce, much more complex than any classical French sauce you could name.<eos> And he serves it on a plate in a perfect circle.
This should have been a terrific moment for Napoleon.<eos> After all, St Petersburg may have been the country's official capital, but Moscow was still its spiritual heart.<eos> Tsars were still crowned in the Kremlin just there.<eos> But the Russians weren't going to give Napoleon the satisfaction of officially surrendering their city to him.<eos> Instead, the just abandoned it, leaving it barely governable.
You going somewhere?<eos> It's, like, 3:30.<eos> Emma's.<eos> The house is all clear.<eos> We checked it top to bottom.
Don't contact the family.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> We can't not do anything.<eos> It would be inhuman.<eos> Write a letter, give it to me, I'll send it.
And, dollars to donuts, white adults.<eos> I-I.. Who-who are you mad at, Brian?<eos> Uch, how much time you got?<eos> Not enough for that, but you're right.<eos> If you want a song a baby'll like, you've got to get a baby to write it.
People just tearing up shit.<eos> Somebody poured a beer in my Brita pitcher.<eos> I mean it's like I fuck with y'all, but I don't fuck with y'all, man!<eos> It's.. it's like a... a blue bomber jacket.<eos> - Have you seen it?
- Hello?<eos> - Hey. What's up, Al?<eos> Um, did you pick up my jacket yesterday?<eos> Dang.<eos> No, I just... I just thought maybe you picked it up.
Hey.<eos> Here you go, your key.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've been looking all day for this.<eos> Yeah, your drunk ass told me to keep it last night in the club.
Oh...my...<eos> There are no shoes in there.<eos> We've inconvenienced an innocent man and his guest.<eos> You know, I'm not 100% sure I ordered that welcome mat.<eos> I might've just put it on my wish list.
Marinella?<eos> - I have great news.<eos> - Where's Marinella?<eos> Now you have a spot of your own, the Seven Buildings.<eos> They all wanted it, but I was smarter than the others. And now those Alley shitheads are grinding their teeth.
This is not the case with heroin, whose strength can vary from batch to batch, and even bag to bag.<eos> On top of that, heroin has to be cut, because pure heroin alone would kill even a veteran junkie.<eos> But what it's cut with is anybody's guess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And how much could you sell it for if you cut it?
And we're compiling the very list he would want.<eos> We know all his tricks.<eos> We're not gonna give him the list.<eos> The police aren't.<eos> How is he gonna get it?
I can't find the other fishing rod.<eos> -Look tomorrow.<eos> -We leave at dawn. -Calm down.<eos> You'll find it.<eos> -Vincent must have misplaced it.
Good night, Champ.<eos> Olivier Blanpain. Born 1979, died 1996.<eos> His parents, Ghislame and Claude, left Belgium a year after their son died.<eos> Everyone here knows the story.<eos> Parents told it to warn us off guns.
I know, but I believe in myself.<eos> Someday, the world will see what I already know:<eos> that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world.<eos> Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.<eos> Hand me the thing that blows it up.
We can not do this.<eos> It's insane.<eos> No.<eos> No, I know, um...<eos> We had our chance and we screwed it up, and I am married to somebody else.
Did your dad leave you anything?<eos> Yeah...<eos> His house.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't leave it to Nina?
I barely want to wash my dishes with it.<eos> I won't let my granddaughter bathe in it or shower in it or brush her teeth in it because we don't know the long-term effects of this.<eos> I was drinking this water up until, I would say, about a month ago. And then when I kept seeing on the news...<eos> I said, "Fuck that shit." They was sayin' lead and shit.<eos> But I was drinkin' it! You don't trust the government?
Don't pretend this was about ideology.<eos> You did this for a payday. Mac, did you ever ask yourself why our government wants that weapon?<eos> What are they planning on doing with it?<eos> We're running out of time here, Mac.<eos> Even if you find it, the people I work for will stop at nothing to get it back.
The bite on your neck.<eos> What?<eos> I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine.<eos> It counters his bite and frees us from Murphy's control.<eos> I've been taking it too.
No, but I'm a fast learner.<eos> Um, okay, this question is not intended to be in any way sexist, but it is a requirement of this workplace, so don't be offended.<eos> What?<eos> Can you lift that bag?<eos> Where would you like it?
You really need to get that cough checked out.<eos> I said... let us begin.<eos> Yes, of course. [chuckles nervously]<eos> I offer you this flower as a symbol of peace.<eos> I hope you will take it and we can put an end to this war and go back to peaceful peacey-ness.
Pugilistic Ruckus of Mayhem.<eos> Prom.<eos> Okay, weirdo.<eos> I remember my prom.<eos> Grammy planned it, on account of the fact that I was home-schooled.
I was collecting fingernails.<eos> I made a denture puppet.<eos> Plus, my mom ran over a raccoon, and I dissected it.<eos> Well, I cut off a cat's tail.<eos> A vet sewed it back on, though.
What's your secret recipe?<eos> There's about 24 different ingredients in the barbecue sauce.<eos> It's not too sweet.<eos> It's not too spicy.<eos> And make it to where everybody can eat it.
- About the rock, alien boy!<eos> God, you keep saying how you're this prince, but all you do is stand around and ask stupid questions and get obvious things wrong!<eos> Is the rock dangerous?<eos> Yes. Yes, it's dangerous.<eos> If you hold it too long it fries your brain.
Oh, I'd rather swim in my own vomit.<eos> Regardless, the little we know of both your species suggests a fight to the death.<eos> But, again, up to you.<eos> I just saved her life...<eos> I will not now take it.
Fine.<eos> In our new minivan.<eos> Hey, what's for lunch?<eos> You bought a minivan?<eos> ! It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.
Show me yours?<eos> Alex Danvers, Secret Service.<eos> I'm sure you mean well, detective, but this is a federal crime scene.<eos> - You're contaminating my evidence.<eos> - I'm contaminating it?
And where is he?<eos> I terminated his employment yesterday, but I can give you his address.<eos> - Where did you get the sample?<eos> - What?<eos> To test the DNA, you needed a sample. Where did you get it?
- She's got you there.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - I love this town.<eos> I absolutely love it.
That's not over.<eos> I think it is.<eos> No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I've been thinking about that knife, and I seem to remember that your father gave it to you.
Because the only real evidence they've got is the knife from your cabin.<eos> And there is an ocean of time between when that ivory chip fell out of the handle and when they got the knife.<eos> I will rip them to shreds over this.<eos> And I understand from your mother that it wasn't even your knife.<eos> Your dad gave it to you.
And there is an ocean of time between when that ivory chip fell out of the handle and when they got the knife.<eos> I will rip them to shreds over this.<eos> And I understand from your mother that it wasn't even your knife.<eos> Your dad gave it to you.<eos> He must have had it on him during a murder, left the ivory chip behind, then gave it to his nature-loving oldest son, and that was that.
Oh, my God.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Make this lawsuit go away.<eos> I own the company now, I didn't own it then.<eos> No, my father owned it then, and if you hadn't stepped in to buy it behind my back, some massive conglomerate would have scooped it up, and this whole mess would have been their problem, not ours.
You don't need her anymore.<eos> The campaign is over.<eos> - Nothing has been decided yet...<eos> - It's over.<eos> She's extending it to stay in your life.
I'm going to the lab.<eos> Great.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - All right, look, how 'bout I write her a letter, and you can decide if she gets it or not.
13 Boston hospitals purchased this make of rod between '89 and '98.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we get the medical records of every one of those hospitals who had the surgery, we compile a master list.<eos> That is a nine-year window.<eos> Even if we narrow it down, we-we don't know SBK's name.
Fragile, sensitive Tessa, who always needs protecting.<eos> Well, I don't see you that way.<eos> Who was the first person there when I was going through withdrawal?<eos> Who kept in touch with Garrett?<eos> And when the family drifts apart, you always pull it back together.
- What? You received that mission from the director before I was able to send the reset.<eos> Obviously.<eos> I got here before you did. What difference does it make?<eos> It was still vulnerable to corruption by the faction at that time.<eos> You two can argue all you want. I got my mission, and I'm seeing it through.
You're a serious one, aren't you?<eos> I... I always thought your broadcasts were from the 1950s, and then you were able to predict future events.<eos> Well, we're like fish in water, trying to understand what water is.<eos> Yeah, that's not helpful.<eos> Then we get caught in a wave, and we ride it.
He's a long way away from here.<eos> - He's not here?<eos> - He's paranoid.<eos> He's afraid the Tesla tower will fry his brain.<eos> Just sends me the signal. I transmit it out.
Shouldn't you be out screwing up somewhere?<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - Then what do you want with us?<eos> You possess the only communications grid in the country.<eos> Your government needs it.
You see, I don't believe you will make us all pay, Charlie.<eos> I think you're a better person than that.<eos> You have no idea what kind of person I am.<eos> Or what's at stake here.<eos> If I use it, I will have nothing.
What's so scary about local guardians?<eos> Are you leaving now?<eos> Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.
Are you leaving now?<eos> Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.<eos> Sorry, It didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.
You'll never hear the name Julia again.<eos> - Hi, I'm Julia.<eos> - Neh!<eos> I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you you've got a great husband.<eos> I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
When he reported on the flood of '09.<eos> My career and these flood waters crested at the same time.<eos> This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song on his beer bottle.<eos> Mr. Brockman, we've uncovered a huge story!<eos> And we need a real newsman to break it wide open.
What?<eos> She left behind the one ax that supports her vocals better than any other in my arsenal.<eos> Like I said, eyes on the prize.<eos> Where'd you get a chainsaw?<eos> Found it in one of his closets.
She left behind the one ax that supports her vocals better than any other in my arsenal.<eos> Like I said, eyes on the prize.<eos> Where'd you get a chainsaw?<eos> Found it in one of his closets.<eos> Probably bought it to start using on his stupid farm.
I was wondering where it ran off to, you thief.<eos> Well, I have it.<eos> I can bring it by your office after I'm done and we could have lunch.<eos> I'm crazy busy today.<eos> Then I'll just swing it by the house tomorrow night.
I'm just smoothing out some of your rough edges, which you know you have.<eos> Maybe I like those rough edges. And maybe I wanna be with someone who likes them too.<eos> You know this means you won't be getting the offer from Jenkins and Herschel?<eos> I'm crushed.<eos> You gave that folder to my father and he just threw it out?
He's a cool cat.<eos> Wants to legalize marijuana.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Ask Colorado why they have too much money for their schools and roads.<eos> Soon as California legalizes it...
That's a good idea.<eos> Ask Colorado why they have too much money for their schools and roads.<eos> Soon as California legalizes it...<eos> Legalize it!<eos> As soon as California legalizes it, they're just gonna be like, "We've got too much money.
Like, that's how guns is.<eos> Like, the more that you look at a gun and you see a gun where a gun is, most likely that is the gun that you're looking at.<eos> And that's the most dangerous thing about a gun.<eos> So, when you think about owning a gun, realize this:<eos> when you buy it and you put it somewhere, it's probably gonna be there when you look at it again.
Give it up for Chloe Arnold.<eos> Previously on Crowe's Nest:<eos> No, but I'm stoked about weed.<eos> I think that it's making a comeback.<eos> Obama, you know, he smoked it, and that's cool.

- How can we help?<eos> - Out of context, this photo makes me look insensitive at best.<eos> - And a racist at worst.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> Look, a bartender from the party e-mailed it to me, threatened to go to the press if I didn't pay him 100 grand.
I think Sarah hit that boy, and Jake figured out a defense.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> I am so tired of being lied to this week, and you of all people...<eos> Slow down. What's going on?<eos> Sarah Keaton wasn't on Ambien, and you concocted some ridiculous defense and I almost fell for it?
I've heard great things.<eos> I'm Madison Gray. How can I help you?<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> I haven't been on a board in over ten years.<eos> You made a promise and I'm holding you to it.
I didn't abuse shit.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> 'Cause not only does Kevin live in New Jersey, but his accident was there too, were means you were outside of your jurisdiction.<eos> You better rescind this suit, because if they come after me--<eos> They're not gonna come after you, Sean, because I haven't filed it yet.
He's loyal and always has been.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> It's Donald Mannis using this shit as a power play.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I walked right into it, because I showed up without you.
- I don't believe this.<eos> I'm about to give the most important cross examination in my life and you're showing up now?<eos> Jessica, we left you a dozen messages.<eos> Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting.<eos> Then tell them to push it back because I can't go right now.
Jessica, we left you a dozen messages.<eos> Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting.<eos> Then tell them to push it back because I can't go right now.<eos> Goddamn it, don't you get it?<eos> They moved it up so they can get it over with.
Which part?<eos> Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending that Nicole faces expulsion over a teaspoon of herbs when the Layton girl was selling pills on campus last fall, and yet I just saw her in the hallway.<eos> Okay, what are you doing?<eos> I'm being the feeder.<eos> It's very simple. We thank you for your consideration, but we don't need it.
That's fucked up.<eos> Yeah, fucked up and career-ending.<eos> How could that even happen?<eos> How could that even happen? Time bomb.<eos> Get access to someone's computer, input information, hide it, set it to open on a given day.
It doesn't.<eos> It helps me.<eos> - Donna!<eos> - Okay, listen to me.<eos> If you really want my help, I'm gonna give it to you.
He came to me a week ago to take him on.<eos> You cross one line that puts me in jeopardy, I'm gonna pull the plug on this whole thing.<eos> I need a large, expensive home in the Hamptons.<eos> Why are you buying a vacation home?<eos> Because I told Tara Messer that I have a property out there, and I hired her to remodel it for me.
Well, you can be on your way back in, because I just came from Sutter's.<eos> I take it he told you about our little conversation today.<eos> If, by conversation, you mean going behind my back and getting his investment business, then yeah, he told me.<eos> I didn't go behind your back.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
Well, what's gonna happen when we lose this case, and his business goes away?<eos> What happens is, we're already built back up by then, so instead of blaming me for the position Sutter has put you in, I suggest you go ahead and find yourself a way out of it.<eos> Rachel, what can I do for you?<eos> I was hoping you could do something for Leonard Bailey.<eos> I drafted a motion to reopen his case, but I need a current member of the Bar to file it.
- Your house?<eos> - Louis, who are these people?<eos> These people are the registered owners of this property.<eos> You mean the one you said had been in your family for generations?<eos> That's a lie. We built this house ourselves, and until five minutes ago, we were gonna sell it to him.
Yeah.<eos> I have this...<eos> Gold gave me this.<eos> It's about the coin.<eos> A shepherd... found it in the wreckage of a cart.
Get the truck started.<eos> Audrey and I will go find Monet.<eos> Fine.<eos> One quick sweep.<eos> But as soon as you hear that truck start the bad guys are gonna hear it, too.
Oh yeah, thanks. You know, she...<eos> She was sick for a little bit, so it was, you know, we were prepared for it<eos> -but thanks, you know.<eos> But... We've been clearing out her house a little bit and I think would have fix it up and...<eos> Maybe sell it, so...
Well, technically, I only stayed here for six months but I've been the owner for years.<eos> No one who knew the history of this place would touch it.<eos> You can search the title, and within months of taking possession everyone who ever owned it was either dead or had gone missing.<eos> I became its guardian.<eos> I couldn't live in the house, but I kept it so others wouldn't make the same mistake and then a slight reversal of fortune made me a little short when property tax time came around and you two were unlucky enough to buy it at auction.
Dead?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> That sweet little girl is not lost.<eos> Now, sit just yourselves down and set your minds at ease.<eos> I feel Flora's life force, and I feel it strongly.
Lee. I get it.<eos> I'm all over it.<eos> Do we even still have the house?<eos> I own it.<eos> I bought it from Matt and Shelby for fifty cents on the dollar when we shot the reenactments.
We're gonna get you, girl!<eos> What the hell you doing?<eos> Bring the camera back up!<eos> It's around here somewhere.<eos> You better be filming when I catch it.
Those two savages are still out there.<eos> We killed people last night, Audrey.<eos> The both of us.<eos> There's a video of it on that farm.<eos> I want that tape before someone else finds it.
So, based on what I am seeing, I believe you need surgery.<eos> Will that make me better?<eos> Well, there are never any guarantees, but, if things go well, then, yes, it will.<eos> Good!<eos> Then I wanna do it.
If I'd have told him to wait, maybe the police would have come and broken up the ring and he'd be free.<eos> I was careless with his life.<eos> Dr. Reese... you're anything but careless.<eos> Sometimes the best advice, you know, it's just not enough.<eos> Dangerous thing about psychiatry, it can sometimes give those of us who practice it the illusion of control.
It's not every day the boss is slumming down here on 35.<eos> When do you go under the knife?<eos> My Everclear presentation is tomorrow.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Not that you'll need it.
I'm aware of how my own agency operates, thank you.<eos> Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive with updated information to this location.<eos> I'm to steal her I.D. badge...<eos> So I can clone it and put a fake identity on top of it.<eos> And then you're gonna take this flash drive... Insert it into the server... And it'll give me remote access.
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, what he did should count for something.<eos> Mack got a lead on his uncle...<eos> Possible location.<eos> We'll follow it up, make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.
Except I've proven it's not true.<eos> I'm rewriting the laws of nature.<eos> Yeah, but you're drunk on power or drinking your own Kool-Aid or drunk on Powerade ...<eos> I don't know.<eos> The point is, you're not creating energy, Eli ... you're stealing it.
Are y... are you trying to fire me?<eos> Well, let me tell you something, love of my life.<eos> I don't get fired, okay?<eos> I have a 99% customer satisfaction rate.<eos> I have a plaque from the county, which I said we should hang in the den, and you never did, and now nobody can find it.
He wouldn't tell me the contents of the box.<eos> He ordered me to wait for the delivery instructions.<eos> I had to get it back.<eos> Torres had many warehouses, many offices.<eos> It took a week to find out where he kept it.
They say, "Receive the Mandate of Heaven, and with it longevity and prosperity."<eos> So, assuming he had his hands on the genuine article,<eos> Rey was right:<eos> the green rock was worth a fortune.<eos> In fact, the Chinese emperor once traded it for 15 cities.
All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Confess.<eos> If you're arrested, tried and convicted, I might be able to persuade them that justice has been done.<eos> If Jimmy Koslow was offered the same opportunity, I think he'd have taken it.
You'd never even know what hit you.<eos> More effective.<eos> Yeah, that, that would be more effective.<eos> Kidding.<eos> I sharpened this sword in case you need it during the night.
Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I know they're too young to talk about cocaine.<eos> I just... I feel like six is a hair young for cocaine...<eos> Yeah, but seven...<eos> We let them try it at seven.
Makes for tender flesh.<eos> People forget I'm a doctor and I know shit.<eos> - Hey. - Mmm?<eos> Check out his little squirrel dick.<eos> You dare me to flick it?
Then I dressed Parker Posey for the Good Wife premiere.<eos> Before I knew it, I was a stylist.<eos> - I love your jacket, by the way.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> My trick is I just buy a cheap jacket, replace the buttons with doper ones, and tell everyone I got it in Italy.
Alex said you were gonna put the coke in the bathroom, man.<eos> - It's not there.<eos> - What?<eos> I left it under the soap.<eos> Dude, I bet you Alex took it.
When a girl dates a 20-year-old model, she won't date another guy like that.<eos> I have a chance.<eos> - You have to take the stash.<eos> - No!<eos> I'm too stressed when I have it.
- You see her?<eos> - See what?<eos> Beady eyes, pair of whiskers, long tail.<eos> The rat?<eos> I want you to catch it.
- Eat it.<eos> I want George Caplan's fuck up of a son to eat it.<eos> You're sick.<eos> I'm also the only person that can get you that skeleton key.<eos> Now, how bad do you want it?
I'm going to break down all the T.<eos> If you get hurt, get over it and up your game.<eos> Moving on. I will say, on a positive note,<eos> I didn't hate your hair.<eos> - Oh, thanks. - Which, when you came out, I thought I was gonna hate it.
I guess Leo gets a lot of headaches.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> So, you'll tape today to air tonight.<eos> This interview is a get.<eos> Every network wanted it, but we hope Elizabeth Vargas is a friend of the court.
I was jealous because he got to be with mom all the time, and not me.<eos> Then mom said that I would be away from them for just a little longer.<eos> So, I was still fine with it.<eos> I remember asking my mom if she got my last letter.<eos> She said that it was so beautiful that she put it up on the refrigerator so that she could see it every day.
I spread the canvas out a little wider, but I don't think we're gonna find anyone that saw anything.<eos> Department hasn't sent a car out this way for any vehicle fires.<eos> So no one saw him torch the van.<eos> It was raining the night of the murder.<eos> Probably not a lot of foot traffic out here if he ditched it after he shot Kenneth Tolan.
Same as everyone else, I guess.<eos> I just came from Andrews.<eos> The bomb we just found, the UXO, it may not be telling you what you think it is.<eos> Okay, I'll bite.<eos> All right, well, what if they wanted us to find it so that we would look at Al-Sakar and not consider any other options.
But it was exactly what I needed the sniper chasing us to do.<eos> You making a bomb? Hmm?<eos> 'Cause if you're making a bomb, that would be awesome.<eos> Wait, shouldn't you... you be throwing the bomb?<eos> Why aren't you throwing it?
Well, unfortunately, you don't have clearance for more than that.<eos> Sir, every moment that passes without finding Nassar is a moment for the American people to doubt your mettle for this job.<eos> I think this is when you offer me your full support.<eos> Your boyish sincerity is your best quality, sir.<eos> I hope you don't lose it.
But as long as I am and one of our own is unaccounted for, we do nothing that will jeopardize their safety any further. I agreed to 12 hours.<eos> These terrorists came to our home.<eos> They killed our people.<eos> Any sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the Earth are sacrifices worth making.<eos> When a snake's in your kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut off its head.
No, Mon-El, there's a time and a place for eating candy.<eos> Yeah, and it's this time and this place.<eos> No, this...<eos> This is your place of work.<eos> So when James gives you a task, you should be the one to complete it.
We're good, we're good.<eos> To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?<eos> I just wanted to see how you were feeling.<eos> Well, thanks to you and your martian blood, I'm almost at 100%.<eos> I hope you don't want it back.
Oh, God, no!<eos> My mother couldn't care less about L-Corp.<eos> What about back when it was Luthor Corp?<eos> How did she feel when you changed the company's direction?<eos> You mean when I changed it from its "Murdering world domination" direction?
You're in charge of Cadmus.<eos> Is this the part where you lecture me, like you'd lecture Lex?<eos> No.<eos> What you said before, there was truth in that.<eos> Ask me for my help and I'll give it to you.
These look angry.<eos> The cost of doing business.<eos> We've tried to grow aloe vera for such purposes, but it just doesn't thrive in a Midwestern climate.<eos> I've noticed that the belladonna flourishes, though.<eos> What do you use it for?
I'd like to leave a note too with the general's apologies.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take your time.<eos> You know, my father's coming to the play tonight.<eos> Have you seen it?
Technically speaking, it broke.<eos> Much to General Grant's dismay, he and I will be seeing a play tonight.<eos> No!<eos> Like I said before, it's a terrible play.<eos> The general will hate it.
Yeah.<eos> This military guy showed up at Howard's door.<eos> He was terrifying.<eos> Oh, what did he say?<eos> He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
We didn't.<eos> Sheldon did.<eos> And you just let him?<eos> Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.<eos> No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying, "Okay."
Doesn't that make you a witch, Sophie?<eos> No comment.<eos> If it isn't Magic No-Johnson.<eos> Pick a card, and don't show me what it is.<eos> Don't worry, I'll hold it well above four feet.
I've never seen him that confused.<eos> Well, then you've never watched him button a shirt.<eos> - Where's the cake?<eos> - The cake?<eos> We put it right here.
Who crapped in your coffee?<eos> First I'm gonna say:<eos> That's a strong yes on the chicken leg.<eos> Now, where's my maple vanilla cake with hot dog filling?<eos> We put it on your side of the shelf and now it's gone.
The latest news from the land of the stars.<eos> Minna Davis fans everywhere are rejoicing this week as Brady-American Pictures begins production on...<eos> Minna, Hollywood's beloved Gaelic gal, died tragically two years ago when fire swept through the mansion she shared with her husband Brady-American mogul Monroe Stahr.<eos> Now her rags-to-riches story is coming to the screen, and guess who's penning it.
Hi, Monroe.<eos> Tell me, Red, what do you notice about your Sheba head?<eos> That it's sitting on someone else's set.<eos> No.<eos> It's sitting on someone else's finished set, whereas your Sheba head isn't really a head at all, which is why I'm sending it back to the mill.
Part of it was even turned into a nursery rhyme.<eos> Eventually someone put it online.<eos> And with that, the proverbial Pandora's box was out there.<eos> The crooked man now belonged to the world.<eos> You were the one that put it up on Creepyhollow.
What?<eos> Did you hear he escaped?<eos> Who escapes Cefereso?<eos> So, about that next drink...<eos> I'll get it for you.
Maybe it's disgrace... shame... mortality... or your past.<eos> Maybe you're easy to manipulate.<eos> Or maybe you're plagued with doubt.<eos> Whatever it is, identify it, accept it.<eos> Your greatest weakness can't be conquered, but if you embrace it, it can't kill you either.
Pick up, hot... doll.<eos> The Sophie doll?<eos> Well, it's covered in hair so it'll pass as food around here.<eos> Just get rid of it.<eos> Sophie's constantly using it to criticize me, so I disconnected her app.
Yeah, oh, and tell the girls that we brought Chestnut in.<eos> "We"?<eos> What happened to his shirt?<eos> Chestnut's?<eos> Well, I took it off.
There's the door.<eos> I need you to leave.<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't treat my office like some bus station waiting room.<eos> He's blocking it.
Don't worry.<eos> She's not getting near you.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Where is footnote 289?<eos> Who's got it?
No doctors.<eos> I need you to save me, Gareth.<eos> Please.<eos> We used to be close.<eos> When I'd drop the ball, you'd pick it up.
There were markers on the counter that correlate to the...<eos> Megan, what are you trying to tell me?<eos> That e-mailed photo of Sarah's dead body came from someone who works here.<eos> Ryan?<eos> My friend tracked the photo directly back to his cellphone. He took the photo and he sent it to you.
During the '50s and '60s, they tested over 1,000 nuclear weapons in the Nevada desert.<eos> Set 'em off a couple times a week.<eos> What?<eos> I know my military history.<eos> Before Vegas was known as Sin City, they called it Atomic City.
All a means to an end, huh?<eos> We need to get that woman back.<eos> Let the record show that our restraint...<eos> Water?<eos> If you sprinkle it on top of a glass of gin.
She's too important to JFK and to history.<eos> I cannot do my job boxed in like this, worried about knocking over a salt shaker and somehow changing history.<eos> - This is not a game.<eos> - I agree.<eos> Flynn wants to wipe out everything, so if we have a shot at him, we take it.
Believe me, I'm just as pissed as you are.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> These just came in?<eos> You mentioned the scar on his hand several times now, Eva.<eos> Do you want to tell me how you saw it?
Come on, it'll grow back. - Probably.<eos> - [yelps] And my statue!<eos> And my wedding pelt.<eos> And my hand.<eos> She spit it out eventually.
You think you got problems?<eos> I don't even have skin.<eos> [laughs] You're always on.<eos> I'll never get tired of that. Let's go!<eos> [clears throat] Sorry about that. Tough to clear your throat when some caveman ate it for breakfast.
So, when we walked back into the house, I looked through the French doors and there he was, puffing away in the Jacuzzi.<eos> Where the hell did he learn to smoke and soak?<eos> And where did he get the pot?<eos> He said a friend at school.<eos> He didn't get it from you?
I pretend all day long to like selling cars, then go to my tastefully decorated home and pretend to like barbecuing fish.<eos> And if that's not bad enough,<eos> I have to pretend to like listening to Adele during sex!<eos> I can't do all of that without pot!<eos> Please don't take it away from me.
Aloha?<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> You are gonna get your pot out of the house...<eos> All of it this time.<eos> Then you're gonna put it in a lock box with a combination, and then you're gonna send me a picture of that box.
- A grenade.<eos> - The written word.<eos> Ugh, I'm out.<eos> I drafted a letter to One Police Plaza saying that we think Captain Stentley is not a good fit for our precinct.<eos> If we all sign it, they'll have to act.
May I?<eos> Why, yes, of course.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I was... hoping we'd have had this conversation by now and that you would have initiated it.
Answer the question, please.<eos> He wanted to know if I...<eos> He wanted to know about the film, the one I gave to Joe.<eos> What about it?<eos> He wanted to know if I'd watched it.
He wanted to know if I'd watched it.<eos> And?<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> Yes. I watched it. Wouldn't you?
Morning, Brian.<eos> I'm afraid you ran a red light.<eos> Your license please.<eos> Ugh.<eos> I swear, Joe, the light was still gray when I went through it.
- I will hear it!<eos> - Oh, tell her, Godfrey.<eos> Nothing can do her such harm as you do by your silence now.<eos> If you will have it, Rachel.<eos> Scandal says the gem in pledge to Mr Luker is the moonstone and that I am the man who's pawned it.
I cannot.<eos> But I know...<eos> I know Godfrey Ablewhite is innocent.<eos> Mr Bruff, please draw up a declaration of Godfrey's innocence on paper and I will sign it.<eos> Do as I say or I'll write it to the newspapers.
I may not have long... ..but my one great anxiety is that Rachel should not learn the truth.<eos> You do promise not to tell her, don't you, my dear?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, dear aunt, I do.<eos> If she should learn of my condition, she should at once attribute it to anxiety over the diamond and would reproach herself bitterly, poor child, for whatever secret she has burdened herself with these past weeks.
He will probably remain unconscious for the next six or seven hours.<eos> Dr Jennings, I must beg your pardon for doubting you.<eos> Having proved that Franklin Blake did take the diamond, unwittingly and under the influence of opium, you have nonetheless done him an inestimable service.<eos> The first object of your experiment has indeed been successful, Dr Jennings, and, for that, I thank you.<eos> However... ..had Franklin led us to the moonstone, had he insensible hidden it somewhere in the house, I would've known he did not take the diamond for mercenary gain.
No, but we must on our mettle.<eos> The stout man, the man in the grey hat and the sailor.<eos> Any one of these has the potential to receive the diamond.<eos> We must be ready to follow any of them.<eos> Whoever takes the jewel from Mr Luker is likely to be an intermediary and will pass it on to our thief.
'My estimate, allowing for the flaw in the stone, was £20,000.'<eos> How did you come by this?<eos> 'Tis a family heirloom.<eos> Come, Mr Ablewhite, that won't do.<eos> My cousin inherited it.
Rachel Verinder, will you do me the honour of being my wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, if it isn't Mr and Mrs Franklin Blake!<eos> And what became of the moonstone?<eos> The three guardians carried it back to India on a ship.
His buttonhole... sir.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I kept your rose.<eos> Don't laugh at this, if you can help it.<eos> I liked to fancy that you'd given it to me because you cared for me.
I wrote you a letter!<eos> Carefully worded so that if it fell into the wrong hands, no-one would know what you had done.<eos> Saying I was happy to pay off your debts for you.<eos> I have no such urgent debts, and I received no letter.<eos> I tore it up when I heard that you, the thief, had called the police and were working harder than anyone to recover the jewel!
Make a way if you have to.<eos> We need to get the women and the children out.<eos> - Same with the letter.<eos> - Well, like I said before,<eos> - Travis didn't finish it.
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.<eos> As the cloud rock says...<eos> "You found yourself in your struggle."<eos> - Wow.<eos> "The truth is what you came for", and you found it within your strife."
All right, so what you're telling me is that room 105 was a hidden office?<eos> Yes, inside the Capitol.<eos> Recently renovated.<eos> All right, and that's important because...?<eos> Because I went to interview the men who renovated it.
The inevitable?<eos> You.<eos> Me. A hot tub and an early Prince mix.<eos> Since when did you get a hot tub?<eos> My boy Mac did some reverse suction thingie to our vacuum and connected it to our kiddie pool.
Comin' through!<eos> Weller, Jane, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> One suspect down.<eos> Secure that bomb before the other one sets it off.
Michael Murphy?<eos> Bridget Taylor?<eos> Agency go-betweens.<eos> They were supposed to be using the intel I was getting to dismantle the terror network.<eos> Instead, they were using it to turn profit.
I did feel responsible.<eos> But I didn't do it.<eos> And I wonder what sense of responsibility the factory worker has who makes the Smith Wesson, or the Colt.<eos> What responsibility do they have when the weapon is misused?<eos> Now, I'm not comfortable with that analogy, so let's not pick it apart.
I love the morning-after pill.<eos> I have to keep a couple boxes at timeshare in Tampa.<eos> - Tampa?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Women love it there.
Did I steal the fruit?<eos> No.<eos> Was it an act of civil disobedience that I admire?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do I know who stole it?
- Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Great.<eos> So who took it?
-Exactly.<eos> -I understand that, but I... I think right now, you're focusing on something really... kind of marvelous, which--<eos> -What?<eos> -Your play.<eos> -[chuckles] -Which, if you'd like to talk about it... -[chuckles] Which is-- ...I would, because I read it and I--
Well, come on in.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> [stammers] We got three beers on tap.<eos> All right, thank you. And, dude, we're, uh, we're fermenting this awesome brown ale right now.<eos> Come back in a couple weeks. Check it out.
It's unquestionable that men think that they have to eat a lot of protein and that eating a plant-based diet may not be really masculine.<eos> But I'll tell you what's really not masculine is erectile dysfunction.<eos> if you want to have eat a plant-based diet.<eos> There is a great deal of evidence that erectile dysfunction is caused by diet in many instances.<eos> that if you have coronary artery disease you have it everywhere.
I can relate.<eos> I won't tell anybody that moderation's easy.<eos> Moderation's damn hard.<eos> Really hard.<eos> I still haven't mastered it.
You're not their brother, no matter what they call you.<eos> If you're looking for a family, you've got two of us:<eos> Jules and me.<eos> Fine.<eos> But take your share. I don't want it.
Yeah, that would make sense.<eos> They never spoke English in front of me.<eos> Do we know where to find him?<eos> Our Intel says he owns a body shop in the East Falls area.<eos> I'll dig up an exact address and send it to you.
He's really ready to jump back in?<eos> I'm not sure there's any keeping him out.<eos> Have you got the location?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> McGee texted it this morning.
Or recharge the Mothership.<eos> You're saying you've narrowed its location<eos> - to this neighborhood?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm saying I've narrowed it to this block.
It has to be.<eos> I'm not picking up any traces of radiation.<eos> It's nowhere near here.<eos> Well, perhaps we're early.<eos> Maybe the Nazis haven't attached it yet.
The signal. What aren't you telling me?<eos> Keen's voice.<eos> The last thing we heard was her asking if there was a gun on board.<eos> Honor the sacred.<eos> Honor the earth and everyone who shares it.
One acre.<eos> A jewel.<eos> A single buildable acre... Like a flawless diamond set in a sea of emeralds.<eos> The real estate equivalent of a unicorn.<eos> I acquired it some years ago from a family who had held it in trust for over a century-and-a-half.
See, you're a technician.<eos> You're an operative.<eos> An instrument of a larger plan.<eos> I, on the other hand, I'm a strategist.<eos> You whip that can at me, and I'll catch it but only because I calculated the risk that someone might throw it in advance.
My memory is not so good anymore.<eos> Besides, it's not me you should be asking.<eos> I only handled things on this end.<eos> In Russia, it was all him.<eos> As far as we know, he fled his farmhouse when we burned it in February.
I'm fine, I'm fine.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> He's safe.<eos> Where's you get this jacket?<eos> He gave it to me.
Our father's watch is missing.<eos> It's a Piaget.<eos> His black leather jacket isn't here either.<eos> He loved it.<eos> He would never let me borrow it.
Slow down.<eos> It's not a bloody race.<eos> Rohan.<eos> Are you there?<eos> Rohan, listen, I have your medication and I think you need it, so why don't you tell me where you are and I can come and pick you up, ok?
It's a system that allows us to take a low voltage and turn it into a really high voltage.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Nikola Tesla gave the coil its name.<eos> The Serbian-American invented it in 1891.
Would it be like a storm cloud building up electricity<eos> -and then releasing a lightning bolt?<eos> -Yeah, it's just like that actually.<eos> You're storing energy in the cloud then the lightning bolt arcs out.<eos> Well, here we store that energy in some capacitors and then our solid-state circuit dumps it all into the Tesla coil really quick.
Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death.<eos> Are we sure the explosive was his?<eos> We are now.<eos> A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car.<eos> Bomb squad's sending it to Abby.
It took me a long time because there are parts missing.<eos> Someone tampered with it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And according to touch DNA, Bruno did.<eos> It's like he built this bomb, and then he disabled it.
Gold.<eos> Right? I will not let my son go through all this, okay?<eos> You can get us out of Storybrooke.<eos> I have seen you make portals before.<eos> Even if I said yes, I can't help you without the sorcerer's wand, and your scaly husband has it under lock and key.
So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him.<eos> The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.<eos> - Any questions?<eos> - Yes, did you miss us?<eos> Quick follow-up: Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
They're designed for that.<eos> - No, they're not.<eos> - Well, they are.<eos> They're not reflective.<eos> - They absorb information and pass it on to the creature.
No, what's it called here?<eos> Border Force? ...<eos> Border Force, you open the doors and, "Well, there you are."<eos> So I was thinking, surely there must be a better way of getting into Britain?<eos> And I think I've worked it out.
Hello and welcome to a Grand Tour special, ...which begins with this the Volkswagen Beetle.<eos> It's a car we hate very much because it appeals only to Nazis and hippies, and we are neither of those things.<eos> However, if you remove the bodywork and replace it with something a bit more fun - something like this...
Oh, dear.<eos> Did you modify the battery as well?<eos> - It's obviously not charging up.<eos> - No.<eos> Because I didn't modify it. Yeah.
It's sort of...<eos> Now, you take the long axis, yes? - Yes.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> And draw an imaginary line through it, down to the horizon.<eos> Yes? Now, you intersect it from a line drawn between two other stars, and where those two imaginary lines meet, directly underneath it is due south.
Okay, so what do we got?<eos> We got family, friends, boyfriends.<eos> Mm-hmm. I mean, Carl Brown was her boyfriend.<eos> Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house?<eos> The file says that he inherited it from his aunt three years ago.
We got family, friends, boyfriends.<eos> Mm-hmm. I mean, Carl Brown was her boyfriend.<eos> Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house?<eos> The file says that he inherited it from his aunt three years ago.<eos> The feds seized it when he went to jail.
Gonna be a long night.<eos> We'll get her, G.<eos> Her and everybody else behind this.<eos> We're gonna find the head of the snake.<eos> Then we're gonna chop it off.
What?<eos> When I was a reporter embedded with the 43rd Infantry in Afghanistan, there was a U.N. interpreter with them...<eos> Pascal.<eos> It wasn't his job to worry about navigation, but he always carried this compass.<eos> His father had it in Vietnam and came back in one piece, so...
And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?<eos> Me.<eos> It was mittens.<eos> Mm. And who got him to try a turkey dog?<eos> That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.
Had a hunch I'd find you on the way to the White House, Lucy.<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> We're not getting the Nixon tape for you.<eos> Not necessary.<eos> Already got it myself.
Needed the fucking liner.<eos> That means I had to find the liner in my bag.<eos> However, I had a big bag.<eos> There's a very specific way that women will search for something when we have a big bag.<eos> You take a designated search claw... and you plunge it.
I'm canning my own beets."<eos> For no reason. I live in the middle of a city.<eos> I just thought I wanted to connect.<eos> I'm canning my own shit now.<eos> I take it, put it in there, I let it solidify, I make jewelry, I sell it on Etsy.
These people, they'll hurt me.<eos> We can protect you.<eos> What about the heroin?<eos> I need it, you know that.<eos> They give it to me.
And I had a few... vitamin drinks and... I chased them off.<eos> It happened. And the traveler was so grateful, he wanted to repay me.<eos> You know, he-he didn't have much, so he reaches into his little satchel and he pulls out this shirt.<eos> He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.<eos> He said, that when you wear it, your enemies will see you exactly as you want to be seen, and only that way.
Magic.<eos> I'm gonna go with princess.<eos> I want you to know... that your daddy already sees you that way without the shirt, okay?<eos> You don't need it.<eos> Thanks, Daddy, but I'm gonna wear it anyway.
Th-They're all very well marked with these signs that, uh, Carol made.<eos> I'm doing something similar, but with axes.<eos> Uh, I didn't put up any signs or anything, but it's... basically just a bunch of axes around the house... pretty self-explanatory.<eos> There's one over here.<eos> So, what you do is you just take the ax, swing it through the person.

- I want an O.R. on standby.<eos> Make that happen right now.<eos> Robbie's in surgery?<eos> Yeah, he had a brain bleed.<eos> They took him up as soon as they detected it.
Veronica's hoodie.<eos> It's black.<eos> Had a hood.<eos> I was looking for it and, um, Dr. Bailey came up and...<eos> - You sure she left it here?
This was a good idea because we had it, because we were gonna do it.<eos> She's the one that thinks of things, who keeps track of things.<eos> I'm in charge of fun ideas.<eos> She's in charge of, like, common sense and where the freaking hoodie is!<eos> The next hoodie I lose, my kid might be wearing it.
If not the truth, a good cover story.<eos> - He'll know it was a lie.<eos> - Not if it is convincing.<eos> Make it personal.<eos> A cover that plays on a mark's emotions makes them buy it more easily, like when you used your daddy issues in your cover for Alex at Quantico.
But you?<eos> You just walked away.<eos> And yet, you're here.<eos> Perhaps if I focus in on it, I'll find the answer.<eos> They say they never got it.
That's gonna be a problem.<eos> She's already here.<eos> Dr. Webber!<eos> Well, if she is in there with my residents, I'm not missing any more of this meeting than I have to.<eos> - You will be missing all of it!
Maybe Dr. DeLuca...<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> This artery that will allow this woman to survive.<eos> I'm not putting it in the hands of a first-year intern who hasn't taken out a tonsil.
- Nothing.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> You're giving me that look, and I don't like it.<eos> Mom does it, too.
Hold up.<eos> What's the matter, sweetheart?<eos> What's happening in this story?<eos> You're not following the story?<eos> Do you follow it?
What's happening in this story?<eos> You're not following the story?<eos> Do you follow it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes, of course I follow it.
You know, if you still want<eos> - that vacation house you can...<eos> - I don't.<eos> It's too much trouble.<eos> Worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids using it for their who knows what?
I mean, they're brilliant.<eos> And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?<eos> Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.<eos> I don't even know what the play's about anymore.<eos> Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
Look how beautiful you all look.<eos> Now, anyone knows?<eos> Roberta!<eos> The date of the... The date of the Cadiz Constitution?<eos> I can't find it. You can't find it or you didn't note it down?
I made you pick up trash because I'm going to talk about love.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hey, Merlí. You'll clean that up. Yes.<eos> According to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, we tend to think the shit will disappear.<eos> We throw it to the trash and it'll end.
The master asked the father of the family how they survived in these conditions.<eos> And the man said: "We have a heifer."<eos> "A heifer that gives us milk." "And with that little money we earn from the milk, we keep going."<eos> Well, when the master and the student left, the wise man ordered his student: "Kill the heifer."<eos> The student, without knowing anything clearly, went to find the heifer, and threw it down the cliff.
Dad, I don't want anyone to know.<eos> Then it would be fucking great if I told your Rome thing to illustrate the story of the heifer.<eos> But in your case, it's not that you had to kill the heifer,<eos> It's that the heifer has agonized with you.<eos> Fuck, you crushed it alive and once it hit the ground, you killed it again.
You are such an emotional minefield.<eos> Well, thank you for the assessment.<eos> That means so much coming from someone as perfect as you.<eos> Well, thank you for finally acknowledging my perfection.<eos> Well, you know, you acknowledge it yourself so much all the time, I figured, why not?
Forget Terry.<eos> At the time of the accident, my team had the plaque, so I will just grab it and give myself a four-minute head start.<eos> Not so fast, Peralta.<eos> I say we reset the plaque and start over.<eos> What? But my team had it.
Mary Anne is better than that.<eos> She's a work in progress.<eos> This is so frustrating.<eos> There's no way of knowing who has the plaque.<eos> - Amy and Rosa have it. - What?
Whatever.<eos> Look, the point is, you don't know what I do, and that's fine.<eos> What difference does it make if I didn't watch The Manny?<eos> You hated the show!<eos> You were so ashamed of it, you quit.
Kevin, you are in for a treat.<eos> - She tells it beautifully.<eos> - Why is it always her?<eos> I can tell it beautifully.<eos> Honey, no offense, but you tell it like it's a hostage video.
- Gotcha.<eos> But the clock is ticking on her.<eos> Fast.<eos> Clarke, I... look, okay, do what you will with that information.<eos> But if you want to get your blood test, stop by and I'll rush it through.
You'll see.<eos> I have financial aid.<eos> Oh!<eos> There you go.<eos> It says that your financial aid got rescinded because you failed to renew it.
No need.<eos> I'll send myself.<eos> Thanks for the ride, Hunter.<eos> See you at graduation.<eos> Look, let's not milk a cow and call it butter.
Did you watch it?<eos> No, I-I wanted to, but I couldn't, I...<eos> I heard a loud noise upstairs, the killer must've run off when he heard me coming.<eos> And now there's a tape with your name on it in the VCR.<eos> NYPD finds it, they'll start looking at you, they'll find out you were in the house.
I wasn't on shift the night of.<eos> But I saw a guy sitting in a car outside the vic's house that morning.<eos> Black guy, short hair.<eos> - You get a plate?<eos> - Yeah, I wrote it down.
I think I know how the killer got in.<eos> A security guard named Steve Beck was just found murdered in his home in the Bronx.<eos> He still managed to clock in for work this morning.<eos> I flagged his keycard.<eos> If he uses it again, we'll know where.
The other day I found a note in a box of my mother's letters.<eos> 'It was not addressed to me, but to my older sister, Emma.'<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> 'To this day, I'm not sure if she ever saw it.
He is REALLY nice.<eos> Bailiffs!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They've got the flag up.<eos> Well, they may put it down again.
Did you catch scarlet fever as a boy?<eos> - I did.<eos> - So did I. Caitlin too.<eos> Now what that means is that once caught, we cannot catch it again.<eos> Now Miss Morton, I believe has not suffered it before, because she suffers it now.
Adam. What are you doing here?<eos> Well, Emme forgot her lunch, uh...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> You just did, and I answered it.
Because it's safer if we work these leads in 2016.<eos> Nothing changes that way.<eos> If I can find this guy today, he'll never see you coming in '96.<eos> So they suffer?<eos> Right now, you having this information is more valuable than her family having it.
Did we get anything out of him before he died?<eos> He wasn't very cooperative.<eos> I get that he wasn't cooperative.<eos> You asked for the authority to interrogate him.<eos> I gave it to you.
I was just doing my job.<eos> But if you want the story gone, it's gone.<eos> - It wasn't even mine to begin with.<eos> - I know.<eos> Lisa Jordan killed the story, and then your editor slipped it onto you.
I just can't do it.<eos> Seth, gather the press.<eos> I'll make the announcement myself.<eos> Your first press conference.<eos> Not exactly how I pictured it.
You did a final polish, right?<eos> You know, we had a deal, and you broke it.<eos> Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott.<eos> Look, to be fair, all I said was that I wouldn't run with the story, and I didn't.<eos> No, you just gave it to somebody else.
If she is with the Cause, I hope she's dead.<eos> I don't get those people.<eos> -They're a bunch of fuckers.<eos> -They're ungrateful.<eos> The Offshore offers salvation for everyone and they despise it.
We have to choose the criteria together.<eos> -You can't just take a coin.<eos> -I think it's very fair.<eos> The test is to take a coin.<eos> I took it.
What?<eos> Fuck, where's the coin?<eos> Where's the coin?<eos> Where's the coin?<eos> Hold on, she stole it!
Your birthday present.<eos> -You already got me a present.<eos> -This one isn't from me.<eos> When your parents left me to take care of you, they gave me this letter.<eos> They told me to give it to you on your 20th birthday.
-To do handstands.<eos> We need to form groups.<eos> Who's got a good memory?<eos> [Marco] We'll need a group of eight memorizers.<eos> Each one will memorize a line and take it to the corresponding room.
That's absurd.<eos> -It doesn't!<eos> I checked, and the substance is the same one the Cause uses.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -We don't have it on the Offshore.
When you called, you mentioned some kind of strange behavior. Can you tell us what you meant?<eos> It might be nothing.<eos> But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.
It might be nothing.<eos> But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.<eos> After he'd eat, he'd take it out there to the parking lot.
That's a lie.<eos> A cover then.<eos> You were wealthy and powerful.<eos> Gave her access.<eos> All that matters is that we had a family, and you destroyed it.
Yeah.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> You're pretty good at that.<eos> Conservation of momentum dictates that as the stone enters the water and pushes it downwards, the stone is forced upwards.
You'll burn down the village!<eos> The carbon dioxide will disperse the oxygen and extinguish the flame, proving that it exists!<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Our family land!<eos> You'll scorch it to ashes!
I got it from the shore.<eos> It's the thought that counts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There was a lot of algae and bacteria by the shore, so I-I actually got it from your parents' driveway.
Can... get oxygen... from tire.<eos> And you're surrounded by nothing but heat bubbles of methane. That's your fuel.<eos> The flare on the dash!<eos> Use that for fire!<eos> But once you light it, get out as quick as you can!
- what are you doing here?<eos> Mom and dad didn't say you were picking me up.<eos> You're pathetic. [indistinct chatter]<eos> - my mom was at the plant and said that there was some kind of explosion.<eos> - did she say what caused it?
Thank you.<eos> Tandy, this is very fun, but I'm worried that people are getting a little urinated off about the power going out.<eos> Relax, Care Bear.<eos> We probably just blew a fuse from overconsumption.<eos> But the main reason we made this our home is because of the power, and if we don't get it back, I'm worried people are gonna start to doubt this place.
The cops linked the crime scene to the serial killer from the same time period. We think there's, like, a pattern.<eos> Tony's story from the party?<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, yeah, you guys are both crazy.<eos> The thing I saw in my house was the same thing that I saw in the crash from Camilla, and Gabe saw it, too, but we're both crazy, right, 'cause none of you saw anything?
I really hope this is some sort of denial, because even you can't possibly be this dense.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jeez.<eos> I saw it, too, Rob, the thing Heather was talking about in the car.<eos> I don't know what it was, but I saw it.
He's not answering.<eos> That old man, that doctor, he figured it out.<eos> He what?<eos> Those lights, the light setup, we can kill this thing.<eos> The light kills it.
Didn't want anyone figuring out his special recipe.<eos> Right. You mean he made that food himself?<eos> Last night.<eos> He'd usually make a batch after we'd close.<eos> Store it in the prep fridge.
He's having a walk while we sublet his terrarium.<eos> I-Is that...<eos> Oxyuranuss cutellatus.<eos> Yes, the very same coastal taipan from Brian Beale's apartment.<eos> The venom from that snake killed eight people, including the last person who kept it as a pet.
I-Is that...<eos> Oxyuranuss cutellatus.<eos> Yes, the very same coastal taipan from Brian Beale's apartment.<eos> The venom from that snake killed eight people, including the last person who kept it as a pet.<eos> I thought that Animal Control was impounding it.
I lost visual.<eos> I see him, but he's no longer wearing the jacket.<eos> Which is probably where he kept that pouch of goodies.<eos> Where did he leave it?<eos> Anyone have eyes on it?
So once again I find myself locked in a room.<eos> But this time it isn't a game.<eos> This time, lives are at stake, and not just mine.<eos> No windows, no air vents, and no way out other than a heavily reinforced door.<eos> And the magnetic lock keeping it shut is designed to withstand a battering ram.
They don't get to make this decision.<eos> There is nothing wrong with this program,<eos> - and it is totally disrespectful to you.<eos> - Maggie...<eos> And if they want a fight, they can have it.
The guy is M.I.A.<eos> They said Medina had blood on his hands.<eos> Stopped in the back office on his way out.<eos> Hey, door's locked.<eos> When the owner gets here, we'll have him open it.
Oh, I want to know.<eos> I actually do want to know very much.<eos> It started so innocent.<eos> I was sitting here, I was working.<eos> He was there, and he comes over my desk, and he knocks on it like this, and says,
Yeah.<eos> And after that, you went back inside?<eos> I called 911.<eos> Then this couple walked into the store, and I saw the weapon.<eos> You found it?
Mr. Burns, being a room parent is a full-time job.<eos> No.<eos> No, my full-time job is my full-time job.<eos> I have three construction projects going on right now.<eos> Why don't you take all this negative energy, and put it into making puppets.
- No.<eos> Our agreement is off, and you can take your dog and pony show<eos> - to some other news producer.<eos> - Julia...<eos> I say the show always comes first, but there is a line, and last night I crossed it.
She sells medical grade liquid silicone at a great price.<eos> Medical grade silicone... For prosthetics?<eos> You know how no one saw your hit man's face because he was wearing that dope ass George Washington mask?<eos> Who you think made the mask?<eos> If y'all ever find it, I'm gonna want it back, by the way.
- _ - he was making a movie,<eos> - _ - and said he needed an aerial shot to sell the scope of the scene.<eos> - _<eos> - So,<eos> - _ - we took his dad's video camera and hooked it up to a homemade hot air balloon, sent it into the sky.
You know, if you didn't approve of the op, then why did you agree to it?<eos> Who's calling the shots here?<eos> Is it you or is it Weller?<eos> Look, Assistant Director Weller and I trust each other.<eos> He made a very good case as to why we should do the mission, and that's why we did it.
Reade, and Zapata.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> They won the auction.<eos> Nas used the money from Lynn Burton's offshore account, 20 million in total, although that's just the first half.<eos> Marconi will be expecting the second half as soon as they get there, and they do not have it, so they're gonna need some serious backup.
But one thing we learn on the farm Is that death is a part of life.<eos> If you tell joe what happened to that goat, Death is gonna be part of your life.<eos> You know what, kids can handle a lot more than you think.<eos> And every step, from birth till the end, Has its own magical beauty.<eos> So, do we jam the goat in the garbage Or heave it over the fence?
Do you guys ever wonder how stories like that get out?<eos> Like if that happened to me, I would never talk about it.<eos> Yeah I've always wondered about that, especially when everyone has died at the end.<eos> How does anyone know what really happened?<eos> I heard about this really strange story out in the countryside, my professor told me about it once and I thought he was full of shit.
What's this about?<eos> Do you own a dark blue truck, white camper shell?<eos> I do.<eos> Where... where is this truck right now?<eos> I keep it at my summer cabin up in the Catskills, but haven't been up there in over two years.
I do.<eos> Where... where is this truck right now?<eos> I keep it at my summer cabin up in the Catskills, but haven't been up there in over two years.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Anyone have access to this cabin or use it when you're not there?
My late husband loved smoking in the main lodge.<eos> Is that whose cologne you made me put on?<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Boxes, right?<eos> I've got a petition here.<eos> Why don't you read it quick?
So, uh, what exactly did Dana say on the phone?<eos> She owns this house, she rents it to her daughter and three of her friends.
What about you, Father Tomas, uh,<eos> - you gonna take a break?<eos> - No, no, no. This... ordeal has clarified some things for me.<eos> Renewed my commitment.<eos> Uh, my parish needs me, and... I've neglected it.
Did you know that?<eos> We were loyal and perfect in every way. And do you know what God did?<eos> God got bored.<eos> He got bored with our perfection.<eos> So He created Man, mortal and ugly, and... and then He built them a sandbox, and He filled it with tangible and sensual delights.
My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?<eos> Uh, license and registration, please.<eos> I had a great time last night, you know?<eos> And thank you for taking that cake off my hands.<eos> I would have eaten it for breakfast.
Jack made my life hell while I was working with him.<eos> The way he looked at me, the-the things he would say.<eos> I wanted to make sure that he could never do that to anyone again.<eos> I was going up against a company, they had deep pockets, I needed help.<eos> If you think that he was really set up by somebody who could profit from that lawsuit, you should talk to the people that actually paid for it.
But I'm telling you, I never would have hurt him.<eos> Never.<eos> Not for all the money in the world.<eos> How'd it go at the library?<eos> Yes, well, it turns out I took out their copy of the Codex Seraphinianus in 2011 and never returned it.
Really?<eos> 'Cause it says we're going to the offices of Muñoz, Sherman, and Lane.<eos> So, here's how it might go down.<eos> Reptilians are very charming, so they might greet you warmly.<eos> If they offer you a beverage, don't take it.
'Cause it says we're going to the offices of Muñoz, Sherman, and Lane.<eos> So, here's how it might go down.<eos> Reptilians are very charming, so they might greet you warmly.<eos> If they offer you a beverage, don't take it.<eos> I mean, actually do take it, but do not drink it.
Whoa.<eos> Really putting down roots.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, maybe I'll start using the pool.<eos> We're draining it tomorrow.
You look like something's bothering you. Oh, uh, yeah.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I had a bit of a breakthrough.<eos> I put butter on my toast this morning.<eos> I did not eat it, but I was okay being around it.
So, why should these spikes be hung with corpses?<eos> What kind of creature could be responsible for creating such a gruesome scene?<eos> There's a mysterious killer at work in this desert.<eos> It's a butcherbird.<eos> This little songbird uses the spines as a butcher uses his hook... to hold its prey as it dismembers it.
For a beetle no larger than a thumbnail, this is the equivalent of us climbing a dune twice the height of Everest.<eos> But even more impressive is what it does next.<eos> Standing perfectly still, facing into the wind, the beetle does a headstand.<eos> Fog begins to condense on its body.<eos> Microscopic bumps on its wing cases direct the water to grooves that channel it towards the mouth.
You ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> That's good.<eos> I got it into the courtyard.
If he was alive then, they'll nail them for manslaughter.<eos> But there's no way to tell which one did it.<eos> I've got 10 minutes. I have to relieve my mom and get my son.<eos> Prosecutor, see this rock?<eos> I think the biker hit it and veered into the other lane in front of the truck.
What the fuck's wrong with him? !<eos> He doesn't feel good.<eos> What's this?<eos> He'll lick and heal it.<eos> If somebody cut off your hand would you just lick it?
What's this?<eos> He'll lick and heal it.<eos> If somebody cut off your hand would you just lick it?<eos> I also had a broken leg.<eos> Did you see a doctor or just lick it yourself?
- Yeah.<eos> - Nah, that's crazy.<eos> - Look, i can't believe you memorized That whole, huge binder.<eos> - Oh, i didn't.<eos> I brought it with me And hid it out on the stoop.
But we're not really gonna attack them, so they're just racking up a lot of frequent mariner miles?<eos> I wish it was that simple.<eos> A few hours before the fake attack order was leaked, someone hacked the NSA and downloaded 200 gigs of data.<eos> We don't even know what exactly was taken.<eos> But you think someone stole a cyber weapon and is now using it to start a war?
Makes perfect sense.<eos> Even after everything we've been through, you still don't trust me enough to want me around.<eos> I don't trust you?<eos> Riley, we wouldn't be in this mess if you'd have trusted me enough<eos> - to ask for help when you needed it.
Moving on.<eos> So, I examined Captain Green's computer.<eos> He had an account with a ridesharing service called homestretch.<eos> But they have no record of a pickup request the night of the murder. Well, someone picked him up.<eos> Yeah, it looks like his account was infected with a worm that intercepted the request and then sent it to a third party.
They clearly show he was nowhere near a computer during the time when classified data was stolen.<eos> He was set up. By who?<eos> Someone that got ahold of his password, logged in remotely.<eos> Even the Crimean bank account...<eos> It's a setup. It's in Green's name, but he didn't open it.
So Logan was the nephew of the man my mother knew as Balthazar Kilmeany?<eos> Her last Christmas, she thought she saw her fiancé at the theater. Well, there's a resemblance.<eos> My mother did love The Nutcracker.<eos> He apparently came from a family of con men.<eos> The Balthazar identity was like a family heirloom passed down to anyone who needed it.
Father made him to teach him what a real job felt like, as if admissions tutor is a real job.<eos> Come on, must we?<eos> No, we mustn't.<eos> But I love this story, so shut up.<eos> Dear, you act like I haven't already heard it 12 times.
Why?<eos> These are two killers.<eos> What are we waitin' for?<eos> Agent Christopher said that we... we need to figure out what the key is for.<eos> But we don't know where they got it, who they got it from, or what the key opens.
Oh, God.<eos> That must have been something.<eos> Well, I got down on a knee.<eos> I pulled the ring box out.<eos> Only thing was, I opened it up upside down.
Hi.<eos> Suddenly I feel under dressed.<eos> "Suddenly"?<eos> Where'd you get the tiara?<eos> Jill gave it to me.
That's of little consequence.<eos> Not only do we have an abundance of forensic evidence...<eos> We also have a written statement by the suspect that reads...<eos> And I quote... "I want to kill Johnny."<eos> It's rare to get an admission in writing, but there you have it.
Oh, just curious. What movie were you guys seeing?<eos> "Jingle All the Way."<eos> Hold on.<eos> Do not blow a chance to see this movie.<eos> I've seen it three times.
But the grain shortage?<eos> Now that was a calculated act.<eos> You'd have me believe Cleander wanted my people to starve?<eos> I'd never presume to know the mind of any man, but I do know that this grain shortage was no natural occurrence.<eos> How do you explain it, Cleander?
So it's only because I stand before you a freedman that you are not bringing your sword down upon me?<eos> With only my dulled blade to protect myself?<eos> My friend?<eos> Pick it up.<eos> -I said pick it up. -I'm sorry.
Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine... I'm not good with sizes... and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now. That's a great theory!<eos> Whoa. But the bag is missing, so...<eos> Hey, how big of a deal is it if I, um, if I never find it?
No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing. - Mm.<eos> - Why are you helping this guy, sir? He's the opposite of everything you stand for.<eos> His favorite expression is "that's gonna leave a mark."<eos> And he doesn't even use it right.
♪ You have the right to remain silent ♪<eos> - ♪ Come on and party tonight ♪ - ♪ Party tonight ♪<eos> The guy's got good hooks. I mean, right?<eos> Wait, who's this guy?<eos> Flaco must've sent someone to get the backpack, and they just waltzed right in and took it out of the precinct.
- He failed his<eos> - lieutenant's exam.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Let's just say my little birds are everywhere collecting whispers.<eos> He left the letter on his desk, and I read it.
Why can't there be four wheels?<eos> Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?<eos> Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.
My name is Holder.<eos> I was wondering if I might leave something with you.<eos> Sherlock's not really big on hats, so I'm not sure he's gonna want a crown.<eos> It's a coronet, technically.<eos> Holmes calls it my "beryl coronet."
Girls, you know that Christmas is an international arms dealer's busiest time.<eos> It'd take a miracle to get him here now.<eos> There is one more thing we could do.<eos> Release a song online called Daddy, Come Home For Christmas.<eos> I've already written it.
I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off!<eos> I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents.<eos> That was a big milestone for me.<eos> Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard.<eos> You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.
Hey, Scott.<eos> It's fun, right?<eos> I-I love hockey.<eos> And your shirt, it's great.<eos> - Where'd you get it?
There's a personal angle.<eos> You knew the victim?<eos> It was the description of one of the men that ran that caught my attention.<eos> African-American, approximately six foot tall, shaved head, beard, last seen wearing a green army jacket.<eos> When I got here, C.S.U. were photographing a necklace that caught on that fence as he climbed over it.
Perhaps he's worried the police might use it to locate him.<eos> Or he forgot it.<eos> He also forgot to close those drawers, as one might do from when they're packing in a hurry.<eos> His toolbox is gone.<eos> I gave it to him as a housewarming gift.
Tell them where you are.<eos> Tell them you want to talk about what happened last night.<eos> Call them, or I will.<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> If you don't believe it, just press "send."
Yeah, the police showed up right after we did.<eos> But we ran.<eos> Which one of you threw the gun?<eos> Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.
Which one of you threw the gun?<eos> Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.<eos> He said If I was gonna roll with SBK, I had to be strapped up.<eos> So I took it to Whitlock, and I told him I didn't want it.
Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.<eos> He said If I was gonna roll with SBK, I had to be strapped up.<eos> So I took it to Whitlock, and I told him I didn't want it.<eos> He said it would be too suspicious if I didn't keep it.
This is part of their investigation.<eos> You're not even really police.<eos> True, but I'm not asking as a police consultant.<eos> I'm asking because I am Dr. Joan Watson.<eos> Which means I either wrote the prescription, in which case I know everything that's on it, or I didn't write it, in which case the DEA could decide to penalize you for filling it.
And we'll all just agree that you've suffered enough.<eos> It was a silver Lexus.<eos> It just pulled out of a parking lot and up to a light;<eos> there was a guy and a girl in the car.<eos> I pulled the driver's door open, I shouted for them to get out, but then the guy yanked it closed again.
Okay, the stress on her, the time and effort to take care of Ethan, I could have never done that.<eos> And I could never have hurt her.<eos> So where's the gun now?<eos> In the garage at the house.<eos> I stashed it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked me and Janine.
And I could never have hurt her.<eos> So where's the gun now?<eos> In the garage at the house.<eos> I stashed it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked me and Janine.<eos> I haven't seen it since.
Hard for me to imagine I missed a gun.<eos> Well, you must have.<eos> Either that, or...<eos> What?<eos> Or someone took it.
It still doesn't feel real.<eos> But she'd want me to keep going.<eos> Ethan, I'm here because my colleagues are with your father at his apartment.<eos> The gun that was used to kill your mother and Dr. Krieg is registered under his name.<eos> The police are searching for it right now.
You know that I'm a big fan of arts and crafts.<eos> Well, a while back, I got an idea for a project, which now, in hindsight, might have been morally questionable.<eos> Or as the cop said, "despicable."<eos> Oh, just get to it.<eos> I made a copy of your handicap parking placard and laminated it so it'd look official.
This was a daring and difficult escape, but despite all the planning, he was soon re-apprehended.<eos> That leaves our last two stories, Balloon Escape and Oflag.<eos> And both those escapes get a 10 out of 10 for degree of difficulty.<eos> Secretly designing and building a hot air balloon under such conditions is an incredible feat.<eos> And so is coordinating an elaborate escape from a POW camp while filming it!
A little bit of both.<eos> He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.<eos> Putting a pigeon in a bomb is definitely nuts, not to mention immoral.<eos> But in theory, it might have worked.<eos> One pigeon pecks the ball as it comes toward him and knocks it toward the other.
Be right back.<eos> But it's not nature calling.<eos> Inside a cubicle, an accomplice with a laptop is waiting.<eos> Player one palms off the camera, then returns to the table.<eos> Meanwhile, back in the stall, the computer guy runs special software that analyzes the footage... and turns it into a cheat sheet.
Al Capone?<eos> You have to be brave to con Al Capone.<eos> All right, well, how much money did this Eiffel Tower job give him?<eos> In today's money, he sold the tower for a million dollars.<eos> Just the first time he sold it. Okay.
There's a lot of sophisticated technology that goes into it.<eos> The ink has to survive being vaporized, fired at 30 miles per hour through a nozzle a third the size of a human hair, at 300 degrees.<eos> Three hundred degrees.<eos> Now, that gives me an idea.<eos> Instead of filling this printer with ink, why not inject it with three ink-dyed accelerants?
All right.<eos> So, you're now flying around.<eos> Awesome.<eos> This guy's looking for the wireless signal between the drone and your iPad.<eos> And it's found it.
But a master predator is on the prowl.<eos> The creature's mortal enemy.<eos> Armed with a sticky web, she tempts it closer.<eos> Stunned and ensnared, the creature is helpless.<eos> She will take it back to her nest... and put it in the bin.
AC/DC.<eos> Metal, baby!<eos> Now, Cahill's dream was to create an electronic music machine capable of mimicking the sound of an entire orchestra with sufficient resonance to be played over a small telephone speaker and fill a room with sound.<eos> So, he started experimenting with cogs and magnets.<eos> If you take a cog wheel like this sprocket right here with all these teeth, and you spin it... and you take an electrical pickup, and you bring it close to it... you'll get... a tone.
You still sing?<eos> Yeah, I still sing.<eos> Do you still sing?<eos> You loved that song.<eos> I hated it so much.
What you take me for, girl?<eos> What do I do that seems to get under your skin?<eos> I want what's best for Star and Simone.<eos> What's best for them is the music we're making.<eos> Have you listened to it?
Save Jim!<eos> - He cannot. This is Jim's fight.<eos> Rule number three.<eos> What?<eos> By Deya's grace, he found it!
Put... the... kitten... down.<eos> - You're a real killjoy.<eos> That is not Enrique!<eos> For the glory of Merlin, daylight is mine to command.<eos> Do you realize how good you boys have it here?
What do you mean, he's in the Void?<eos> The Void sounds like a very empty word. - A bad word.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And are these happy ghosts we're talking about here, or soul-sucking poltergeists?<eos> They will not suck his soul. They will merely peer into it.
I don't got it! I don't got it! I don't got it, I don't got it, I...<eos> Ooh, everything hurts.<eos> So, what's in the box?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We're not gonna open it.
But aren't you curious, though?<eos> There could be, like, a tiny creature in there that can't breathe, Jimbo!<eos> Or an itty-bitty troll king whose little kingdom needs saving!<eos> Oh! Or my soulmate!<eos> Guys, it doesn't matter, because, at lunch, I'm taking it straight to the post office.
From a trilogy of sorts? Some might say of the Triumbric variety?<eos> That's not how you speak to a queen.<eos> Their informality is amusing.<eos> No, Trollhunter.<eos> We do not have it.
Gunmar betrayed him in hopes of taking his army as his own.<eos> The battle lasted weeks.<eos> Gunmar lost an eye. Orlagk lost his head.<eos> I fear this may be the most difficult Triumbric stone to find.<eos> For if his dark servants worked so hard to steal it from the Krubera, they would not hand it over so easily.
- No! No!<eos> - What? Is it my breath?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I know why he ran off with my purse!<eos> He has it!
Should we watch something downstairs?<eos> -In the game room?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> What's the game room?<eos> Oh, you haven't seen it yet?
-In the game room?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> What's the game room?<eos> Oh, you haven't seen it yet?<eos> -You haven't seen it?
The game room?<eos> You'll see.<eos> What do you think?<eos> -You'll see.<eos> -I'll know when I see it?
-Did you eat already?<eos> -Just a bit.<eos> Do you want some good meat?<eos> I'll pass even though I wanna eat.<eos> -But will he be upset if we use it all?
The night before last, we thought we'd have it for dinner.<eos> We didn't have any main dish besides rice.<eos> But we had the meat, so we decided to eat it.<eos> -Uchi's meat? -Uchi's meat.<eos> So the three of us cooked and ate it.
She was always trying to get us to have a three-way with Jay Mclnerney.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, I got serious about my career, but for Annabelle, the party never stopped.<eos> I've tried to get her into rehab.<eos> There is only so much you can do for people who need help, but won't get it.
Good luck, David.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you get the tablet art for the Happy Vegan Cookbook?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'll forward it to you.
Yeah.<eos> It's all yours, big guy.<eos> What happened to the door?<eos> Oh, we... we broke it wrestling.<eos> We're using it as a table.
- Hello?<eos> - Liza.<eos> I'm at Monkey Bar, and I left my wallet on my desk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I need you to bring it to me.
So we've got a little problem on our hands.<eos> We do?<eos> Cheryl Sussman doesn't think her $2,000 sweater is dry cleanable. Oh.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll pay for it.
Nelson?<eos> She knew the book then.<eos> And bought Suzie Colebrook's artwork.<eos> Every artist has a dealer.<eos> Find out which gallery sold it.
I didn't want to lose him again.<eos> Did your father say where he'd been for the last three years?<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> The dagger.<eos> I turned him over and pulled it out.
- Morning, Pol.<eos> - You!<eos> You've been dumping your rubbish in my bin!<eos> I don't want your rubbish, mate!<eos> You keep it in your own bin, and if you don't have no room in your own bin, you'll keep it in your fucking house!
If I go bowling and I throw a strike, one thing happened.<eos> Ten things didn't happen.<eos> Jim, my guys aren't bowling pins, as much as your guy may have treated them as such.<eos> If... let me finish. Let me finish.<eos> If your house is insured for $100,000 and a tornado carries it away, it carried away one house.
Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart.<eos> There are gangs, and rule of law is less firmly established over there.<eos> And definitely stay away from the Wall.<eos> On their side, there's a line cleared of buildings along the Wall.<eos> They call it the "Death Line." Cross it and you'll be shot.
You can just use the FLOTUS window.<eos> Looks right down onto the Oval Office.<eos> - You can?<eos> - Sure.<eos> A lot of anxious First Ladies use it.
Hey, I need a shirt.<eos> This isn't "Die Hard."<eos> Hey, sugar tits, did you stroke and choke the rules committee?<eos> Oh, yeah, absolutely.<eos> Egan dropped the ball a little bit, but I picked it up.
- Selina Meyer is yesterday's news as far as I'm concerned.<eos> Good, because I have a big GMJ client I need tied up and I think your West Wing access should bring him right in. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> We can trap and truss him, right, Ames?<eos> Yeah, if people want access to that backstabbing madhouse, then I think we're the ones to get it for him.<eos> Maybe you can refer to it as the White House since some of our clients actually still like and respect that place.
Band of Horses.<eos> I just wanna say thank you for supporting the men's health campaign and letting me tell guys that they should feel themselves up.<eos> Easiest job I ever had.<eos> You guys remember my... You guys remember my catchphrase, right?<eos> Remember it?
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.<eos> And before she died at the age of 89, she told me a secret that she kept for almost 50 years.<eos> The story concerns...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James.<eos> How about it?
He put his balls on the table?<eos> - Right on the table.<eos> - On purpose? I don't see how it could be by accident.<eos> Richard, I just got an email from the guys at Midland-Oak.<eos> Apparently, there is a line, and I crossed it...
No, it was not pink.<eos> But it was plastered with "my little pony" stickers and glitter...<eos> So much glitter.<eos> It was really bad.<eos> I kind of got used to it, actually, but then my dad took it away and gave me a boys' bike instead.
And it will take time... To make him understand in a way that doesn't wreck him.<eos> That will take time, - but I will do it. - I know.<eos> I'm not asking you to... Well, you don't need to, Patrick.<eos> You don't need to ask me. Because that life you are building for us? I am too.<eos> I'm not losing it.
I thought the party was inside.<eos> I just came to get the karaoke sign-up sheet.<eos> - Seen it?<eos> - Yeah, I've got that.<eos> I will, uh, I'll just unfold it.
We're just not built for it.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, Karen posted another photo.<eos> Sending it to you right now.
No way. Are you kidding me?<eos> We should have just done this the first time.<eos> I know you thought about it.<eos> It's the perfect fit.<eos> You get my infrastructure, I get your speed, and I get it today rather than in a month or two.
Yeah, we can get them in Sierra Vista.<eos> I'm gonna need more cash, though.<eos> Here's a beer.<eos> Come on, this is warm, you bastard! What?<eos> Don't drink it, you little prick.
For fuck's sake, is that my gun?<eos> I mean, it's bad enough I get jacked by the local neighborhood watch, but now you're gonna point my own fucking pistol at me?<eos> Being that it's yours, we certainly don't have to remind you that it's loaded.<eos> Can you bring it closer?<eos> Yeah sure, you wanna hold it, too?
I was the last in.<eos> We sat at the table in candlelight and we held hands.<eos> The candle went out and then the bell rang.<eos> The bell on the side table?<eos> The spirits use it to communicate with us.
But first, we've got a murder to solve. There we go. What's that?<eos> That is the ghost of Mama Beth.<eos> So, what have you got?<eos> Well, Elias Thomson owned a food distribution company back in the UK.<eos> But once he'd made his fortune, he got bored, he sold it, came out here, met his wife and bought the rum distillery.
They say it can sense thermal radiation. Like snakes.<eos> I thought there were two of them.<eos> There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.<eos> Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.
Extinct animals have no rights.<eos> They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We're sitting on a goldmine.<eos> And Masrani is using it to stock a petting zoo.
- I could've washed the windows.<eos> Where's the carpet?<eos> - The what?<eos> The carpet.<eos> I put it away so that the kids won't make a mess on it.
Where's the carpet?<eos> - The what?<eos> The carpet.<eos> I put it away so that the kids won't make a mess on it.<eos> I bought it for the party.
If you have time later, I could show you around.<eos> I mean, show you around the hotel.<eos> We have a new suite named Inari.<eos> I didn't name it Inari because I'm obsessed with you.<eos> I named it after Inari, the municipality.
You still haven't found that bastard?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you checked the station?<eos> I searched everywhere he could have gone to?<eos> Hey, he probably took his pay and is spending it all on booze.
It's in Assemblyman Seo's hands already.<eos> There's no point in tracking down Boss Kang.<eos> You fucking piece of shit!<eos> Call Youngdeung, and tell them to bring Chairman Hur's deed.<eos> They'll bring it if they want to save one of their own.
"Where could it be?"<eos> "Outside it began to snow and an icy wind blew."<eos> That happened to me and Peter once.<eos> We lost a goat.<eos> Did you find it again?
I can't continue this charade anymore.<eos> - I don't want you to either.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you have a match?<eos> So I'm not saying you need plastic surgery, I'm just saying if you wanted it, I would pay for it.
You might not know it now, but it's out there, waiting to be found.<eos> Wanting to be found.<eos> It's almost always simple.<eos> So simple, it's almost silly.<eos> And when you find it, well, there's no feeling like it in the world.
Your turn, Einstein, saddest thing ever.<eos> Well, there was a scientist who lived 300 years ago who wanted to figure out how much the earth weighed.<eos> And he theorized a series of measurements that could be taken using pendulums, weights, and counterweights.<eos> He spent years building his ingenious contraption and then he died.<eos> He knew exactly how to get the answer, but he never got to know it.
Shut up!<eos> Or I'll pour it out!<eos> Okay, fine, okay,<eos> I will put the gun away. But I get to choose the next song.<eos> I want to hear silent night and I want Mandy to play it.
- But they are into all that God shit, right?<eos> They'll be sweet, they'll just pray themselves to safety.<eos> - No, no, urn...<eos> No, they were at home when we played the song.<eos> Fuck. Look, they definitely would've heard it, okay?
# She'll do crazy things, yeah-eh<eos> # On lonely occasions... #<eos> "Dear Peter, well, I'm home now.<eos> "I have your picture on the desk where I do my homework<eos> "and everyone in the family has seen it at least three times.
# You're playing with me... #<eos> "David, honey. Daddy, listen. I kicked, man, 4 months ago.<eos> I'm on the road rockin' with a new group so I got Janis back.<eos> She's delightfully crazy but I love her, man.<eos> I've got that picture of us in Salvador and every time I look at it, I look like a woman.
I'm all for curiosity but-- i-i just feel like something saved me, shook me and woke me up.<eos> And that someone is god?<eos> Mike, he didn't save you because you were never dying.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."

Areyouokay?<eos> Michael? I have to go.<eos> Wait,whydidyou callme, Michael?<eos> To my friends who are trapped in homosexuality: I wanna thank you for your kind comments and keen observations regarding my story and my revelation that i am no longer homosexual and am now heterosexual.<eos> The gay identity has been packaged and fed to you, and if you identify as gay then you have eaten it, preventing you from further growth and understanding of your true self.
I got a guy.<eos> You are a guy.<eos> Suck my dick.<eos> He's comin' up the tunnel on Wednesday.<eos> He's gonna sell it for us.
It's so pretty.<eos> I like looking at it.<eos> Yeah, well, say goodbye, 'cause come Wednesday, that shit is going down the tunnel and out into the world for sale... like a Romanian baby.<eos> This shit is happenin'.<eos> I take this ball of blue energy... and I pass it to you.

What's Russian Roulette?<eos> - Just explain it.<eos> - All right, fine.<eos> Okay, so, you take a bullet.<eos> Take a bullet and you put it in the chamber.
A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.<eos> I'd have been fine if that little game of Russian Roulette ended it.<eos> But since I planned and executed the elimination of Judge Spangler, my life had taken a new turn.<eos> I understood why people loved life and saw it as something joyous to experience.
No, we're fine, babe.<eos> I mean, you should do whatever makes you happy.<eos> If we had more money I could buy a little happiness.<eos> Oh, we had an American start at work today.<eos> She took a group photo of us and posted it online.
Well... a friend.<eos> - What bulb did you get in the end?<eos> - The 15.<eos> Tell me what the light's like.<eos> - I will, when I see it in the dark. - Of course.
No, no way.<eos> Just your obsession with turning the lamps on and off.<eos> - It's an obsession that works.<eos> Where'd you read that list?<eos> I didn't read it.
William Popely tells me I might find a use for you.<eos> A man of many talents, he says.<eos> A remarkable memory?<eos> There's a technique, My Lord.<eos> I learnt it in Italy.
He's always had a greed for ruling over other men.<eos> The Cardinal's a public man.<eos> Would you have him shrink from a public role?<eos> Well, I think it's a little late to read the Cardinal a lesson in humility.<eos> His real friends have read it long ago and been ignored.
She's known what she's wanted all along.<eos> The soul in question did confess though in guarded terms in Rome in Holy Year, though I'm not sure the priest understood English.<eos> Do I look like a joy rider?<eos> My child, you have already been given absolution for this particular sin.<eos> I have given you it myself on several occasions.
Where's the key?<eos> - What key?<eos> - The car key.<eos> I put it down.<eos> Well, I haven't got it.
- No.<eos> I read a good review the other day.<eos> - I was told they were all good.<eos> - They are, I'm sure.<eos> We enjoyed it.
I've had bigger flowers than these.<eos> And with ribbons on.<eos> These don't compare.<eos> Music.<eos> How are people supposed to avoid it?
And with ribbons on.<eos> These don't compare.<eos> Music.<eos> How are people supposed to avoid it?<eos> You see, I had it at my fingertips.
These don't compare.<eos> Music.<eos> How are people supposed to avoid it?<eos> You see, I had it at my fingertips.<eos> I had it in my bones.
So... remember that box of things I asked you to hold onto for me before I left for Afghanistan?<eos> Your mom's stuff?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Yeah. C-Can I see it?<eos> Of course. Uh... if I can remember where I put it.
[Sighs] Not so great.<eos> I'm just gonna throw myself into my work and try not to think about the fact that my parents are getting a divorce.<eos> Geez. Even saying the word, I'm getting a little lightheaded and...<eos> No... okay, okay, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, then don't say it, all right?
I'm all in.<eos> So am I.<eos> Oh, wait, what is that?<eos> The bet's $200.<eos> That old watch gonna cover it?
'Cause I'm thinking fire, huh?<eos> We burn the joint down, I bet it don't move around much.<eos> My friends are still in here somewhere!<eos> And so is yours!<eos> We can't just burn it down!
I'm so sorry.<eos> Is it my fault?<eos> That's what we're trying to find out. How did you get that?<eos> Brained myself showing off in the pool, ended up in AE.<eos> Look, if I left it to burn, if it's my fault...
Well, I've ruled out that.<eos> That's as much as you're getting for now.<eos> - Glad we made the trip.<eos> - However... I found this metal plate in her skull.<eos> The scar tissue covered it, so I missed it first time round.
Uh, I wouldn't worry about that now.<eos> It's just one of many scars.<eos> Will I ever know why?<eos> The possession.<eos> What brought it on?
Shunt, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The uterus is hardening a little.<eos> Let's remove the Dardik.<eos> OK, the shunt is in and I'm passing it down the left common iliac, distal to the tear.
See how the hair falls here?<eos> And now here.<eos> Did you take a sample for tox screening?<eos> No.<eos> I just combed it through for fibres. Debris.
The Peshwa has asked for a paan (after meal delicacy).<eos> Here, it is your excuse to see him.<eos> I no longer need excuses.<eos> This dagger?<eos> The Peshwa gave it to me!
I no longer need excuses.<eos> This dagger?<eos> The Peshwa gave it to me!<eos> Dear God!<eos> And you accepted it?
Minister has a point, Peshwa.<eos> That step must be taken after much forethought.<eos> We shall discuss other matters after this evening's soirée.<eos> This sword is best left in its sheath, Peshwa.<eos> Since you won't be going to Delhi, what enemy's neck would you place it on?
Start the projection!<eos> --Are you ok?<eos> We started a mutiny!<eos> Acting is a strange job...<eos> I sit here... It mixes with real life and confounds it...
--No, get back with the kids!<eos> With the kids?<eos> --Yes, so you'll keep 'em quiet.<eos> This is insane...<eos> I left the "dead rat" in his room... I no longer ned it.
There isn't much peace to be had these days.<eos> For anyone.<eos> Then I'm lucky to pass my days here.<eos> You still find immortality lucky?<eos> Why else would I have given it to you?
They're doing some pretty heavy duty botanical work here.<eos> Hybrid breeding, seed manipulation... they're combining traits of different plants to create entirely new variants.<eos> You mean like GMOs?<eos> They don't have the technology...<eos> They don't need it.
Mmm! - These are really good.<eos> - Same as when you were a little girl.<eos> That song you were humming yesterday...<eos> - reminds me of something.<eos> - I would sing it to you when you were scared.
- What's the project?<eos> - A world where only one field yields a crop, while the rest lie barren.<eos> Infertility?<eos> That's right.<eos> Michel has perfected it.
Search parties have been looking all night.<eos> So far they've only found 4 of the infected.<eos> The others are being hidden somewhere on the grounds.<eos> Have you seen my budding knife?<eos> - I keep it in the second drawer and it's not there.

Her?<eos> Michael discovered mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight.<eos> Only one tree survived, absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it.<eos> Later, Michael discovered a curious effect in the fruit.<eos> It made the mortal men who ate it unable to father children.
You cannot enter the hall if you don't have a tie.<eos> All right.<eos> - What is your name? - Juan.<eos> Look, Juan... that is a really nice tie.<eos> - My girlfriend gave it to me. - Really?
From leaf to paste to powder, they produced 10,000 kilos a week.<eos> At 50 grand a kilo, that's five billion dollars a year.<eos> These guys weren't fuckin' around.<eos> Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.<eos> They added it to liquor, to coffee, and just to be funny... they put it back in Coca-Cola.
- Bury the cash.<eos> And cut the bullshit.<eos> Go on, pussy.<eos> - And that's what they did.<eos> They buried it in fields... they hid it in caletas, hiding places in walls and ceilings.
- I'll take care of it.<eos> - Are you crazy or what?<eos> Stupid asshole.<eos> It's a woman with a baby.<eos> Take a picture so we can send it to the newspapers.
So what's our options, since we have none?<eos> Well, we keep her in hiding until things cool down, and get her immunity in exchange for her testimony--<eos> Are you gonna get us immunity?<eos> [softly] We are going to jail if we get caught with this woman.<eos> Well, the next time your wife decides to bring home a human hand grenade, how about she hands it to you?
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.<eos> There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.<eos> The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.<eos> They want vengeance.<eos> - And you'll help them get it?
What about the house in Cartagena?<eos> That's not happening, right?<eos> Do you want your house in Cartagena?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - OK... you will have it.
you're telling me you didn't do shit?<eos> Like I was some kind of idiot.<eos> Is this my cash or not? !<eos> No, Pablo.<eos> Did you take it and bury it in Rionegro or not? !
Oh, there's pizza in here.<eos> You want it?<eos> You want my slice?<eos> I'm fine, but thank you.<eos> Okay, well, you can have it for later then.
Wow, you smell good!<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Ok, you can talk.<eos> Did you leave the lasagna there?<eos> I left it there inside the oven, because I couldn't put it in the freezer because it was too hot.
It... it was really what first drew me to magic - er, the romance of it.<eos> The tales I heard when I was a boy.<eos> When she d...<eos> When she... when she died, I went around collecting folk-tales, writing them up.<eos> And that story Lady Pole told last night - the lighthouse keeper and his cupboard - it made me think I have heard it before.
When she... when she died, I went around collecting folk-tales, writing them up.<eos> And that story Lady Pole told last night - the lighthouse keeper and his cupboard - it made me think I have heard it before.<eos> It is much like a tale told by the fishwives of Flamborough, about a man called Bloodworth, who lit the lamp in the lighthouse during the 1500s.<eos> Is it a common story?<eos> No, and the way she told it, it's not quite the same as I have it in my book.
Your Honor, first of all, he did not throw the chair.<eos> He kicked it.<eos> It was an old chair, rickety.<eos> It was wobbling.<eos> He didn't launch it like a projectile.
You're gonna have to give me something more concrete than this.<eos> Want something concrete?<eos> How about that?<eos> - Viv... what are you doing?<eos> - That storm - I've seen it before.
Honestly, that's not ours.<eos> Yeah, who would leave weed in a wall, anyway?<eos> (Mocking) Who would leave weed in a wall?<eos> A weed genius!<eos> And she'd leave it there indefinitely, in case of emergency.
You're first, little buddy.<eos> - Now, suck it up. - (Bong bubbling)<eos> That's it.<eos> And here we go.<eos> (Ilana) Yeah, I invented this app... Well, okay, I didn't invent it yet, but soon.
Accompanied by the famous sherpa tenzing, edmund hillary climbed the summit of the world's highest mountain.<eos> When tenzing norgay reached the summit of everest, that is such an amazing moment.<eos> It's one of the most beautiful moments in climbing history.<eos> That's the moment when the word "sherpa"<eos> has the meaning of brand in the way that we understand it.
- You live?<eos> - Locked and loaded.<eos> Got something I wanna show you.<eos> What're you gonna show us with that old hunk of junk?<eos> Well, most folks look at this, call it a scope.
Th-that brown spot, that's her blood.<eos> We all went searching, but we never did find the boy's body.<eos> And the Marine?<eos> Shoot, he come home that night from the war, the whole family gone.<eos> Didn't take too long till he took a pistol, put it in his mouth, and joined them in the great beyond.
That's all you need?<eos> Just my wolf blood?<eos> That's all we need.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> If you don't give it willingly, it will be taken from you.
Why is it like this?<eos> Why isn't it any easy for me, like it is for you?<eos> The pain is the same for everyone.<eos> Morphine.<eos> I don't want it.
Ruth: I know it seems strange, but this component of the ritual has to be done alone.<eos> Whatever it takes, I'm here to help.<eos> Nick: Why are you building this all the way out here?<eos> Jeremy wanted it in the back field, closer to the house.<eos> If they need solitude, I thought this is where they'll find it.
Before we go...<eos> I have to ask you... The way that Savannah can't control her magic, is that normal?<eos> It's a powerful force.<eos> She's like a grenade with the pin pulled.<eos> You throw it in the right direction, everything's okay.
I checked his room.<eos> I found these.<eos> Survey maps.<eos> Nick: He cut out this corner.<eos> Looks like he took it with him.
Ruth made it very clear, it's dark magic.<eos> When Aleister took over his body, he destroyed Clay's soul.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't believe her.<eos> Jeremy: If there was any other option, we'd be taking it.
Super.<eos> -Yes?<eos> Hey, perhaps it's a good idea if you wait here for them while we make a quick stop at the hardware Store.<eos> And maybe you can take them to the place around the corner to have crepes.<eos> The hardware store is awful, the children hate it.
- You can't do that.<eos> Take it off.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> Just let me use it for today!<eos> No, I haven't even worn it yet.
Did I come here after ten years to drink tea with my family?<eos> You have a good bar like the Americans.<eos> Brother, wine from 1972?<eos> Are you a collector?<eos> I bought this bottle for you ten years ago, you still haven't opened it'?
[Cory] Dude, I can hardly move in this.<eos> [Ricky] You'll be happy you had it on when a rubber bullet tags you in the fucking bag, trust me.<eos> I would like to apologize, Mr. Pencock, and assure you that kids throwing bottles and trying to sell crack here in Sunnyvale Villas is not a normal occurrence.<eos> So I'd like you to bear that in mind when you're making your appraisal.<eos> I make an unbiased assessment based on what I see and give it to the client, ma'am.
It's deep, it's ambiguous.<eos> Mm.<eos> It's about...<eos> You know, it's a poem.<eos> I shot it like a fucking poem.
It's not there.<eos> You know how bad this looks?<eos> Yeah, I got a piece, but I really don't wanna have to kill nobody today.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Nevermind, I just found it.
Morning!<eos> Has somebody been moving stuff around?<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> Where is that box that was supposed to be delivered to buffalo today?<eos> Oh, the guy who ordered it came by this morning to pick it up.
I can't find it.<eos> It's right there.<eos> It's under I.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> Where the fuck do you put it?
Where the fuck do you put it?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Fuck, Emma!<eos> This is not a fucking game. Okay?<eos> If we don't find it, we will go to jail.
- Of course.<eos> You're cleaning the beach at my favorite surf spot. Ah!<eos> Your surf spot happens to be where there's a lot of trash.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> -It means that there's a lot of actual trash here, and I'm cleaning it up.
Like this one.<eos> It has rotating fins, so you can surf in any direction. Or this one.<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> It's my surfboard suitcase.<eos> So, you fold up your board, put it in your bag, and it goes up in the carry-on, then, when you land, - you're ready to surf.
How are you?<eos> How's your father?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Patterson's office keeps calling to set up that conference call.<eos> See if you can push it to next week.
Okay, put this on the furnace, all right?<eos> Cook it up good.<eos> Oh, no, he wants a turkey burger.<eos> What? Why?<eos> I don't know. I offered it to him.
Would you look at that?<eos> Aw, man, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'm gonna give you a beer on the house-- come on inside.<eos> Oh, how nice!<eos> No, I'll just take it here.
Aw, man, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'm gonna give you a beer on the house-- come on inside.<eos> Oh, how nice!<eos> No, I'll just take it here.<eos> No, actually we don't have our outdoor liquor license, so I so I got to have you drink it inside, in you go!
!<eos> He's joking!<eos> Werewolves don't exist<eos> He made the footprint himself!<eos> Bet it was your mom who made it!
What was his name?<eos> Sam.<eos> He is a great kid.<eos> What if you wrote him a letter?<eos> And hide it under my pillow?
I'm sorry. I don't feel so good.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Lots of people are sick these days.<eos> Both Mi-Chan and Sensei got it.
Mt. Fuji.<eos> Melon bread.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that gun real?<eos> Why didn't you use it back then?
I'm kicking you out.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I have a free game here.<eos> Okay, tell you what.<eos> You bring me that case of beer and put it over there, and I'll let you play your free game.
Victims four and five were foreign-exchange students that were reported missing two months ago.<eos> Add Megan and Donnie, it brings the total number of victims to seven.<eos> We'll consult with the profilers at Quantico, help expand the search, and see if there's any other consistent patterns with the other victims.<eos> What about the media?<eos> Well, we'll sit on it.
I studied criminal law on the mainland, Came to fortitude, and married a policeman.<eos> And we live on the one place on earth We're guaranteed a quiet life.<eos> Our honeymoon was a night of thrills and magic.<eos> Eric took me up onto the glacier in a tent-- Or more a bivouac, really.<eos> And the temperature fell to minus 30. We saw the most spectacular aurora borealis I'd ever seen. "the fireworks of the gods," as we called it.
And the temperature fell to minus 30. We saw the most spectacular aurora borealis I'd ever seen. "the fireworks of the gods," as we called it.<eos> You can actually hear them, you know, the northern lights, Outside the city.<eos> And now we are building a hideaway in the ice.<eos> We are building a hotel hewn into the glacier itself, Where lovers of the wilderness, lovers of the northern lights, Or just lovers<eos> I'm quite proud of that line actually, So I don't mind if you want to use it in your brochures.
Of course.<eos> You know him? Mm-hmm.<eos> Put the cake I bought for Shirley in the fridge And went to bed.<eos> How would you describe your relationship With Shirley's mother?<eos> How would I describe it?
I'm positive the postmortem is gonna show plaque And blood clots and blackening of the coronary muscle, Which is what happens<eos> The only visible injuries On Shirley were self defense wounds on her arms.<eos> That was it.<eos> And the blood on the wall Was from Dr. Allerdyce.<eos> Shirley transferred it there.
Well, listen, Dan.<eos> The drill's gone.<eos> What?<eos> Jason took the ice drill.<eos> He stole it.
He stole it.<eos> Why the hell would he do that?<eos> He's off his head.<eos> He's stolen the drill.<eos> He's driven it away.
You think Jason might have stolen it?<eos> Maybe.<eos> We won't know till Eric tracks the thing down.<eos> Well, if it's not Jason, then it's someone ruthless enough to cave a man's skull in just to steal some... stupid piece of machinery he can't even get off the island.<eos> Eric intends to make the arrest and bring the drill back to town no matter who took it.
I was raised in the faith.<eos> It was arduous for me.<eos> Have you religion?<eos> Are you offering it?<eos> - Do you require it?
Now let them move.<eos> Believe.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> You'll know.<eos> Do I turn it over?
May the angels bless the Lord Protector, Mr. Cromwell.<eos> Granted the land to me in perpetuity.<eos> Not even the high-and-mighty Sir Geoffrey can steal it off me.<eos> Long as Parliament sits, this pile of dung is mine.<eos> When you say he granted it to you...
So they got what they came for.<eos> Utterly.<eos> I know totems like these.<eos> It is the most important thing to have the flesh of the enemy.<eos> Consume it... you take their power.
And they saw me with you... and they laughed and pointed and said,<eos> "How could the likes of her be with the likes of him?"<eos> And what did you do?<eos> It was more what you did.<eos> You took my hand... and you held it.
And what did you do?<eos> It was more what you did.<eos> You took my hand... and you held it.<eos> And you looked at them.<eos> Then you raised my hand to your lips... and you held it there.
It can't make peace with it.<eos> - It's a danger to him. - Yes.<eos> Yes, the demon, the hound, the scorpion endlessly circling one another.<eos> You know Mr. Lyle won't give up.<eos> If there's any sense to be found in all this, he'll find it.
When the Devil knocks at your door, he doesn't have... cloven hooves.<eos> He is beautiful and offers you your heart's desire in whispered airs.<eos> Like a Siren, beckoning you to her ruinous shore.<eos> And what do you do, when that Siren sings?<eos> You save your soul... or you give it to her.
Tomorrow is our Super Bowl.<eos> Tomorrowiswhenwewin.<eos> So gets your fucking head in the damn game.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Throw me the ball, catch it and write it down.
It must have slipped my mind.<eos> They're not exactly easy lyrics to forget, Mrs Winning.<eos> Oh, well, I put Folk Moods out years ago.<eos> Mrs Winning, whoever killed your husband knew that ballad.<eos> Well, it's a folk classic and I'm not the only person that recorded it.
It was made from a phone box next to that cottage.<eos> So?<eos> So I was wondering if you had any idea who might have made the call.<eos> Look... that cottage was Johnny's.<eos> I only got it after he died.
Eventually I persuaded Frank to tell me.<eos> At least he talks about Johnny!<eos> You called Toby from the phone box.<eos> He said to bring the tape to his office.<eos> ~ You didn't listen to it?
You called Toby from the phone box.<eos> He said to bring the tape to his office.<eos> ~ You didn't listen to it?<eos> ~ No.<eos> He promised me he would just listen to it once and then I would have it back the next day.
~ I'd expect more with a close-range shot.<eos> But these things vary.<eos> It's such a shame what happened to him.<eos> Let's say that Winning was killed because he had the master tape.<eos> Presumably, the killer would have taken it from his house.
I wasn't there till Christmas '53.<eos> I was home by then.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> No, I got one. Tell you one thing about Korea.<eos> They can keep it.
And it'd be super fun to work with you.<eos> I mean, I have to talk to my boyfriend about it first, but...<eos> Yeah, of course!<eos> This is all perfect, and everything's worked out just as I'd hoped.<eos> [Chuckles] Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, huh?
No.<eos> So, how does this qualify as an emergency?<eos> The mother was gouched out, insensible.<eos> There was a dirty sharp within the boy's reach.<eos> I mean, how he didn't get hold of it....
I made a list of everything that I know you like.<eos> Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc.<eos> And then, I lost the list.<eos> So, I had to make a new list.<eos> I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg.
Death is natural, Andrew.<eos> We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Before I die, I'm freezing my head like Ted Williams.<eos> Wait a thousand years, thaw it out, slap it on a robot, Keep on ballin'.
Woo-hoo!<eos> I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.<eos> You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such.
I'm getting out of here once and for all.<eos> No, Ron!<eos> God, no!<eos> That alarm is just for sprinklers.<eos> April kept pulling it. So the fire department disconnected it.
We are hella chill.<eos> And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz.<eos> Well, we kind of do.<eos> I mean, the internet is no longer optional, it's a necessity for everyone.<eos> And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement.
I didn't love the first Harry Potter movie.<eos> The book was so much better.<eos> Nerd alert!<eos> A book could never be better than a movie.<eos> If you wanna tell me a story, act it out with beautiful people while I'm eating popcorn.
Just read the book.<eos> And then we can celebrate by watching the movie.<eos> - There's a movie?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Travis has it on DVD.
What is this?<eos> - My future! - Huh?<eos> Not so--<eos> Man, it just sat in the parking lot with a for-sale sign all month.<eos> I'm so lucky no one grabbed it before me.
I can't step in now and crush his dreams, but just do me a favor.<eos> The next time you two are getting so excited about this genius plan, I want you to take a step back, take off the mom goggles, and take another look, 'cause I think you're gonna be really surprised at what you see.<eos> Roger Frank screwed you, and we're gonna screw Roger Frank.<eos> Here's the plan.<eos> We need the key to Roger's office, but the only time he lets it out of his sight is at his weekly massage.
- Trav, stop.<eos> This idea... It's terrible.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Welovethisidea.<eos> No, you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it, too.
Wow. Jelly, you look ridiculous.<eos> Is this a gift for me?<eos> I love it.<eos> No, it was a gift for me from my Uncle Doug, whose passion for fine women's clothing made him an expert tailor-- and also ruined his marriage.<eos> Jules, my giant thing of sprinkles is missing from my shop again. Did you take it?
You're lucky we're friends, or I would've just killed you.<eos> Ok. Remember our friendship when I tell you why I'm here.<eos> Finn sent me to get your blood.<eos> Why would Finn want my blood?<eos> I assume he needs it for a locator spell to find your daughter.
No.<eos> You haven't, but by all means, brother, prove yourself.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Finn wants your blood.<eos> He promised to heal me if I delivered it.
It's not too late.<eos> Finn wants your blood.<eos> He promised to heal me if I delivered it.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> You've got to tell me why he wants it.
Tell him.<eos> Have your wedding.<eos> Save your wolves, but you mark my words.<eos> If you ever betray her, I will find you, and I will deposit your head on the end of a spike.<eos> Perhaps I'll leave it in your grandmother's garden.
- Come on.<eos> - All right.<eos> Gimme a friggin' drink of this shit.<eos> Randy... [sigh] - I've got cups.<eos> Now you've got your mouth-juice all over it.
- Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God. What did you do?<eos> It's a long story, but the strip still works and that's what matters.<eos> I mean, it looks like somebody tried to cut it and then you found it in the garbage.
Not from the plate.<eos> It'll make the washing up easier.<eos> He's getting worse than you.<eos> Maybe if you don't make the meat so rare and bloody, It might not put him off so much.<eos> That's how I've always cooked it.
I'll go and lock up the rest of the house.<eos> We've only been here five minutes And the fridge already looks like a slaughterhouse.<eos> What's with all the boxes?<eos> I ordered extra security.<eos> I'll put it up later.
'<eos> Luke Altman.<eos> LUKE: It wasn't an attack.<eos> I didn't touch the man.<eos> I grabbed his camera and threw it on the ground.
I play basketball with the attorney general.<eos> I convinced him that you'd be... best in a Catholic-run institution.<eos> Besides, it was you who had to accept the plea of insanity to make this work.<eos> Look.<eos> I received official notice from the Vatican, and, uh, I've been instructed to pass it over to you.
Well, when you talk dirty to me like that...<eos> Yeah, I know you've been sniffing around Angie's tree.<eos> And you should know the only soggy box that interests me is mine, and all that goes in it are dicks and tampons... and sometimes other things, but only guys can put those in.<eos> Noted.<eos> Although, when you call it your soggy box, you know, it makes it really hard to resist.
Alex, it's not your fault.<eos> And they call me crazy.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We will probably never be rich... and we'll most likely live in a place that's not that big, but we'll work hard and we'll love each other and... we'll find so much happiness that we won't even know what to do with it.<eos> We'll share it with our kid.
- We're gonna go to Caputo's office...<eos> - No! ...you're gonna tell him exactly what you told me, every word, even that weird Al Gore thing.<eos> Okay, look, Luschek, you must've misunderstood me, all right?<eos> I'm fucking with you.<eos> Of course I'll sell it.
What the fuck?<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Remember when I said the heroin was stolen?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, well, I'm the one who stole it.
All right, listen.<eos> Remember when I said the heroin was stolen?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, well, I'm the one who stole it.<eos> All right, but now... Now the meth-heads have it, and we need to get it back.
Well, it's not, actually, for me or anyone around me.<eos> Didn't that shit, like, kill you?<eos> Like, didn't your heart stop?<eos> Man, it's not a rational thing, you know?<eos> But I want it out of here, I really do.
I don't cook Italian much, but what this woman does with butter...<eos> What'll I use it for, a doorstop?<eos> Hey, pity party...<eos> you need to let this shit go.<eos> You're right, the food tastes like crap, and I get 1,000 different visions of hell when I put it in my mouth, but your face is not one of them.
Hey, I don't make the rules.<eos> You take a woman's power away.<eos> Her work, her family, her currency.<eos> You leave her with one coin... the one she was born with.<eos> It may be tawdry and demeaning, but if she has to, she will spend it.
Charlie figured it out.<eos> "Worst is first."<eos> Charlie and Dee were getting blood from Frank when Charlie realized Dee was born first.<eos> Therefore, she's the rightful heir.<eos> Then I got a little bit more blood from Frank, 'cause I feel like we're probably gonna use it in the future and he was already opened up, so who gives a shit?
You know what?<eos> Announcement-<eos> - I have an announcement to make, all right? Thank you for gathering for me.<eos> I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and it's totally sweet.<eos> You guys probably want me to burn it, but I won't, all right?
Excuse us.<eos> I'm yer husband.<eos> You mustn't embarrass me in front of my family and the servants.<eos> You're doing a fine enough job of that yourself.<eos> You've a sharp tongue, Claire, but there's a time and a place for it.
Perhaps a little.<eos> She's a Fraser.<eos> Their hearts are as big and soft as their heads are thick and strong.<eos> It was Jenny who took care of me after I returned from France with a stump of wood.<eos> Jamie told me you lost it while the both of you were fighting in France.
An AMBER Alert lets the world know that a child is missing.<eos> Make this fast, folks.<eos> Andy: They've been missing for three months.<eos> Sam: Wonder what state the house is in.<eos> Uh, well, Kitchener P.D. said they left it the way they found it.
He was painting before he got here.<eos> He was stoked about finding some headboard in the garbage this morning. Well, that's weird.<eos> I talked to a guy who mentioned finding a, uh, an old bar sign this morning. Okay.<eos> Doesn't seem like the kind of neighborhood where people are just throwing out old furniture onto the street.<eos> Then that would mean that there was a van in that neighborhood today, and I want to know who was driving it.
Andy: Hey, sam, this is my second call to you.<eos> I really hope you get this soon.<eos> I'll keep in touch. Marlo: Oh.<eos> [ breathing heavily ] All right, sylvia.<eos> Look, you don't open this door right now, i'm gonna break it down.
Just do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> [ chuckles ]<eos> I'm gonna burn this letter.<eos> Oh, i'm not burning anything in here. Well, then i'll shred it, and i'll even eat it.
We need a name.<eos> - My house.<eos> - A word of advice... next time you steal someone's technology, make sure their boyfriend wasn't a bomb-making genius.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You stole Julie Malarek's research and sold it.
Where can we find him?<eos> U.C. Santa Monica, the science building.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Friends of Julie.<eos> So Castellano funnels Julie's research to Pica, who sells it to applied holographics for a small fortune.
What?<eos> There's no need to re-think anything, Andy.<eos> Oderno started on this case, and he should finish it out. Yes, Mike?<eos> Uh, casings confirm Lisa Lewis and Gary Erwin were shot with the same gun.<eos> Any hope of finding it?
B-because my sister's ex-boyfriend was stalking her.<eos> She was scared to go out of the house by herself.<eos> Where did your sister keep this stun gun?<eos> No, I mean she had it to begin with.<eos> But... but then she threatened Raul with it and he took it from her.
I'm not gonna let Sam die.<eos> Ohhh. Look.<eos> The master chief ... he went on foot.<eos> It takes time.<eos> And if there's medicine to be found, he'll find it.
Before you go, let's get a picture with Phil and Hal.<eos> Don't you move. Don't move.<eos> Today's mark was an eccentric billionaire. But I had spent the last six years talking people out of their money, banks, college endowments, teachers' pension funds.<eos> If there was a nickel to be had, it was my job to get it.<eos> When the guilt piled up, I buried it with my ambition.
You seem familiar with this place.<eos> Just look at this technological marvel.<eos> Not a sound. Is its motor broken?<eos> I bet I could fix it.<eos> What, are you going to use it on your bike?
You're coming with me.<eos> So you say this house can walk?<eos> - It has wheels and an engine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you find it?
So you say this house can walk?<eos> - It has wheels and an engine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> We built it ourselves.
No, we'll step back 30 meters.<eos> You'll do the same. That's 70 meters.<eos> - Actually, that's 60 meters.<eos> - I mean, er, 60 meters.<eos> You'll put the ball on the ground, so that when we pick it up, you'll be far away.
Yeah. Oh, you think you gotta go home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> And while you're there, why don't you do the world a favor and cut off your dick and then eat it?
I get all your fake pot, I get to come around here whenever I want, make sure you're not screwing anyone else over, and you get to not go to jail.<eos> No.<eos> Your official lab report says that what you tested was fake pot.<eos> But you got a report that says that what you tested is what I sold you?<eos> Did you bag the pot as evidence as soon as you bought it?
No.<eos> Your official lab report says that what you tested was fake pot.<eos> But you got a report that says that what you tested is what I sold you?<eos> Did you bag the pot as evidence as soon as you bought it?<eos> Or... did you maybe bring it home and smoke it first?
♪ This time that we had ♪ ♪ I will hold... ♪<eos> ♪ Forever ♪<eos> ♪ Forever. ♪ (siren wailing, car horns honking) Mercedes!<eos> We have amazing news.<eos> Remember that movie that Artie wrote for you but you were too busy on your own world tour so we gave it to me?
You're no listening.<eos> That gypsy all but told you he'd carry on performing that song - if it earns him money.<eos> - I have to believe that a man who looks you in the eye and gives you his word will keep it.<eos> The gypsy will keep using the song.<eos> So, you'll be singing it, they'll be singing it.
He wrote "Will you marry me?" on a seashell.<eos> No, I wrote "Please let me make you happy for the rest of your life" and then hid it on the beach.<eos> And there's Oscar telling us they're engaged.<eos> I must've walked her past that seashell 20 times.<eos> And then when she finally saw it, it was all smudged, so I had to read it to her.
But it dawned on me that you are the second person in a week to tell me that I am impossible to live with.<eos> So, if I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone, I think I might need someone to teach me to loosen up a little.<eos> Felix?<eos> Hey, we came to see if you're okay.<eos> Also, we can't find anything in the kitchen since you reorganized it.
We cannot abandon them.<eos> You have contacts on the Russian-Korean border.<eos> They're looking for someone to blame Joon-Soo, this is the time to choose sides.<eos> The whisper's about a high-level attack in Europe.<eos> Well, we brought the fight to North Korea, now they're bringing it back to us.
Oi, oi, oi. Back off, don't spook him.<eos> Scott, you're gonna get your chance mate.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And when you do get it, give him a kick for me too.
Does that sound familiar?<eos> Yeah, referring to the Security Council Resolution 2094.<eos> Which you co-authored.<eos> - We offered you aid.<eos> - And then you took it away.
But Social Security?<eos> Benefits. Entitlements.<eos> We don't want to present a fresh face only to shoot ourselves in the foot.<eos> Then let's not pretend to unite the party, let's unite the party behind this legislation.<eos> We'll never get it past the Republicans.
I want to understand what justice is.<eos> That's a big one.<eos> I know.<eos> There's our justice, the kind men create.<eos> We base it on things like the Ten Commandments.
Do you understand?<eos> I can't lose my gun.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> We'll go to the bar, we'll go look for it.<eos> Maybe you lost it at the bar.
I can't lose my gun.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> We'll go to the bar, we'll go look for it.<eos> Maybe you lost it at the bar.<eos> Maybe you lost it at the bar.
No, you saw me reading about the play.<eos> Well, no, how do you appreciate a thing and google it at the same time?<eos> That's no way to live a life.<eos> That's an insult to the actors to do that.<eos> Because it was a great play and I wanted to know more about it while I was watching it.
What is all this?<eos> What have you done to my dining room?<eos> They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people.<eos> They wouldn't let me in, and I could see that they were shredding.<eos> I wrote them a demand letter, and I gave it to them.
We're in.<eos> In?<eos> Where's in?<eos> Take a picture when you get to the Moon, okay?<eos> I'll get it on the front page of the school paper.
For one rule!<eos> I break one rule in my whole life and I end up in a rocket heading to the Moon!<eos> Yes!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we have a mission to accomplish.<eos> Commander Goldwing, go and get that flag back before Carson destroys it.
It was unplugged and secured.<eos> Unplugged?<eos> That's the quickest way to lose all the data.<eos> Detective Cho, please treat all hardware, including the baby-cam, like a dead body.<eos> Don't touch it, don't move it until we get there. Sorry.
And put Donald Blythe in this office?<eos> You know he's not up for the job.<eos> Congress would get killed for malpractice.<eos> As crooked as you may think I am, you know I can handle the pressure, and you know Donald can't.<eos> So pass your law, I'll veto it.
I'm declaring war on atrophy.<eos> But these days, who could tell the difference?<eos> - So how about this? - Hm?<eos> I'll order a pizza.<eos> When it gets here, I bring it into this room... with a paper towel draped over my arm.
Oh. Cool, cool.<eos> I farted during the fourth one.<eos> It's an inside joke.<eos> I'm gonna miss you guys. You know what I think everybody should do, as a humble outsider that came in and nailed it?<eos> I think everyone should imagine their own personal version of season seven and not share it with anyone.
I mean by ourselves?<eos> Sure.<eos> I love that I got to be with you guys.<eos> Gay.<eos> You saved my life, and changed it forever.
I don't even like Mark.<eos> He has HPV.<eos> He has HPV?<eos> I mean, the disease itself isn't that big a deal.<eos> It's just kinda crazy he has it when he's 14.
Hi, Cleo.<eos> Hi, Mr. Parker.<eos> Cool T-shirt.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Yeah, my mom got it for me.
Forward-looking.<eos> That's the way to be.<eos> Like, I want to know more about the future... of your cock.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, I want to know more about the future of your, um, big hard cock when I put my hand around it and it gets so hard, and then I shove it into my slimy vagina like a... like one of the Stalley pickles.
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, Fin, hi.<eos> I'm Jackie Collins.<eos> And, um, I know your wife wrote a book, and, uh, it was very good, but you, you have a great story to tell, and I want to be the one to tell it, and here is my card, and call me, okay?
~ Oh, here's a letter.<eos> ~ Let me see!<eos> No!<eos> It's for your brother.<eos> Ma, why don't you open it for me?
So, I saw Ramu Sood.<eos> I rode straight over. He made me an offer.<eos> Stay on, as manager of my uncle's estate, making Armitage tea, just as before.<eos> But the land is still his?<eos> Aye, but I'll be running it, that's the point.
Yeah, some of her old stuff is pat, but, well, she's moved on to more of an alternative sound.<eos> Less and less commercial, even more of a reason to pass.<eos> Look, would you just at least listen?<eos> Jeff, the only reason I said yes to this deal is 'cause you said I had the final word.<eos> Now you have it... "no. "
Previously on "Nashville"...<eos> The energy, the connection, I know you felt it, too.
Oh, good.<eos> Good. Then he can help fix your teeth!<eos> Sir, if I may, I have a nephew his age.<eos> Get it done.<eos> Listen you little shit This is my first real vacation, and I will not have you ruin it for me.
No, it just looks like me after I've eaten, like, a big Mexican dinner.<eos> - Hannah. - No, but, like, her actual pussy.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Oh, I didn't get to see her pussy.<eos> Adam, did you see it?
The consul told me that cholera season was fast approaching and his government just couldn't wait that long.<eos> So he agreed to purchase Numoral, hoping it would be as effective.<eos> Unfortunately, we all know how that turned out.<eos> It's tragic.<eos> Oh, come on, you had inside information that the old vaccine was about to be yanked by the W.H.O., so you paid off the consul to take it.
You cooked up this scam together, didn't you?<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - It was a win-win.<eos> Sloane sells a warehouse full of drugs that nobody wants, and you get a big kickback.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we find that offshore account and link it back to you.
Okay.<eos> - Good night, Gordon.<eos> - Good night.<eos> You can take my husband's truck.<eos> I haven't driven it since he passed.
was in love with you.<eos> That you always had to be at the meetings so he could think about jacking you off.<eos> You have a foul mouth.<eos> Take responsibility for your failure.<eos> That account was handed to you and you made nothing of it because you have no character.
Well, I don't think that Ferg Donnelly is a good match.<eos> Ferg's very important around here.<eos> Frankly, you're lucky he's taken an interest in your business.<eos> I understand that, but it's not necessary.<eos> I don't mean to brag, but I've been handling this account on my own since I brought it in.
It's for a few weeks.<eos> Well, do you want me to come with you again?<eos> Not now.<eos> But soon, okay?<eos> Now that he's gone, I just need a little time to figure out whether or not I wanna sell it.
Bail is denied, and you are remanded to the custody of the sheriff.<eos> - We want your testimony.<eos> - Screw that.<eos> - They're cutting me loose.<eos> - The judge gave you probation, and when you break it, you're gonna be right back here.
But we didn't realise the impact they'd have on the village.<eos> The chemicals they use on the grapes, the extra traffic, the... trees they cut down and the hedgerows they ripped up.<eos> I mean, look what they've done to the local pond.<eos> And what have they done?<eos> They diverted the stream that fills it without a word of consultation.
Great.<eos> Draw some fouls.<eos> Harvard, what do you got?<eos> Unbridled rage.<eos> And right now, this wedgie is feeding it.
Colleano's could be closed in a month's time.<eos> I do hope you're not going to disappoint me.<eos> We could all be making a lot more money.<eos> Let's say we lose the roulette and the back room.<eos> We bring it out front and make Colleano's a gambling club.
So you played me.<eos> I protected you.<eos> From what?<eos> I manipulated the painting in case it got into the wrong hands.<eos> I couldn't risk Zee using it on you.
Take your seat.<eos> Court is in session.<eos> Hey Roxanne, you're on.<eos> Max and I started Tech Talk Great Development.<eos> And he stole a software application and sold it to our top competitor.
I wanted this app to be part of Tech Talk, the company I put years of hard work into making the success it is today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No further questions, Your Honour.<eos> Your witness, Ms. Dennis.<eos> Mr. Pearson, did you steal Tech Talk's property and sell it to Brebner Tech?
He cuts your hair for free...<eos> Are those your parameters?<eos> Know what?<eos> You conceal your weakness.<eos> You cloak it in wimpy, generous, pseudo-humanistic words but the truth is you're scared.
We should help them take their place in society again, these brave men... .. who gave their all for King and Country... .. who have returned to a world turned upside down.<eos> Let us bring them out of the shadows... .. and into the light.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is the handwriting at all familiar?<eos> I don't recognize it.
Stand by.<eos> M.E. Wagon en route to Sunset and Highland.<eos> Hey, 7999 Sunset, that's... That's the Coffee Hut.<eos> That's Art Gladner.<eos> Sal, you were here when that call came in. Who took it?
Wait.<eos> Jimmy, come back.<eos> I gotta check your vagina for sand.<eos> Did you get a look at that door?<eos> It was locked before one of the nosepicks broke it down.
- So let them. It's got bipartisan support.<eos> Dunbar's going to publicly support the bill.<eos> - What about Jackie? - She's trying to stay out of it, but if it goes to a vote, she's gotta go with the tide.<eos> We don't want her poll numbers to take a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.<eos> If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
- So act like it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> My husband formally approved our own humanitarian package for eighty million.<eos> Zimbabwe will be withdrawing the amendment tomorrow.<eos> And when the resolution goes to a vote, I expect Israel to support it like the loyal ally she is.
- The town's national treasure died.<eos> People are super sad and stuff.<eos> No one wants to buy a house when they're sad.<eos> It's listed too high.<eos> In the city, we'd list it 25% lower.
We hand you over.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> Making sure you don't bleed to death.<eos> If that leg becomes infected, you'll lose it.
~ This land belongs to you.<eos> But it's our home - everything we know.<eos> Then take it.<eos> I've no use for it.<eos> I give it to you.
Is there a god?<eos> Shoos!<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> Is there a god?<eos> If you speak of the great thing again we'll rip out your tongue and feed it to you.
Instead of walking the righteous path, they wish to fly.<eos> The Labyrinth is not a maze, but a path.<eos> To navigate it requires absolute focus.<eos> Some may find our methods severe.<eos> But those who need help most rarely ask for it.
We're only 6 inches above top of active fuel.<eos> We flooded the core. Why isn't the water level going up?<eos> Looks like somehow the flood never made it there.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> The only way is if someone stopped it manually... From the inside.
Himself?<eos> You, Dr. Phelps?<eos> Mankind.<eos> Eugenics is, in my opinion, a very legitimate and necessary study.<eos> So much so I've added it to the curriculum at my own Columbia Medical College.
You have as much interest in finding a cure as I do.<eos> You help me, and perhaps with what I learn, I can help you.<eos> I'll work as fast as I can and you can bury her in a few days.<eos> You won't cut her face?<eos> I'll protect it with my life.
Please. Please.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - You know what you earned yourself.<eos> The Polish doctor discovered the gland secretion existed.<eos> Doc at Johns Hopkins thought he'd crystalized it, but turned out he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative.
- Please don't.<eos> - You know what you earned yourself.<eos> The Polish doctor discovered the gland secretion existed.<eos> Doc at Johns Hopkins thought he'd crystalized it, but turned out he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative.<eos> Then this Japanese fellow on 103rd Street, he crystalized it for real.

- Yeah.<eos> You're staying with me.<eos> I got my place all fixed up.<eos> Put an extra bed in the parlor for you.<eos> Had a lady down the hall make a curtain to go around it.
This is the last place I expected to see you today.<eos> Seems I missed one minstrel show at the ball.<eos> Couldn't pass up the opportunity to see another.<eos> Now that I've made the transverse elliptical incision around the hernia and the umbilicus,<eos> I will now deepen it to the base of the hernia intrusion.
I'm fine.<eos> Just go about your food.<eos> Oh, Christ, Harry.<eos> I don't want your pity.<eos> Then I won't give it to you, but for fuck's sake, it's all right to let me of all people see you hurting.
- No!<eos> Come with me.<eos> Now.<eos> This is Molly's face.<eos> I want you to hit it as hard as you can.
Well, we took a little drive up there.<eos> - Found a shitload of narcotics.<eos> - A shitload, John.<eos> No way Danny could have had that much shit.<eos> Unless he stole it from Wayne Lowry.
I'm gonna need your help with this.<eos> What is it?<eos> Why didn't you get rid of it?<eos> I thought it might be useful.<eos> I just didn't realize I'd be using it for this.
What is it?<eos> Why didn't you get rid of it?<eos> I thought it might be useful.<eos> I just didn't realize I'd be using it for this.<eos> After he moved it from your property, it-- lt appears he kept it for himself.
Mm-hmm. It was a domestic.<eos> Husband had locked himself in the bedroom with a .45.<eos> So, Edgewood had a shotgun.<eos> Kiko and I have the door.<eos> Kiko kicks it open.
So I left a note.<eos> "Wake me up at 5 am for work."<eos> It's funny the things you remember.<eos> I've got a photo of her here.<eos> I carry it with me everywhere.
We're trying to protect her.<eos> Not punish her.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> So now he's "telling" it?<eos> Not "shading" it?
It's Mitch Pendergast's. - Hmm? - The, uh, the heroin from the girl's backpack.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> No, Mitch Pendergast is in Baraga.<eos> He started a ten-year sentence six months ago.<eos> Yeah, I didn't say he gave it to her.
- out of the evidence vault.<eos> - Wait. What?<eos> - Commander, I already told...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> We know you took it, but we can't prove it.
It's okay.<eos> How did you...?<eos> I heard you talking on the phone.<eos> When you were making dinner, I snuck into your room.<eos> Took it from your dresser.
And for astonishing bigotry.<eos> ~ A fucking mask?<eos> ~ Viv, ma'am, just play it out.<eos> Majid kept his shop door locked so he could easily sneak out the back and peg it to the petrol station.<eos> He makes damn sure he's seen getting the petrol, pours it in through the cat flap, and is in such a rush to get back he drops his phone.
See if we can't coax this bastard out of ~ whatever rabbit hole he's hiding in. ~ KNOCK AT DOOR<eos> Sorry, ma'am.<eos> There's been a hiccup with the Readies warrant.<eos> I'll pretend I didn't hear that, Joy.<eos> So... You know you filled out the paperwork for the warrant ~ and then passed it off to me to get to the magistrate?
Oxbridge education.<eos> It was fired from a 9mm Baikal pistol.<eos> Sleek, beautiful and if this summer's jaunt to the Palm Springs Gun Show is anything to go by, quite the heartbreaker.<eos> The gun that killed Tierney was used on the Fordhuck Estate ~ in a number of recent gang shootings.<eos> ~ We never found it, but we're all set to raid the den where the gang hangs out.
I'm no ordinary man.<eos> I carry a demon's curse, a curse I've passed on to my son.<eos> What sort of curse?<eos> A prize of the gods.<eos> He will feel it when he comes of age, as I did.
You didn't know?<eos> No, I... I knew she was brought up by the sea, and that her father was a fisherman, but she kept names and places to herself.<eos> She was protecting you.<eos> This is that shell.<eos> I've kept it close to my heart ever since, wondered about her every day.
Guard!<eos> I need help here.<eos> Where did you find that bird?<eos> It flew into my room, Majesty.<eos> And who were you taking it to now?
One moment, sir.<eos> You take issue with the laws of this land?<eos> I can't help but feel that, in this case, justice would have been best served by clemency.<eos> Happily for justice, this court is better able to interpret the law than you.<eos> Then the law is savage and you interpret it without charity!
~ And yours, George, particularly in the light of your recent acquisition.<eos> Ah, my shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> You must take that as a compliment.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> Clearly you know a fine investment when you see it!
Five.<eos> Jesus, John.<eos> What?<eos> Five?<eos> He's selling a lie and folks are buying it.
Oh, what about The Walking Dead?<eos> They're not rushing the romance.<eos> They've spent five seasons letting Daryl and Carol fall in love.<eos> Because we're all watching the zombie show to see if the hick and the housewife will sleep together.<eos> That's why I watch it.
Lieutenant Backstrom?<eos> Yes, madam chairperson.<eos> You're simply reading from your statement.<eos> That's because my statement is what happened.<eos> The veracity of your statement is exactly what this committee is questioning, so we'd prefer if you put it aside and answered our questions.
All right!<eos> And now $325...<eos> I got the soda for a steal.<eos> I had a buyer... some old queen...<eos> but I gave it to Jason instead.
And now $325...<eos> I got the soda for a steal.<eos> I had a buyer... some old queen...<eos> but I gave it to Jason instead.<eos> You gave it to him?
Oh, my goodness!<eos> How funny is this?<eos> Well, if I'd known this guy was your son,<eos> I would've asked you to sign a permission slip.<eos> If I would've known it was so he could go out with you, I totally would've signed it.
Thanks.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> What is it?<eos> A flash drive that looks like a credit card.<eos> Shaw already signed it out.
Now look at you.<eos> Hand me the flash drive.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I'm afraid you're of no use to me.<eos> I know you still have it on you.
I know you still have it on you.<eos> You are nothing if not predictable.<eos> I'm willing to bet it's in your back left pocket.<eos> Now, hand it over.<eos> Or I'll shoot you in the head and take it anyway.
Rats.<eos> Human flesh.<eos> But it takes its time, devouring... digesting...<eos> Leto, my favourite surgeon, is most skilled.<eos> When he cuts a small hole in your belly, you will feel very little pain, and after he has slipped his black snake into your stomach and sewn it in, you'll feel as if you've eaten a very heavy meal, that's all.
You know, people... people are killing people who look like you because of the color of your skin.<eos> Because of the way you act, the way you dress. Because you wear a fuckin' hoodie. Pop.<eos> Yeah, no, no, no, no. He needs to know this.<eos> He needs to hear this.<eos> And you-- you take this sickness and you've used it for your own cynical gains. Do you get that?
Kidnapper, please, just -- just prove that my talia Is alive and well, And we will give you whatever you ask.<eos> And, um... Welcome [sighs] my daughter's safe return.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The fbi is demanding for proof of life.<eos> They're not gonna get it.
This became her favorite game.<eos> One for every time I messed up.<eos> Look, all I ever wanted was to come home.<eos> Please... just leave me here.<eos> I'm sorry about what's between you and your sister, but I still have my warrant and a girl is going to die if I don't finish it.
- Doctor...<eos> - This is my fault.<eos> You mustn't blame yourself.<eos> It was me.<eos> You had the perfect life and I destroyed it.
It makes my heart sing to see you cooking again.<eos> You were never good at hiding your emotions.<eos> What is troubling you, my son?<eos> This medicine...<eos> the man I was getting it from...
Why are you here then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was almost killed.<eos> I didn't know where to go, so I went home.<eos> I was worried about Amanita... and missing the life that we used to have, and I was wondering if I was ever gonna get it back.
What does it mean? Okay, a business this size would never have so many transactions, so this is how we know there are illegal goings-on.<eos> So, you bought the wheel from the victim?<eos> From his sister, Celia, two weeks ago.<eos> I still have the receipt.<eos> Why would she sell it to you?
Lieutenant?<eos> This picture points to a big fight.<eos> Every fight's got two stories.<eos> Well, we know that Gu lost that fight.<eos> But we don't know that he didn't start it.
We believe our book, Human Sexual Response, will reacquaint all of us with our natural selves, free of fear, but also full of understanding.<eos> We thank you for coming here today, and we appreciate your interest in our book.<eos> - If I may...<eos> - Really, Mr Buckland?<eos> Why ask for the floor now when you've hijacked it so unapologetically all afternoon?
I needed to reevaluate.<eos> At the time, I thought I was unhappy with the project, but in hindsight I realized I was just unhappy with myself.<eos> So I guess that's what I've been working on.<eos> Well, Joe is being very modest.<eos> What he didn't tell you is he took this tiny regional company and turned it into a national competitor for PCs almost overnight.
Well, there's absolutely nothing automatic about a bail hearing.<eos> - It... - But he could still get out.<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> - Even if they granted bail,<eos> I can't imagine they'd set it at a level that I...
All very casual, sleeves rolled up.<eos> They can't be candid if they're planned.<eos> No one needs to know how the sausage is made.<eos> I'll take the jacket.<eos> I'll keep it on.
That's it.<eos> We are no longer allowing signs<eos> - in the council chamber.<eos> - You.<eos> Anybody who is carrying a sign shall relinquish it or be removed.
Hey, Martinelli's here.<eos> Uh, excuse me for one second.<eos> - Congratulations, Nick.<eos> - Thank you, Angelo.<eos> You know, the voters have lifted a tremendous burden off of my shoulders and placed it on yours.
It is beautiful.<eos> It is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It really is.<eos> I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.
Protesters have gathered here at the Grinton Will Library to demand its reopening.<eos> It was closed by Mayor Wasicsko in compliance with the state control board's emergency management of the city's finances.<eos> It's bad enough that the mayor is not listening to people about the housing.<eos> And now he wants to close our library? Yeah, right.<eos> Yeah, I'm closing it.
It's not a negative for me anymore.<eos> I took a courageous stand.<eos> I was the only one in the city who did the right thing.<eos> Nick, courage isn't the kind of word you can use to describe yourself even if it's true.<eos> It works when other people say it.

Not anymore.<eos> At least one of us made rank, though, right?<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Pipe bomb.<eos> Watchman found it on his rounds.
Collateral damage or something?<eos> You just want to come clean, Trey?<eos> Clean of what?<eos> That gun we found by your bed...<eos> When was the last time you fired it?
That's his gun, right?<eos> That's your gun.<eos> No, the other gun, lid... that one.<eos> That's the one they found at his trailer.<eos> Right, that's 'cause I put it there.
No, the other gun, lid... that one.<eos> That's the one they found at his trailer.<eos> Right, that's 'cause I put it there.<eos> That gun right there, that is the gun that I found next to his body.<eos> Why did you put it in the trailer... to frame Holden?

I'm a worried father.<eos> Mr. Hardwicke, please...<eos> Your articles say he was fired for sexual misconduct, but you never say exactly what Dr. Rawlings did.<eos> I didn't specify the nature of the sexual misconduct because...<eos> I didn't know it.
Why have you got that bint constable sniffing round?<eos> "Who am I married to?"<eos> ~ "How many kids have I got?" ~ I didn't, I promise.<eos> ~ I'm warning you, Bacchus. ~ Argh.<eos> One word gets out to anybody about where I was that night and I'll rip your ugly head off and shove it up your arse!
What do yous want, anyway?<eos> We'd like to take a further statement from you concerning what those three men did.<eos> Erm, Rachel will take the statement.<eos> No male officers will be present.<eos> But... before that, I'd like to ask you about the previous time when you made a similar allegation... but you withdrew it.
Quiet down.<eos> Indra, please.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> My shock baton has got your back.<eos> How about you stick it up your ass instead?
According to your neighbors, you've been bringing extra food home after meals.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Is it true that you've refused treatment 12 times in the past 15 years or that you've refused them 30 times?<eos> Do you deny that?<eos> We take the blood when we need it.
Two of them... at the dam and in the mine... are moving into position already.<eos> The third... inside the mountain... is freeing the Grounder prisoners as we speak.<eos> It is our job as the fourth team to keep the eyes of the enemy off of them for as long as possible.<eos> To do that, we have to be in position here at the main door with our entire army.<eos> The mountain men believe the door can't be opened from the outside, so they leave it unguarded.
I didn't have a view, either.<eos> Still, I wish I could see it.<eos> Maybe you can.<eos> There's an airlock.<eos> We used it to hold Emerson.
Don't call her Ginny.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> I made you a cup of coffee.<eos> No, I don't want it.
So irresponsible.<eos> Balan I called you a hundred times.<eos> Without calling me all these days, suddenly to talk like this.<eos> What mistake did I do?<eos> Balan, had given me the word, I expected you to keep it.
I don't understand.<eos> I give you a key piece of evidence, and you're not interested?<eos> A blue jacket with a blood stain...<eos> I'm very interested.<eos> Now, I don't know how Matt got it, but I'd assume that the jacket would have Tom's killer's DNA on it.
I thought you'd want to know!<eos> And it's missing.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't there when I went back.<eos> You do see my dilemma... you heard I needed evidence, you gave me evidence, and now the alleged evidence is conveniently missing, like your flashlight.<eos> I'll find it myself.
Heroes? !<eos> Do you know what they did?<eos> No.<eos> But the judge does and he believed them worthy of bail.<eos> I merely provided it.
Why would we leave?<eos> The job's not finished.<eos> £7,000 will be in the business account by now.<eos> I'm a signatory.<eos> We clear it out and get steerage to New York.
Ain't life a bitch?<eos> This is the single worst idea I've ever heard.<eos> You just whacked a whole houseful of people and that's when the Blade was nowhere around, and now you want to be in actual contact with it?<eos> We don't know that I have to be in contact with it.<eos> All we know is that we need it.
You're the sane one.<eos> You on board with this? !<eos> Wings of Titania, bear mine eyes aloft as I bid thee...<eos> It's insane.<eos> You want me to procure the most dangerous weapon on the planet for Dean Winchester, the man who goes mental every time he touches it!
Oh, I need a firm chair.<eos> So I see.<eos> I have it.<eos> This is my responsibility.<eos> I will deliver it only to the King.
What would I be doing with that top-shelf stuff?<eos> You were seen around the time of the refreshments.<eos> So?<eos> I went to pick up my pocketknife.<eos> Thought I might've dropped it back there or in the change rooms, but I couldn't find it.
You know, he went to Berlin for the Olympics but he had to drop out because of some injury.<eos> Maybe he's reliving the glory days through Dennis.<eos> What about the rival in the other team?<eos> I mean, doesn't he benefit, now that Dennis is out of the way?<eos> And, if Dennis was on testosterone, where did he get it from?

Welcome to girls camp.<eos> It felt good to laugh after crying so much.<eos> I even prepared a little something.<eos> Instead of complaining about how old and cheesy your camp songs were, I decided to write a new, cheesy song for you guys to learn.<eos> This is my first time singing it in front of anybody, so be nice.
You don't think my boss has something to do with that missing girl, do you?<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Turn off the TV.<eos> But I'm watching Law Squiggle Order!<eos> I said turn it off.
When did you find out?<eos> I was diagnosed nine years ago.<eos> Wait.<eos> That's why you left me?<eos> My grandfather had it.
Show it to me again.<eos> Wait.<eos> How...?<eos> Where's the rock?<eos> I left it right here.
Go prove they aren't.<eos> They didn't give you any warning?<eos> Do they ever when they're passing out pink slips?<eos> What about Peter's adoption?<eos> They won't grant it if you're unemployed.
It's always the same, always the brainy ones.<eos> Where did you get this from?<eos> I found it.<eos> Really, just like that?<eos> I'll find out, even if I have to carve it out of flesh with a blunt fork, so where did you get it from?
You two have endured all the traditional werewolf rituals and trials.<eos> There's only one remaining.<eos> Jackson, you may kiss your bride.<eos> I know that look.<eos> I've seen it all too often. What are you planning?
I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Esther made this bargain long ago.<eos> It's most unfortunate that you've been dragged into it.<eos> You talk like you don't have a choice, but this is your doing.<eos> When I give my word, I keep it, and I expect others to do the same.
There really is only one question here.<eos> What exactly are we doing?<eos> This was not my plan.<eos> You rushed it and made but a single weapon.<eos> Of course she took it from you. And now we've lost what advantage we had and used up the very materials we needed to kill her. That's a bit histrionic.
You yourself said to hear her out.<eos> And you yourself said that would be idiocy.<eos> Did I?<eos> Well, that does sound like me.<eos> Regardless on the off chance, Freya has some information that could protect my daughter, I prefer she share it on my terms.
Young Freya here, although powerful, lacks the spell to put Rebekah back in her true body, and that's where you come in.<eos> I need you to be a dear and dig deep in that ex-witch mind of yours.<eos> Give me the spell that puts Rebekah back.<eos> You know, even when you betrayed me, I didn't blame you.<eos> You just couldn't see the light, but you see it now, don't you, now that your body was stolen by the very same family of vampires that are trying to steal mine!
My plan's worked perfectly.<eos> Easy, Elijah.<eos> I can see your red door swinging wide open, but our job's not yet done.<eos> Shall we kill her and be done with it?<eos> To be clear, I do want her blood, but I want it on this blade, which I've had bound with the soil from Dahlia's homeland, not to mention viking ash.
Thea knows nothing about Sara.<eos> And she never will.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> I know her.<eos> She'll get to the truth no matter how well you think you're hiding it.
You have 23 hours, 59 minutes.<eos> I suggest you move your sweet ass!<eos> Captain Lance?<eos> Brick wants every cop out of the Glades or he's going to kill his hostages.<eos> We need help, we need it now.
Alderman, stay back!<eos> Where's Zytle?<eos> Hey.<eos> So you still haven't told me-- what did you think of my set last night?<eos> Because fangirls on Vine called it "epically epic."
I suppose you planned to leave without telling me.<eos> Well, I knew that you wouldn't approve.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maseo saved it.
And in rare instances, told in legend, those waters have been used to restore the dead to life.<eos> He offered to use the Lazarus pit on Thea, didn't he?<eos> Lazarus, as in from the bible, Lazarus?<eos> The pit's real.<eos> I've seen it.
No, but Merlyn assures me that he'll be waving the white flag.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgot the flag.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I would have told you where you can put it.
How do we find Simmons?<eos> Light bulb, literally.<eos> I--no, actually, figuratively.<eos> Uh, just before Simmons beat me, I blasted him with my compressed light beams, and he thanked me for topping him off.<eos> He absorbs energy and turns it into weaponized plasma.
That she knew it might be tough, but that she wanted us to be friends.<eos> She's two years older than I am, and she thought, like, what, she was gonna be my new stepmom?<eos> I had to make her take me seriously.<eos> So that's why you brought the gun.<eos> My mom bought it last year when there were some break-ins in the neighborhood.
Jake believed in me when really very, very, very few people believed in me.<eos> Jake was the one who gave me the knowledge and I was nobody at the time.<eos> - Dallas, came into the wrestling business very late.<eos> - At age 35, become a wrestler for the first time?<eos> - You wanna talk work ethic, DDP has it.
- You guys want something to drink?<eos> A coffee or, not coffee, but water, Gatorade, urine?<eos> Yeah, a little over a year ago, I retired officially.<eos> The only passion I had was wrestling. Had to give it up.<eos> I had a life, but I poisoned it.
Really.<eos> Come here.<eos> Didn't you say you had something to do tonight?<eos> I was thinking of having the guys over for a poker night.<eos> I'll tell them we'll do it next week. What?
I know no-one wants to speak ill but, come on, lads, a man's died.<eos> That's why we've turned out.<eos> Not for the free bar?<eos> All right, let's start with the scrap outside.<eos> Anyone see it?
You're saying whoever did this did it from inside that room, plugged in.<eos> It was an up-close intrusion?<eos> Yep.<eos> Explains the direction of that security camera.<eos> My guess is, the target moved it before breaching the control room.
I removed the target's board, but the train's not stopping.<eos> Damn it.<eos> It must still be paired to the train's computer over Bluetooth.<eos> First, carefully... remove the Bluetooth radio from the motherboard.<eos> You'll find it in the USB port.
It's so good to see you.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> How was school?<eos> You don't have my bracelet.<eos> You know what, I had to use it.
Yeah, look... guy like that... rich, famous, handsome, gets more biscuit than a baker, what does he need to beat on women for?<eos> Let me talk to him, find out.<eos> Let the detectives handle their case, all right, you already did your part, sweetie.<eos> They don't have a case.<eos> They'll put out the made up description and then drop it.
I was paralyzed from the waist down In a high-school gymnastics accident.<eos> Your driver's license was used in a prison visiting office.<eos> Uh, w-was it about three months ago?<eos> That was about the time I lost my wallet.<eos> You remember where you were when you lost it?
[ carol sighs ] This is your way of turning it all back on me.<eos> You have to play the good guy so you don't feel so bad About running away with that filthy whore.<eos> She got what she deserved.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> I put a bag over her head, and I squeezed it tight And I watched the life drain from her body.
I didn't leave the motel because I was hoping the mystery lady was gonna show up, and I did not wanna miss the money shot.<eos> Well...<eos> Here he leaves the motel with a travel mug.<eos> but here, when he comes back 45 minutes later,<eos> - he doesn't have it.
Well...<eos> Here he leaves the motel with a travel mug.<eos> but here, when he comes back 45 minutes later,<eos> - he doesn't have it.<eos> - Maybe he lost it?
No, no, no.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Look... 5:15 the next morning, he leaves the motel empty-handed.<eos> When he comes back, he's got the travel mug again.<eos> So maybe he found it.
I don't think so.<eos> Look... 5:15 the next morning, he leaves the motel empty-handed.<eos> When he comes back, he's got the travel mug again.<eos> So maybe he found it.<eos> He didn't find it.

Nice job.<eos> So you think Dylan Blyer snuck in at night<eos> - and placed a camera?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> And then picked it up the next morning so he could see what Ward had been up to.
If we'd dumped them, the government wouldn't be about to fall.<eos> Enough talk!<eos> Take action!<eos> How's it going with the amendment on the waterfront of Ostia that should be put into the Suburban Renewal Law?<eos> It's halfway done, considering who's behind it...
Because this time, I won't keep quiet.<eos> What's in your hand?<eos> Don't worry, my cards are good.<eos> There's nothing in your house.<eos> We cleaned it out when they arrested you.
All I have is stock.<eos> But you own the majority, so it's yours.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'll give you a week to hand over the villa, the house, car and all the small change you can scrape up.<eos> I'm furious with your father... so if you don't go away now, I'll chop your leg off, put it in the fridge and return it when you bring me the money.
- Do we?<eos> - The truth.<eos> I want my friend released.<eos> Then perhaps you could start by telling me about the letter.<eos> Well, it obviously wasn't meant for me and Archie didn't leave it for his colleagues either, which means he didn't trust them.
Must have been the night you dropped me off at the bus.<eos> Eric O'Bannon had a job going, so he cut me in on it.<eos> And we went out and we stole the gas and...<eos> What'd you do with the gas?<eos> We took it out to the mangroves.
We were also able to determine that the call came from approximately a 2,000-square-foot radius<eos> 32 degrees south, southeast of the breakfast table.<eos> How the...?<eos> How the hell do you know that?<eos> Oh, we-we accessed the cell tower, pinged at it and triangulated the source of the call.
I don't need to see him in green.<eos> Russ, you ever thought about why you hate technology so much?<eos> No, I haven't, because I don't.<eos> I just think the human brain is so much better.<eos> Maybe you don't like technology because I have it and you don't.
He... The ankle bracelet,<eos> - I mean, that was on a monitor, right?<eos> - We apprehended him last night.<eos> I mean, this is unbelievable.<eos> - He cut it off.
- Let me see.<eos> - What?<eos> Stop!<eos> - Jane, cyanide poisoning stops the cells of the body from being able to use oxygen.<eos> That didn't happen, and that thing hurts my eyes, as it has the last four times that you've used it.
I-I-I realize that.<eos> No, look, Carlo, I'm gonna get Karen a big-ass diamond.<eos> That's a given.<eos> I'm talking about the proposal, okay?<eos> I want you to film it for me.
- What did it say?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It was slipped under the door at our home.<eos> It was addressed to Ron.<eos> He read it, he ... he folded it up, he put it back in his pocket.
Yeah, except you make a bad play, maybe she murders you.<eos> Well, there's a big difference between muffing a ground ball<eos> - and having another wife.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> We need to find the murder weapon or figure out where she bought it or placed her in Boston at the time of the murder, or all of the above.
Come on, Tasha.<eos> Let's mix you up some virgin something or other to celebrate.<eos> Good job.<eos> Obviously, Barry's scholarship was sweat lodge revelation number two.<eos> Well, I only had it because you wouldn't let me call the admissions office and help her.
Let us help you find out who did this.<eos> Russians are dead.<eos> Russia will find the killers.<eos> I don't understand why you're refusing our assistance.<eos> Because we don't need it.
- It billows.<eos> On its own, it billows.<eos> Just a draft?<eos> I wish.<eos> - Your father read it?
People died for it, in case you don't remember.<eos> You know, last year, I, uh, had his remains moved in secret from Kharavan cemetery to Behesht-e Zahra.<eos> It's the resting place of the martyrs.<eos> I picked a nice, shady spot in a forest of pine trees.<eos> Later, I can maybe draw you a map so you can find it easily.
It's all my fault.<eos> Maybe it was your fault, maybe it was my fault.<eos> Maybe...<eos> It doesn't matter, does it?<eos> Getting that thing onboard was a risk and I knew it from beginning.
Yeah. He showed up at my place, like, two weeks ago.<eos> And he's all, "'sup, babe?"<eos> And I'm like, "don't 'babe' me, bitch.<eos> You owe me, like, 15 grand."<eos> And then he gives it to me in cash.
And I'm like, "don't 'babe' me, bitch.<eos> You owe me, like, 15 grand."<eos> And then he gives it to me in cash.<eos> 15 grand.<eos> Well, did he say where he got it from?
That's because when they look at you, all they see is their son.<eos> I see so much more.<eos> We are under attack, but our enemy didn't come from the skies.<eos> Our enemy was already here.<eos> The RAPs only needed one resource in order to maintain control, and we surrendered it to them, without a fight.
As the Allies dug in, meeting heavy resistance from Axis forces in Tunisia, Ford and his men had to turn over all their footage to Zanuck.<eos> But Ford was skeptical about Zanuck's ability to make a compelling war documentary.<eos> In Hollywood, Capra was securing more studio space for his expanding program of war films.<eos> [Frank Capra] We had installed ourselves at Western Avenue.<eos> But we couldn't get any furniture. So we stole it.
Doesn't matter.<eos> - Just take my minivan.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> I appreciate it.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.<eos> Sir, I mean, if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.<eos> It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.<eos> You both make excellent points.<eos> And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
What is the etiquette for where I would put my... "his asshole" fingers?<eos> Is it just straight out to the side?<eos> Or... under a pillow?<eos> Or just...<eos> Just sever it.
It was sold out when I looked in the bookstore.<eos> Really?<eos> That's fantastic, Michi!<eos> I doubt that it was sold out.<eos> They probably never even carried it.
Yeah.<eos> My mom's supposed to be working for the Justice Department, right?<eos> Sure, she's prosecuting the catalytic converter case.<eos> Yeah, only she's not.<eos> She's not prosecuting it.
- Anytime.<eos> - If you hadn't been there...<eos> - I was there.<eos> Sure.<eos> And don't worry about your car. I'll get it back to you.
I figured you'd never go there.<eos> - Give me the money.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> How much did you get?<eos> $200, but I spent it.
I thought that sounded pretty good.<eos> This is the band Richie wants to see?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> He liked their demo.<eos> Did he hear it before or after he started using again?
- Shit. - Disco King Cadillac.<eos> -Get off me!<eos> -I ought to pluck your eyeball out...<eos> Get his ass, pay him for that shit.<eos> ...wear it around my neck if you don't answer.
Does he already have a name or do we get to name him?<eos> I swear I'll walk him all the time just like I promised.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> - You know, deal's a deal, right?<eos> - I didn't mention it before.
And so I'm very high. High as a... - They get it.<eos> Hey, Jeannie? - Hmm? You do understand that the edibles are more potent than the smoke, correct?<eos> Hmm! Ugh, it's like a fucking horror movie.<eos> Food and pot together in the rabid claws of Jeannie van der Hooven.<eos> We've seen every kind of high there is, and we embrace it.
Easy now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> These are the M80 firecrackers that ShotSeeker picked up a half an hour ago.<eos> See how precise?<eos> ShotSeeker picked up the sound, located it correctly, and identified it as firecrackers.
Why isn't it going on?<eos> It fits!<eos> What kind of a guy...<eos> We've been dating for half a year and you haven't even bought me a ring.<eos> I couldn't wait any longer, so I bought it.
And then yesterday you erased it.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> What trouble was Jamie in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But, whatever it was, I didn't want him bringing it here.
I got this thing going on here tomorrow... so you gotta do it and pretend you're me.<eos> You'll get in a guy's car and deliver a briefcase.<eos> Don't worry about anything.<eos> There's $1,500 in it for me.<eos> You know I need it.
You got to go where they send you.<eos> Now let's meet the judges who will be awarding the coveted Golden Stockpot to the winner.<eos> Hi. Hello!<eos> It's us. That's right.<eos> Not only are we reporting on the chili, but we're also judging it.
They found large quantities of it in his blood sample. They also found some at his house, dried up and untouched.<eos> Sergeant, do you really believe that?<eos> The tests results are in!<eos> Sergeant, have you ever tried those kinds of mushrooms..?<eos> Never tried it you dick...
Good.<eos> You have the money?<eos> How much will it..?<eos> Do you have at least 10 million Won?<eos> Yes, just tell me when you need it.
Why are you asking that?<eos> A course in Falun.<eos> Psychodynamic therapy from a relational perspective.<eos> Very interesting.<eos> I can heartily recommend it, even for laymen.
Don't ever laugh in front of me!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Who really gives a damn if you broke the curse?<eos> If you broke it, I'll cast it again!
Call!<eos> Power of unity.<eos> The boiling water is on standby.<eos> Refreshing two bowls of ramyun.<eos> I will prepare it.
- Forget it.<eos> Oh, shit. Where's my purse?<eos> It's at the motel.<eos> Oh, God, I have, like, $10,000 in there.<eos> Got it right here.
Rat poison? Tres Pasitos.<eos> - Three Little Steps.<eos> - It's a Mexican rodent killer.<eos> 'Cause a mouse can only take three steps before it drops dead.<eos> You can't get it in the States anymore.
It's a microcell.<eos> People put it in their homes to boost bad cell reception.<eos> And that one over there-- that's an industrial radio.<eos> The micro-controller, here in the middle, acts as a bridge, lets 'em talk to each other.<eos> Can we trace these components back to the person who built it?
So I'm gonna prove it.<eos> And when the judge realizes what you did, he's gonna throw your ass in jail.<eos> Really?<eos> Because the way I see it, the judge is gonna certify that my client is a member of this class because they are one whether Jack tipped me off to them or not.<eos> And when that happens, I kill the deal, and your money goes back to the partners that you took it from.
Okay, so, then, all we have to do is use ourselves as bait to draw the green meanie in, and then figure out a way to cut a piece of fabric off his costume and bring it around to all the fabric stores in the area,<eos> see if they recognize it like they do in those forensics shows.<eos> Okay, this is not a forensics show, all right?<eos> That is an unnecessarily dangerous and extremely complicated plan!<eos> Why don't we just go to the shops and describe it to 'em?
Get rid of her and take care of her guards.<eos> We got to finish this job, Colonel.<eos> New incoming, bearing 1-3-0 degrees!<eos> Lieutenant, where's my satellite? !<eos> I narrowed it down to two.
I know where the goods it ..<eos> In a place easily.<eos> In the office Grunts?<eos> How can we get in.<eos> How do we find it?
What gift?<eos> Let me see it!<eos> You may see it, But I'm afraid your rank isn't high enough.<eos> It's very... very confidential.<eos> If you insist, I'll show it to you.
Junior Commandant!<eos> I knew you didn't have a gift.<eos> It's a trick. I'm not tricking you!<eos> My gift was to release Yang Kenan for you. To help you build up some karma points.<eos> But we don't need it anymore Since you killed another person.
With self-respect.<eos> So, Russell Cole and his Asteroid Admonition.<eos> Sherlock said that you were already aware of his paper?<eos> It made quite a splash in my circles.<eos> Come, I'll explain it to you.
But you made it sound like it was a deadset fuckin' certainty.<eos> It's not easy, Rex.<eos> The Federal Government, the church, the AMA.<eos> They don't want this.<eos> It takes power away from them and gives it to ordinary people like you and me.
He came into some money.<eos> How much?<eos> Thousands.<eos> Tens of thousands anyway.<eos> Found it in the car wash.
How could that have happened?<eos> You did fall asleep a lot in those town-hall meetings.<eos> My chair was too comfortable.<eos> And at that ribbon-cutting ceremony, you accidentally cut that guy's finger off with the giant scissors.<eos> His doctor sewed it back on.
Some, uh... office equipment from a realtor.<eos> Nearly as old as I am.<eos> Win?<eos> Yeah, 3,500 I don't have.<eos> I charged it to the law firm where I work.
Thanks to the wealth of digital recordings that Winthrop has been leaving for us,<eos> Sara and I requisitioned every audio analysis program on the planet.<eos> Including one that listens to plants?<eos> This one tracks minute vibrations of all sorts of different objects in a space, and analyzes the sounds that created them.<eos> Okay, I-I get that the sound of a voice can vibrate the leaves, but if you can't even see it, then how do you measure it?
With my dagger concealed here, I'm ready for any surprise attack.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Hey, can we have two?<eos> Give it to us!<eos> I'll bring it right away.
Thank you for braving fairway.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know you'd rather be watching your basketball.<eos> Well, you know, the big games aren't until tomorrow, so...<eos> I'd miss it for you anyway.
- Where are the files now?<eos> They're on an encrypted hard drive, secure inside a laptop.<eos> Only I know how to stop the deletion timer.<eos> The laptop with the SVR files,<eos> Miguel hid it in Philadelphia City Hall.
I decided there's two types of people in the world-- people who are meant to live their life to the fullest and people who are meant to read about those people.<eos> I'm the latter.<eos> So... you just drive straight up Route 30, and you'll see our sign that says "Bushman Funeral Home."<eos> It's right across from the turkey farm.<eos> Trust me, you'll... smell it.
It was motion.<eos> More specifically a motion sensor.<eos> You see, in the first explosion, Orion dropped Laurel's jacket at a distance of two and a half feet from the explosive device, which is the maximum perceptive range of this infrared sensor.<eos> And, given the proximity of Paul's body to the second device, that explosion was triggered from the same distance.<eos> Do we know where the bomber got it?
I told ya.<eos> There's someone who wants to meet ya.<eos> Was there a problem?<eos> You didn't find the ship?<eos> Oh, yeah, we found it.
- No. We need a working atmosphere.<eos> - It provides a good atmosphere.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> I have coffee and tea, if we need it.
Bravo, Sid.<eos> You?<eos> !<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I took your hat and coat and put it on a riverbank.
~ Does it pay well?<eos> It's just that we were wondering... why did Jenny give you 6,000 the day before she died?<eos> We have a witness who says you forced Jenny to give you the money.<eos> I didn't force Jenny.<eos> I didn't even want it.
But in 2008, the whole intricate system of credit and loans that the banks had created collapsed, and there was growing panic as giant financial institutions faced bankruptcy.<eos> The politicians in America and Britain stepped in and rescued the banks.<eos> As they did so, they began to discover that most of the major financial institutions were also riddled with corruption.<eos> But unlike President Roosevelt in the 1930s, they didn't then try and reform the system.<eos> Instead they simply propped it up by literally pouring billions more pounds and dollars into the banks, hoping that this would somehow spread through the economies.
The VP reportedly collapsed...<eos> I didn't know gallbladder could have an emergency.<eos> Well, it can if it's inside the Vice President of the United States.<eos> Hey, one of you guys needs to sign this paper<eos> - proving that I showed it to you.
You know, I can gift a certain amount of money every year to a person without having to pay taxes, and I...<eos> I don't know if it's gonna be enough for your dream wedding, but $13,000...<eos> - Marnie, that's crazy.<eos> - No. What's crazy?<eos> I have it, you need it.
'Cause I need it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Okay. So I'm your lawyer now, Kalinda, and this dollar represents attorney-client privilege.<eos> Sure.<eos> You faked metadata, and Diane presented it in court to get Cary released, yes?
You two were close?<eos> We believed in the same fight... that we didn't have to accept the way things were.<eos> Fernandez wanted to protect me as his source, so he made a copy of the ledger.<eos> What happened to the original ledger?<eos> If Diablo doesn't have it already, pretty sure that Fernandez hid it before he got killed.
- You find anything?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Most microchips are about the size of a grain of rice and all they contain is an ID number, but..<eos> Ours feels bigger.<eos> It's like A modified it so that he could track our every move.
He's our Shabbos goy.<eos> Shabbos goy, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, the lights and the oven.<eos> Turns it off and on.
Ah. Right. [upbeat music]<eos> Hi.<eos> I got your message.<eos> And, uh, corn.<eos> A guy was selling it by the side of the road and no one was stopping.
an extraterrestrial event that in fact took place in real life.<eos> Although most ancient astronaut theorists believe that the Egyptian gods were, in reality, extraterrestrial visitors, there are many who wonder if Osiris was even made of flesh and blood.<eos> One of the most famous stories that go hand in hand with Osiris was that he was dismembered by his jealous brother, Seth.<eos> JONATHAN YOUNG: Seth went into a fury and tore his brother's dead body to shreds, tore it into 14 pieces, had it scattered far and wide all over the kingdom.<eos> But Isis, the loyal wife, searched far and wide and found the pieces and pulled it together.
No, I'm going to public school.<eos> And I'm not saying that I took that cash, but if I did, I'd be smart enough to do the math.<eos> My parents put $3 in the collection plate every week.<eos> $3 a week for 52 weeks for six years-- $936.<eos> And I would have thought that belonged to my parents and I would have just been taking it back.
And I thought, woah!<eos> I was one of the first people at my school to listen to it.<eos> I brought it to school.<eos> We first listened to it in our music class, and all the students said:<eos> Then about a week later, everyone was listening to it.
Because I saw them there yesterday.<eos> Mrs. Blakeley, can you keep this to yourself?<eos> Well, I'll do my best.<eos> And I'm going to look into it as soon as I can,<eos> I just don't want whoever took it To get nervous and leave town.
A chicken's a bird.<eos> So I picked up the chicken and I chucked it in the audience.<eos> It came down and people grabbed the chicken.<eos> Let's just say it wasn't healthy for the chicken.<eos> The audience tore it to pieces and threw it back up on stage.
- Two weeks from today.<eos> Nice try. Where is the money?<eos> Maurice gives you 5,000 a week.<eos> Where is it?<eos> He didn't have it.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.<eos> That's why they only found the foot.<eos> What foot?<eos> It was her shoe.<eos> I gave it to her.
Because when you're here, you're here.<eos> So don't pass through that gate until you are.<eos> Okay.<eos> The district's been awarded a new patrol car.<eos> And since you guys went above and beyond on that hoarder deal, I'm assigning it to you.
I think the Patriots started this outbreak on purpose.<eos> Patriots are behind all this?<eos> As crazy as these guys are, I can't believe Truman would want to wipe out the town.<eos> Well, you know them better than I do, you tell me.<eos> How do we stop it?
Driving around in their big cars.<eos> And now Felicia thinks that I am one of these people.<eos> She wants me to redo her place with no money.<eos> Mom, you were the queen of decorating with no money.<eos> You took a pink fan and a colander and turned it into a lamp.
It's really not up to me anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Why not?<eos> I didn't get the principal job.<eos> What? No, I thought you killed it.
Dad, I think you're taking this a little far, okay?<eos> I just wanted you to be open to what Colin had to say.<eos> I don't want you to stop being you.<eos> Colin's ad was clearly better.<eos> You guys chose it yourselves.
And...?<eos> That's it. That was the story.<eos> Where's that cake now?<eos> It got sold.<eos> Who bought it?
Forever, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> - What's the code? - Uh...<eos> The numbers, Charles.<eos> I wrote it down.
Good boy.<eos> If you can hear this, we have the briefcase.<eos> We mean no harm.<eos> Talk about a fishing expedition.<eos> This fish lost a million bucks, he's out looking for it.
Danny...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I need my money back, Jason.<eos> The $4 million I invested with sunnylinks.<eos> I don't have it.
In retrospect, it looks like cowardice.<eos> You're many things; never a coward.<eos> Oh, I was.<eos> We should have been happy together, living the life I promised you.<eos> Instead I took your love and your loyalty, and I soaked it up like a sponge.
Her bite guard was over there, on the side.<eos> Her?<eos> Bite guard.<eos> She wears it at night to stop her from grinding her teeth.<eos> Normally, when she wakes, she puts it in its wee box at the side of bed and... at night, she rinses it and puts it back in.
I don't bite.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I thought we'd open with a prayer.<eos> Heavenly Father, we ask that you bless this Bible study.<eos> We know that we're not worthy of your love or protections, but you give it to us unconditionally.
Why do you always have to make everything bigger than it is? !<eos> L.O.<eos> Hey, Phil, listen.<eos> Does your pharmacy carry lice shampoo?<eos> Lily got it at school.
You guys are gonna be regulars. I'll keep a table open for you.<eos> And special thanks to Leslie Knope for once again bringing about positive change to this town.<eos> Pawnee, I present to you, your new slogan.<eos> You fixed the mistakes.<eos> I held it together for the entire meeting.
Say something in English or get your fucking face blown off.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> That'll do.<eos> The Germans have been pounding shells at us the last few days.<eos> We make up ground then we give it back to them.
That's ok.<eos> Now for the shoes.<eos> Let's see if H goes nice with the dress.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's high. Can I take it off now?
This is finely aged.<eos> You have the rest of it with you?<eos> Well, do you have the money?<eos> I want $30,000!<eos> Well, I don't have it on me.
That code include throwing $10 million bouts?<eos> I heard about that, but I don't believe it.<eos> Johnny was a true warrior.<eos> All he cared about was the fight.<eos> No way he dumped it.
Zach, where's your inhaler?<eos> The extra inhalers are in there.<eos> - Wait two minutes.<eos> - Make it one, Doc.<eos> Okay, Zach, I got it.
In the ocean, there will be waste byproducts.<eos> There will be certain compounds that will go into the sediment, get covered up, and not get recycled by the microbes or by the worms.<eos> Tyler thinks that even though they feed on one another, life forms in the ocean are ultimately working together, like organs inside a body.<eos> One group, which includes fish and mammals, works like the human respiratory system.<eos> It takes in oxygen and carbon and transforms it into carbon dioxide.
Well, listen to me, damn it.<eos> We had to keep an eye on the prisoners.<eos> There was a Polish professor,<eos> Tadeusz Rosenthal.<eos> I passed him bread and cigarettes, but they caught him with it.
It's raining. Let's go inside<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm in a rush one more thing...<eos> It's $100.000 here<eos> Chiu Wai-ying asked me... to give it to you
There he is.<eos> What are you doing here, Mick?<eos> I want my fuckin' money.<eos> What money?<eos> When we met, you offered me 500 thou to blow town... now I want it.
Hold on!<eos> Family is what's most important in life.<eos> Be it formed of blood or of bond.<eos> When someone joins a family, they are bound together forever.<eos> They come to our rescue when we need it the most.
Oh, we can get that number down Because the king has arrived.<eos> King of the lab?<eos> Isn't that a little passé?<eos> I found some trace on the reverse side Of a couple of the letters.<eos> I put it up on the server.
How are you today?<eos> Oh, you prefer a different greeting.<eos> Okay. Good morning. How are you?<eos> Do you have the summary document on our last job?<eos> I'll send it to you.
Al, security cameras were shut down in Hughes' office.<eos> We still have no eyes on who went to the lab<eos> - and took the virus.<eos> - There has to be video of the hallways.<eos> - Still waiting for the university to send it over. - Get 'em to speed it up! Come on!
But I told the father.<eos> Three weeks ago, I came across his wife's obituary in the Advertiser.<eos> She died of cancer without ever... knowing the truth about her daughter.<eos> I reached out to her husband, confessed everything, even offered him the 1.6 million the Porters gave me.<eos> But he didn't want it.
Why did you bring them to the precinct?<eos> And why are they covered in...<eos> - Ice cream!<eos> - Ice cream!<eos> Grandpa Leo got it for us.
Perry has made a victim out of both of my daughters.<eos> There was always something off about that girl.<eos> We understand.<eos> Keep... keep going, Mia.<eos> Zoe was lying there, and Perry... she took my knife and the camera, and she threw it away.
Yeah.<eos> Do you know how this box got here?<eos> No.<eos> Thank you for the last couple of days.<eos> I'll never forget it.
I guess Natalie was making money on her design.<eos> The blood here says it was involved in the attack.<eos> Same goes for this broken champagne glass.<eos> Left after the Hornet's trick shot.<eos> Confirms... somebody used it for a different kind of trick.
Who's this guy?<eos> The vest and the cane?<eos> I love it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cassie picked it out for me.
Fire!<eos> My baby's in that podium!<eos> Somebody call the fire department!<eos> There is no fire department.<eos> I sold it to pay for Bender's medal.
That's a great idea, like Columbus and his egg.<eos> You should use it.<eos> Thanks, but not this time.<eos> I'll keep the plans.<eos> After you use it, I'll use it too.
Let the man say his piece.<eos> It's a scheme, plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.<eos> The passes are too tight.<eos> I reckon them at more than 12 feet at their most narrow.<eos> Wide enough for a tub to traverse if a team of niggers cleared it out.
But...<eos> But she would have struggled to reach him from where she stood.<eos> Lucy stood... here.<eos> See the arc of arterial blood?<eos> The heart's beat projects it from his severed artery, strikes this wall, this wall, this window...
I haven't seen these in a while.<eos> So you and your girlfriend seem to be having a nice little reunion.<eos> Negative.<eos> Come on, she slipped you her cell number by texting you blood results.<eos> She sent it to you, too.
What about mine?<eos> Did you sell it?<eos> All right?<eos> Did you hand over our work?<eos> Did you hand it over to them?
Hey.<eos> Hey, man. Ahh.<eos> I brought some beers if you want to wash down that chicken.<eos> Oh, thanks, man, but...<eos> I already washed it down after I dropped it climbing up the ladder.
We ride the train into Stuttgart.<eos> We meet up with somebody called Kestrel at the opera house.<eos> Give him the message, retrieve our objective.<eos> The schematics for the bomb.<eos> We get it by any means necessary.
Good on you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You got a case file?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just got to sign off on some of the paperwork.<eos> Uh, I'll get it back to you. Huh? _
For instance, Schiller is meeting J.J. Johns at the gun exchange.<eos> Deals go bad.<eos> People die.<eos> But the money would still be sitting there, and the guns.<eos> Waiting for someone to take possession of it.
Uh, which is Lucy's locker?<eos> Number 116.<eos> Yeah?<eos> There.<eos> I had maintenance open it for you.
Then we're gonna go in and do what needs doing.<eos> Cobb will stay here with Ms. Hawkins.<eos> Anything goes wrong, he kills her.<eos> Slow.<eos> Maybe tears the baby out, kills it separate.
- Yeah.<eos> Incredible!<eos> Dusarque has all the appropriate paperwork co-opting my medallion and my ride log.<eos> The hubris!<eos> Didn't even bat an eye when he handed it over.
So work it, because you are worth it!<eos> June!<eos> Of course you're here.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I guess I always knew you had a drinking problem and I just didn't wanna see it.
You're the most responsible person I know...<eos> I mean, with money.<eos> Okay, all right, fine.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll put it in my account. And then when you really need something, I'll give it to you.
I want to be your partner in Barnes Global.<eos> Well, I think you've had enough champagne, don't you?<eos> You don't need to patronize me.<eos> If there's one thing losing my babies taught me it's that life is far too precious to continue trying to earn your love and respect.<eos> If I don't have it by now, then I guess I'm never gonna have it, am I?
mankind received a grim reminder. and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.<eos> get ready to fight!<eos> There's only one target!<eos> We will exterminate it and make this mankind's first outside base!
She said she doesn't need it.<eos> And Rosie was somewhat insulted.<eos> Well...<eos> That's nothing to fight over.<eos> If she doesn't need it, she doesn't need it.
Relatives, godparents...<eos> "We don't think he acted alone.<eos> How can we get him to give up the bangers""<eos> Thanks for the tip.<eos> I haven't given it to you.
"What you seek, poet, in the sunset?"<eos> Take that!<eos> Every night before bed, I read a poem.<eos> It is a way to shake dirt of the day, like a shower.<eos> And you'll learn it by memory?
Ezequiel stepped up and said he would pay the debt.<eos> He was supposed to meet me last night with the money, but he never showed.<eos> How much money?<eos> Ten grand.<eos> I'm never gonna see it now.
That's a little better.<eos> All right.<eos> There we go.<eos> All right.<eos> And now your buttons -- why don't you unbutton it?
Zev's inside.<eos> Fortunately or unfortunately, I've got Siegel.<eos> Lose him, Moz.<eos> I need a couple more minutes.<eos> Well, I'm not sure you'll have it.
Well, if there are holding anybody on board, it'll be hard to find 'em.<eos> Smugglers are a crafty lot.<eos> How do you think we get your French champagne into the country?<eos> Or that Russian caviar you're so partial to.<eos> Here I was thinking you picked it up from Victoria Markets, Bert.
What I'm going to do?<eos> Whatever you want, lover!<eos> What is it?<eos> You want your lipstick?<eos> Wait, I'll put it on you, come on.
!<eos> - I just ate a handful of this rat poison. - Why?<eos> !<eos> I thought it was trail mix.<eos> - Why do I keep it so close together?
I'm basically the office manager.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - Oh, I did everything.<eos> Everything!<eos> I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it.
Seems to be case closed.<eos> Right.<eos> Homicide, guy's luck ran out in the alley.<eos> Yeah, the casino pit boss sent one of his goons after the guy.<eos> The goon kills him, takes the money, and then he stashes it in a stereo speaker and then pawns it.
- Yeah.<eos> But in a minute, a Kazakhstani arms dealer is going to arrive in a nicer car and the Ferrari is going to be taken away and put in a multi-storey on the other side of Monaco.<eos> But we pull up there in a Bugatti Veyron and a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster, are you're saying something better is going to come along than that?<eos> In Monte-Carlo, I promise you, someone would turn up in the USS Enterprise and our cars would be in the multi-storey.<eos> It doesn't matter how good your car is, the valet parkers will ultimately take it away because something better always arrives.
He uploaded them.<eos> Always.<eos> I know this because I helped him set up his Cloudsaver Account online.<eos> [ Chuckles ] That was a 40-minute phone call.<eos> Anyway, uh, he takes the video of the kids he's scouting, and he uploads it to Cloudsaver so his bosses in Missouri stay synched up with him.
When did he tell you to move the money?<eos> - Late last night.<eos> - Where'd you take it?<eos> To a diamond wholesaler in Brooklyn.<eos> Courier's picking it up this afternoon.
Thank you, sir, you've done me a great... I'm sorry, but that's mine.<eos> Really?<eos> Please give the cigar back.<eos> What next!<eos> It's my cigar, I found it.
I must operate by Her Majesty's clock.<eos> - Oh, are you talking about Big Ben? - Ah?<eos> - Big Ben?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> Even though the Queen has her own astronomical watch, I fancy that sometimes even she will not resist the temptation to check it against Big Ben.
Oh, great.<eos> Here's my list.<eos> I was thinking of getting my mom a scarf.<eos> But that's what I got her last year.<eos> Does your beanstalk know you left it unattended?
Well, I was watching this show, and this blonde was trying to make love to all the boys, and when her friend find out, she made up a story so everyone would think she was the one making love to everyone.<eos> I didn't know that happened.<eos> Everyone today is just taking off their clothes, saying, "Let's make love." Like it's nothing.<eos> Well, I'm sure that was just the show, Nana.<eos> They have to do that so that people will watch it. They won't wanna watch if nothing shocking happens.
So how are we gonna do that?<eos> With that.<eos> Does anyone know how to fix a generator?<eos> I'll give it a try, but why?<eos> Okay, look, if we hook up the generator to those poles and put it in the water, we'll send a current that will drive the shark nuts, and it'll come check us out for sure.
I make 'em run laps. Now just do what you gotta do, keep the grass alive and get it installed.<eos> What's wrong with you, McArdle, huh?<eos> What, do you like getting hit or something?<eos> You know, that mirror's gonna cost at least 200.<eos> And I know you don't got it.
It's important.<eos> I wasn't asleep, anyway.<eos> You run out of dreams at my age, son.<eos> Come on in.<eos> If Gary wanted to lay low for a while, you know, maybe change his name, perhaps, what do you reckon he'd change it to?
Hey, Warren.<eos> That's Warren.<eos> Where's his uniform?<eos> We had a break-in last week.<eos> They took it.
Um, that's, like, the fourth time you've had to revive him tonight.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> His body has been through a lot.<eos> What are those tubes for?<eos> Uh, his body is filling with fluid, and those tubes are draining it.
Or what?<eos> Or hang out with Dr. Bellows.<eos> He can help.<eos> You have his number, don't you?<eos> Ugh. Yes, he gave it to us, but...
I'm sure she's doing well.<eos> I think so, too.<eos> Do I have everything?<eos> Put on your hat.<eos> In case you need it, my phone numbers in Jordan.
I know, Art, but there's nothing under that church.<eos> That's an old story.<eos> You find it, then.<eos> Tell you what, I'm gonna go down to Harlan County and talk to the outgoing sheriff, see if he can get us any info on Quarles.<eos> And if, along the way, I trip over $3 million, I'll bring it back to you.
Eight.<eos> Jimmy, that is not healthy.<eos> No, that is not healthy.<eos> You can only squeeze that little muscle down there so many times in your life.<eos> You don't want to wear it out in your 20s.
Hold your breath all you want... the DMV is not gonna give you back your driver's license.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Bongo.<eos> Dibs.<eos> Ask... just ask me to hand it to you.
According to his registrations, Captain, Mr. Hall and his father purchased all of his guns in the last three years from a guy named Dale Fisher, who works at a place in North Hollywood called Noho Guns and Ammo.<eos> I bet you this Dale would know how to get in touch with him.<eos> But why do they want to buy all these weapons?<eos> Normally, I'd say to sell guns to other sovereign citizens, but the volume and the trailer suggest they're running guns south of the border.<eos> So he collects money from these multiple ransom drops and uses it to order serious weapons.
The missing file from the United Equinox warehouse.<eos> Well, it's a list.<eos> Of what?<eos> Every Navy warship that contains the faulty wiring.<eos> They did sell it to the Navy.
Yeah, you were very missed.<eos> What is the white bucket you're carrying?<eos> What does it signify?<eos> Uh, white bucket is our $5 Friday bucket.<eos> And what we do is all the crew members who want to indulge put their names on a $5 bill, tuck it into the bucket here, and we have a winner for $5 Friday.
The consequences can be catastrophic.<eos> In 1994, a comet called Shoemaker-Levy 9 flew too close to Jupiter.<eos> Scientists watched the planet's immense gravity tear it apart.<eos> The remains headed straight toward Jupiter.<eos> Many people thought that the impacts wouldn't do anything to Jupiter, that Jupiter would just sort of swallow it up without a burp.
- Thank you very much.<eos> That was Eric Neal with the Minerals Management Service.<eos> - We have the statement.<eos> - We now have a statement from BP.<eos> We'll put it up on the screen for you.
We made contact and arranged a rendezvous in the Andromeda system.<eos> But Dreadwing must have intercepted the transmission, 'cause he got to Seaspray first.<eos> Proximity bomb was supposed to take us both out.<eos> Guess I should be glad that Jackhammer can take a punch.<eos> I picked up Dreadwing's ion trail and tracked it through a dozen solar systems before catching up with him.
- Give me a shawl.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> You don't meet me nowadays.<eos> So tell me where and when this deal is happening?<eos> Sarfaraz has the details, he has kept me out of it.
You mean call to ask if they have a dog?<eos> Yes.<eos> -If you're that allergic.<eos> Hey, why haven't you told me that the critics already have Schütz' book?<eos> Well, they do. I distributed it ahead of Schütz' visit.
But it is extremely dangerous.<eos> Think of everything on top of this sheet as the future. Where they are.<eos> When the Observers transport a shipment from their future to our present they drop them down a wormhole that they created.<eos> Because the wormhole is stable at both ends matter and energy in their future is unaffected, life goes on undisturbed.<eos> However if we were to collapse our end, sealing it off everything they put down the Wormhole will just weigh it down.
- You like it?<eos> I guess. I don't know.<eos> - What are we talking about?<eos> - I like it.<eos> I used to make it for my kids on Sunday nights.
In the bowl.<eos> Just put the money in the bowl.<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> I'd appreciate it if you did.<eos> $40,000, and I don't know who I'm giving it to?
I've got to go to this other meeting, but I need someone to take him to dinner.<eos> So you pimp out your daughter.<eos> No.<eos> I ask her to help me close a business deal.<eos> A reminder that the family business is dying and that we need this contract, and Oliver Queen can give it to us.
The typhoon tore off most of the dock.<eos> Use the money your wife brought to pay for the repair.<eos> I've already used the money to pay for a store and a house.<eos> Wait till I have some steady income.<eos> I'll use it to fix the dock.
I understand.<eos> Colin is your son.<eos> I know.<eos> Colin came with a strand of your hair, so I showed him the results.<eos> He looked at it for a long time, and asked, "Does this ahjusshi have a lot of money?"
Benny's blood was all over it.<eos> Killer must've been wearing it while he was cutting him up.<eos> The plastic distorted when it was exposed to the heat, encasing several items that were balled-up inside... leather gloves and a bloody rag with one eyelash attached.<eos> The poncho and the gloves protected the killer's clothing and hands from blood spatter but not their face.<eos> So they wiped their face with the rag, rolled it up inside the poncho with the gloves, and hoped that the car fire would destroy it.
But you know who does care about feelings in fishing?<eos> Those people fishing over on the left side of the lake.<eos> Yeah, you don't want to be catching a fish over there.<eos> If it's a big one, they'll confiscate it from you.<eos> They'll chop it up in little pieces and give it away to the people too lazy to learn how to fish.
The three of us are divas.<eos> Look at our idols.<eos> Whitney, Barbra, Patti LuPone.<eos> They all became stars while they were single.<eos> They took all the pain and loneliness, and they put it into their music.
- You can have his shot.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> We need another shot, please.<eos> - You can put these on me.<eos> - No, I told you, I had it.
Where did you find this?<eos> Nowhere special.<eos> You have more of these?<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> Eino give it to me.
Let's leave the West Bank story.<eos> It's going to swing, which means in New York it will go inside, but for the rest of the country it will go on the front page.<eos> You know, you look for that moment where you can really tell people, "Here's how the world's changing." Daniel Ellsberg:<eos> When I gave "The Pentagon Papers" to "The Times," there was a 22-month period from the start of my copying to it finally coming out.<eos> Had the internet existed then, I would have bought a scanner, sent it out to all the blogs.
Sure as hell didn't tell him that.<eos> So why'd he come here?<eos> Figured you guys wouldn't be looking for him here.<eos> Wanted money, clothes, my car.<eos> You give it to him?
Um... So sad about Brock, isn't it?<eos> - Sad.<eos> I'll tell you what's sad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Working hard, starting your own small business, and then the government comes along, taxes the hell out of it, and gives it to people just sitting on their butts.
A gray metallic Audi.<eos> Now, here's Stephanie's car. The photo used in court.<eos> It's what the valet testified looked like the car he saw racing off on the night of the murder.<eos> Now, they don't look much the same, do they?<eos> Until you put it at the scene and put it under the same fluorescent lighting.
You are the one with the broken-down-mustang...<eos> - Mr. Mid-Life-Crisis car...<eos> - All right.<eos> You never gave your kids, by the way.<eos> I'm still giving it to my kids.
I don't understand, how could we lose him?<eos> Let me make this very clear to you.<eos> If you and your husband are obstructing a murder investigation, you will both go to jail.<eos> That duck in your bathroom... it's real cute.<eos> Langley give it to you, or did Maria Ortiz?
Where are you going?<eos> To buy glue for the broken dish?<eos> Hold on I have extra strong glue I use to make accessories.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I won't touch it again.
I shouldn't say, how fast he was going.<eos> I was exceeding the speed limit.<eos> I could hear other police trying to catch up too.<eos> You could hear everybody talking about it.<eos> Where did you see it, where is it now, where it's going?
"has a million friends".<eos> You're not supposed to read those! They're not finished!<eos> They were definitely finished.<eos> So, I'm sorry, we're supposed to be satisfied because you checked his computer?<eos> No, we also set up 24-hour surveillance, and for that, I turn it over to Agent Dauz.
Yes,all of it,80 million-gone.<eos> How does Nikita do anything these days?<eos> She found the account on a black box.<eos> I transferred African relief money into our slush fund.<eos> We then converted it into bearer bonds,and she stole it.
But that's why I built this.<eos> All this mail belongs to the staff.<eos> They haven't picked it up in a long time.<eos> And this is my mail.<eos> I've been sorting it.
Do not worry!<eos> It is easy for you to do it.<eos> At least you won't smell the horse dung working here.<eos> These should be placed into storage as well.<eos> It took one year to transport it here...so be careful.
What?<eos> - You're serious, Charlie?<eos> - A loan.<eos> Couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.<eos> You know I'm good for it.
Shaw clears out all of his accounts three months ago, 20 million and change.<eos> But when we bust him, the money isn't on him.<eos> Wait.<eos> $20 million?<eos> There's a chance we'll get lucky and find it.
When did I do that?<eos> The development plan has not been decided yet.<eos> Why do we need to go to the ranch first?<eos> Because of the child 's side dishes.<eos> I'm afraid that it would be spoilt just leaving it there, that's why we're going.
Put a coat of paint on there, some sponsor decals.<eos> Look at the tread on the tire's still good, huh?<eos> We're in business.<eos> We paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?<eos> I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.
"spread your wings and fly"<eos> And "you deserve to be a champion."<eos> You're telling me that all you need<eos> Is $1,000 to do your dreams?<eos> Then I want you to have it.
We can talk some more then.<eos> So where are you gonna get that $3000?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know my old man doesn't have it.<eos> He wouldn't lend it to me if he did.
But I will sleep in my shorts.<eos> You wear these disgusting, threaded pyjamas.<eos> The thread provides a good grip.<eos> The pyjama doesn't come off while sleeping at night.<eos> That's why I wear it, sir.
Per year.<eos> Hang on...<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Alright.<eos> - And I want it now.
"Geez, we're so busy this month."<eos> "Fuck.<eos> And we've always wanted to see Italy.<eos> You know, "just put the baby in the freezer."<eos> "When we get back from the trip, we'll thaw it out."
"I mean...<eos> "I... I can't imagine what would be "so wrong with my ass."<eos> "What intestinal issues I would have<eos> "to need to stretch this much to pinch out a loaf?"<eos> "But if I had it outside, I wouldn't be shitting in public."
I think I'll go this way.<eos> Man!<eos> damn,**<eos> We searched the first clearing,I moved to the next one, immediately saw a leaning tree,a fallen tree, an upstanding tree,forming a triangle.<eos> Everybody was going to see it,i felt, so I had to get down and try to get it first.
Yeah, well, that's the nicest thing he does.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is somebody doing something there?<eos> Hodgins is doing a demonstration in his beaker.<eos> It's a fact that Russian "businessmen" add blue dye to tankers of clear alcohol and import it as glass cleaner, thus avoiding the high tariff on booze.
Check this out.<eos> This house has a sprinkler system.<eos> Hey, I was here during the fire.<eos> Believe me, the sprinklers weren't on.<eos> Maybe they shut it off during the renovation.
We'd been captured, tied up and kidnapped.<eos> And as if that weren't bad enough... we found ourselves on a plane headed to an unknown destination.<eos> - Where the hell are they taking us?<eos> - I don't know but I got a bad feeling.<eos> Ugh, every plane. Every plane there's gotta be a crying baby and a mother ignoring it.
I concur.<eos> Me, too.<eos> (quietly): You know I am Disappointed in you, Dwight Hendricks.<eos> Detectives, You are off this case.<eos> If I catch you near it, you are suspended.
Rebecca must have missed the second duffel bag under the bed when she went to pick up the money.<eos> Which is why Benny found it when he went back there later.<eos> Yeah, but we looked through Wilder's financials with a fine-tooth comb.<eos> There was nothing in there to suggest that he pulled that kind of cash.<eos> It's hard to imagine he had it just lying around.
You're..<eos> What about your salary?<eos> Did you get anything?<eos> No.<eos> Master said he'll give it on Monday.
From where did you get the money?<eos> -Money?<eos> The wretch is pretending.<eos> We confiscated an entire Rs.70, 000 from the attic.<eos> Where did you get it from?
But you still want to hear whatever I find out?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's appealing, running together, Peter.<eos> I respected you from afar.<eos> Well, you know that the state's attorney sets the goals for the department, but that it's the deputy that runs it, so...
It's difficult to see how it could have anything to do with us all.<eos> But despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish,<eos> Jupiter can, in fact, have a profound influence on our planet. And it's through a force that, well, surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together, gravity.<eos> Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature.<eos> It exists between all objects. And the effects of a gravitational field extend way beyond the planet that creates it.
It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> I miss him sometimes too.<eos> Is your foot getting bigger?<eos> No, no, I already know how to tie my shoes.<eos> Oh, you want to tie it?
Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I don't know how I ended up at my old High School.<eos> It was like a blackout, only I wasn't drinking. Have you been playing?<eos> There was a scrimmage the other day.<eos> That guy Doug was killing it.
Theoretically, of course.<eos> Can I have a cigarette?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's legal.<eos> Bought it myself.
I already promised her, so I'll help you.<eos> Aren't we gettin' in?<eos> Come.<eos> About the money as agreed, right? 1500 Euros.<eos> Yeah... but I don't have it on me right now.
I thought it was the only way to get what I wanted.<eos> I guess I didn't realize what I already had.<eos> You still have this little number.<eos> Wish 16.<eos> All those years I saved it for something really special.
Mm-hmm. You ever been on a campus?<eos> Not as a student.<eos> And yet you have three MBAs and two doctorates.<eos> Clearly something wrong with the system.<eos> Too bad you faked it.
Poor guy was on the way to work.<eos> You know, the driver was probably on, like, A senior's cocktail.<eos> I've seen that before.<eos> Senior's cocktail?<eos> Yeah, my grandmother was on it.
You know, you really ought to watch what you say, 'cause you never know who might be listening.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You speak Navajo?<eos> And five other fairly useless languages.<eos> So I'm never gonna make a million dollars, unless I take it from you.
And I'm sorry about yesterday...<eos> Mike and Frances and you had to take the money back.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> God, I wish you could have been there!<eos> I threw down 20 after 20 and I told her. And her uptight fucking colleagues to shove it up their ass.
Who is this?<eos> Dr. Takasaki<eos> So when Henry tipped it over all this stuff just poured out.<eos> The samurai Trojan horse.<eos> Takasaki used it to sneak in the fakes and smuggle out the originals.
- Romanian stuffed peppers.<eos> I know it's no Shredded Wheat, but I think I did an OK job.<eos> Payson, this is... this is fantastic.<eos> I haven't had this dish since...<eos> Since your mother used to make it after a big meet?
They were giving out free jungle gyms.<eos> My grandfather donated the first teeter-totter To central park in 1907.<eos> Must be very gratifying to continue his work.<eos> Oh, indeed.<eos> Children in underprivileged communities Can make a wish, and we grant it.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Organised Crime get the result they want - end of story, as far as they're concerned.<eos> 'Yeah, any chance of getting something' to eat?<eos> '<eos> So, you owned the snooker hall in 2008, and then you sold it?

That's rice paper.<eos> Bookies use it 'cause it's water soluble.<eos> What you do is, you write your bet on a piece of paper like this, then you leave it somewhere for your bookie to retrieve it.<eos> My bookie's drop box was downtown.<eos> Then the end of the day, after he's paid out all his bets, puts a bunch of these in a bucket, douses it with water.
Angel! These are perfect!<eos> Listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.<eos> You haven't? !<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Twilight, I would just like to ask... I mean, if it would be all right if you haven't given it to someone else...
Where we serve paella?<eos> No paella!<eos> French cuisine!<eos> You'll need capital, let's say a million francs.<eos> You don't have it, so you issue 10,000 shares.
Great, we got up this truck!<eos> Hey, I'm driving!<eos> No, let me drive!<eos> Look, they're getting into your car.<eos> I gave it away.
Hey, I'm driving!<eos> No, let me drive!<eos> Look, they're getting into your car.<eos> I gave it away.<eos> How come you gave it away, if that car is ours?
Αnd yoi look like a νillain in a B-grade Ηinti moνie.<eos> You haνe no idea how νillainous I can be.<eos> What will you drink?<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> Ηaνe it. Liquor and blood. I take it when I want it.
- You shredded them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Bob... - But the disk...<eos> Uh, yeah, shredded that, too.<eos> But she backed it up on Raymundo's computer.
What?<eos> What, did you give her one of those phones?<eos> It means public displays of affection?<eos> Where are his pants and his blazer?<eos> I will make sure he wears it to the play.
It was the lamest thing anyone has ever said to anyone.<eos> And the worst thing about texting is that once you send it...<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No!<eos> ...you can never get it back.
I would select the crows that were bigger, make them smaller and blurrier, so, to the eye, they seem farther away.<eos> Then, select the clouds and do the same thing.<eos> The result being that you can better see the field.<eos> So it's the same in audiology... we just shrink the sounds we don't want to hear, so that the sounds we do want to hear become foreground.<eos> We use filters to diminish or blur noise, identifying each unwanted sound by its frequency and discriminating against it.
Now, what was in it?<eos> I told you, it was the meaning of--<eos> Of love?<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Why don't you just give it to Whitmore before someone else gets hurt?
Burt!<eos> "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 'Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"'<eos> And please pass the corn.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Do you want the body so you can cover it up?
So if we can't talk to Frank, ? we've no way of finding out who he stole the necklace for.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> We just sit and wait around for whoever put Frank in hospital comes and finds us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And when they do, they'll think WE nicked it.
Our love for each other may not appeal to you,<eos> Mr. Holland, but it is genuine nonetheless.<eos> If my dear Mr. Ramsbury could come to terms with it, I'm sure you can.<eos> Your affairs are none of my business.<eos> This hospital is and you have attacked it.
There were 20 people to one room.<eos> Would you check that I have a fresh supply of cocaine solution?<eos> There are 15 grains in the drug cupboard.<eos> No, I had to flush it.<eos> It looked like someone had already opened it.
I went through your stupid bag.<eos> Hag?<eos> But look at what I found.<eos> The family wand and the book of Forbidden Spells.<eos> Justin took it out of the lair without permission.
But look at what I found.<eos> The family wand and the book of Forbidden Spells.<eos> Justin took it out of the lair without permission.<eos> My respect for you is increasing.<eos> I didn't take it.
The family wand and the book of Forbidden Spells.<eos> Justin took it out of the lair without permission.<eos> My respect for you is increasing.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> Dad gave it to me.
I don't know, pete.<eos> I'm about to operate on noah's wife.<eos> And i like her.<eos> I really like her.<eos> And their marriage is on the rocks, And the only thing holding it together is this baby,
Everything has been for your sake.<eos> And who decides that?<eos> Who the hell says that everything is for us?<eos> I have never once thought, that you've done anything for our sake.<eos> Your world of happiness, who do you think gave it to you?
See if you can get him to throw that heating pad on his ears. Heard that.<eos> How?<eos> So, uh, there's a big playoff game coming up, huh?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we grabbed the last spot when we won Sunday.<eos> After you went down, Evan filled in and really tore it up. Oh, that's nice.
An obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will Orson.<eos> Hey, it's not over yet.<eos> You still got a couple of hurdles.<eos> Has Orson brought up the insurance claim again?<eos> No, he thinks I filed it.
How soon can you meet me at 115 Highland?<eos> Be there in 10.<eos> I don't know who you are, what you think you're doing, but you're done lying to me.<eos> Involving civilians in operations... is dangerous but sometimes necessary.<eos> I want two grand in cash... - and your car stays right here until I get it.
Patrick Fuller in bed with Julie?<eos> That takes some imagining, that does.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to go.<eos> Sir, the earring.<eos> The bloke who made it was in Birmingham when we were doing the rounds.
Bitch.<eos> I can't believe she took the money.<eos> Yeah, bullshit like that comes in all the time clogs up the waiting room, slows everybody down.<eos> It wasn't even my 20.<eos> I got it off a dead guy in the morgue.
Have you even looked at any of the investment plans that I sent to you?<eos> I only got the money last week.<eos> Um...haven't had time.<eos> Well, every day it sits, you're losing income.<eos> I mean, even if we just put it all in bonds, it'll kick off at like 3 1/2%, tax-free.
The secret of magic is misdirection, Mr. Casten.<eos> Magician, what are you doing on my phone?<eos> Misdirection.<eos> So you went after the incriminating reports.<eos> And I deleted it.
- Hey, new guy, how's it going?<eos> Well, I'm worried.<eos> - I haven't been on the show the last two weeks.<eos> - Good stuff.<eos> Listen, every Christmas, I collect money from the staff and give it to the cleaning ladies.
Obama said he was going to abolish the Patriot Act;<eos> he now vigorously defends it.<eos> We saw the same type of flip-flop when it came to warrantless wiretapping of the American people.<eos> Look what Obama's done with wiretapping, surveillance.<eos> He's brought it to heights even beyond what George Bush... the disgusting levels that he brought it to.
Hmm, nate, If your comment that<eos> "they might be miffed" constitutes trying to stop me, I suggest you learn More forceful techniques of self-assertion.<eos> Not that I would have listened.<eos> People, this is an office.<eos> Insofar as you have equipment necessary to your duties, You'll find it in your desks.
The Mercedes S63 has turned up, that's the other car I was going to test, and that sort of puts Stigs on heat.<eos> That S-class is actually the AMG tuned version.<eos> Apparently it's a bit of a rocket ship, I can see why Stig's got the red mist.<eos> Luckily, Stig's a bit too stupid to work out where all the driver aids are on this.<eos> Oh no, he's found it.
You are 0.2 of a second faster than a chef.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> But you are the fastest Australian.<eos> Is there a wet track Ashes I can take back to Australia?<eos> Tell you what, we'll burn the car and put it in a little thing, you can take it back and Australia can have some ashes.
Whose? James's.<eos> That's his second car of the day.<eos> James... Are there any cars you won't destroy?<eos> How many cars have you destroyed today?<eos> I didn't destroy it.
Huh?<eos> After we make fake DNA test results, what do we do with that?<eos> First, we write the 'receiver' in the son's name, as if he paid for it.<eos> And then?<eos> Then we make sure that the father-in-law reads it.
No, don't.<eos> I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me.<eos> She loves to sue, she loves lawsuits.<eos> You know, honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.<eos> - You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?<eos> Could be.<eos> Turns out he's missing too.<eos> And normally I'd say someone did the world a favor.<eos> But our snitch's car, turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab, they come back, they tell us it is the purest they've ever seen.
You sold us the burnt ones. No way!<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll give you a discount.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Get it cheap.
- Much.<eos> Smitty's 83, one of the old-timers.<eos> He was the coach of the Olympic weight-lifting team back then.<eos> Was it ever thought of as cheating at that point? No.<eos> No, because we figured everybody was taking it.
But I've brought it.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Tremendous work, Freddy McNernie.<eos> You see, all the devil's powers were contained in this diamond.<eos> And now that we have stolen it, all evil will slowly drain from the Earth.
He needs all the help that we can give.<eos> I'm not running a charity.<eos> I know.<eos> Just... give him a couple more days.<eos> If he doesn't have it, I expect the money from you.
When Bill Belichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do?<eos> He videotaped the opposing team's defense.<eos> Think of the defense as your test.<eos> When taking a test you must also videotape the defense<eos> Learn what's on the test before they give it to you.
I found a buyer for the SUV.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> it turns out that mechanic is serious about how much he loves Carmer's death-mobile.<eos> He wants to buy it.<eos> And he's willing to pay us $500 more than we paid Carmer, which is a good thing because I think we're going to need it.
That repugnant little moppet landed on my doorstep one day with fake adoption papers and a promise.<eos> If I did as she said, she'd get me tenure at the university.<eos> What did she have you do?<eos> Our lab equipment is all physics department property.<eos> Tenure was just a lie she used to get me to steal it.
If I did as she said, she'd get me tenure at the university.<eos> What did she have you do?<eos> Our lab equipment is all physics department property.<eos> Tenure was just a lie she used to get me to steal it.<eos> She blackmailed me for stealing it.
- Where?<eos> - There.<eos> - Cool,huh?<eos> Hey,ouanmeo ftou syocasee inside?<eos> - How about I knock it down with a perfect spiral?
- You're obliged to tell the truth.<eos> - Come closer.<eos> Doesn't she look lovely?<eos> - You're wearing lipstick and mascara.<eos> - Should I take it off?
There is so much wolf hair in our apartment right now, man.<eos> But why are you eating it?<eos> Well, you ingest everything.<eos> Both of you are eating wolf?<eos> Have you tried it before?
My mom took it.<eos> You can ask her for it.<eos> Nah, nah, man.<eos> My deal was with you.<eos> Well, I don't have it.
Hey, my ass is not for kicking but touching.<eos> Why don't you treat customer better! ?<eos> Hey, you...<eos> Customer?<eos> We sell it for 100, but you only charge 50.
AM I RIGHT?<eos> THIS TIME, NATE...<eos> I THINK THERE'S JUST ENOUGH ROPE FOR TWO.<eos> THERE'S NO WAY TO FAKE THE NUMBERS ON THAT CHIP.<eos> YOU FAKED IT BEFORE.
There's always a part of you that goes, I never want to go.<eos> There are no parts like this.<eos> I think it's a good time for me to move on and we've got the 50th anniversary.<eos> It's the biggest year in the show's history.<eos> And I'm playing the part and I pass it on with... With a smile to the next guy and... I say good luck, buddy.
[ Laughs ]<eos> But the greatest temperature problem was not keeping the iintensely cold liquid fuels insulated from each other.<eos> It was keeping both of them from boiling in the hot Florida sun.<eos> BINNS: We insulated the liquid-hydrogen tank in the early days with a honeycomb insulation.<eos> We put it on in big vacuum chambers, and we sucked the honeycomb down onto the metal, pulled it tight, and let the adhesive set.
Here, there was a set between the whole numbers and the infinite decimals.<eos> It was an incredibly daring solution.<eos> Cohen's proof seemed true, but his method was so new that nobody was absolutely sure.<eos> There was only one person whose opinion everybody trusted.<eos> There was a lot of scepticism and he had to come and make a trip here, to the Institute right here, to visit Godel. And it was only after Godel gave his stamp of approval in quite an unusual way, He said, "Give me your paper", and then on Monday he put it back in the box and said, "Yes, it's correct."
- Sure.<eos> Can we watch a soccer game instead of basketball?<eos> What are you, nuts?<eos> Sophie says soccer's the most popular sport in the world.<eos> Well, then they don't need us to watch it.
How to say?<eos> Excuse<eos> He's my son.<eos> Have uploaded on this train?<eos> Do you find it?
Anything at all.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Oh, Troy? He just dropped off some? for my new flip.<eos> And he gave it to me for free.
With all this magnetobacteria running around fucking up tantalum capacitors, there's gonna be a panic and the market for raw coltan is going to skyrocket.<eos> Whoever's sitting on a supply is looking to make a killing.<eos> That shipment alone could be worth billions.<eos> And it's out there somewhere, on a fleet of 18-wheelers.<eos> It's just a matter of time till we track it down.
Did I not ask you to go to the store?<eos> What -- what did you do with the cash that I gave you?<eos> No,let me see your eyes.<eos> Oh,great.<eos> You smoked it.
Butterflies.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> All right, everyone, if you wanna gather around, I trust you've been briefed.<eos> You all know that the big bang device is in danger melting down.<eos> And the people who built it are incapacitated.
Not the rats they feed all that artificial sweetener to see how long it'll take them to explode.<eos> Did you say 18?<eos> That's all of them.<eos> I never would've spotted them without this headgear.<eos> - Mind if I keep it? - Yes.
Okay,but I'm not seeing a connection to blue eyes or our bodega suspect.<eos> Veterinarians send the pets to tattoo artists-- places that you and I go.<eos> I mean,well,I would go- - I mean...<eos> Uh,anyways,I located several establishments,and one place in particular offered me a special on eyeball tattooing.<eos> We're the only ones who do it.
Please, you're my last chance on earth.<eos> Can I help you otherwise? - How?<eos> - I could get some money.<eos> - I can get a few thousand dollars.<eos> In time, if it'll help and you'll accept it.
How long has he been standing like that?<eos> Ever since the Dark Times came. When the Dark Times pass, he'll come down.<eos> - Do the bandits bother you?<eos> - They showed up once, looked around And said he's worse off here than in prison...<eos> We've brought some fine bread to him for a holiday and he sent it back in a waste bucket...
What is it?<eos> Um, I'm the owner of the cellphone you found<eos> I know, I already saved your number<eos> All the addresses of the people in my phone are gone<eos> I deleted it.
Everyone in this room continues to try to find reasons to pursue this foolishness,<eos> yet no one will ask the bigger question.<eos> Should we even carry out this operation?<eos> And the worst of it, the world will see this folly for exactly what it is, a CIA operation, start to finish.<eos> What business do we have to mount an invasion of a country Just because the Kennedys are pissed off at the guy who runs it?
I don't want it anymore, OK!<eos> ?<eos> What do you take us for?<eos> I don't want it!<eos> Can I give it away as a gift?
I don't know what you're talking.<eos> Everyone feels this way about the media.<eos> Everyone.<eos> No.<eos> People may say they hate it, but they really love it.
We don't want any problems.<eos> We just want you to pay back what you owe.<eos> You're right, I do have it.<eos> But it's my rent money.<eos> And if I give it to you, then my husband's gonna know that I'm gambling again, and he'll take my kids.
Suspects.<eos> What's the case?<eos> A crime...<eos> They're a couple of guys who might be connected to the Garza murder.<eos> Who asked you to look into it?
How do we make... your show?<eos> I thought y'all would know where to get cameras and stuff.<eos> I think he means, "How much do you want for it?"<eos> Oh. As far as compensation goes, I would like to be officially the head of the pages, and I need a new clock radio.<eos> You've got it up there, now snap it off.
So far what we do know is...<eos> Someone died exactly the way described in your book.<eos> Do you keep any of your old fan mail ?<eos> No.<eos> I don't even read it.
- All right.<eos> Well, before I came over tonight I put a toothbrush in my purse.<eos> What's so embarrassing about that?<eos> I don't go anywhere without floss.<eos> In fact, sometimes I'll snap off 18 inches and tuck it in my pocket in case, you know, I have a stubborn - Oh.
- See what you can do, please. - Right.<eos> - Why would you want to contact them?<eos> - To negotiate.<eos> It's a waste of energy.<eos> We need to figure out how to destroy it.
It's not yours, is it?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> He has a thing for shoes.<eos> I don't know where he got this shoe.<eos> He, just had it when I got back from our vacation.
Well, I guess that means I saved your life.<eos> Come inside, we'll talk about it there.<eos> No.<eos> You just... Just give me five green and I am gone.<eos> I'll give it to you inside.
- You are welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi, Mom...<eos> Not too early?<eos> I found a buyer for a good price, and want to show it to him.
I'm sure you guys'll find your way back to one another someday.<eos> Jim ... I am really sorry.<eos> Oh yeah, don't worry about it.<eos> I'm going to give you a peace of paper.<eos> I want you to write down how much you want, And I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
I can get for you 50 cents on the dollar.<eos> 60 grand.<eos> 55 would work but that includes shipping to Jersey.<eos> We look like fucking UPS?<eos> Look, you send the truck up north, we send it back loaded.
- Well, that's great.<eos> - Will you shut up, please?<eos> long enough for me to mirandize him.<eos> You got the right to remain silent.<eos> Got it.
Speak, where's the money?<eos> I don't know<eos> I didn't betray you<eos> I was only responsible for the explosives<eos> I didn't know you used it to rob an armored truck
But then I saw her car coming out,<eos> I thought what the heck, and followed the car,<eos> And I saw it hit a Jaguar,<eos> But it just turned around,<eos> I thought it was strange, so I followed it again,
Your work... is very dangerous...<eos> and alive... and I love your poems.<eos> They move me.<eos> But that's not who you really are.<eos> You're running away from... your past and your pain... and yet you keep it so close to you.
It's a voluntary organisation that encourages the industry to be as environmentally friendly as, under the circumstances, such an industry can be.<eos> Unilever, which uses palm oil in many of its products, is a founder member.<eos> The mission of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil is to promote the use of sustainable palm oil.<eos> In order to do that, we needed to define what we mean with sustainable palm oil.<eos> And in order to do that, we need to balance the interests of those who are interested in nature conservation, and the interests of those whose livelihoods depends on the production of palm oil, and the interests of those who use palm oil, put it in their products and sell it to consumers.
Let me tell you something, Council.<eos> This shithead's in the wind, and he ain't coming back.<eos> But if it happened here, the answer's here.<eos> And we're gonna shut this place down like East fucking Berlin until somebody gives it up.<eos> Now, all I want to know is are you working Armstrong or just protecting it?
And to me, they kind of, like, set things and... kind of screwed up the art market, I think.<eos> Because now everything's worth something, and... some paintings aren't worth what people are asking.<eos> Whether he can achieve a 25 million dollar price point... solely on the basis of a fingerprint... you know, remains to be seen.<eos> Twenty-five million dollars?<eos> I don't have it, but sure, why not?
Whether he can achieve a 25 million dollar price point... solely on the basis of a fingerprint... you know, remains to be seen.<eos> Twenty-five million dollars?<eos> I don't have it, but sure, why not?<eos> If you can get it... more power to you.<eos> Does she deserve it?
Lf, as Myatt suspects Teri's painting is authentic... then how did it get from Pollock's studio to a thrift shop in California?<eos> Pollock was an absolute madman.<eos> I mean, he'd give pictures away to anybody.<eos> If you were in his studio one night and you were drunk... he was drunk... and you said " Hey, you know, can I have that?" He'd say " Take it home."<eos> He'd give it for food. He'd give it for airplane rides to go visit his mother.
Good.<eos> I want you to remember this feeling.<eos> I want you to feel.<eos> I'm not going to, will I.<eos> Your pain your synapses I couldn't control it.
Like, was that the big payoff?<eos> Like, "Ha, ha, dick hairs glued on his face"?<eos> - Is it itching?<eos> - It's in my mouth.<eos> Why'd you put it in your mouth?
- This is important.<eos> She said it was a transcript of a call she had with David Palmer.<eos> I'm sure when she said that she believed it.<eos> If this document finds its way into the wrong hands, you'll be responsible.<eos> - I didn't take it.
Because if he was born here, we can keep him.<eos> Booth, stop!<eos> She's frightened enough.<eos> - We have a double murder.<eos> - She didn't do it.
The woman has a heart condition, she's on her own.<eos> A man can't nail his office assistant, it's national crisis time.<eos> Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-Iabel use of medication?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'II pay for it.
Can you imagine anything worse than being homeless and pregnant?<eos> Gourmet Coffee Shop 108 West 91st Street Friday, December 9<eos> Gonna spend five bucks on a cup of coffee in there.<eos> You can get it at the Korean deli for 75 cents.<eos> Give the extra four bucks and a quarter to somebody who really needs it.
- Can I smoke?<eos> - Yes, you can smoke.<eos> - Just tell me... - Forensics!<eos> Love it!<eos> Always loved it!
Yes. I have...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me....<eos> essentially, yes, I have taken...<eos> I'm told that there has been some interest in forming a union, and that Michael supported it.
If you didn't find it, and it didn't reveal itself...<eos> Once the hive left Atlantis, the worm began to destroy all of the data they had sent down.<eos> Then this was their plan all along.<eos> What did they get?<eos> This is one of the reasons we didn't detect it.
Perfect.<eos> Mainly because I have no idea what a tennis bracelet is.<eos> Let me finish up getting these things on.<eos> I'll take you in and show it to you.<eos> I left them in the car so Rory wouldn't find it.
Well, I don't know if you want to know this, but I saw that bag earlier at Anna's store.<eos> That bag?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How do you know it was the same exact bag?<eos> There must be millions of places who sell it.
Look, we're running out of room in my truck.<eos> And that light in the window- that's the sun.<eos> Look at the gold leafing on these pillars.<eos> We can't take the pillars, Wayno.<eos> New owner will strip it down, slap a coat of white gloss over the whole thing.
- What do you say to that, Kody?<eos> - You know, I want the man in charge.<eos> Not the Field Commander, the one who makes the final decision.<eos> That's me, Kody.<eos> If I ask for a plane and a million dollars, you just give it to me?
No, I knew Link Hofstadter.<eos> I knew his family.<eos> He was a fine young man.<eos> You want to know what really happened that night?<eos> I come to work on time for 18 years, damn you, took crap from customers who let me carry their refrigerator to the damn door and then got nervous when I took it inside.
Um... him.<eos> Look, guys, I'm cooperating, all right?<eos> I will give back the money.<eos> I will quit my job.<eos> How's about we just call it even?
Oh, fudge...<eos> - I've got a casting!<eos> - Again?<eos> What about the glue?<eos> - Did you get it?
I woulda heard about that.<eos> Gotta nice watch though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Retails for 3,700.<eos> I'll give it to you guys for six bills.
No,ma!<eos> Is that door locked?<eos> Yeah,it's locked.<eos> So this money's all mine?<eos> I'm five grand short, but I'll get it to you as soon as I can.
We've lost contact<eos> The trouble is we know almost nothing about the missing bay ship's status<eos> We received a garbled distress call, then silence<eos> Not surprisingly, their hybrid sent us a confusing set of data<eos> Our hybridis analyzing it
- This is Phoenix, do you read?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Kheel and McMullen, I remember those names.<eos> - They're in the Prophet Five archive.<eos> - Pulling it up now.
I guess he did.<eos> Hey guys, he's betting two hundred for whoever finishes the pie in twenty seconds.<eos> Twenty seconds?<eos> Anyone can do that!<eos> Whoever eats it can take it.
You haven't won yet, Batman.<eos> Two against one. Piece of cake.<eos> I'll create another army of Everywhere Men.<eos> With the same result.<eos> Then I'll recall it and start over as many times as I have to.
Look.<eos> Comes from a clean mountain stream.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which contains fecal matter from animals.<eos> No bones in it, though, is there?
You should sit awhile.<eos> No, I'm fine!<eos> Standing's no problem.<eos> All right, but from now on, no more serving heavy food -- your meat loaves, your bowls of stew.<eos> Somebody who orders that-- let Caesar carry it.
I'm finding references to a freedom from technology brigade, a fringe group that's showing up lately.<eos> Anything else in the note?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's a not very artistic drawing of what kind of looks like a... robot with an arrow through it.<eos> I'm uploading it to you now.
So you're still pursuing Cotterdam?<eos> Have you looked into it?<eos> A little.<eos> I agree with you, the Special Branch report is shoddy.<eos> I'll get on to it, get them to explain what is going on.
Okay, yeah, I did.<eos> Some kind of staple fiber, got Kevlar in it.<eos> It's Nomex.<eos> It's a flame resistant material used in military gloves.<eos> SWAT uses it as well.
The only shot I got is this.<eos> This thing takes worse pictures than you do,McGee.<eos> They went to a lot of trouble to get the chip back.<eos> Like you said, It's the only evidence we have.<eos> They know we can link it to 'em. How?
Let's say this woman's husband came here, found a job, maybe one on the books.<eos> His first thought is to reunite the family.<eos> But he doesn't ask for a legal permit because he'd have to wait too long.<eos> So he tries to find a shortcut.<eos> He borrows some money and gives it to the boat men to pay for his wife to be illegally brought here.
- The family of the pilot that we killed.<eos> - What?<eos> We disposed of the bodies. Yes.<eos> A relative showed up at the house and became suspicious when no one was home.<eos> - He called the police who are looking into it.
You know what?<eos> Not only am I going to that dance, but I'll bet each of you 20 bucks I also get boob.<eos> - Bring back the bra to prove it? - I'll do you one better.<eos> I'll wear it back.<eos> No, actually, I'll just bring it.
- Look...<eos> - Jesus, look at the size of her.<eos> - What has she done?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Heineman told me that he took the money I gave him, the $1500 and gave it to his daughter and didn't tell me why.
So, radio control?<eos> Thought control.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... who's controlling it, then?
I know he doesn't look 13, but having kids will do that to you.<eos> She's not my daughter.<eos> She's my sister.<eos> I can work you out a great deal on the television, the sofa, dining room set.<eos> You get it today, I'm gonna save you some money.
One last note- the only other person who knows about all this stuff is my brother-in-law russell.<eos> And he thinks I'm nuts.<eos> I don't understand. Wilmore and casey can't clear the roads because the equipment's broken?<eos> because we don't have it.<eos> The city's using it all.
I found digital recording chips in three surveillance cameras... installed by two guys in our installation crew, Jones and Nelson.<eos> See?<eos> When you did your surveillance camera overlay, you got me to thinkin'.<eos> I'm sorry, Ed, you lost me.<eos> I looked into it, and I found that the Indian casinos and the riverboat... were designed by the same team that redesigned the Montecito.
I have this license plate number I need to check for this case I'm working on.<eos> I think it might be a rental car.<eos> Well, to be honest, the police usually handle that kind of thing.<eos> You know, I used to work over there.<eos> Why don't you give it to me and I'll call it over and see what I can find out.
No signs of sexual violation whatsoever.<eos> She will, however, be missing her heart.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He takes their hearts.<eos> Carves it right out of their chest.
It's the same with a radio code<eos> If this key sent out the same signal every time, well then,it would be easy for someone else to intercept it<eos> With a rolling code the pitcher needs to mix it up<eos> Okay,he's throwing curveballs he's throwing sliders so if the remote's sending a different signal then how does the car understand it?<eos> The change is predictable as long as you know the algorithm that generates it
In fact, why do you even need them?<eos> Oh, yeah, didn't I tell you?<eos> She's giving us the place.<eos> So just hand them over, really.<eos> She gave it to you?
Blow the whistle on your own escape?<eos> He'll be back.<eos> Those guys.<eos> They go before us tonight, they use that hole, it's over.<eos> CO's will turn this whole place upside down till they find it.
- How we gonna get her out?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I send units to recover that body, you and Antwon'll be waist-deep in shit too.<eos> Try to move it, I'll nail it in transit.
Holla.<eos> Holla.<eos> I got a murder for you two.<eos> 65-year-old white female, shot during a home invasion.<eos> - Run it through Vic.
Allina.<eos> This is going to work.<eos> I think it just might.<eos> It's a layout... of the sudarian villages.<eos> The walls of this monastery have protected it for 10,000 years.
They showed up by ship, and dropped some sort of device by the Gate as we were leaving.<eos> I've seen it before. They're tagging the planet.<eos> If we're going to evacuate Atlantis, we're going to need a new place to go.<eos> That planet was supposed to be uninhabited.<eos> What did the Wraith want with it? I don't know.
It's not Bihari it's Vihari, Dr. Vih' ari!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> First change your name.<eos> His name is giving me jitters, go out.<eos> My condition is vey serious for a month, whether it's my wife, children, CM or PM calling on phone, don't give it to me.
Wolfowitz' anger is fundamentally an anger against the weakness of American liberalism:<eos> the compromising nature of a man like George Bush senior.<eos> His willingness to make concessions, to negotiate, not to drive to the bitter end.<eos> And his anger is motivated, interestingly less by hatred of Saddam Hussein, than by hatred of American liberals who are a source of weakness, and a source of rot, and a source of relativism that had been corroding American society for decades.<eos> Faced by this defeat, the neoconservative movement now turned inwards to try and defeat the forces of liberalism that were holding it back.
If animals are machines, then the way to find out how the culgris that make them take actually work is to start cutting them open, to make the flesh and blood speak and that is exactly what he did to eyes.<eos> If he could show that the eyes were a machine, then, he argued, that would be proof enough on which to stand his entire theory.<eos> What we have here, cat's eye ball, and I just trim off the spare tissue around it.<eos> This is exactly what Descartes would have to do.<eos> He said he scrapped it off on his pair of scissors.
The whole area was built for the brick factory employees. As a recreation area.<eos> But when they closed down we wanted to buy the cabins.<eos> - The entire building is empty now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> There were a few small businesses there, they used it mostly as a warehouse.
You don't have to tell this one which sIingbacks go with which frock.<eos> Owns her own cosmetics company.<eos> Empire, actually.<eos> Started out doing facials in a fancy salon.<eos> Took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya, put it on the market, and bingo:
Spit 'em out.<eos> He was a weird kid, eh?<eos> He was from Japan or something.<eos> Anyway, he made us sushi just out of these mats.<eos> Just put this rice down and just rolled it up in the mat.
- We have been developing a ... - Cole!<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> It's the frigging blob.<eos> They're in love with this thing. We got to fucking kill it.
I wanted to create an artificial space. I wanted a human face without a background.<eos> First, I captured the energy in the streets of Ginza.<eos> Then I got rid of the background so you focus on their face.<eos> I was already doing these things.<eos> And this book, I titled it '70s Faces because I shot it in the '70s.
- Give me my money!<eos> - You're killing the golden goose. Fine!<eos> - Right now!<eos> That's all I want.<eos> You're pissing me off so much, I'm going to give it to you.
Better her than me.<eos> Anybody in this room that's ever been in love will testify to this shit.<eos> If you haven't contemplated murder, you ain't been in love.<eos> If you haven't seriously thought about killing the motherfucker, you ain't been in love.<eos> If you haven't had a can of rat poison in your hand and looked at it for 45 minutes straight, you ain't been in love.
It's real cornflower.<eos> Seval and Larisa went to Visoko and her father went to the mill to grind it.<eos> - Really?<eos> This is your plate.<eos> That's why I brought it!
And only one post train from Kiev used to stop once a day at our station in August, 1929.<eos> Sometime at night.<eos> For two minutes.<eos> And in the morning we found out that some family left Tulchin forever.<eos> Me, in contrast to others, was never jealous of it.
A knife.<eos> I know it's a knife.<eos> What you doing with a knife?<eos> Soldier gave us them.<eos> What do you mean, a soldier gave it to you?
What are you going to do?<eos> Stop the other paradines from finding this place.<eos> Who knows what they'll do to me?<eos> They will be grateful you have restored it.<eos> They'll be furious i invaded it.
What do you mean by that?<eos> Well, we hired a clown - squirting flower, big floppy shoes and all that - what we got was a smackdown.<eos> Doodles was going through his clown bit, and, uh, then this mime comes through our kitchen, which at first we thought it was part of the act.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> So, uh, I jumped in and broke it up and dragged the Mime into the kitchen.
I give advice.<eos> On relationships.<eos> I'm sorry, dear.<eos> I just never figured you for the advice-giving type.<eos> You certainly never took it.
Brownish like.<eos> I put 'em in my tea.<eos> Well, if it's the monthly's, I generally prescribe a day or two of laudanum against the cramps.<eos> Coming off the laudanum's what had me crampy.<eos> Then you used it for more than a few days.
Did you buy us any presents?<eos> Oh, God, presents.<eos> Wait up. Let me see.<eos> - Ohhh! - Yeah!<eos> But I'm not giving it to you unless you promise to go outside right now and practise throwing for 20 minutes. - Yeah! Yeah!
I took a nap there once, but just on the couch.<eos> Well, you sure knew a lot of details.<eos> How did you know what to say? Gran read all the stories about him in the papers.<eos> She cut them out, made a scrapbook.<eos> She quizzed me from it every day.
No, ma'am.<eos> Each of you will need to provide a statement detailing what you saw.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like Lieutenant Johnson's service record and the personal effects from his locker.<eos> I'll have it in your office as soon as possible.
Hard not to love that.<eos> Maybe it'll fix in conference, or we can proclaim it National Veto Month.<eos> -The president's not gonna veto it. -He won't sign it.<eos> It's grand theft.<eos> They stole the issue and stripped it for parts.
And Prius is expanding its production 50%.<eos> The market's doing what markets do, resorting itself out.<eos> Messily and with contradiction.<eos> Better fuel economy's an idea that just has to reach its tipping point.<eos> A veto maybe nudges it a little closer.
What I am, he made me.<eos> He alone will decide my successor, not Parliament, or any earthly power.<eos> I will not grant Parliament rights it may one day use against me... or the legitimate heirs of my blood.<eos> I will suffer no more talk of divorce or annulment.<eos> I've never considered it.
Before you and the minister get too tipsy, won't you accompany me?<eos> I'd like to sing for our guests.<eos> She's a wonderful pianist.<eos> Do you have a special wish?<eos> I leave it up to you, ladies.
Cut the crap, you murderer!<eos> What?<eos> Half a century ago, that country compared ours to a 12 year-old<eos> How old does that make that country now!<eos> If any country pisses it off, it just bombs them
You're the target today.<eos> This is the last order from the Rhodes Team.<eos> My last assignment.<eos> The Rhodes Team carried out covert government operations.<eos> The International Civil Rights Committee protested the team, so Minister Song axed it and had all the agents killed.
So, did the conductor guy used to live here?<eos> No. The conductor worked on the train. The station agent worked in here.<eos> Doing what?<eos> A lot of things.<eos> The train brought in the mail. And the agent delivered it.
"The girl from Stromboli" has a name.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> In the meantime give me your ID and I'll fill out a card.<eos> I left it at home.
And listen to the second good news<eos> Tickets for Greece.<eos> Tickets for Greece?<eos> You've won a jackpot?<eos> Aunt Anna gifted it to us
What are the...<eos> What do you remember?<eos> What are the facts?<eos> What are the certainties?<eos> Every time we found this crop circle, there was this smell of... of ozone, and it seemed like they were using the circles as a way to get around, but... they never used it to get in the house.
You have a cold, Mr. Ramirez.<eos> Antibiotics, 10 days. Right?<eos> No white spots on your tonsils.<eos> Antibiotics won't help.<eos> - Last year they cleared it right up.
Grow up?<eos> Your parents?<eos> Do you like my nose ring?<eos> It's township.<eos> All the snazzy girls are doing it.
Ooh! You invented the fart?<eos> I reinvented it.<eos> Can we play with him, Daddy?<eos> Sure, Gracie.<eos> I could pass it around.
- Then you're not leaving.<eos> Finish it.<eos> - Give it to him.<eos> - No, I need it.<eos> - I said, finish it!
They're not.<eos> How about you?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - No, thank you, I'm full.<eos> Fine, don't eat it!
Hey, Mom. Remember we had that conversation about trying to... cut back on things that aren't necessities?<eos> - Like it was yesterday.<eos> - It was this morning... and now I hear that you've hired a crew for the yacht.<eos> - I'm selling that yacht.<eos> - Michael, you haven't heard why I want it.
You got a warrant?<eos> Don't need one if it's in plain sight.<eos> And I see over $30,000 there.<eos> Not fifteen, like you said, so what's up?<eos> I thought the bitch might have stolen it out of my safe.
If you want the goddamn doll, have it till you find one, then I want this back. Understood?<eos> - Five dollars.<eos> - It says 775 cents.<eos> You offered me five dollars.<eos> You'll get it back when you return my doll.
I believe the Charrids are trying to expel the Kalish from Katratzi by force.<eos> And who are you to possess such erroneous intelligence?<eos> Just like you, I am a devoted Kalish.<eos> Without us to administer their empire, the Scarran system of government will collapse.<eos> What if they fear you will take it away from them?
- It's not your decision anymore.<eos> - What?<eos> On behalf of the children of New York, I reject your money.<eos> - But we're giving you this.<eos> - And I'm giving it back to you.
Main hall, egg display.<eos> We're taking fire.<eos> Kay pushed the red button.<eos> Computer at MiB can destroy bogey.<eos> I'll walk you through it.
That's great.<eos> -You're doing it. Living your dream.<eos> -Glamour girl!<eos> Your drawer was short $6!<eos> Next time that happens, I'll take it out of your cheque.
Well, it's the damnedest thing.<eos> This salmon is perfect.<eos> Your whole presentation today has been excellent. Well done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Make sure you tuck it in tightly.
Keep the change.<eos> You like this, Pops?<eos> For the new menu?<eos> - Where did you get that?<eos> - I drew it, Dad.
Hello, pumpkin.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> The poor kid all alone in the wild.<eos> Sabers gang nailed on it.<eos> So I just snatch it.
Sure you can.<eos> The good news is the papers are ready.<eos> Once you sign them, we'll get our stock and you'll get your $40 billion.<eos> I don't want that money.<eos> Just give it to a charity.
I'd never wear that!<eos> They're all the rage, poppet!<eos> You blow 'em up, just like a lilo.<eos> Look, this little pump comes free with it.<eos> Pop it in the valve, pump away, up it goes, then slip it back in there... ..and boom!
Sure.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> You wanna go for a bike ride?<eos> Guess it's better than the whole rolled-up newspaper scheme.<eos> Don't take it off, just do it.
Some say it´s a forgery.<eos> Since you´re here, enlighten me.<eos> Most paintings attributed to me are fakes.<eos> This one, too.<eos> When I see your work, I can tell whether you painted it with gusto or not, and if you were standing or sitting.
Death... or restitution.<eos> Here we go. No more bets.<eos> Thanks for your vote.<eos> Glad you could make it.<eos> I appreciate it.
Right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car.<eos> He brought it home. He put it back on his Caprice.<eos> What did he call it?
What could she prove?<eos> What can she prove?<eos> Nothing.<eos> And I wouldn't worry about the video.<eos> Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
Shane Caldwell secretly recorded that.<eos> - Oh, dear Lord.<eos> - Do you see now?<eos> That video is what set me free.<eos> And I would never have found it if God wasn't directing me.
But that certificate must exist.<eos> It's in the monastery.<eos> But I wouldn't know where to look for it.<eos> And the place makes my skin crawl.<eos> Why don't you look for it?
We'll buy him three.<eos> Yeah, right! We can't even afford a toy one.<eos> I know how to get one.<eos> By the way, how did you get such a nice horse?<eos> Picó gave it to me.
You hungry?<eos> - What?<eos> - Let's get lunch.<eos> You know, I'd love to, but I got to go get that paycheck.<eos> Have them send it to you.
Well, for the last several years, I've been thinking about the summers I spent here.<eos> You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.<eos> And the tire swing.<eos> It used to break every summer, and every summer Grandpa would fix it.
No.<eos> And I... You know...<eos> Here.<eos> What's that for?<eos> Well, you know, just so that, next time there's a school trip, you won't miss it.
I'd say the fight's coming, soon enough.<eos> I hope you're wrong.<eos> Earth knows the price of escalation as well as we do.<eos> You said our job is to prevent a war with earth.<eos> Ever wonder if we've got it backwards?
I'm not here to draw conclusions.<eos> I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.
I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must be gratified.<eos> And you're disappointed.<eos> Just because I believe in the merits of the deal doesn't mean I'm any less concerned about Iran cheating on it.
I'm not on his side.<eos> Sekou's facing 15 years in prison here.<eos> You're on a side.<eos> You gave him $5,000, which you're saying was for a man in Africa, a jihadi.<eos> And if that's what the money was for and Sekou took it, tell Simone and tell me, and we'll listen.
Very... close.<eos> You must know that.<eos> There's a video of it.<eos> It was... It was all over the Internet.<eos> You've never seen it?
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
Sir, we're looking for Carrie Mathison for comment on the attack. Can you tell her?<eos> She's not here.<eos> Are you aware of what's going on at your house?<eos> Wait. What?<eos> They're calling it a hostage situation.
Who knew I was coming to New York?<eos> No one.<eos> No one?<eos> Then who was aware of our meeting in the West Bank?<eos> The Israelis suspected it.
We're down to Saul Berenson, that is if you're willing to offer him a deal in exchange for his testimony.<eos> More than willing. Is there a legal basis for it?<eos> As long as you go through proper channels at Justice, the National Security Division.<eos> In that case, FBI Counterintelligence would make the first approach to Saul.<eos> Think he'll go for it?
That is not true.<eos> He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.
I'm told you took a video while I was here of Mr. O'Keefe and me.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Ah. You deleted it from your phone.
I didn't.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Ah. You deleted it from your phone.<eos> Did you, uh... send it somewhere?
Nowhere.<eos> Ah. You deleted it from your phone.<eos> Did you, uh... send it somewhere?<eos> How could I?<eos> I never took it.
So, here I am.<eos> You do know it's not slander if it's true?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Not true.<eos> Have you seen it?
- Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.<eos> You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.
And with guests.<eos> And a woman.<eos> How pleasing.<eos> I have forgotten your name, silver monk, but not our price.<eos> Do you have it?
Yes, you are.<eos> You are.<eos> Is it your intention to build an army?<eos> Oh, last night I was still a slave.<eos> Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.
Came by to pay my respects.<eos> He was friends with Michael.<eos> Hey, John, I read your book.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.
- You did?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> Y'all have a nice day.<eos> I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
- Doesn't matter.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I need you to call the Kurripa Hospital. That's Kur-rip-pa.<eos> Find out if there's a patient there named Christopher Sunday. Matt?<eos> You threw it away?
Just walk on down, come back through.<eos> - Enjoy your flight.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Come on. Hey, give it back!<eos> - You can't take it, no.
You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book.<eos> It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?
We'll be back.<eos> But there's a man, a very special man, and he's supposed to be here with us, but he's in Melbourne.<eos> And because of this unexpected event, he's stuck in Australia.<eos> He's stranded.<eos> God has placed an obstacle in our way, but He wants us to overcome it.
- Please, Laurie.<eos> It's in your best interest if you're not involved.<eos> You know, whatever you got to say to us, you can say to her.<eos> No one seems to care that I just witnessed a murder.<eos> The man who perpetrated it just assaulted me.
- Uh-uh.<eos> No. She just shows up.<eos> She won't even tell us how she even knew we were here.<eos> You wanna disclose how you got that black eye?<eos> I got it from Nora.
My lighter?<eos> Can I have it back, please?<eos> You said you quit.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Then you don't need it.
Please give it back.<eos> Like I did with Lily?<eos> - Give me the lighter, Nora.<eos> - Come on, Nora.<eos> - She said she doesn't need it.
- You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.<eos> Went to the neighbor's trash and threw it in there.
What price can be too high to prevent it?<eos> Drastic measures will need to be taken of which, I'm afraid, this will only be the first.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> The damage done to this alliance was caused by Billy.<eos> It may be that the only way to repair this damage is to remove that which caused it.
I'll be at the house soon.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> What happened?<eos> Big misunderstanding.<eos> I'll tell you about it when I get there.
I don't think he'll ever understand that.<eos> No, he probably won't.<eos> He lives in a different world.<eos> He'll never understand the work that we do.<eos> Sometimes I'm not sure I understand it.
Look, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Your dad was a stand up guy.<eos> Yeah, but how do you condense a man's entire life into five minutes? Huh?<eos> There's probably an app for that, right?<eos> You, like, download a template, put in his name and then boom, it writes it for you?
You uh... can have the dresser.<eos> Catch.<eos> How's the eulogy coming?<eos> Harder than I thought.<eos> You want me to write it?
They revolted.<eos> A man named Julius started it.<eos> Now he's forming an army out there with designs on taking Nassau.<eos> The damage done to this alliance was caused by Billy.<eos> It may be that the only way to repair this damage is to remove that which caused it.
They are strong when Flint and Silver are united.<eos> But separate the two of them, turn them one against the other, and their world collapses.<eos> I tried once and failed.<eos> But I didn't possess the instrument necessary to make it work.<eos> And you possess it now?
Mr. Oliver oversees our operations.<eos> Before I can be convinced that your proposal is credible, he'll need to be convinced that your proposal is credible.<eos> It's interesting... When Richard was a little boy, there was a tomcat that lived out in the woods behind the house.<eos> And it would scratch at the windows at all hours of the night.<eos> Richard, all of four years old, would go outside still in his nightshirt and feed it.
What will you do when the cat fights back?<eos> It just arrived from Nassau.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Held hostage by the governor in Nassau.<eos> Unless we bring him the cache and surrender it to him by his deadline, she dies.
I let you try it your way!<eos> I did trust you.<eos> But I'm through wagering with her life now.<eos> If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us.<eos> We had it.

Your plan failed.<eos> We're moving on to my plan.<eos> Go get it. Bring it up here right now.<eos> Go get what?<eos> We had it in our hands.
But I don't think we're going to have that long.<eos> He gave me the time for his benefit, not mine.<eos> He's preparing to make a move.<eos> I know not what, but he's preparing for it.<eos> And there's little I can do about it until I secure that chest and have it to bargain with.
Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.
More.<eos> He never would have got this far ahead of your men carrying that chest.<eos> The chest was never here.<eos> He left it behind.<eos> You think they'll figure it out that we dropped it down here?
Good morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love our coffee.<eos> It's one of the few things Kenya does really well.<eos> In England, I missed it.
These are my people.<eos> And we go to our knees for no one.<eos> Take your fucking "mai soil" and the three guns Fuchs hired and fuck off.<eos> I'm going to enjoy scraping you off my shoe like the dog shit you are.<eos> Bring it, bitch.

Isn't it masculine?<eos> - That's why you need to have your book published.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Girls in our publishing house are fighting for your typescript.<eos> I've read it several times myself.
- A pretty cute one though.<eos> Give me that.<eos> That baptism was kind of like our wedding, wasn't it?<eos> Don't blaspheme, please.<eos> We must take an oath that no one will ever know about it.
- Mrs. Wislocka?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I've read your book.<eos> You've read a book that doesn't exist?<eos> The whole Party is reading it.
And by contracting their muscles...<eos> I do have to send my patients to sanatoriums.<eos> It's mighty inspiring.<eos> - Why don't you write a book?<eos> - Who'd read it?
- You can't arrest that book!<eos> - Leave the lady alone!<eos> It's for you too, gentlemen.<eos> Are you doing so good at home?<eos> It's a user's manual, don't you get it?
That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.
- Which part?<eos> - The scar.<eos> I think I would have noticed that.<eos> Well, maybe if, you know, we ever got to be naked with the lights on, or in a bed, even.<eos> Hey, you think that your dad was pissed because you took the car or pissed because you took it to be with me?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm involved in my own.<eos> And I would have mentioned it last night, but, you know, she has so much to lose, and I...<eos> Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...
Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...<eos> And, look, they're fuckin' grilling me back there, right?<eos> And Bo said if I go anywhere near the impound lot, he will rip out my lungs and shit in the hole.<eos> And I can't ask any of these guys to go get it, 'cause they know her and they know her fuckin' husband, and they'll recognize her phone because it looks like it belongs to fuckin' Liberace.
Well, the place is cleaned daily, isn't it?<eos> Usually, but we've been a bit short-handed this last month.<eos> So how many people used cubicle two after Miss Palfrey died?<eos> Nobody.<eos> We shut it up, out of respect.
Change is as good as a rest.<eos> Here, give us one...<eos> THREE DROWNINGS POLICE SAY "MURDER" .. the unexpected defeat of the Russian scientist, Professor Yuri Gradenko by the computer JASON in a chess match at Lovelace college.<eos> Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford Team, predicted that within a generation few compartments of the intellect would remain outside the machines' realm and that the problems of creating artificial intelligence would be substantially solved.<eos> We're no closer to catching this bastard, and now the whole world knows about it.
"Rude dram".<eos> Look, anyone can make a mistake.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, I'll make coffee.<eos> I've a feeling we'll need it.
Your sister, she's dead.<eos> I just found her again!<eos> After all that time, I can't let it happen again!<eos> You're ill.<eos> You've had a breakdown, and Dr Neilsen knew it.
Who knows?<eos> Some kind of coordinated terrorist attack, maybe.<eos> Turn here.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, you know.<eos> I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.
Sold out?<eos> But there's clearly no one here.<eos> No vacancy.<eos> There aren't any motorcars parked outside.<eos> We got a dress code here, and she's breaking it.
We learned that from the Nemeton.<eos> What kind of price?<eos> A big price?<eos> Big.<eos> You let it out.
Let's be real, you're an easy target.<eos> But that's... well, that's because you're honest about what you love.<eos> And underneath it all, that's... inspiring.<eos> And I'm sorry too.<eos> Not about the sex, I don't even really remember it.
The problem is the photo.<eos> The photo.<eos> If we leave the helicopter there, blown up or not, the bad guys will take a photo with it.<eos> And it fucking pisses me off, if you'll excuse my language.<eos> But if we bring it back, we can turn this accident into a victory.
- Set up a tent for the wounded.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Maño.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I want your vehicle on this hillside, covering the area from this rock to over here, got it?
Since Anup told me about it<eos> I have buttoned my shirt till the neck.<eos> Can you imagine!<eos> - Really?<eos> Who started it?
And the biggest thing, sir is that you will understand everything<eos> but will not be able to explain it to anyone.<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you think this is a game?<eos> - They started this game while you all watched it but I will end it.
Be quiet.<eos> I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?<eos> No. We'll never find it!
But guess what.<eos> You can't fuck with me anymore, okay?<eos> I'm "unfuckable" now.<eos> So, yes, you might've thrown me a little bit when you showed up, but not anymore.<eos> 'Cause I... I took my ball, and I marched down that court, and I fucking dunked it.
- Okay, wrong example since you lost your virginity at 13 to, like, a lifeguard or something.<eos> You know when you're a little kid and you're not ready to have a sleepover?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yes!<eos> And it's, like, kindergarten or first grade and sleepovers are, like, all the rage and everyone's doing it every Friday and Saturday night, and you're just like, "No, I can't.
Marn, call me back, okay?<eos> I have an actual problem about actual life.<eos> Please.<eos> - Rice.<eos> - I know it's so traditional to throw rice, but I just don't think I want them throwing it, because then the pigeons eat it, and I hear they die, I don't want that
I couldn't leave without seeing you, Zelda.<eos> Well, we have to speak.<eos> I didn't get a chance to talk to you about your book.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Scribner's rejected it. It's dead.
Forever changing her mind.<eos> She was madly in love with life... but she loved herself a little more.<eos> At age 6... she played a bee in a school play.<eos> She adored her costume so much.<eos> she kept it on for a week.

At age 6... she played a bee in a school play.<eos> She adored her costume so much.<eos> she kept it on for a week.<eos> A Week later... she threw it out like an old toy.<eos> Never wore it again.
Tomorrow morning... give her some flowers.<eos> and propose to her.<eos> From the time I couldn't spell "love." let alone understand it...<eos> I loved her. when that girl says yes, I could feel my heart bursting.<eos> I rewound that moment and played it again and again in my head.
Don't you know?<eos> Oh God!<eos> Not again.<eos> Try and forget about your album, please.<eos> Abhi, you don't get it.
In our time, I was a freak.<eos> Today, I'm an amateur.<eos> Stop it, John, this instant.<eos> You know you can walk into a shop here and purchase a rifle or a revolver, and it's perfectly legal?<eos> These people encourage it.
"It's true, H.G., don't be daft."<eos> Believe it.<eos> I wrote this, but...<eos> This symbol, what does it mean?<eos> I've researched it, but there's no record of it.
- We'd have our own house.<eos> - We'd make love when we wanted.<eos> - And be free! You'll love the village. You can paint in peace.<eos> We can't go there. It's the first place they'd look.<eos> You'll miss this term but then you can make it up.
- So, no other female friends?<eos> - No.<eos> I cut up a rabbit once.<eos> What?<eos> When I was eight, I found a dead rabbit in the yard, and I picked it up with a plastic bag, and then I cut it into small pieces, and I put the pieces in a bowl in the shed.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I need you to do exactly as I say.<eos> No time for questions.<eos> Just listen.<eos> When I start walking down this car, I want you to grab that backpack, there. See it?
Dr. Bancroft never actually spoke to Hodgins' therapist.<eos> It was Zack, e-mailing and calling on a burner cell.<eos> Zack is the one who developed the protocol that you've been following.<eos> Zack is the one who's going to make it so that Hodgins can walk.<eos> Look, Aubrey, okay, I'm not saying that Zack didn't do it.
Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Faulk warned us someone would insert themselves into the case, manipulate it.
So, Miss Baker had stolen Stephen's research?<eos> It's rather brazen, isn't it?<eos> Dr Klein wasn't sure how it all happened.<eos> But when they finally spoke, Stephen was regretful about the whole thing.<eos> Said he'd discuss it with her.
So, now you've uncovered my shady, little secret, is there anything else?<eos> Oh, I'm afraid we're not quite done yet.<eos> We believe Stephen may have had a change of heart.<eos> He was going to discuss it with you. Perhaps re-publish?<eos> We did discuss it.
Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.
Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.<eos> And I believe you placed it up there with the seismometer.<eos> You then dialled it intermittently over a three-night period to upset the readings from the extremely sensitive instruments and lead Stephen to think it was cause for concern.
You gassed Stephen in his own bedroom.<eos> How can we be sure of this?<eos> Phenolphthalein.<eos> There were vials of it on Stephen's desk.<eos> I assume he'd been using it for some kind of soil analysis.
And in his permanent drug-induced state, I'm sure it wasn't that hard to wear down his defences.<eos> And Emer.<eos> I think you genuinely cared about Stephen.<eos> I'm guessing that Victoria found out about your secret, didn't she?<eos> And used it to bully you into joining them in their plan.
So, that's how they did it.<eos> And that's why they did it.<eos> They might each of had their own motive to take Stephen's life... ..it was you who provided the extra incentive.<eos> The final nail in the coffin, if you will.<eos> If you weren't an accessory before the fact, you certainly were after it.
And I'm the best surfer on Pen Gu.<eos> Who else are they gonna ask?<eos> Hey, Lani.<eos> I told my mom that you told me that you were going to join the Hang 5.<eos> And then she said that I should get your autograph because she wants to sell it online.
He'll show me my destiny.<eos> Gus knows what I'm talkin' about.<eos> The coyote.<eos> My legacy.<eos> He knows it.
I took two tabs.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> But you're gonna have a lot of time to think now, 'cause you're going to prison for a long time.<eos> Booth, the sodium nitrate in Ian's neck wounds did not conclusively prove that Randy's the killer.<eos> Yeah, but I knew he'd buy it.
He's telling the truth.<eos> ...then he wouldn't have any trouble finding product.<eos> It's low quality, but there's plenty of it and the dealers aren't too picky.<eos> Has no one here read the report?<eos> Yeah, we read it.
And we keep looking till we find this guy, and we don't stop.<eos> That was just right, Seeley, I knew you would have it.<eos> I've been reading about this kind of torture.<eos> They say it still exists in the Balkans and parts of the Middle East.<eos> Yeah, I heard of it.
They say it still exists in the Balkans and parts of the Middle East.<eos> Yeah, I heard of it.<eos> Your unit served in both.<eos> McKinney was there.<eos> No chance McKinney did it.
You didn't go for the cheapest option.<eos> Well, why would you have a cheap phone in your bag?<eos> 'It just sort of shouts "affair", doesn't it?<eos> 'It's a pay-as-you-go.<eos> 'Obviously, you don't link it to your e-mail account.
Well, why would you have a cheap phone in your bag?<eos> 'It just sort of shouts "affair", doesn't it?<eos> 'It's a pay-as-you-go.<eos> 'Obviously, you don't link it to your e-mail account.<eos> 'Oh, and don't top it up at the same place twice, right, cos it's important not to establish a pattern, which is kind of the exact opposite of what you do.
He won't.<eos> We're not like that.<eos> He's not the jealous type.<eos> It's important to imagine the worst-case scenario.<eos> 'Well, I'll say that it belongs to Liz from work' and that she left it at a meeting and I've been carrying it around, intending to give it back.
OK.<eos> Do you know what really winds me up about Gary?<eos> His haircut.<eos> I hate his haircut.<eos> He's had the same haircut for 30 years and I hated it 30 years ago.
I'm just saying marriage is a crazy idea.<eos> I don't know why anyone does it.
Hold on.<eos> I'm getting word.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - We now have it.
Well, we don't know yet.<eos> I'm trying to recover it.<eos> Frankie Vargas passed away before he was able to inhabit the office he was elected to.<eos> But his achievements, his selfless work, and his dreams shine a light forward for all of us.<eos> And even though we don't have the message, we do have the cellphone number of the person who left it.
I can't get it out of my head.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> No.<eos> Dude, I'm...<eos> I mean, I, I literally can't get it out of my head.
Bodies with no DNA?<eos> Or bodies with no DNA that somehow make you feel terrified.<eos> I don't know if the body's actually causing the fear.<eos> Maybe it's just amplifying it?<eos> You still feel it, don't you?
Why would he?<eos> She was gone.<eos> Well, I don't see why it matters now.<eos> You've got the ring.<eos> So why does he keep putting it off?
Addison Derringer is making some very serious allegations about me being inappropriate.<eos> And if this is all about breaking me down so I have to admit other things to Hackett...<eos> Wait. What other things?<eos> I took a shortcut to getting my degree, okay?<eos> I-I missed a final exam, and A.D. took it for me.
Someone sent you a finger.<eos> - Are you sure that it's...<eos> - Archer Dunhill's, yes.<eos> The prints were a match.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent it or why?
Hi, Miss Harper.<eos> I'm calling from Mr. Hastings office.<eos> - What happened? - Um...<eos> Nicole found the book.<eos> And she threw it at you?
For the donor.<eos> What?<eos> What did you say?<eos> You asked us to put this on hold for the egg donor.<eos> We personalized it and everything.
A.D.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?
It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it..
You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it..<eos> No, I put it in my purse.
No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it..<eos> No, I put it in my purse.<eos> He's not gonna find it.
What is it?<eos> It's you.<eos> You mean, you guys have been sitting on this...<eos> The game showed up a couple of days after the blind school.<eos> We've been hiding it at Spencer's.
Well, there's these little pieces that look like the five of us.<eos> If you're not on the board I don't think you're invited to play.<eos> I'm not trying to get in on it.<eos> I'm trying to get inside of it.<eos> If I can figure out how it works maybe I can find out who made it.
I was nowhere near there.<eos> I was at the Radley Hotel.<eos> All I did was deliver a couple of drinks to Caleb and Mona with a message.<eos> Why?<eos> Jenny sold it as a practical joke.
Your hands are a lot bigger than when you were a kid.<eos> They're lot less purple too.<eos> I can see why she wants to leave it up.<eos> It's been there for years.<eos> They left it that way after Gloriana passed.
I got to go shower.<eos> Why wouldn't A.D. pick up this hard drive on her own?<eos> Because it's probably a weapon or something.<eos> Hanna, stop pacing.<eos> Well, how do you know it's not going to explode once you hook it up?
Caleb, this person saved me.<eos> He gave me and my friends an alibi the night of Charlotte's murder.<eos> It's not Lucas.<eos> Hi, Marco.<eos> The apartment's different than how I pictured it.
- Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Are you absolutely sure about this?<eos> Mona has the game.<eos> She not only has it, she's accessing the guts of the thing.
Well, think again.<eos> Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police.<eos> You're gonna tell them how you made everybody's life a living hell.<eos> But first, we're gonna pick up the game just so they can see your handy work.<eos> I don't have it anymore.

Open the door.<eos> - Oh, my...<eos> Mona said she doesn't have the game anymore.<eos> - She said that to you?<eos> - She said somebody stole it.
Of course.<eos> Well...<eos> I killed Archer Dunhill.<eos> I ran him over with a car that I stole and I buried his body in the woods.<eos> Later I moved it to where I told you you'd find it.
- Before they hit. - In a small venue.<eos> We can be like, "We liked them before they were cool."<eos> I was trying to add you the other day, but I couldn't find your profile.<eos> Is it like hidden or something?<eos> Yeah, I erased it a year ago.
Well, I think it means that Fillmore-Graves wants to make Seattle a zombie-friendly city.<eos> "Zombie-friendly"?<eos> Like, "Eat all the brains you want, we'll make more"?<eos> I didn't get details.<eos> There was a bit of a rush to get out of the building before they blew it up.
Well, if I was the owner, wouldn't it make it my money?<eos> Chief is dead.<eos> I got shot.<eos> That is our money.<eos> I don't want to sound like your mom, but where'd you last see it?
Does it help with the guilt, given what you are?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Keelin, you need to listen to me.<eos> - How do you know my name?<eos> - Got it from a friend.
You're offering me a deal?<eos> One you cannot dismiss.<eos> Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.<eos> Now they loathe you.<eos> Creatures such as they respect only one language, and I speak it fluently.
Well, this should be good.<eos> Something's coming, something unlike anything we've seen before.<eos> What's coming?<eos> You know the fire that ended the world.<eos> Lexa called it Praimfaya.
You have a hand in that?<eos> I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Niles.<eos> Well...<eos> If you're referring to that strung-up cattle rustler, now that you menti it, I might know something about that.
You asked for a map of this place.<eos> Bajie always delivers.<eos> You sure this is accurate?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I got it from the oldest picker in here.
Get the cup!<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ!<eos> What was that?<eos> Two essences melding together in a single fleeting moment.<eos> Don't ruin it, hon.
- Thought we had a deal.<eos> - We did.<eos> But... there's your money.<eos> I don't need the money.<eos> I need someone to launder it.
Belonged to Grammie Davenport.<eos> She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And Mom read it to me.
She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And Mom read it to me.<eos> I read it to you.
Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And it used to get so hot, we thought it would burn the house down, but...<eos> - Right.<eos> - ... you wouldn't let anybody touch it.
Don't you want to keep going till you do the whole thing?<eos> No.<eos> If you're done, I'm done.<eos> You know, your clients seem to like that rainbow.<eos> Think they're gonna miss it?
You put it in the patient's chart.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Right?<eos> - Because they never check it.
I'm a SEAL, and my sperm can't even swim.<eos> Joseph...<eos> Joseph, this is not about you or God.<eos> This is a simple medical issue.<eos> We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
I kill seven.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they were my enemy.<eos> And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.<eos> Claim it by its secret name.
Well, whoever hacked your phone used your thumbprint, so, unless you're missing a thumb, that's you.<eos> I don't know what you're messed up in, but I'd watch your back...<eos> When you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with her partner.<eos> What?<eos> They tracked me down using my cell phone, so I brought it to Jep's to try and figure out
You would defend your stupid boyfriend.<eos> Even since Wes died, all you've done is point the finger at Annalise, which is suspicious behavior.<eos> The first thing guilty people do is try to blame someone else.<eos> Like a fart.<eos> If you smelt it, you dealt it.
You're wrong.<eos> I swear on my son and your husband's graves, it wasn't me.<eos> You offered me a deal...<eos> Seven years if I squeal on Annalise...<eos> And now I'm saying I'll take it.
Take it to trial.<eos> Expensive.<eos> And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<eos> Not my first choice, or yours, I imagine.<eos> The firm could choose to buy me out... for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.
Um, one day you will be, honey, yeah.<eos> But not for a very, very, very long time.<eos> Hey, honey, did you make a decision about the hotel?<eos> - We need to book it.<eos> - Alexis is looking into it.
I'm not having it!<eos> I'm not being spoken to like that!<eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to have done wrong!<eos> You nicked my catalogue money and spent it on bloody weed!
Right.<eos> Kinchie's making you tea, Peter.<eos> I won't be long, love.<eos> I'm not eating that, it's a goose!<eos> It's an egg and you'll eat it.
We've charged Mick Donovan with Shannon's abduction.<eos> Well, that's it, then.<eos> But he's telling us you were in on it with him.<eos> How?<eos> He's saying the two of you planned it.
How?<eos> He's saying the two of you planned it.<eos> That you agreed he'd pick Shannon up from school, keep her at his flat, and split the reward money.<eos> Well, he's lying, then, isn't he?<eos> I weren't even in on it.
It's not going to happen now, is it?<eos> I mean, she's one of them, they care about her...<eos> I think they should have counselling.<eos> And what did the Head say?<eos> Wouldn't do it.
Sara. Please, please, please.<eos> I can explain, okay?<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> I was sick with worry.<eos> I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family, so I picked up your phone from the shop and I took it to Andrew Nelson, my buddy in the computer sciences department.
No, no, no, no, no, this isn't the kind of thing that you want to do off the books.<eos> Listen, Lincoln, he's gonna need a transfusion.<eos> Michael's b negative, okay?<eos> It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.<eos> You won't find it where you're going, and he won't make it while you look.
Okay. Which friend?<eos> He's at Patrick's house.<eos> What happened to your grandmother's ring?<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> I took it off on the way over for safekeeping, 'cause I didn't want it to get stolen, then when I looked for it on the way back it was gone.
Please hold.<eos> Heart Enterprises.<eos> Please hold.<eos> I got the job!<eos> They offered it to me on the spot!
-What is it?<eos> -Come here.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> -No.<eos> I can not pry into it without you noticing.
-Sorry.<eos> You have the latest model.<eos> It has a selfiekamera with five megapixels.<eos> The focus will be unbelievable.<eos> That was exactly why I bought it.
Alexis?<eos> Eyes up, honey.<eos> You're here with family.<eos> Seriously, would you put your damn phone down.<eos> Do you have it or not?
Did you do something with my money?<eos> - I knew I could make you more.<eos> - More?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I put it into a house, okay, but listen to me.
Note the past tense.<eos> When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.<eos> What does this have to do with me?<eos> You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?<eos> No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
What happened?<eos> Alec...<eos> Someone has taken my spell book.<eos> You're putting your wards up?<eos> Nobody leaves until I get it back.
Look, all I know is Gideon said the motorcycles Darhk and Merlyn stole are here.<eos> What, so we're just supposed to walk around until we see a sign that says, "this way"?<eos> Good idea.<eos> _ Subjugating the world to your rule isn't saving it.<eos> You would create a wasteland, and call it peace.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
You hungry?<eos> You buying?<eos> Give it a whirl.<eos> OSWALD: That is the logo for my new club.<eos> What are we gonna call it?
Thanks for believing in me, H.R.<eos> Hey, I've been looking for the right time to tell you.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Right before H.R. died, he asked me to give you a message.<eos> Tell... tell Cisco... this took strength, and he gave it to me.
I'll be back with a writ signed<eos> Can't wait.<eos> I've always wanted her autograph.<eos> You know how people hate to say,<eos> I don't hate it.
- Thanks.<eos> Oh, and a Katherine Wallace called.<eos> She didn't say what it was about, but she sounded like...<eos> Okay, um, did she leave a number?<eos> Uh, yeah, I put it on your post sheet.
Hey, it's just a party, okay?<eos> Relax a little.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I wanted a haircut.<eos> But we talked about it, right?
Yeah.<eos> No, I'm still here.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not wearing this dress.<eos> But you were wearing it in the first part of the scene. The part we already shot.
Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I don't like blue cheese.<eos> - Then why'd you take it?
Hey, did you notice last night, there was a point where I was spooning you and then you were spooning Grandpa?<eos> It was so cute.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Bertie leaves half-eaten yogurt cups in here.<eos> Who eats half a yogurt and then puts it back?
You know, I think they like to be called background actors.<eos> I think she likes to be called Natasha.<eos> Natasha?<eos> Okay, that's cool.<eos> I would have invited her to my room, but, you know, I share it with Arya, - so that's a drag.
How are ya?<eos> - I almost died today.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> A car hit my shopping cart while I was pushing it.
Did you see him often?<eos> First of the month.<eos> Pick up his check.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> I'd cash it for him, and that was that.
I like our marriage being... recognized by the federal government.<eos> I know we don't need anybody's permission to love one another, but you know what, it feels good to have the same rights as every straight couple.<eos> To be included.<eos> To be protected under the law.<eos> God knows that right might be taken away from us, but, man, as long as we have it, I want it.
- Mm-hmm. - And after one of the more awkward conversations I've ever had in my life...<eos> Jesus is now cleared to resume sexual activity with some limitations.<eos> Hey, well, thanks for the help, Doc.<eos> So... if we pass this along, does that mean we're condoning him having sex?<eos> Well, he's having it anyway.
Jesus is now cleared to resume sexual activity with some limitations.<eos> Hey, well, thanks for the help, Doc.<eos> So... if we pass this along, does that mean we're condoning him having sex?<eos> Well, he's having it anyway.<eos> What my concern is where he's having it.
The thing is he doesn't have a place to live, and if he doesn't take this job up north, he's gonna be living out of his car.<eos> I think he's depressed.<eos> Well, he could have just said that.<eos> He was hoping he could work something out.<eos> Anyway, he has a new number, and he wanted me to give it to you.
Okay, well, where's... where's the chicken?<eos> Do we need chicken?<eos> I will go back.<eos> Uh, no, you've done enough.<eos> I'll just have Mom get it on her way home.
Nothing.<eos> - Did I hear something about Emma?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, h... he's just mad because I... didn't fill up the car when I used it last.
- They couldn't use it in court.<eos> - You said you weren't at her house that day.<eos> - I lied.<eos> I was there in the morning, I saw money on the counter,<eos> - and I took it.
Just stop this guy.<eos> Whoever he is, he's not in the system.<eos> What if instead of tracking him, we tracked the assault weapon?<eos> Rifle.<eos> And Oliver took it.
What do you got?<eos> Wait.<eos> That-- that doesn't make sense.<eos> This is the AR-15 assault rifle that was used in the attack on city hall.<eos> Which one of your guys did it?
I'll keep you gentlemen posted on the status of this investigation.<eos> I wouldn't panic just yet.<eos> We don't even know if that report's legitimate.<eos> I think it's safe to say that it is.<eos> The question is who sent it to Pike?
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
Ahem. Ok. All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Mayor, all due respect, your head's bleeding, and our concussion protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.<eos> Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm suspending it.
Yes. I totally manifested that. What do you got?<eos> When my Sonic cry hit vigilante, it knocked off a small piece of his visor.<eos> Looks like it's lined with some kind of circuitry.<eos> Well, that means, it's manufactured.<eos> Maybe I can link it back to where he bought it from.
But first I have a gift for you.<eos> This tattoo of yours.<eos> To be an American and named a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary.<eos> When you look at it, it must--it must remind you of such a victory.<eos> Now, when you look at it, you'll think about our time here together and the secret that you confessed to me.
See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.<eos> Others will embrace it, even revel in it, like you.
Hey, how's the tooth?<eos> - It hurts. - You want some ibuprofen?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Look, I know you've been trying.<eos> And I really do appreciate it.
Are we to simply believe that he is the heir?<eos> Look, I don't blame you for being cautious.<eos> And damn me if I'll ever trust a dragon, but somehow I feel what he says is true.<eos> It's the bond.<eos> If he feels it, Drago feels it, it must be true.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.<eos> I don't like it, but okay.<eos> We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.<eos> We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.<eos> He dumped it there for us to find.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.<eos> Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.<eos> What is it?<eos> Probably doesn't mean anything.<eos> We checked it out.
The Chief is considering handing Katie Pine over to the OPD.<eos> - What?<eos> - We've got a murdered indigenous girl who has slipped through the cracks.<eos> Everybody is watching.<eos> I am trying to give you a chance here but you are gonna have to work the case that is in front of you or you are going to lose it.
- We can pretend.<eos> - I don't want to pretend.<eos> Hold on. Here, come here, sweetie.<eos> Listen, calm down, okay?<eos> It's okay, I'm gonna fix it, okay?
Which is perfectly acceptable these days.<eos> Oh, I just remembered, when Jean tried out to be, what was that, Cinderella, yeah.<eos> Well, she didn't get the part.<eos> She only made chorus.<eos> Oh, she was so angry. She had it in for the girl who made it.
No, he's... he's... we're together.<eos> It's gonna get cold.<eos> - What?<eos> - The tea.<eos> My mother only ever drank it piping hot, so.
Anyway, Richard, you're not gonna seriously go home and tell the guys in your company that even though your user rates are skyrocketing that you wanna pivot.<eos> For the past 48 hours, I've been trying to rewrite the core video chat code, and I literally can't.<eos> Instead of typing, I just bite my fingernails.<eos> I think, subconsciously, I would rather bite my own fingers off than work on this platform.<eos> Richard, I know people who have spent their entire careers chasing after an app with this kind of growth rate and never hit it.
Colleen is gonna beat my ass if I don't bring this Chinese food home tonight.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> You don't get it?<eos> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Dude, your car is horn-y... beep-beep... so I'm toe-ing it.
Yeah.<eos> So you are a thief.<eos> Just some coffee.<eos> You got a hot tub.<eos> You ever use it?
Somebody fucked us.<eos> I spoke to Adelstein this morning.<eos> Fuck, I told you not to.<eos> And he told me about the deal.<eos> I'm not taking it.
They thought it belonged to the dead woman.<eos> Yes, it does belong to the dead woman.<eos> I am the dead woman.<eos> Where's my fucking car?<eos> - Police towed it.
- You have a preference?<eos> As close to rubbing alcohol as you got.<eos> Coffee, please.<eos> Black.<eos> I'll bring it to your table.
They feel my heat on their hip, and it keeps them warm at night.<eos> God bless the believers.<eos> Come with me to Wisconsin.<eos> Stand with me, and let the world open to us once again.<eos> I was on the bus before you painted it yellow.
I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.
Would I could give you some of mine.<eos> You've got gold?<eos> Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.
The world is watching.<eos> And we're live in three, two...<eos> Mayor Cobblepot, as Gotham is enjoying an historic spike in job growth and prosperity, it is also going through one of the safest periods in its history.<eos> And I'm sure everyone is wondering,<eos> "How did he do it?"
An exaggeration.<eos> People love to invent scandal.<eos> But it was murder that sent you to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane.<eos> I rescued the city from the madman, Theo Galavan.<eos> Some call it murder.
I want this to be a slow... painful death.<eos> One of a thousand deep cuts.<eos> First we take away his mind...<eos> That's the part I like.<eos> We destroy his empire and take it for ourselves.
You must be the first person in history to go on a killing spree in order to find a life coach.<eos> Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.<eos> No.<eos> A good riddle reveals the asker.<eos> To solve it is to solve the mystery of the person posing it.
My enemies took everything from me.<eos> Tried to murder me.<eos> You help me get my revenge, and when I take back my throne, I will give you every resource you need to free yourself from this icy prison.<eos> Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours outside the cold without my suit.<eos> And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a Wayne Enterprises black site ever since you escaped Indian Hill.
When I find out what you did, I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.<eos> And I'm gonna enjoy it.<eos> Jim, hey.<eos> Where's the riddle?<eos> Me and Lucius took a crack at it, but maybe you'll have better luck.
All this time, and you really don't know anything, do you?<eos> Right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Wait, this is the owl? What the hell happened to it?<eos> Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?
Trains them.<eos> What I did to you, the Court has done with them for 200 years.<eos> But the process does more than remove all feeling.<eos> Cut off the smallest finger of your left hand.<eos> Shall I tell him to eat it?
He won't shoot you.<eos> He's weak, Bruce, but you are not.<eos> Bruce, please.<eos> Give me the detonator, son.<eos> You will press it.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
You hungry?<eos> You buying?<eos> Give it a whirl.<eos> That is the logo for my new club.<eos> What are we gonna call it?
Yeah, it's growing on me.<eos> And this rifle is growing on me.<eos> Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning of what this bad boy can do.<eos> How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?<eos> Barry stole it for me.
- What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.<eos> I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.
I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.<eos> You took my home away from me, and now I will take it back!
I don't... it was spontaneous.<eos> I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.<eos> Yo.<eos> There's a three-alarm fire in the Raab building.<eos> Fire department is evacuating it now.
Wally.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> Let me guess. You do?<eos> I know what my hell is.<eos> I've already seen it in the future.
Yes, I'm burning everything.<eos> - W... ev... - What?<eos> - Everything?<eos> What... - My work.<eos> Well, I don't know why they call it "work," because none of it works.
As in, I-I saw the two of you squaring off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, from the angle that I saw, it looked like you had a pretty clear shot.<eos> Okay.<eos> You had a clear shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it.
You.<eos> All of you.<eos> I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.<eos> Without it, nothing really matters.<eos> And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?
- How was Earth-3?<eos> - Yeah, um, hanging out with Jesse was awesome.<eos> I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.<eos> Without it, nothing really matters.<eos> And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?
- There's no time to test it now.<eos> - What is that thing?<eos> This can send electrical charges through the transmitters in his suit and theoretically, should jolt his memory.<eos> You want to electroshock his brain?<eos> Won't that fry it even more?
That's what mercy gets you.<eos> This must be where Waller kept her suicide squad.<eos> I think this is it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cisco, we found it.
You held up the crew and you delayed production.<eos> If you don't show up tomorrow. Ready to deliver the performance of a lifetime then don't show up at all.<eos> Who died?<eos> She said no.<eos> I gave her a necklace and she gave it back.
Leave the tags on the Dolce and follow this thing with Rainer.<eos> So Meryl Streep, huh?<eos> Yeah, you should probably start working on your Oscar speech.<eos> Hey, where did the bracelet go?<eos> I took it to the jeweler, it was a little bit big and I didn't want it to slip off the wrist.
- That was my agent, actually. - Oh.<eos> Yeah. I have a meeting about my script in an hour.<eos> I just called him earlier to let him know I might not make it. Wait?<eos> Like to sell your script?<eos> I already sold it.
Because every debt Aidan owed, I now owe.<eos> And if I don't pay back all the money they're gonna kill me.<eos> When Brandy Michaels needed bail money she was pretty eager to chat.<eos> So, what, you're just gonna hate your best friend now that I-I got it?<eos> Because I didn't think that you would but you just waltzed right in and you got it, like everything you do.
I feel much better.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> You sold a script.<eos> You're getting paid.<eos> Don't you get it?
I don't need your pity.<eos> I'm trying to help, Jake.<eos> I...<eos> And I don't need you to solve my problems.<eos> And, Paige, if I get this job, I'm taking it.
Maggie!<eos> Maggie!<eos> I-I didn't tell Maggie we're gonna pick her up.<eos> Where is my phone?<eos> I thought I'd put it..
My part.<eos> As in I'm the only time sorceress in "Locked" in the US, in China, on Mars.<eos> Now I don't ever want to hear the name Xu Yifei ever again, okay?<eos> You didn't even want that part, remember?<eos> - Ida wanted it for you.
There's been two million tweets about it.<eos> It's all over Instagram and Facebook.<eos> Alright, I can't look at that.<eos> Who would've done this?<eos> Well, Rachel was the one who recorded it but I-I can't imagine..
The strange thing is... losing those people is what brought us together.<eos> It's how we found each other.<eos> It's what made us... a family.<eos> Where did you get that necklace?<eos> You gave it to me.
Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire?<eos> Bonnie, is everything okay? Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you.<eos> But I also know that you and I are equally willing to do anything we can to fix this.<eos> Absolutely. Why? Do you have something?<eos> I think I do, but the only way it gets rid of Katherine Pierce is if she's in hell when I destroy it.
- Right.<eos> - Maybe her last name, friends, family, where she was staying when she was in L.A.?<eos> I'm a lover, not a Rolodex.<eos> Detective.<eos> Found it in the tunnel.
I was desperate.<eos> I'm broke.<eos> When the stewardess let it slip how much cash she was gonna make from this delivery, I... I thought it was drugs.<eos> I was gonna sell them.<eos> Then I opened it.
We were searching for a... a special package that was smuggled into the country,<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We never found it.<eos> It had to be the poison.<eos> Kleinberg must've been the one who stole it.
She'll show you.<eos> Don't listen for the click.<eos> Feel the click.<eos> Shut up, shut up.<eos> I almost got it.
You break that, there's consequences on a cosmic scale.<eos> Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> Yeah, you made a deal.<eos> You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.
Site 94?<eos> It's a government facility, off-books.<eos> Shadow ops.<eos> One of those places that officially doesn't exist.<eos> Then how do you know about it?
I won't let any of you die.<eos> And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves.<eos> You mean too much to me, to everything.<eos> Yeah, you made a deal.<eos> You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.
All these dumps look the same.<eos> So this spell, I'm stuck in some sort of Mementoâ crap?<eos> Right.<eos> The fix sounds fairly simple.<eos> You just find the witch who did it and kill it.
My name... my name is...<eos> My...<eos> My name is... is...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.
Rowena, now!<eos> Ez loh, say tah!<eos> Mah tay, ez loh, say tah!<eos> I managed to pervert that spell.<eos> So your essence wasn't sent back to the cage, but instead, we found your discarded vessel a few years ago... repaired it, improved it, making it a fitting final home for the real you.
Since... before the lake house.<eos> It wasn't Wally.<eos> They brought me that case.<eos> You were runnin' an errand for the Brits.<eos> You kept it from us.
See, I didn't choose this place for its ambiance.<eos> Obviously.<eos> This?<eos> It's a fortress.<eos> No one gets in here without me knowing about it.
Here.<eos> Here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to track Dean's cellphone.<eos> All right, got it.
That's nice.<eos> Well, I mean... Guys like us, we're not exactly the type of people they write about in history books, you know?<eos> But the people we saved, they're our legacy.<eos> And they'll remember us and then I guess... We'll eventually fade away, too.<eos> That's fine, because we left the world better than we found it, you know.
The grace extraction.<eos> The tracking spell was a bust, right?<eos> But... but the extraction ritual worked.<eos> So?<eos> So what if Cass used it on Kelly's kid?
Yeah.<eos> One for Kelly.<eos> They're close.<eos> The celestial pulse we felt,<eos> Joshua tracked it to a house nearby.
Crowley, I guess.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> Well, that's what Hess said.<eos> But Crowley's a freakin' cockroach.<eos> I'll believe he's gone when I see the body and burn it.
In an...actual rat?<eos> Wasn't too bad, really.<eos> Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job.<eos> Never realized I hate it.
Sammy.<eos> Where's your big bro?<eos> Right here.<eos> Ooh. Sweet toy.<eos> Yeah, I got it off an old -- new pal of mine.
Head gasket blew already.<eos> Barely made it home this afternoon, myself.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - You can take the boat though.<eos> We'll take it.
Listen, I was wondering, erm... if I popped over, maybe in the next half hour, would that be all right?<eos> I just need to borrow the old laptop.<eos> What for?<eos> Oh, it's got some files on it I need for school.<eos> I'll get it back to you later tonight. So, is that OK?
Yes, I did.<eos> I was on your computer.<eos> I used your card.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> When I sent it, I didn't know she'd been raped.
Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> Why?<eos> Just... do it.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> You record me, give it to the police as new evidence.
- Yeah, I do.<eos> And we can't afford new ones so, from now on, there is no smartphone and you use the computer at the library.<eos> Where did you get that porn from?<eos> Michael Lucas.<eos> - Where did he get it from?
I was er... just about to lock up actually.<eos> - Have you got your wife's laptop?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - How did you get it?
- PowerPoints of what?<eos> You know, various things.<eos> Osmosis, reproductive systems, the cellular life of plants...<eos> Right, well, we'll have the computer now, thanks.<eos> We'll examine it for our enquiries.
Why aren't we enough?<eos> What did you expect to get from him?<eos> I just needed... I needed to hear Joe say it.<eos> You know, confess properly, like he never would in court.<eos> I tried to record him on my phone, so I could give it to the police, but he took it off me.
What you doing?<eos> Get off!<eos> I was trying to work out where Michael got the porn from. Here!<eos> Your computer.<eos> He got it from you!
Your computer.<eos> He got it from you!<eos> That is not what's going on.<eos> What are you even doing with it?<eos> - Look, everybody has it!
More than that, there are traces of one of our men's DNA on the sock.<eos> Who?<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I was moving stuff and I found this.<eos> Never seen it before.
Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> One day, Osbert, I will kill that bastard and savour it.
I'm sorry. What are you saying?<eos> She's a... zombie?<eos> I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.<eos> - I don't like it either.<eos> - Let's not use it.
Are you going to spend the rest of your life making excuses<eos> - for his behaviour?<eos> - I'm not making excuses for anyone.<eos> She's telling the truth, sir.<eos> There's a link, she explained it to me.
What about yours?<eos> - When we put him on trial, the defence will rip holes in our case if you're involved.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I promised Anna.<eos> - Who's running it now?
You doing stuff you shouldn't be, and me having to cover it up.<eos> Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you.<eos> Ever since she turned up and you started wearing that bracelet.<eos> What, this?<eos> I've had it for ages.
Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you.<eos> Ever since she turned up and you started wearing that bracelet.<eos> What, this?<eos> I've had it for ages.<eos> Richard gave it to me as a present.
I can help you.<eos> I can help you beat Harry.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> There's a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it.
- You want to be transferred?<eos> - I'm not trusted.<eos> Harry!<eos> - This bracelet will drag him down.<eos> - I won't let it.
Klaus, what is that?<eos> It's Uncle Monty's handwriting.<eos> He must have copied it down during the movie.<eos> We were right next to him.<eos> If he got a message, we would've seen it.
Mr. Leonard.<eos> Did you know "Wright" comes from the Old English?<eos> - It means "shaper of wood." - Huh.<eos> And here I was thinking it meant "adulterer."<eos> Well, it intrigues me you never knew the meaning of your last name, considering you picked it.
And there are strict rules governing conflict that I cannot break, so...<eos> Then let's make this an unofficial consultation.<eos> Are there things I can do today to protect myself?<eos> Would I be wise to consider extreme measures, separation, divorce?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to pick up the money and put it back in your bag.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm gonna provide the equity piece.<eos> Great.<eos> We're also gonna put it in your name.
Lieutenant, I want to charter a boat to Santa Cruz Island. I need your approval.<eos> All right, it sounds like you're already on a boat.<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Bosch, what the fuck?<eos> I think Woody Woodrow stashed his money there and Dobbs has been tracking it.
Keeping the knife.<eos> It was hidden under the seat cushion.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> News to me.<eos> The lab took it apart this morning.
RHD says Caffrey was the target of the arson at River Watch.<eos> Somebody wanted to wipe him out and whatever he had in that apartment.<eos> But his lawyer had the yearbook. Yeah.<eos> And Caffrey kept a copy of my mother's murder book somewhere else, somewhere safe.<eos> And RHD found it.
You can say "Welcome back to the Bureau, Agent Wish."<eos> Give me a desk and a badge.<eos> Soon.<eos> I forgot what assholes you guys really are.<eos> Caffrey kept it in a safe deposit box.
Look, I'm trying to spare you some grief here, because if you run this story without confirmation, you'll regret it.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Not at all, just giving you a reality check.<eos> - The tip is wrong.<eos> - If you fall for it, you're gonna look like a fool.
-Out of my way, Remnant.<eos> -I thought you were trying to help.<eos> -Move, or you'll never get your body back.<eos> Isn't this what you want? To get back what she stole from you?<eos> -She didn't steal it.
- It's a...<eos> It's a picture, okay?<eos> It's like a little poop with a...<eos> That's what it means.<eos> Well, I didn't see it.
I went after him all the way across the border into...<eos> Pay the fuck attention!<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I find him at his sister's house.<eos> And he comes at me with a hockey stick, and I see this bat and I grab it.
She's my wife. I'll take care of it.<eos> Well, tell your grandson to go pay Tony for his lunch.<eos> And here.<eos> Give him back his shitty watch.<eos> You can keep the bat. I bought it at Herb's 10 minutes ago.
Ms. Bergstein.<eos> Do you need help? Ms. Bergstein?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm wearing this phone thing around my neck and it goes off sometimes.<eos> It's Japanese.<eos> You've never heard of it.
Tough day on the farm?<eos> Every day is a tough day when you're running a farm.<eos> 5:00 a.m. comes earlier every morning.<eos> There's a 5:00 a.m.?<eos> I'm kidding, I've heard of it.
And had it been a bat, which I realize now it was not, it would have been rabid, and you'd be thanking me for saving your life.<eos> You're the one hanging fruit in the trees with a sign that says, "For Bats."<eos> They have to eat.<eos> And this is your Panic Alert?<eos> Yes, it is. This car didn't come with any bells and whistles, so I use it as an OnStar.
You saw it yourself... there are thousands of drones in those walls.<eos> I mean, we didn't you see that whole bloody nest?<eos> What does it matter if we crack their communication?<eos> Put that audio file on a thumb drive.<eos> I'll take it to Hennessey, see if he has any ideas.
As long as we don't make any mistakes, you and I are gonna get out of this shithole.<eos> I promise.<eos> Extra security for the shipment... it's going up.<eos> We'll take good care of it.<eos> We're unloading it here.
What if that file had information on-- on where Bram's being held or-- or how long?<eos> - When his release date is-- how--<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll take it to work. Try to open it there.
What's on your mind?<eos> I have a file from the Deputy Proxy's Office.<eos> It's protected, but it's got all kinds of population data on the bloc, including information on where my eldest son, Bram, is being held.<eos> How do you know what's on the file if it's protected?<eos> Because my sister showed it to me.
May 18, 1969-- the fourth manned mission to the Moon.<eos> NASA still hasn't figured out the source.<eos> Lots of conspiracy theories.<eos> Here's your file.<eos> The instant I heard it, I recognized the similarities.
And why are we suddenly so eager to find an in?<eos> Her husband, Will.<eos> The collaborator.<eos> He let a kid go during a raid.<eos> The Occupation sniffed it out.
You get us something from that suit.<eos> Holy shit, it worked.<eos> Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet?<eos> Hennessey's gonna hold on to it.<eos> We'll take good care of it.
Dig deeper.<eos> If you're right, maybe we can use Bowman to catch Broussard.<eos> But tread carefully.<eos> Where was he keeping the gauntlet?<eos> Who else knew that Hennessey had it?
Even I'm baffled by the toilet payment system.<eos> Oh, it's simple, bring the chit from the applicable restroom to the purser...<eos> You might've been fun a hundred years ago, Burnsie, but now you're a cheap, old lamewad.<eos> And trust me, I know cheap.<eos> That's right, I bought a suit, Xeroxed it, returned it, and wore the copy.
Don't let it be forgot that on this shining spot was a place I really ate a lot.<eos> I don't see how you can blame a man of 97 for retiring.<eos> - I thought we were the same age.<eos> - So did I.<eos> Well, I hope you didn't sell it to some clown.
Suddenly this hot dog-covered locomotive seems like a joke!<eos> Take my hand, son.<eos> It's strong from turning a can opener.<eos> Your chili was store-bought? !<eos> I didn't say I paid for it.
We're gonna do everything we can to find your daughter.<eos> What was Strickland treating her for?<eos> She has a genetic disorder.<eos> Myers-Skelton Premature Immunosenescence.<eos> We're not quite sure what causes it.
Hardly anything is evil, but most things are hungry.<eos> Hunger looks very like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery.<eos> Or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?<eos> So what is it and what was it doing on Earth?<eos> Well, there were scorch marks on the concrete where we found it.
- Search the place.<eos> You're a stubborn son of a bitch.<eos> - The catalyst that launched you into hell.<eos> - Hell might be a bit extreme.<eos> - Well what would you call it?
How you doing?<eos> Oh, we're winning so far.<eos> There was a British agent here asking after you.<eos> Figured he'd catch up to me, eventually.<eos> The money is good, Martin, but I don't need it.
We'll go and have a talk with this shepherd.<eos> .. be sure of a bounteous harvest, and bless us with all good things throughout the coming year.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> What were you doing with Laxman's jacket?<eos> I found it under a hedge up by the woods, by the Americans' cottage.
What were you doing with Laxman's jacket?<eos> I found it under a hedge up by the woods, by the Americans' cottage.<eos> So why didn't you report it at the time?<eos> I find all sorts up the woods.<eos> I didn't know anyone was missing when I picked it up.
I'm pretty calm in a crisis.<eos> Eric borrowed his stepdad's car.<eos> Please don't tell Dan.<eos> He loves this car.<eos> Keeps it covered with a blanket in the garage, which is how I'll end up if he finds out I took it.
Well, I've got one with two heads.<eos> Maybe it isn't Wesen.<eos> What do you mean, like a real monster?<eos> Please don't don't me you think they exist.<eos> Wait, I think I found it.
- Anyone approach the car?<eos> - Not since I've been here.<eos> - We know which unit it is?<eos> - It's parked in the spot<eos> - Now you stay here, we'll check it out.
- How do you know that name?<eos> - Daddy said his name a lot of times last night.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Sometimes he said it really loud like he was mad at him.
Forget it.<eos> Monroe, when you met rosalee, was it love at first sight?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> She just didn't know it yet.
Not as long as you help us.<eos> So how long have you had this mirror?<eos> Forever.<eos> It was my mom's.<eos> I remember my dad brought it here to the shop for me to play with when my mom was in the hospital.
Nick!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> _<eos> So you felt the arm come through the mirror in the spice shop?<eos> I saw it first, and then I felt it.
And it shattered into pieces, and the pieces all came back together.<eos> It's not a magic mirror.<eos> It belonged to my mother.<eos> It's been in my family since I can remember.<eos> I think, as long as none of us look into it, we're probably okay.
"Humano-Reptiliana:<eos> Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.<eos> Grimms in the South used to use it to lure out Galenchidas from the swampy marshes, and catch them and chop off their heads.
Look what David is holding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot.<eos> He had a staff too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't promoted.<eos> Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
Then how did this Zerstoerer guy get his grubby mitts on it?<eos> I was just reading about this.<eos> There's a prophecy about a staff with the power of the gods, and it can't be destroyed.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Right here, I got it.
Because after seeing you up close,<eos> Allie preferred her ex.<eos> You popped the question, and allie said no.<eos> She was leaving to make up with trent myers, is that it?<eos> And then she thrust the very expensive blue coat. Back into your hands and said she didn't want it.
You left paint flecks from your tesla. What do you wanna bet we can match it up to your car?<eos> That tesla is filled with dna, Proving that allie dumped you, so you dumped her back.<eos> And he kept her keys so he could get. Into her ex-boyfriend's house where you put the burberry coat.<eos> The burberry coat that you.<eos> Soclearly described. So when we found it in her ex's closet, We would arrest trent and nobody would know.
Now, this... this wig, does this belong to you, sir?<eos> I mean, leftover from Halloween?<eos> I teach music to sixth graders at Ramsdell Hall.<eos> They won't allow me to wear my hair below my collar.<eos> Well, why don't you just cut it off then?
My paper's due at midnight. It's 11:30, and I haven't even started.<eos> You haven't even started?<eos> Well, I started thinking about it.<eos> But.... every time I go to write this stupid paper, it's... it's hard, and I'm worried I'm gonna be a big failure and let everyone down, so I...<eos> I put it off, and I watch cartoons.
I am not the Mother of Time. I will never be her.<eos> I'm a failure.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're not a failure yet.<eos> Look, the paper's due on his desk at midnight, but he's probably not gonna get to it till 12:30.
What the hell is that thing?<eos> Where are my manners?<eos> I'm Bob, chief intelligence officer here at NSA black site Indigo.<eos> Why is it made of meat? - Mm.<eos> - Okay. Imagine the NSA built a huge cube of nutrient enriched meat, then grew a giant human brain, placed it inside, added some wires, plugged it in, and then used it to monitor every person on Earth at all times.
- Right.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right. I mean, I definitely cannot take that money.<eos> But hold up.<eos> If I did take it, - would I be compromising my...
Don Francisco...<eos> If you're going to speak, don't lie.<eos> -I don't care why you did it.<eos> Just tell me how much it would cost to get the original will back.<eos> Suppose that was the case, and that's supposing a lot... why would you think I kept it?
It's better than being publicly shamed.<eos> -[chuckles] Great.<eos> -Mmm-hmm.<eos> I've got my cousin's number here.<eos> I'll give it to you. Here...
All right, back to work.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You really weren't kidding when you said you were doing this for you.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> I've been trying to get somebody in this position for this money for the last ten years, and now that I have... I'm gonna take full advantage of it.
$3,600?<eos> Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The clinic has a fund to help with this kind of thing.<eos> We do it all the time.
And you know what you are?<eos> Awesome.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want to take a coffee break?<eos> I think we've earned it.
- Oh, dear.<eos> - All this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin.<eos> I didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing.<eos> My café got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole.
- based at Silicon Beach.<eos> - But not a federal employee.<eos> Uh, government-adjacent with a fairly high security clearance.<eos> Could be why he was killed.<eos> His wife gave me his passcode to his laptop, but it had encrypted files that I need permission from D.C. to open, so I secured the computer and sent it downtown to Cyber.
Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?<eos> Danny... told you he gave me his cell?<eos> But you didn't use it to make a call.

OffKey.
You don't know what you're missing out on.<eos> KITTY CAT CLUB<eos> That suit was so formfitting.<eos> Be bloody hard to get out off, I'd imagine, huh?<eos> Unless he never takes it off.
- Northern Virginia.<eos> And the Muslim dies.<eos> Call the bomb squad, he dies.<eos> We've got eyes on the building.<eos> He leaves it, he dies.
- Well, use it.<eos> To write stuff down.<eos> Pyke has a scheme to trap him, yet he won't tell me what it is.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want you to blurt it out.
What are they talking about?<eos> Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.<eos> Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.<eos> And the baby?<eos> She lost it?
Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.<eos> Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.<eos> And the baby?<eos> She lost it?<eos> - Did they find it?
Oh, look, Margo's here.<eos> You remember Lasaro?<eos> That creep who made the Margolem?<eos> I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave up the spell.<eos> Living clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it's like he wanted me to steal it.
So I did.<eos> We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich... half an hour ago.<eos> Then I ate it.
You guys!<eos> You made a lot of friends, huh?<eos> I heard you guys were dead.<eos> So I threw this massive rager in your honor.<eos> The fact that you just called it a rager sickens me.
I am... ill-equipped to be a king.<eos> I am no better equipped to teach one.<eos> Being an adult is recognizing your responsibilities.<eos> A bunch of my students went and conquered another world.<eos> They more, like, gave it to us.
He's cut his eye!<eos> It's not OK!<eos> - Where did you park the car?<eos> - I'm trying to remember, Christ.<eos> - Did you not use it last?
- Just to find out what happened!<eos> What happened?<eos> I handled his penis.<eos> OK, someone else's penis, but that is as bad as the story gets.<eos> I took a man's penis out of his pants and I... I looked at it.
♪ Please send me a dream ♪<eos> ♪ Put my finger in a ring And gave his... ♪<eos> Every song is incredible.<eos> That album is gonna be massive.<eos> So Babyface produced it?
Excuse me. Miss.<eos> - I see that book. You're stealing it.<eos> - You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I saw you take that book.<eos> I'm almost certain you did not pay for it.
- Doctor.<eos> You think I would be here if I had health insurance?<eos> After this, I'm gonna buy Advil with an Albertsons rewards card.<eos> I wouldn't know where to begin to get health insurance.<eos> Most people get it through their job.
Yes. Bring the dogs in here.<eos> They'll kill themselves.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Office space!<eos> When do I want it?
When they ask you to put in the year that you were born,<eos> - all you have to do is...<eos> - Okay.<eos> You talk too much, like woman.<eos> Don't love the stereotype, but I'll take it.
And a little off.<eos> So, it's gonna be great.<eos> Whatever.<eos> That jumpsuit.<eos> Where did you get it?
I'm sorry. - Yeah.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without your computer.<eos> Left it at home.
I know.<eos> You took a payout and you signed a non-disclosure agreement.<eos> That's got nothing to do with it.<eos> They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.
You go there with a show of force like that, trust me, this woman is gonna be blown away.<eos> Okay, Donna.<eos> Show of force it is.<eos> Holy shit, Otis Redding's first album?<eos> You sure Harvey won't mind if I take it out?
Oh, I-I remember a few days ago,<eos> I think it was last Wednesday.<eos> Yeah, it was last Wednesday.<eos> Will said he felt like this car was following him.<eos> He said he saw it a few times... on Vermont, at school, near here.
I mean...<eos> I mean...<eos> I am very, very glad to have so much of your confidence.<eos> And my affection, Lieutenant.<eos> Whether you want it or not.
Well, since this is a murder, why don't we ask chief howard?<eos> You are gonna have to think up a new tactic pretty soon, Because any day now, that "let's ask chief howard".<eos> Is just gonna be a thing of the past.<eos> Well, while we are still in the present...<eos> If major crimes insists on special treatment, Of course, you will get it.
Yes, let's make sure we have their shoes.<eos> This is your helicopter, correct?<eos> Our helicopter.<eos> Danny. Why don't you let me do the talking?<eos> He flies it.
You help Ghost, you're protecting everybody.<eos> I will get you the money.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> And you're sure this is clean?<eos> Petar wired it from the security company, so on paper, it looks like reimbursement.
- Then it looks like you're gonna have to find your own way out of here.<eos> All clear, Freya.<eos> This is where you absolutely had to do a locator spell?<eos> Ah, well, when I first moved to New Orleans, I primed this space.<eos> Marked it with my magic, made it mine.
- So we need to find this book.<eos> Well, do we even know the name of it?<eos> It's some long Serbian name, which according to a message board roughly translates to:<eos> Pozica: Never Fucking Go There.<eos> There's this guy who claims to have it. Name's Anton.
- is to lose a hostage.<eos> - I understand that<eos> - but this witness is different.<eos> - We'll try to negotiate.<eos> But if we get a clear shot, we're gonna take it.
Very well.<eos> But you will continue to report to me.<eos> It was you that delivered the plate of food to Madame de Reynaud?<eos> Yes Sire.<eos> You collected it from the kitchens and you took it directly to her cell?
Mr. Marchal informs me that you have been his eyes and ears in the salon.<eos> From now on, I wish you to perform these same duties regarding your husband.<eos> If he says or does anything that you consider to be contrary to my interests,<eos> I wish to be informed of it. Yes, Sire.<eos> As for love, if that is what you seek, I suggest you seek it elsewhere.
We sold it for $23 million.<eos> Right... search optimization.<eos> That was five years ago.<eos> Look, Beth got your number from a private investigator,<eos> But... I still don't get it.
Good.<eos> Now I want my money.<eos> $5 million.<eos> Well, there's a problem.<eos> The Millers don't have it.
Well, that narrows it down.<eos> Wait.<eos> Uh, it was by the airport.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll find it.
Yep, it is.<eos> No, I'll...<eos> I'll do the line. I... i don't know what happened.<eos> Prep a chest tube.<eos> Really, I thought I had it.
I did, but... nothing worked.<eos> It just hurt a lot.<eos> I know.<eos> Gabe... we want to be able to give you a new medicine.<eos> And I'm afraid if you don't take it, you are gonna die.
I could only watch.<eos> I was useless, weak.<eos> - And the suit?<eos> - Stumbled across it online.<eos> I don't know why I ordered it.
I was useless, weak.<eos> - And the suit?<eos> - Stumbled across it online.<eos> I don't know why I ordered it.<eos> But when it came, I tried it on, and...
- But leaving the country?<eos> There is no oversight.<eos> The bacteria that caused your abscess likely came from a treatment.<eos> To ditch the wheelchair, it's worth it.<eos> You touched Nick's abdomen, and he felt it.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son.<eos> They need to operate on him immediately.<eos> But it was promised to us!<eos> We've been waiting for it.<eos> Plus that man would want Dustin to have it.
It wasn't good.<eos> And the point of this?<eos> The point is that I understand compulsive behavior.<eos> You know, it's not rational.<eos> You can't explain it.
Mr. President.<eos> We don't know who survived, but I've got our top agents searching for the Quinjet.<eos> Agent Burrows has the package, but we don't know if he was onboard.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let's hope for all our sakes that Director Mace got it.
Couldn't have known she'd be ready for us.<eos> Maybe if somebody had warned you first?<eos> - Guys.<eos> - No, you do this all the time, Phil.<eos> I give you the benefit of my expertise, and you just ignore it.
You put too much faith in them.<eos> Man is the superior machine.<eos> And I... am the superior man.<eos> I'm told you refuse to talk and that you welcome pain.<eos> And I love to make others feel it using the old ways.
Please be patient.<eos> While we're waiting, perhaps you could tell me why you dislike the Inhumans so much.<eos> Yes, some of them are monsters, true, but ...<eos> These Inhumans... they did not suffer, labor to become what they are.<eos> They have great power... but they didn't earn it.
My God. Is it possible?<eos> What?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Radcliffe mapped another brain.<eos> I saw it. I watched him do it!
!<eos> I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher ...<eos> You said it would help me find a solution ...<eos> - to eliminate the Inhuman problem.<eos> - I said don't touch it!
Bull. Where is the truck?<eos> Forget about the truck.<eos> This guy's never seen Terrigen before in his life.<eos> Hydra-issued citizen's card.<eos> But I know for a fact that your name isn't Jason Rajan, so I wonder, who made it?
You never helped anyone, you bitch!<eos> Give me the Terrigen, and I'll show you a threat.<eos> Someone in Hydra make this for you?<eos> Your name is Vijay Nadeer.<eos> Don't deny it.
I knew if anyone would understand, it'd be you.<eos> I would've figured it out a long time ago if it wasn't for the mind-control soap.<eos> Yeah. Wait. What?<eos> That blue soap everyone uses?<eos> Hydra loads it up with chemicals.
Daddy, help me!<eos> Daddy! Daddy!<eos> She's just a kid! Let her go!<eos> No!<eos> The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it.
Leaving in 10.<eos> Sir, the plates are switched, the transponder's toast.<eos> There's no way hydra can track the bus.<eos> Fast work. What's with the sat-radio?<eos> Well, I noticed the bus had a comms system, so I decrypted it and synched it up with this.
Do you think i don't know who you are?<eos> Where you're from?<eos> You come from that other world, just like them.<eos> You're just as tainted.<eos> You want to talk about that "other world," as you call it?
The facts will speak for themselves.<eos> It's done, Ophelia.<eos> I've completed the design.<eos> You won't have to live like this for much longer.<eos> I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.
- ... lifted?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We have located the two agents threatening the Framework.<eos> They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.<eos> Once we get a lock on it, my men have orders to shoot it down.
This is not on you, okay?<eos> We all lost ourselves in there.<eos> And yeah, it might take you a long time to forgive yourself.<eos> But speaking on behalf of the team, you have nothing to apologize for.<eos> If there's a price to pay, we pay it together.
Make it look professional.<eos> Right, smile like you love me.<eos> God, that's so bad.<eos> Paul's things.<eos> We're clearing out his locker cos someone needed it.
Who is this handsome stranger?<eos> I feel strangely drawn to him.<eos> As you are to all handsome strangers.<eos> I'd pour gold into your lap if I was sure of your love.<eos> You have it.
Is it the powder or have you seen a ghost?<eos> What crime were you planning to accuse me of?<eos> Miss Lacey, perhaps you'd care to take some tea...<eos> I've come to take a lot more than that.<eos> You threw me to her like a piece of scrag and you will answer for it.
Whatever for?<eos> That's for him to say.<eos> Amelia Scanwell, a girl of faultless virtue, told me she saw Sir George Howard carried lifeless from your house.<eos> The Scanwell girl is lying, and I'll tell her so in court.<eos> You put his carcass into a coach and dumped it into St. James's Pond.
My car is not working.<eos> Oh, no. Did you call AAA?<eos> No, I called a friend. He knows how to fix cars.<eos> He's almost done with work, and then he's gonna come and help me.<eos> - He's fixed it before.
He kicked it down that pier like if it was a football.<eos> He was stomping on it like a crazy man.<eos> And then he starts kicking it towards me.<eos> Then he said to me, "beatriz, kill it."<eos> I looked down at the octopus and I touched it.
- So do I.<eos> I think we all have a destiny to manifest.<eos> And if we don't, it hurts the soul.<eos> If the brass ring is there, there's a reason.<eos> And if we don't grab it, we... We regret it for the rest of our lives.
This is Cal.<eos> He's got that deposition.<eos> - I'm gonna take this in the house.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Well, we just hold it?
Tangled Up in Blue.<eos> Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.<eos> Our car was that color.<eos> We bought it off Craigslist.
We're almost there.<eos> Okay, here we are.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Yeah. Can we get some help?<eos> There's real coffee, can you smell it?
Okay.<eos> Did you sleep in here?<eos> Just getting a feel for my new office.<eos> You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?<eos> You put a bike rack in here, your first pro bono, you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.
- Donna told you, didn't she?<eos> - Probably.<eos> Did she bother telling you what we're doing now?<eos> She didn't have to, 'cause you're Harvey Specter.<eos> You've got one trick, and you taught it to me years ago, so let's go.
Thank you for dinner, Harvey.<eos> If you need a session, call my office.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore, but I can give you a recommendation for someone who can.<eos> - Louis, what can I do... - Do for me?<eos> You could tell me from now on if you have a problem with me, you'll take it up with me instead of going behind my back.
I couldn't control it.<eos> And the street's right there, what if somebody sees us?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Okay, there's nobody around, it's dark, and there are no security cameras.<eos> We'll wrap his body in a tarp, put it in our car, take it to the storage unit where you can eat.
What are we gonna do?<eos> Okay, there's nobody around, it's dark, and there are no security cameras.<eos> We'll wrap his body in a tarp, put it in our car, take it to the storage unit where you can eat.<eos> I'll mop up the blood and pour some bleach on the spot so it doesn't stain.<eos> We haven't touched his car, so we'll leave it here. You understand?
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner.
We had him guarantee to pay you what he promised and to hire you over there at the end of the quarter.<eos> - 'Cause I don't just want you to set that hearing,<eos> I want you to bulldoze anyone who stands in my way.<eos> Look, it's up to you.<eos> You take the job and the money and you get me in or you stay on a sinking ship and wait for them to figure out that you're the one who sank it.
Because I didn't fly all the way down here to strong-arm that woman.<eos> And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.<eos> You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.
To ensure life and death remain separate.<eos> But if he crosses that bridge...<eos> He won't!<eos> And why not?<eos> Because I'm gonna destroy it.
Jeff. Jeff!<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.
Where's your car?<eos> What, you didn't bring you car?<eos> Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.<eos> No, I didn't bring my car.<eos> You and Switchblade Sally ditched it at the front gate.
You do understand me, don't you?<eos> So...<eos> What do you think of our little club?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> I thought you'd enjoy it.
Blessed day.<eos> I've got a fine cut of meat for Commander Waterford.<eos> Praised be His bounty.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> Saved it for you.
♪ Gotta get those workers out of there ♪<eos> ♪ With a job to do ♪<eos> Uh, I... I need a phone.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said that you could put your uniform on?<eos> What... I gave it to him.
The joy in exercising what you have to give.<eos> Where's Jeremiah now?<eos> That's another story for another time.<eos> Here, now, I want you to keep an eye on your peers, identify their individual potential, andand, you know, help them see it.<eos> Help them realize it.
You can't be wavering. When.<eos> When we sell<eos> Will selling it even be enough money?<eos> - We all know he overpaid. - And what about the garden?<eos> What if this is where the garden is meant to be and we lose it?
We just wanted to say thank you for sheltering us and thank you for your generosity.<eos> We will repay it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've all lost.<eos> We share that. And grieving's hard, but it's important that we process it...
As time went by, and freedom arrived, townships changed, and have become a place where black people can have fun.<eos> Barbecuing is something that black people and white people have always done.<eos> Barbecuing used to be something you did just for fun.<eos> Now it is something people can make a business out of.<eos> [in Afrikaans] I found this place and cleaned it up by myself.
Nah, just bacon, eggs, snags.<eos> Just your basic shit.<eos> That's what a barbecue is.<eos> It's not like putting a hangi down, where you've got to spend hours and hours.<eos> Barbecue, you should be able to start it up, crank it up. Over and done with in half an hour, everybody's sitting down having a feed.
The best lechon is in Cebu.<eos> Outsiders who come to Cebu, they always want to taste the lechon.<eos> The best lechon is made in Cebu.<eos> Cooking with heart, that's how I do it.<eos> When I cook lechon, I cook it wholeheartedly.
It's a homecoming to a lot of people.<eos> It means community is what barbecue means, and there's a community of us that are still keeping it alive.<eos> What we're doing is, we're putting as much love into this as we can.<eos> You know, and we're...<eos> I'm trying to show the gratitude I have to the people that I've learned it from, and a gratitude to the ones that they learned it from.
Get me in a room with him.<eos> Then I'll know if I have an enemy.<eos> Your locker, Mr. Rhoades.<eos> Thank you, Domingo.<eos> Now, some people, when aging a cigar, keep it at 70 percent humidity.
Aluminum.<eos> That's what it tastes like, anyway.<eos> Fear in the back of my throat.<eos> You know, most people, they try to move away from fear, try to organize it out of their lives as soon as they're able.<eos> Me? I cultivate it.
The petting zoo.<eos> It's an animal conservancy, I think.<eos> Anyway, tell them I'm in, along with the big donation.<eos> The only thing I want from them is their assurance that Jack Foley be named their man of the year and that I'll be the one presenting him the damn thing.<eos> A package came for you. I put it on your desk. It smells musty.
It is within reach.<eos> I just need the cash.<eos> Your, lockup period is ending?<eos> You said you wanted to do something for me.<eos> - Now is when I need it.
Last time I tried, he fired me.<eos> So you want me to review it.<eos> Would you?<eos> I'm not saying I've got fucking dyscalculia, but if I'm gonna put my ass on the chopping block, I want to make sure I'm not missing something.<eos> Send the report over. I'll take a look at it.
Be fun if you could find a way to lob a turd in the punch bowl.<eos> Yeah. Real fun.<eos> I'll make sure to take a sizable allocation.<eos> So you'd have cover.<eos> Yeah, take the free money up front, throw it into reverse, and I'd short every tick on the way down.
- Mr. Mulligan.<eos> Five shillings for two inches?<eos> It's highway robbery.<eos> Honestly, I don't know why you buy space in that dishrag.<eos> No one reads it.
You'll have to wait a little longer as I must wait for a stipend from New York in order to pay you.<eos> - We can't wait!<eos> - Don't take that tone!<eos> - Gentlemen, please.<eos> - We will block the road with our wagons, we will block it.
Well, he doesn't, sir.<eos> He knows that Caleb is my friend, that he's seconded to my command, and he knows that I run spies, but he knows nothing about Culper senior or junior.<eos> Brewster does.<eos> He would never give up the ring, sir.<eos> He has already destroyed it.
Lady Washington.<eos> Clever, isn't it?<eos> That awful winter at Valley Forge, my husband made do with just a spoon.<eos> But with this, he would have had a full set of cutlery.<eos> Why don't you take it?
Son of a bitch.<eos> You okay?<eos> I just feel like crap, and all I want is coffee, and I can't even do that.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Hey, you need it more than me.
That's why Mother sold my horse.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Write that down.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no. Your dad sold it to get the IRS off of his back.
- Of Purell. I gotta find a Boost Mobile store.<eos> It's too bad we won't have time to see the camel races.<eos> They're saying that Hamlool could be the next Al Misk.<eos> And plus, the day after Daylight Saving Time, you're all messed up.<eos> One time, my mom brought in my breakfast an hour late like an idiot, so I just threw it on the floor and I said,

I'm gonna slow dance with Mama.<eos> Of course, Gary.<eos> Hey, everybody eat!<eos> Danny, where the fuck were you? I've been trying to call you all night.<eos> A... it's Dan, and B... I don't have my phone because this morning's guest dropped it over the side of the Staten Island Ferry while pretending to be Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl."
We did, Ma'am.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, now it's on top of you, it's knocked your teeth out, and it's making sweet love to your face!<eos> We don't know my diary is the source.<eos> Well, there's scans of it on the WaPo website.
I'm about to go viral.<eos> The ball!<eos> Did you get the footy?<eos> No, I don't have my phone!<eos> I left it in the car!
Sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey. Whoa. Dude.<eos> Oh, that's not my phone.<eos> I found it in these pants, so.
Citizens of Charm City, kiss your precious organic juice bar good-bye!<eos> "You don't need to have superpowers to accomplish great things.<eos> Love, Dad."<eos> He gave this to me when I was little.<eos> - I always keep it with me.
Love, Dad."<eos> He gave this to me when I was little.<eos> - I always keep it with me.<eos> - That's so sweet.<eos> And now you're smelling it like a creepy person.
Can I pick the color?<eos> It's 7:00 a.m. What am I doing here?<eos> Van, this device we've created has just alerted me that Jack-O-Lantern is in the area, giving us enough time to get to safety.<eos> It uses advanced chemoreceptors to pick up on Jack-O-Lantern's unique smell profile.<eos> We call it the "Jack-O-Lert."
Show her.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I know they're in Chicago...<eos> Just have a little faith.<eos> So, we figured since they are using a physical map, they'd probably be touching it.
I'm assisting Detective Babineaux with a murder investigation.<eos> An anonymous witness sent me Snapchats with photos they took of possible suspects.<eos> As soon as I open the images, they disappear.<eos> You could've saved us both a lot of time if you'd just screen-grabbed the images.<eos> When I want your advice, I'll beat it out of you.
Damn that woman.<eos> [man] What do you want us to do?<eos> I want my money.<eos> Get it.<eos> [man] What if she doesn't have it?
To make someone think I was out of the country.<eos> -Who is this person?<eos> -What does that matter?<eos> I want to know if you're in danger, Alba.<eos> I owe money... and if I don't pay it back, I'll go to jail or worse.
With respect, Lord Uhtred.<eos> You have still not explained why you crossed the street into Daneland.<eos> I can never remember your name.<eos> I am Aldhelm, I'm Commander of Lord Aethelred's household guard.<eos> Would you like me to write it down?
Look, I read your report.<eos> I know you and James Hicks got in a scuffle,<eos> I know he shot you, but come on.<eos> Give me a little something off the record?<eos> Why do you think he did it, huh?
You know what?<eos> After seeing that snoozer, I don't want Barbara to have any part of Hollywood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, she can be something important, like a realtor.<eos> All right, I stitched it up with a rubber band and a fisherman's knot right there.
Bobby, don't ruin your suit.<eos> We can't afford it.<eos> Oh, my God, this is terrible.<eos> Can I see the ring again?<eos> Um, I licked it, and it's not candy.
See what they're carrying?<eos> - Metal?<eos> - Metal.<eos> They scavenge and trade it for food.<eos> Then, Nos smuggles it in tunnels into the Badlands on the black market.
He might dress a little funky, but that's impossible.<eos> Oh, like Headless Horsemen?<eos> Huh? Demon John Wilkes Booth?<eos> Jake's right.<eos> I lifted a hair follicle off your jacket and sent it to the lab for carbon-14 dating.
So, Banneker went and worked with the founders after all?<eos> Story for another day.<eos> We do not have long to prepare.<eos> You're thinking J Street. It is a cul-de-sac, so if we lure the Horseman in, we can use Banneker's disc to block his way out.<eos> But you said that it's enchanted, so how do we open it?
Well, well, well.<eos> You are full of surprises.<eos> Where did you get this book?<eos> You can trust me.<eos> Father. He gave it to me before he disappeared.
- Kinda homey.<eos> - If your home's in hell.<eos> Look, Bob, don't patronize me.<eos> I know this place is a dump.<eos> Not as clean as what's-his-name would keep it.
Stay out of sight.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> I realize now that... everything gained can just as easily be lost.<eos> The book is safe, Professor.<eos> We'll go back there and get it, as soon as we get out of this.
Oh, no, no.<eos> I get it.<eos> Believe me, I do.<eos> Running this country is the hardest job there is.<eos> Problem is, with everything that's been flying at you, you're not actually running it.
But then I realized it had to be the FBI.<eos> I had to get to the director himself, so I went straight for Alexandria.<eos> And I almost made it when I lost control of my car.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd hacked it somehow.
Impressive CV for someone your age.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Oh... and if I get you some more of that special Kona coffee that you like, will you tell me the real reason you left?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I-I'll think about it.
Well, he's reaching out now.<eos> I want to remind you, this bill is not about taking guns away from people.<eos> It's about making sure they don't fall into the wrong hands in the first place.<eos> Initial social media response to the bill is mixed.<eos> Well, they don't call it a third rail for nothing.
I'll go check on Mrs. Kirkman now.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Speaking of numbers, sir, we need to get 51 Senate votes in two days, which is not gonna be easy.<eos> The language of the bill is not ideal, as you know.<eos> That's why Senator Bowman picked it.
That's fantastic.<eos> I'm sorry it had to play out like this, Tom.<eos> I wish I could have just said yes when you asked me, but, anyway, I wanted you to hear it from me.<eos> You can count on my vote.<eos> I really appreciate it, Walter.
Tail number was blacked out.<eos> And there's no FAA airtraffic control in the area.<eos> It's like he flew into a vacuum.<eos> Did we secure the munitions, at least?<eos> Yeah, the task force was on the ground two hours after Hannah called it in.
Hey, Dan.<eos> Nice smear job.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> I called you for a comment.<eos> Yeah, and you buried it under four graphs of innuendo.
Now, this was a fair deal.<eos> Every single person in this room has something to claim victory over.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hijack that, sir.<eos> And if you're willing to play politics with people's lives, trust me...<eos> I am more than willing to walk down that hall to my press room and call you out in front of the entire world for trying to hold our justice system hostage at a time when we need it most.
You didn't even notice.<eos> I mean, it looks the same?<eos> It always looks great.<eos> What is... what?<eos> I got it for the trip.
I gave it my best shot in there today with the committee.<eos> What makes you think I'll do any better in the House?<eos> Because it'll give us time to organize a campaign.<eos> We'll put your profile out there in the national media,<eos> We'll drag it out as long as we can... until public opinion swings the vote in your direction.
Mr. President.<eos> Major flag for you, sir.<eos> What is it?<eos> Abe Leonard is running a story claiming that FBI Deputy Director Jason Atwood was arrested in the Oval for the murder of Majid Nassar.<eos> He says the White House covered it up.
Thank you.<eos> You ready for tonight?<eos> Happy with your speech?<eos> I better be.<eos> I wrote it myself this time.
Don't apologize.<eos> You're a welcome sight.<eos> I know it's been a while since we were sent to the Continental side.<eos> And I was just telling her her position's taken.<eos> And now she is getting it back.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.<eos> I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.<eos> Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?<eos> Positive.<eos> If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> There it is.<eos> I lent Linus my smart-watch.<eos> He still has it.
I thought you guys were in trouble.<eos> It's like a country club!<eos> We're being reassigned, not waterboarded.<eos> Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.<eos> I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Well, I'm not sure what you did.<eos> Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.<eos> All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.<eos> Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
I think the time off did him some good.<eos> I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.<eos> I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days.<eos> You been working on this leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm left it off of Jane's body because it is a dud.
Made Icarus's wings, right?<eos> Stop looking at me like that when I know things.<eos> Pretentious college kids and lithium.<eos> That does not add up.<eos> Maybe they're mixing it with Jaeger and doing shots?
A piece of paper that cost me billions of dollars, okay?<eos> Are you happy now, Mom and Dad, huh?<eos> - Why don't you take that piece of paper... - Rich!<eos> Rich!<eos> ...and roll it up real tight and shove it up your...
Yes.<eos> Hey, Cap, what happened to that diesel fuel you promised?<eos> Fuel's right there. Much as you want.<eos> The silo, right?<eos> Could munchers have opened it?
Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.<eos> That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
Thank you.<eos> It's hard to concentrate with "Che Guevara" up my ass.<eos> Find anything?<eos> There's a shipment today a few miles from here.<eos> I want to see it for myself.
Do you want to know why my marriage ended, Jack?<eos> - Hmm? - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... for as long as I can remember, I've woken up at 6:30 every day to make Shelly coffee, splash of milk, two sugars.<eos> I would make it and bring it to her in bed.
Baby, our beautiful children need a beautiful dog.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Get them a dog.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And then get them a new mommy who will walk it.
So... thanks.<eos> For being a dick.<eos> I needed it.<eos> Like I said, your voice was annoying my horses.<eos> That's why I grabbed it.
"From the team."<eos> And for all this, Tyler, I thank you.<eos> You see, for days, I've been plagued by this question:<eos> How do I honor my father's legacy?<eos> Then I realized, I honor it by taking what I've learned from how he lived his life and having it shape the way I go on living mine.
Fresh meats that you could actually go and pick out the chicken.<eos> - He would kill the chicken...<eos> - What?<eos> ... defeather it, clean it,<eos> - and then wrap it up for you.
Well, he believes he's mentally ill, but at the same time part of him knows that the power is real.<eos> And are we clear on the scope and nature of this power?<eos> No, but if the readings are right, he may be the most powerful mutant that we have ever encountered.<eos> After what happened in red hook, I'd say that's an understatement.<eos> So he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it.

We may never get the chance again.<eos> That would be a mistake.<eos> We've never had a subject like this before.<eos> I need...<eos> Look, just give me till the end of the day, and you have the gas if you need it.
So, Dev, how was the fasting today?<eos> You know, I didn't eat anything from sunrise to sunset, so I'd say solid fast. And it must be very difficult to fast with all those tasty cupcakes at work.<eos> Mm. Did you know Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during the NBA Finals?<eos> Fun fasting fact, huh, Navid?<eos> Yeah, I've heard it before.
Look, I get it. For you guys, religion has this cultural value.<eos> It's not like that for me.<eos> It's people calling me terrorist and getting pulled out of airport security lines.<eos> That's because you lost your passport three times.<eos> I lost it twice.
God's sake, I'm busting.<eos> Tie a knot in it.<eos> What went on in there?<eos> Since when's it my job to do yours?<eos> If you put the report on my desk, DS Flynn, I'll be sure to take a look at it.
The map also shows the location of Hana Reznikova's abduction.<eos> Seems like your man wasn't in the right place at the right time.<eos> Just because the phone was there doesn't mean Farmer was.<eos> And there are no witnesses to Farmer loitering near his grandmother's nursing home for an hour and 45 minutes.<eos> He left it there the whole time?
OK.<eos> A thorough search of the flat failed to recover Tim Ifield's mobile phone and laptop computer.<eos> So we can assume that the killer stole the phone and the laptop.<eos> Is there a track on the phone?<eos> The last recorded position was Tim's flat, so whoever took it was smart enough to switch it off.
Got you a big pint of that cats' piss that you young fellas seem to like so much.<eos> - That whisky's probably older than me. - Aye.<eos> And all the better for it.<eos> No, I just thought this would be a... a better way for us to discuss your ambitions.<eos> I know that if I put you on a case, you'll see it through to the bitter end, come what may.
- Amen.<eos> We never got married.<eos> She wanted to... especially after you were born.<eos> She took my name.<eos> She wanted you to have it. But I always thought that was some kind of a bad omen.
How many times I gotta tell you to stop calling me that?<eos> Well, Nunez is MIA.<eos> It's just Rita and I running the shop, and she called in sick.<eos> So did Warren and Franks, so,<eos> I'd say the job's yours if you want it.
Too long.<eos> I live and work here.<eos> Just as dusty and crowded as I remembered it.<eos> It's not as charming as your old bus, but I make do.<eos> Hey, don't knock it till you try it.
"Then the smallest mouse Came out of its hidey-hole." And stood before the others.<eos> "'I will free princess knabberzahn From the cat's dungeon.'"<eos> This is boring.<eos> I want the dinosaur book.<eos> Honey, we don't have it with us.
The one from this morning?<eos> No.<eos> No, another one.<eos> I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.
Look, it's gonna be okay, Gabby.<eos> I mean, DCFS will read this guy the riot act.<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> Who took the top hat?<eos> Why would someone take it?
- I'm fine.<eos> - Take a break, Gabby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something I should know about?<eos> We'll fix it as good as new, Chief.
- Morning, Chief.<eos> Tell me again, when is the briefing room door getting fixed?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh, Capp was supposed to pick up<eos> - the new piece of glass, but...<eos> - But it's silly for Capp to pay for the glass when Otis broke it.
I'll bring the desk with me.<eos> That was my feeling.<eos> Small desk, obviously.<eos> Maybe it folds up.<eos> But that way I'll have it while I'm making the world safe for democracy some more.
Cancer.<eos> She tried all the things.<eos> Chemo, radiation, surgery.<eos> You know what they do with a tumor when they cut it out?<eos> They put it in a bag and burn it.
you might be tempted to do such a thing yourself.<eos> We're stealing these, too.<eos> So allow me to offer you a piece of advice, even though I don't know anything about you.<eos> Do not take a sailboat that does not belong to you.<eos> We're just borrowing it.
I'm the boss.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> There's a reason this town will never forget your parents.<eos> They're the ones that burned it down.
- No.<eos> No, I don't need a third eye to be able to see that all of this is wrong.<eos> Mr. Cole, the window is closing.<eos> I'm splintering you to the Emerson Hotel, 2007.<eos> You'll devise a plan, you'll execute it.
Okay, wait, as much as I would love you to blast their brains all over the walls, she knows something.<eos> There's something real.<eos> Cole, Cole, Cole...<eos> There's a map, and it's about the red forest and everything.<eos> We can use it.
Turns out, I was writing about the future in the past tense...<eos> #PrimaryProblems.<eos> What's your point, Ms. Goines?<eos> The Witness also kept a diary.<eos> Seen it with my own eyes in Monkey Mansion.
This led us to Titan.<eos> Ramsey tore that off a document - in Berlin. - Ah.<eos> So you all have been chasing the Monkeys for years, but this word is your chance to get ahead of them?<eos> We'd have to go back to Berlin.<eos> If we went back there and stole it, we would never have the piece to locate Titan in the first place.
"The House of Cedar and Pine."<eos> 1957. Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...
When's the last time you slept?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> What time is it?<eos> My watch is gone.<eos> Do you see it?
Okay?<eos> I own this place now.<eos> Took me forever to find it.<eos> It's complete shite.<eos> Why do you want it?
That's a lovely invitation, but I think you'd prefer one of the other gentlemen who's about to come this way.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You look pretty handsome to me.<eos> And what happened to your wedding ring?<eos> You lose track of it?
I feel a strange kind of kinship towards you, Henri, so I know that you are not the type to give up so easily.<eos> Oh, I haven't given up.<eos> I'm just waiting for the right moment.<eos> And what is that moment?<eos> I'll know it when I see it.
I didn't see.<eos> The kingsguard put him under arrest.<eos> The privy council meeting is tomorrow morning.<eos> Did you find the missing money?<eos> Darnley spent it.
I was told that the court ambassador to England was waiting in the throne room, insisting on speaking with the king.<eos> They were up in arms, as well, but Henri took charge.<eos> He used the situation to his own advantage.<eos> His speech was quite stirring, something about Englishmen being swine and how France would never back down.<eos> Our French nobles, they were cheering, but the ambassador, well, he didn't take it quite so well.
If Darnley is no longer motivated to share your power, he's gonna try and take it.<eos> He's a threat to your throne and to your life, Mary.<eos> You need to get rid of him.<eos> I'm not ready to talk about killing a king... or to have my child without a father.<eos> There has to be another way, and I will find it, as long as I have you by my side.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry. That went on forever. Were you having sex with sting, or...<eos> Just this brain I've been on.<eos> Ravi soaked it in some blue solution, part of his memory research.
Scalpel, please.<eos> That's the woman I told you about.<eos> Around 9:30 last night, she walked in, and...<eos> Anyone recognize her?<eos> Uh-uh. And believe me, everyone watched it.
You were totally into Yvonne, but she friendzoned you.<eos> She wanted your money, but she didn't want you.<eos> She didn't even take the money.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't know, she just said she didn't need it.
So...<eos> - Be sure to include whether or not the dryer was already plugged in when you got there.<eos> Why?<eos> If it was plugged in already, it's manslaughter.<eos> If you plugged it in, it's murder.
Maybe you can get him to understand the seriousness of the situation.<eos> - All right, I'll take care of it.<eos> - You know where his bar is at, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know where he's at.<eos> - He probably closed it down a few times back in the day, right?
Then go play in your apartment.<eos> I can't play in my apartment.<eos> My dad's got old picture frames and trophies and stuff.<eos> Is that mustache real?<eos> No, I glued it to give myself more authority in situations like this.
I know this must all be pretty confusing for you.<eos> My god.<eos> Don't even. Where are you going?<eos> Do you need any money?<eos> Winslow's mother owns this place but the stepfather runs it.
Thanks, dad brain.<eos> You find anything on those old Chuck burd shows?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well, get back to work.<eos> There's a crisp five dollar bill in it for you if you do.
Shall we begin?<eos> While you wait, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife?<eos> I don't believe I have.<eos> One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap.<eos> Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.
He died?<eos> He built this place with Cary 30 years ago.<eos> Before the Divisions.<eos> Before anyone knew ‭how fast the world would change.<eos> They built it, ‭and they went looking for people like you to fill it.
I'll give you what your boss wants.<eos> Or you can carry on. Torturing me, but you'd be no further ahead.<eos> In this game, you're only as good as your strongest asset.<eos> I can be that asset.<eos> My superiors didn't approve that arrangement. From the brigadefuhrer; why would they approve it from me?
Survival.<eos> You tried to take this bunker for yourself, yet here I am, willing to talk.<eos> The Trikru alliance holds the temple.<eos> Of course you're willing to talk.<eos> And the Azgeda alliance surrounds it.
I'm not a quitter.<eos> Thanks for understanding.<eos> Where's Monty?<eos> Unloading the rover.<eos> We're leaving it behind for you, by the way.
You don't have to kill all 12 warriors.<eos> I just have to kill the last one.<eos> Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it.
The water's cold enough.<eos> Your pulse is already dangerously slow.<eos> Tell me again how you're gonna drop the electrical current to restart your heart once it stops.<eos> A live wire on a timer set to go off 15 minutes after I flatline.<eos> I rigged it to deliver the exact same charge as the defibrillator in the emergency med kit in the rocket.
one champion per clan, one death instead of thousands.<eos> Then whoever wins gets the bunker.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We'll share it.
Breathing's important, too.<eos> What's the plan for oxygen?<eos> Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker,<eos> I'm guessing... make that praying... There's an oxygenator there.<eos> We take it with us.
What's the plan for oxygen?<eos> Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker,<eos> I'm guessing... make that praying... There's an oxygenator there.<eos> We take it with us.<eos> You hook it up.
T-minus 51 minutes and counting.<eos> Set it down. I got this.<eos> Go find your glove.<eos> I can't find my other glove.<eos> I can't find it.
Uh, no, actually, this is about a different nightmare scenario.<eos> I've been running diagnostics on the timer chip you recovered from Arkani's factory, and it is far more impressive than anything we've seen from the NMB or any extremist group for that matter.<eos> In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because... we did make it.<eos> - Good Lord.<eos> - More specifically, the defense contractor Blackthorn Kincaid made it.
In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because... we did make it.<eos> - Good Lord.<eos> - More specifically, the defense contractor Blackthorn Kincaid made it.<eos> Well, they make everything from our own ICBMs to Israel's Iron Dome.<eos> So how'd Arkani get it?
Well, that won't happen.<eos> Everyone here has dedicated his or her life to protecting the American people.<eos> Tell us about the timing chip.<eos> It was manufactured within the last four months as part of a surface-to-air missile teleguidance system.<eos> Can you tell us who manufactured it?
The attackers were all wearing balaclavas.<eos> We have proprietary mapping software that can recognize sufficient facial contours through a soft fabric mask.<eos> - Ah. Remarkable.<eos> - Another trade secret.<eos> You tell your leadership I'll be adding it to my bill.
Get him back here.<eos> Now.<eos> Agent Ressler, no word on Agent Navabi.<eos> - You have the system?<eos> - Yeah, we have it right here.
Ressler, move your team in now.<eos> Hands!<eos> Hands where I can see 'em.<eos> Bring it down!<eos> I'm not the one controlling it.
- Uh, sir, sir. - Huh? Huh?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Sir, there's a... situation.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I would've told you about it earlier, but--
And you stuck the toothpick in the food, and you stuck it in the chocolate, and you stuck it in your mouth."<eos> Then, 'I want another drink!<eos> '<eos> Then they bring it, you drink it, it dribbles down and it gathers in your navel.<eos> You punch yourself... to get it in your mouth."
"Is there something that I need to know?<eos> So the lady's sitting there, she's like,<eos> "Well...<eos> Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."<eos> And the gorilla immediately took it in.
"That was so sad.<eos> I mean, it was beautiful, but it was sad."<eos> And I was just like, "Get off me."<eos> "Just... Just get off me."<eos> And I closed the laptop, set it down on the nightstand, and I just got up, and I started pacing.
So we get into the house. She's scoping it out, because she's smart.<eos> She's finding the rooms that get sun, checking closet space.<eos> Me, like an idiot, I want to check out the garage.<eos> For whatever reason, I'm drawn to this.<eos> And I go down, I open the door, and the last people hadn't cleaned it out.
I got three hours into this job, my forearms were cut, I had dirt, sweat, cobwebs all over me.<eos> I wanted to burn down this fucking house.<eos> I was ready to leave.<eos> But out of nowhere, my wife showed up, big smile on her face, and she had made me a sandwich.<eos> Cut it in half diagonally, which is love, right?
I wanted to burn down this fucking house.<eos> I was ready to leave.<eos> But out of nowhere, my wife showed up, big smile on her face, and she had made me a sandwich.<eos> Cut it in half diagonally, which is love, right?<eos> If they don't cut it in half, they might as well frisbee it.
"Here you go, you fucking piece of shit.<eos> Hose yourself off!<eos> You should live out here!<eos> You should live out here!" Right?<eos> Cut it in half diagonally, poured Fritos in the middle, and gave me an ice-cold beer.
It just pops in my head like this fond memory.<eos> I'll just be by myself, talking in the car.<eos> "Remember that time she made me a sandwich?<eos> It was unbelievable!<eos> She cut it in half, Fritos, an ice-cold beer. I felt like a king!"
I'd like to ask a favour.<eos> Wait there.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Father, I don't trust myself with it.<eos> I will put it somewhere safe.
Maybe you should go and see her and show her she's not nearly clever enough to get one over on the great Father Brown.<eos> Have you ever heard the story of the eagle and the daw?<eos> I can't say I have.<eos> A jackdaw sees an eagle swoop down on a spring lamb, carrying it away to eat.<eos> The jackdaw believes himself to be as powerful, so he flies over, lands on the back of another lamb, grips it with his claws and flaps away with all his might.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, how did it go?<eos> Oh, it's hard to tell.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - I bet you aced it.
Who would say that?<eos> One of the locals described seeing someone.<eos> I thought it might be him.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> If Eddie went to Peru, I would know about it.
Get on the table.<eos> Where are we on finding Roman?<eos> I'm using Patterson's system to autodial Roman's cell phone every 15 seconds.<eos> - But he hasn't picked up.<eos> - But we're tracking it?
That's just... what every girl wants to hear as she's being tied to a plank with wire.<eos> Chris lived to help others.<eos> She made lives better all over the world.<eos> She helped build the hospital that she died in.<eos> And it only stood for one month before an unsanctioned American bombing turned it to ash.
Hang on a minute, where was that book found?<eos> Borden's apartment.<eos> Can you zoom in on that?<eos> That's book one of Livy's "Ab Urbe Condita."<eos> Jane said that she'd seen it in Shepherd's office.
Which... which dress?<eos> You know, this one.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Because you've never seen it on me before?
- I'm searching.<eos> Oh, maybe this.<eos> Okay, "Locate current defendant using his..."<eos> Yeah, no, still need the number.<eos> - Okay, I found it!
Well, a neighbor called 911, and then the firefighters broke the gate down.<eos> Listen, they saved your life.<eos> Damn razor wire.<eos> I got most of it down, and then I fell off the ladder into the whole mess of it.<eos> You were taking it down?
I'm sure there's more to it than that.<eos> Well, it's not right, what Bailey did.<eos> You can't just throw anybody in as Chief of General Surgery.<eos> Keps is good, but Grey put in the time for that job, okay?<eos> She deserves it.
I know you feel responsible...<eos> But I am responsible.<eos> You couldn't have known you tore that vessel.<eos> Dr. Robbins didn't catch it.<eos> Dr. Minnick didn't catch it.
The vessel's prepped for anastomosis.<eos> Pocket for implantation is ready.<eos> Go time.<eos> Stop!<eos> Did you attach it?
So what would you do?<eos> Look, if we can wake up the mom and ask what she wanted...<eos> We can't. She would need to be awake long enough to become competent.<eos> The kidney would not last until then.<eos> I know, but if we could, she'd say give it to her son.
You were not demoted.<eos> From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending?<eos> - It looks like that.<eos> - April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.
Wait.<eos> I'm sorry. You're the what?<eos> I'm the foundation's representative on the board, right, a position that you gave me, that you made me take.<eos> Yes, and you kicked and screamed and whined every step of the way.<eos> And then I took it on.
Jackson, stop it!<eos> Just stop it!<eos> You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery," but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.
Well, just not yet.<eos> When?<eos> Our surgery is tomorrow.<eos> After.<eos> I can just have the surgery and tell her then, and I can tell her that I had cancer and not that I have it.
I get why he's mad at you.<eos> That was way worse than what I did.<eos> How is that worse?<eos> You gave away his job.<eos> And you put your mouth on the person who took it.
I'm gonna give it everything that I never got.<eos> I'm gonna get it everything I couldn't give to my boys.<eos> I'll get it everything that you couldn't give to your first child died a-borning.<eos> My baby is not a means for you to right your past wrongs.<eos> This child, it will be good, it will be pure, and I will not be expose it to your darkness
The Rindells have 13.8 million on hand, and that's from an initial investment of eight billion.<eos> They never invested a cent?<eos> Not after 2008.<eos> The housing bubble.<eos> There was a shortfall, and they made it up with money from new investors.
No.<eos> - Okay, what is the crime?<eos> - An attack on the power grid.<eos> Cyber terrorism.<eos> And how does your client know about it?
Lawyer's been asked by the client not to say.<eos> And who's this lawyer?<eos> Why?<eos> Just trying to get as many facts as I can.<eos> Look, if we don't want to make the deal, let's not do it.
Well, it's, um, 555-0193.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> I need a pen. I just met the man I'm going to marry and I need to write down his number before I forget it.
I need a pen. I just met the man I'm going to marry and I need to write down his number before I forget it.<eos> But that's permanent marker.<eos> Hey! You're destroying my property!<eos> Oh, please, it's just a piece of an old canoe.<eos> You wrote my number on a restaurant canoe so you wouldn't forget it?
- We didn't...<eos> - No, I want to hear you say it.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - This wasn't us.<eos> You said keep it in your account, and borrow on it.
We're family.<eos> I don't know if she's lying or not.<eos> About the cancer?<eos> No, about the fund.<eos> Do you think your dad did it?
You can review them.<eos> Oh, that's not necessary.<eos> If you say they're fair, they're fair.<eos> Oh, okay. Um...<eos> I thought we'd have it at the Elk's lodge?
How did we not know about Cujo and Co.?<eos> Well, the Norteguayans must let the dogs roam around the perimeter freely.<eos> Veronica and Paige never saw them.<eos> And the barking isn't a problem?<eos> Noise from the printing press will cover it.
That won't cause enough movement to make it fall.<eos> Not an option-- the door's pressed against the ground.<eos> He's got no exit.<eos> Then we need to drill an escape hatch.<eos> No, the vibrations will shake it, it'll fall.
Let's get you seated.<eos> Ambulance is on its way.<eos> That's not environmentally friendly.<eos> The chemicals are in.<eos> Permeation rates in this type of geology, we're talking less than 30 minutes until they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
She got Lucca's office.<eos> I don't want to lose Lucca.<eos> She needs to feel needed.<eos> See, here's the problem with power.<eos> You got to take it from somebody to give it to somebody else.
The Genome labs acknowledgment that they transferred one egg to you.<eos> And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.<eos> Regrettably, here's the problem...<eos> You've already destroyed it?
And why do you want the ovum?<eos> She needs her egg back to fertilize it.<eos> Regrettably, here's the problem...<eos> You've already destroyed it?<eos> No, we've already fertilized it.
The, uh, problem, Laura, is... the last remaining ova has already been fertilized.<eos> - By who?<eos> - That's the question.<eos> We don't know.<eos> We located it at Chicago Poly-Tech, in the genetics lab, and we're bringing them to court.
So you just fucked us over.<eos> Under British law, the sale of these eggs is invalid.<eos> What difference does that make, Your Honor?<eos> You've already ruled on the ownership of the embryo.<eos> For the express purpose of taking it to England for this procedure, which they have now been forbidden from doing.
Here we go.<eos> Here's a news article about one of the Reddick/Boseman lawyers now.<eos> She just spent $350,000 on jewelry.<eos> Where did that money come from?<eos> Who gave it to her?
Basically, some people are just better at things than others.<eos> That's what coding makes you realize.<eos> The number seven is the number seven.<eos> If you call it the number eight, you don't actually make it the number eight, you just embarrass yourself.
If you call it the number eight, you don't actually make it the number eight, you just embarrass yourself.<eos> Likewise, men are better at invention than women.<eos> Just a fact.<eos> Now, this makes SJWs upset.<eos> They think there's something wrong with the fact and they want to change it.
And you're welcome anytime.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Both courts.<eos> We'll see which one finishes first.<eos> Putting something on top of the pile is a great way to get me to move it to the bottom.
What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?<eos> He said he would recommend to the judge a sentence of ten years instead of life without parole.<eos> No further questions.<eos> I had no idea of the plea deal.<eos> No, I did not authorize it.
And you're the new direction.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I'm taking my firm back.<eos> You've driven it to the ground, and in this day and age, we can't afford to let it drift.
You don't look fine.<eos> It's time for you to tag out.<eos> Wake up Snow and get some bloody sleep.<eos> I said I'm fine!<eos> And If I wanted advice, I doubt I'd take it from a pirate.
[Wendy] Knock, knock.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> Kimberly, Richard wants to marry me with his grandmother's wedding ring.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> No, his grandmother has it.
I think him and Ash set up some sort of shady side deal.<eos> He's the real criminal.<eos> But if Ash got this hefty divorce settlement, then why was he couch-surfing?<eos> Where'd the money go?<eos> Maybe the mediator took it?
What's this?<eos> Well, where do I start?<eos> Missing commemorative scissors.<eos> Looks like we found our fat knife.<eos> Or didn't find it, but, you know.
This.<eos> I didn't think this was possible.<eos> It wasn't part of the plan.<eos> So, maybe... maybe we make a new plan.<eos> This time, we make it together.
The point is, despite all of that, she went out of her way to help him.<eos> Yeah, she's right.<eos> The doctor has seen a side to me that I hide because it's, well, terrifying.<eos> But she accepted me nonetheless, and she's helped me through issues that I thought insurmountable.<eos> I appreciate the testimonial, and I will include it into the notes.
You think our two sweet, "legit" cleaners are up to something not so legit?<eos> Hello, Brother.<eos> I notice you've changed your look.<eos> Where's your pretty necklace?<eos> Oh, I've put it in a safe place.
Right.<eos> So that space just got snatched.<eos> While you were eating a sandwich?<eos> I can multitask.<eos> May I ask who snatched it?
Stop.<eos> It's true.<eos> Think about what you said about my paper.<eos> I didn't know you'd written it.<eos> You were the only person who read it, and you hated it.
- Time to go.<eos> - Hey, it's really good to see you.<eos> You, too, man.<eos> A big hug?<eos> We'll save it for after the flight, all right?
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry we stole your car, man.<eos> - No worries.<eos> We found it.
Seriously, how many more times do you think this woman's gonna keep letting me off the hook?<eos> And now what's happened?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> I've let her down.<eos> Again. So appreciate you just... just light the match and throw it on top.
I thought they were going to tell me to vote against the upcoming referendum. I...<eos> Okay, so if that's why she went to the cafe, then everything Matty told us, all the CIA intel, was wrong.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've seen the pictures, I want to believe you, but you need to go back and explain everything exactly how it happened.<eos> A waiter... gave me the phone, and there was a man on the phone, and he told me, get the purse from the planter box, carry it down the street, and then when I see someone follow me,

- I know how to clear our names.<eos> - Yeah, something like that.<eos> Back at the cafe, I was disguising the signals of our comms and wireless cameras as normal cell traffic routed through towers of a local Dutch telecom.<eos> Okay, now you're just using big words that nobody else understands, like he does.<eos> That video we lost... I was routing it through local cell towers.
I think they're here to steal something.<eos> What... what kind of building is this?<eos> _<eos> According to my sources, that building you're at is a front.<eos> The DoD calls it Facility H9.
It's protocol, all right?<eos> Just simmer down.<eos> Well, I'd like to know what it is.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I'm trying to remember what the protocol is, and if you stop with the questions, I might remember it.
- Okay?<eos> - I know.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> I thought I had O.R. 3 booked for my lap colectomy this afternoon.<eos> You did, but I have a valvuloplasty, and I wanted O.R. 3, so I took it.
Okay, look, you need to at least be hydrated, okay?<eos> Will you stay there?<eos> Let me just take care of this.<eos> - Did you get the proximal end?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it.
You... You taught me how...<eos> You taught me how to take my past and find my path.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think I found it.
Knew for weeks I wanted to hurt him.<eos> Then one day after practice... he smiled at me.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> I beat him up.<eos> Took his arm, put it behind his back, and broke it.
From the fridge to the trash.<eos> I am taking it on the chin today.<eos> There's even an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites.<eos> The trophy is a crystal palm tree.<eos> We'll attach it to a necklace so you can wear it - when relatives come over. - Mm-hmm.
Alright,<eos> - you shitting yourself?<eos> - No.<eos> Er, yeah.<eos> Dad wanted me to do it.
All of it.<eos> The wake.<eos> Porchetta Ariccia.<eos> The speciality of a small village just north of Roma.<eos> You take a suckling pig, gut and debone it.
The wake.<eos> Porchetta Ariccia.<eos> The speciality of a small village just north of Roma.<eos> You take a suckling pig, gut and debone it.<eos> Stuff it with garlic, rosemary and fennel, slow-roast it over a wood fire.
I never understood what made Gina truly happy.<eos> But the Penrose played a part in it.<eos> Well, she's got it all now.<eos> Maybe she's got what she deserves but will she get her just deserts?<eos> _ All this time and I owned it.
Frank, Frank.<eos> Hold up a second, man.<eos> Hey, look, uh... the guys from the motor pool are looking for you.<eos> They still can't find your car in the lot.<eos> Yeah, but they were supposed to check it off yesterday.
Hey, look, uh... the guys from the motor pool are looking for you.<eos> They still can't find your car in the lot.<eos> Yeah, but they were supposed to check it off yesterday.<eos> All right, I'm just telling you what I heard.<eos> Yeah, well, they're gonna have to wait, 'cause I... I left it at home.
But the baker's son will think twice about pushing me in the mud when he sees me carrying this.<eos> Oh, Bae, listen to yourself.<eos> Papa, I'm sorry I asked you to give up your power.<eos> I understand now why it's so hard.<eos> But we need it.
- Do we?<eos> - No, we do not have a pirate problem.<eos> Our port in the Gulf has a pirate problem.<eos> It's a loyalty issue.<eos> I suggest you attend to it personally.
You should be saving up like me.<eos> Saving up for what?<eos> I want to own a Dairy Queen franchise in South Florida.<eos> It's sunny every day there.<eos> I'm gonna go to my shop, have an ice cream, then I just eat it at the beach.
It's like Chewbacca mask lady meets bad lip reading.<eos> Something tells me you and I have vastly different definitions of "creepy."<eos> Come on.<eos> Check it.<eos> This guy I follow on picagram posted it an hour ago.
I think I know how it's spreading.<eos> My tinder date was telling me about this video that he watched, before he got sick.<eos> It was posted on some kid named Logan MacDonald's picagram feed.<eos> My guess is that somebody hacked his account and then embedded the pamphlet's curse into the video's source code.<eos> Meaning that whoever watches it could get infected by this fire flu that burned Washington.
Oh, my god.<eos> That's the suit I made.<eos> It's lined with vermiculite, see?<eos> That's the material stunt men use.<eos> I sewed it in myself.
That's cool.<eos> I don't know what you're supposed...<eos> Does this go around the...<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Nope, you squish it, and you actually stick it up your... and you are, uh... You're open for business.
Crane!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, I'm fine.<eos> Right. I shall guide you through the Banneker lock mechanism.<eos> Uh, it's okay, I think I got it.
- Damn straight.<eos> We're all in this together. For better or worse.<eos> Right on.<eos> We came into town to find this talisman.<eos> If Dreyfuss took it, and Crane, we could...
Think it's over?<eos> That's the last we'll hear from Dreyfuss?<eos> I'd like to believe it... but evil has a manner of raising its head in a way we least expect.<eos> But if it should...<eos> We shall face it together.
No, it is not.<eos> He's got a whole thing on this.<eos> Just continue.<eos> There's a whole world out there.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.
One had a gun.<eos> They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?"<eos> No one even noticed.<eos> What money?<eos> They said they gave Adam half a million dollars and they wanted it back.
A half million.<eos> Was that true?<eos> If it was, I never heard about it.<eos> But they didn't believe me.<eos> They just kept hitting me and yelling, did I have it, did Owlsly have it.
- Okay. I got it.<eos> I cut the feed.<eos> - Oh, it's a...<eos> It's a British tradition, sir.<eos> - Flight, I had radio contact for a second, then I lost it again.
- we'll be over Ray's launch position in 18 minutes.<eos> - We only get one chance at this intercept before the moon's gravity slingshots us back to earth.<eos> - Henry.<eos> You need to understand how time travel works.<eos> - My grandfather understands it just fine.
Rude!<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Yes, but you do it so well, and with such... style.
No, I don't want to do that.<eos> Dad was still paying off his medical school loans until I was in middle school.<eos> I'll be in debt for the rest of my life.<eos> I'm so sorry, sweetie.<eos> You know if we had the money we would give it to you.
I think you're right, and...<eos> but... also, you gotta own up to what you do though.<eos> Because at some point it can become who you are.<eos> If I'm honest, I've got a young daughter, very young, only two years old, but if she, when she is your age, decided to do this, I would be pretty upset as her father.<eos> I think the important thing is whether the person is doing it by choice.
Here's to sand in my shorts and umbrellas in my drinks!<eos> I will drink to that.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Easy.<eos> He smelled like a distillery, so I rolled his car, lit it up.
Malotru executed by the Daesh is a bargain for the Americans.<eos> The scandal is avoided.<eos> Your problem is fixed.<eos> And ours too.<eos> Once we release it, what do we do?
This is your file.<eos> Follow.<eos> What if Cochise were now... an official of high rank of the Islamic State... and would have reactivated the code to contact us?<eos> There are many charges of Islamic State... that come from the old party Baas of Saddam Hussein.<eos> And left us this to that we find it?
You will change the clothes for a niqab.<eos> Will bring another GPS in the panties.<eos> They may have a GPS detector.<eos> How do you know?<eos> We buy it from Al Qaeda, who knows it by the Saudis.
- Voucher.<eos> Marie Jeanne will go on the first car tracking.<eos> Can Rex send an SOS?<eos> Your phone will be micro.<eos> - They will confiscate it.
But we do not leave it.<eos> If not, there would be no one here.<eos> Pass.<eos> On the contrary, it will retract the bache as soon as possible.<eos> Before I chew it a lot.
- Yes.<eos> You quoted here because knew that I was.<eos> I think you've worked a little for her, without realizing it.<eos> Our meeting is no coincidence.<eos> - Why have they done it?
- Do you explain that?<eos> - We were both alone.<eos> But calm down, here I am.<eos> Come on, I invite you to brunch.<eos> You do not even pay for it.
So we took advantage of the encounter between Rex... and the niqab woman... to pass another coded needle scheme.<eos> It was like throwing a bottle to the sea.<eos> We think that...<eos> Cochise would watch the video of Malotru with the scheme... and I would understand that we want to resume contact with him.<eos> And now, forgive me for using the term because it seems silly... and I never use it, but... bingo!
Useful.<eos> And above all you will be perfect.<eos> The mold of your dentures.<eos> It's old, I've been changing my teeth since then.<eos> I will have them redo it.
- See you guys.<eos> - I'm just messing.<eos> You can't have my joy.<eos> Oh, hey. What's good?<eos> Hey, um, I found this extra charger at my house and I thought you might've left it during my party.
I want full surveillance on Jack Barker, 24/7.<eos> I don't recommend using conventional listening devices.<eos> He may sweep for those.<eos> I do have a colleague at Facebook that has a laser microphone.<eos> You can point it at an office window from a mile away and read the sound vibrations.
The trees off the land are used for shelter and fire.<eos> More than that.<eos> Is it love, Father?<eos> For the Lord's sake, can you not remain quiet?<eos> But, yes, the bastard has it, it can only be love.
- I'll overlook it this once.<eos> - Do you know what this is?<eos> If it's not crisps, you're sacked.<eos> Fluid link K57.<eos> Removed it from the TARDIS the other night after your lecture.
- Shh. No!<eos> What happened?<eos> I can't move.<eos> Your suit set to auto.<eos> The Doctor hacked it and walked you out.
When they've thieved everything on land, they'll rob the sea.<eos> If their enemies are rich, they'll take all they have.<eos> If their enemies are poor, they'll make slaves of them.<eos> Their work is robbery, slaughter, plunder.<eos> They do this work and they call it empire.
Oh, stop being brave.<eos> I can't bear brave people.<eos> I'll put the story in the stone.<eos> I'll put your name in the air.<eos> They'll see it for hundreds of years.
Margot: Yeah, the girls should have the bedroom ready by now.<eos> You are clear for approach.<eos> ♪ Congratulations on your citizenship.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hong Kong recognizes talent when they see it.
♪ Guido, nah ♪<eos> Kimberly, use your key!<eos> I'm Lemonading!<eos> You're not answering your phone.<eos> If you must know, I dropped it in a public pool while I was making track one.
You put me in a jam, man.<eos> You bring a guy in for his hand in the till, leaves beat up.<eos> Makes us all look bad.<eos> And you know about this place how?<eos> She mentioned it in the therapy tapes.
Looks like it's been placed.<eos> It's not old!<eos> It's like a brand-new shoe.<eos> Right... You haven't seen my keys, have you?<eos> I put it up on the wall anyway, see if anyone comes back for it.
- What shoe?<eos> That shoe from this morning, I told you it was outside the house.<eos> Well, what's it doing on the table?<eos> I thought I'd bring it in.<eos> And put it there?
And put it there?<eos> Well, you don't know where its been.<eos> It could be covered in dog shit.<eos> It's brand-new, that's the whole point.<eos> Well, if it's brand-new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.
Well, you don't know where its been.<eos> It could be covered in dog shit.<eos> It's brand-new, that's the whole point.<eos> Well, if it's brand-new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.<eos> All right, I just didn't want anyone stealing it.
It could be covered in dog shit.<eos> It's brand-new, that's the whole point.<eos> Well, if it's brand-new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.<eos> All right, I just didn't want anyone stealing it.<eos> What, so you stole it?
That's the whole point.<eos> We don't know what happened, do we?<eos> Could be an accident, someone's fallen over, the shoe's come off.<eos> Could be an older gentlemen with Alzheimer's, say.<eos> He's gone for a wander, doesn't know where he left it.
They've taken their dad's shoe out of the house.<eos> - Maybe penny for the Guy. - What, in March?<eos> - Right, so it's a bit of a mystery.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Do you want to see it?
I understand.<eos> Let me have a word with Laurence who does my PR.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally, somebody gets it!
Jacqueline, someone somewhere is missing a shoe and if I can bring that person and that shoe together, then I will have achieved that.<eos> All, right, David.<eos> Let's say this for a second, yeah.<eos> Say I'm the person that lost that shoe.<eos> Now I go back to look for it, but it's not there because you, you've got it in your house.
Thanks, but no, thanks.<eos> I'm happy the way I am.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You're just saying that to hide the real reason that you won't take a chance on love.<eos> You don't think you deserve it.
I'm moving on from double glazing.<eos> Into publishing, selling advertising space in magazines.<eos> No more slumming it for me as a door to door salesman.<eos> And when were you planning on telling me about this new job, then, Mr Advertising Executive?<eos> Right after they offer it to me.
He said he didn't see me before he swung, but my brother always was a sore loser.<eos> - Renee played shortstop.<eos> - Thing is, I was really close to my brother and my dad.<eos> I always sort of had to be one of the guys.<eos> I tried playing softball but hated it.
There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3.<eos> It would save you a lot of time.<eos> M-Maybe I could pitch that to my boss, if I knew what I was talking about.<eos> I can show you how it works.<eos> So, 10 minutes prep, and you pop it in the oven for 35 minutes.
We'd never do anything like that lightly.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Where did our name come from?<eos> Jennings.<eos> Um, well, before we got here, our people worked it out.
"Well, do you enjoy doing it?"<eos> Great.<eos> Good.<eos> Isn't it fun, yeah, just keep doing it.<eos> Just keep it doing, you know, and, um... if you don't enjoy it, please, you know, stop.
And she said, "No."<eos> Every time we go to see Cheryl Hirsham, we can't remember the code to get in.<eos> Is it 4-0-0-2?<eos> Wait, is it 2-0-0-4?<eos> I thought you wrote it down!
I left sick with anger at myself.<eos> I said, "Is that all I have for my father?"<eos> An unobtrusive tchotchke?"<eos> Maria!<eos> She hates it.
Fuck.<eos> Uh, defensiveness.<eos> I'm not into sailboats, I have nothing to do with sailboats!<eos> Stonewalling.<eos> And they gave us this magnet that looks like a piece of flooring, and you hand it to your partner when you're done speaking and you say, now you have the floor.
We can't tell her how bad her food is because that would destroy her.<eos> So when I found out Chef Dumont was coming to town, I signed us up for his class, so he could do it.<eos> - Whoa! - I know.<eos> Pretty intense, huh?<eos> Now I just grab the sensor and put it...
Needless to say, he did not.<eos> You don't come off in that story as well as you think you do.<eos> So, to avoid being thrice made a cuckold, he agreed to a deal?<eos> Well, not yet.<eos> Melcher actually signed off on it, but his fiancée wanted to certify that what we're trying to build complies with their data-handling and security protocols.
Hello. Well, good. Now that you're both here, we can dispense with the mindless chitchat.<eos> I'd like to be the first to offer you, both, the opportunity to take me off the market.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm saying that I very much respect what you're doing here, almost revere it, and I wanted to offer my services as an associate.<eos> And I will not phone it in.
The 36 HooliPhones that blew up at Hoolicon and the 17 that blew up around the US all had our code on them.<eos> Richard, these are real people with real crotches, and they're burning.<eos> We have to tell someone. This was our fault. No.<eos> No, no. Keenan's demo was built to run on a $10,000 rig.<eos> Jack ported it to a phone in four days.
- Once.<eos> It's always some new, unexpected... Except the first one that they used.<eos> - They went back and forth through that clock all summer, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Until their mother died and their uncle sold all their stuff.<eos> - Um, I think I saw it.
- Um, I think I saw it.<eos> At my Yale interview.<eos> It was the same one as the one on the cover.<eos> I mean, the guy died.<eos> They... they probably sold it off, but what if, um, what if the clock I saw was the clock?
You done, Stay-Puff?<eos> Sorry, I had a few setbacks.<eos> This isn't even the new system.<eos> You know, I tried that system and, it was bunk.<eos> Maybe you built it backwards.
Couldn't help him.<eos> But whatever I said, it didn't matter because he realized then that he couldn't have them and me.<eos> He had trapped himself in.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.
I tried to save him.<eos> I did.<eos> But there was so much blood.<eos> Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever that is.<eos> Yeah, there may be sin inside of you, and that's what you treat it, believe it.
Yes, hello, Alex.<eos> You, you didn't deliver on your side of the bargain.<eos> This cannot have been all you got.<eos> Um, I put the name in, and that's all that came up.<eos> Okay, well, did you spell it correctly?
I'm just... no.<eos> I'm just saying that herpes is permanent.<eos> It's way more binding than marriage.<eos> And if we had it we might still live together.<eos> You keep trying to sell me on the herpes thing, I'm gonna think you have it.
Saw him toss his make-up and that in the trash a week ago.<eos> His mother confide in you about his experimentation?<eos> I saw him buy an eye shadow kit.<eos> Sure wasn't for Maggie.<eos> Cost twenty bucks and he tossed it.
What if he can't live with it?<eos> I know I couldn't, not forever.<eos> Maybe it's not forever.<eos> I, um... I talked to Meghan and Robbie about the case.<eos> We went over it.
I, I guess it's possible he might have left himself a back door or something, but I-I doubt it.<eos> Would it be okay if I had an expert come and take a look at your code?<eos> Just to be sure?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll get I.T. in here to set it up.
You've picked, what, 20 locks?<eos> 23, counting breaking in here.<eos> When did you find the time to practice?<eos> My deal fell through.<eos> Actually, I called it off.
So you can take solace in that.<eos> I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.<eos> The paraffins alone would have killed you.<eos> I'll get you a different one.<eos> Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
Find the phone!<eos> Jay, I gave you<eos> - that phone at the bust.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And I bagged it.
- Yeah. Just Epp's phone...<eos> What about it?<eos> I just don't know how it's gone MIA.<eos> We went into the house... Yeah, you arrest Gerry, you take his phone.<eos> - Then I gave it to you.
Sorry.<eos> I know he's your partner, but...<eos> Ah, his heart's in the right place.<eos> You know what? The guy hasn't changed since high school.<eos> I go out for a pass, he throws it into the bleachers, and it's my fault.
From now on, you have to be honest with both of us.<eos> We should talk about this inside.<eos> Come here.<eos> I came to tell you that Noah raised the plane without the Road Demons' help, but they still want a new price.<eos> If they don't get it, they'll take their business somewhere else and Eli Voss loses his biggest customer.
Not that a judge is gonna care, 'cause if this case gets tossed,<eos> - the shit lands on all of us.<eos> - Especially me.<eos> I didn't lose the phone, Jay, OK?<eos> Somebody lost it for me.
Oh, I'd figured it was khazars guys who'd grab the briefcase.<eos> Realized whose money it was, and then sent this fool to give it back.<eos> Am I right? Hey.<eos> So where's the stone, pal?<eos> You got it in your mouth?
H-His name was Kip.<eos> Kip Tully.<eos> We weren't buddies or anything, but I know that he lived in the city, too.<eos> We would both take the train to Mount Pleasant.<eos> We would change into our costumes in the woods and then use it as a shortcut into town, just never on the same night.
Just in case this guy keeps causing trouble.<eos> You just spot something?<eos> It's a link to an online Photobucket.<eos> Schmitt's phone was never recovered.<eos> Presumably the killer took it along with his wallet.
It is a virus, but not one she's ever seen before.<eos> Well, now we've got its mug shot, someone's gonna know what it is.<eos> She thought it was very suspicious that it was both UV and chlorine-resistant.<eos> She cannot rule out that it was a natural mutation, but said that it was far more likely that our suspect was lab-engineered.<eos> So someone crafted it specifically to survive the city's gauntlet of water safeguards?
I always thought I had some kind of... god-level good luck.<eos> True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.<eos> I can teach you how to use it at will.<eos> Easy.<eos> And once you've mastered it, that's how you get Cowden's vote.
Art thou the bird who man loves best?<eos> The pious bird with the scarlet breast.<eos> Is that a "Yes, I returned Marvin's birdfeeder"<eos> or a "No, I didn't return Marvin's birdfeeder"?<eos> Yes, I returned it.
Isn't it a little racist?<eos> Racist?<eos> You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?
You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?<eos> Uh, I haven't had any African-American guests.<eos> So I'm the person with the darkest skin tone that's seen it, and I'm the most offended.
There can't be one brownout or blip during the duel.<eos> So straight-up, how do we guarantee that?<eos> - It's too...<eos> - What?<eos> Um... There is something, but we urge you not to do it.
They can.<eos> And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> The fairies want a baby?<eos> They aren't gonna eat it, are they?
Hello, Ravn.<eos> My condolences.<eos> - I did everything I could.<eos> - That's great. Everything within the law.<eos> Had I, for just one second, believed in Vilma's treatment, I would have considered it.
You ain't gonna tell Abby shit.<eos> You just got away with it, dude.<eos> You think every time I drive drunk I get home and I call the cops?<eos> No.<eos> I pull over, I pick up the mailbox I just knocked over, throw it in my trunk and I keep moving.
Gonna need some collateral.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Here are the keys to my house.<eos> You can take in the mail and feed the cat.<eos> What do you want me to feed it to?
Who told you that?<eos> Your little phone?<eos> As a matter of fact, yeah.<eos> It says there's an accident up ahead.<eos> If there was an accident, I'd know about it.
Look, your time with Colt will come and it'll be just as special.<eos> It was easier when I thought they weren't gonna keep the baby.<eos> That make me a terrible person?<eos> You're a wonderful person going through a... a tough time.<eos> But you're not gonna go through it alone.
Just to be clear... we stay off of each other's property, no matter what?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Good.<eos> You just got a check from Neumann's Hill yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to start a fire.
Beau, that is my cabin now.<eos> I have no obligation to tell you anything.<eos> We're divorced.<eos> By the way, nice haircut.<eos> Who did it?
Well, did you fix the pipe like you fixed the brakes on the truck?<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> - Brakes work fine, Dad.<eos> What doesn't work so good is your reflexes, your eyesight and that gate you plowed through.<eos> The fuckin' gate wouldn't have swung shut if you'd leveled it out.
What's his name?<eos> I don't know. Horse?<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> - Beau, did you make this?<eos> - Yeah, my father made it for me.
I don't know. Horse?<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> - Beau, did you make this?<eos> - Yeah, my father made it for me.<eos> I gave it to Rooster and Colt.
- Was it?<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means the second Colt and I get into an argument, you're sleeping with him without any protection.<eos> What, you think I wanted this?<eos> Well, if the condom doesn't fit, don't wear it.
"Patsy Cline came on the radio today, and I thought of you.<eos> "I know you've only been gone a few weeks, but it feels like forever.<eos> "I've taken to growing a mustache.<eos> I'm not sure it suits me.<eos> "I'll probably shave it off in a week.
Yes, Colt.<eos> That's exactly why.<eos> By the way, I hope we catch 328 fish today.<eos> The exact same number as your career interceptions.<eos> Maybe a fish will swallow your phone and we can catch it.
You're the first person who's ever noticed it.<eos> Well, most people are probably looking at the booze and I'm trying to look anywhere else.<eos> Doesn't look like something you picked up at the ampm.<eos> No.<eos> My grandmother gave it to me when I was a kid.
- She's six!<eos> - Jesus.<eos> So, I said, "Honey.<eos> Honey, look, there's Elsa from Frozen!"<eos> And she turned to look, and I grabbed her cell phone and I threw it overboard.
It's a system all my own.<eos> [del Toro] It becomes accessible to the man on the street, and that makes his product eminently American.<eos> Consumable, and yet of undeniable quality.<eos> [narrator] Capra wanted his next film to be about the American Revolution, with George Washington as its hero.<eos> But Harry Cohn, Capra's boss at Columbia, turned it down, and the reason was something Capra hadn't considered.
There had never been a situation where you could take Hollywood professionals and use them to help sell the war to the American people, and to help win the war by building morale.<eos> And so, they were really trying to figure out: "What should those movies be?"<eos> [Guillermo del Toro] The idea of propaganda filmmaking is to propagate, to disseminate ideas.<eos> Each of the five men that we're talking about goes at it differently.<eos> You have John Ford, who approaches it on a mythical, epic scale.

[Greengrass] Ford realized that, in a time of war, what the American public wanted was to understand and have unmediated their sense of reality of this conflict.<eos> And what that film had done was to try and create this kind of Hollywood semi-fictional mishmash, and it didn't play.<eos> And what Ford did was what he did with his scripts.<eos> Ford was famous for taking a script, you know, and just gutting it, filleting it, taking out the flam, the flim, and getting to the core of it, the essence of it.<eos> And that's what he did: cut it in half and made it truthful.
Such a tight little window.<eos> You did well today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But we're missing one bag.<eos> I gave it away so we could escape.
When her father was killed,<eos> Cortez, the conquistador, took her in as his own and gave her a land, a new religion, a new name.<eos> Who exactly do you think you're talking to?<eos> Do you think you are the only killer in this place?<eos> If you say my daughter's name again, I will carve it into your skull.
Happy birthday... mi'ja.<eos> I asked Pote to look at your car to see why it was overheating.<eos> See, if you're going to represent this business, you should be driving something more... reliable.<eos> Come.<eos> I purchased it for Isabela.
A lot of folks thought I was crazy, including your mother, but I saw something in it that I loved, that I wanted to build on... I was gonna give to you boys one day.<eos> I'm sorry that's not gonna happen now.<eos> What're you sayin', Daddy?<eos> Well, didn't your brother tell you?<eos> We're gonna sell this ol' place... just as soon as you fix it back up.
In 12 to 25 easy steps, You could become a tax-exempt place of worship.<eos> The church of aquaticism.<eos> Make up a religion?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, look, I'm not much of a lyin' brian myself, But if it means keeping this place open, then we'll do. What we got to do and take it to our graves, right?
Man, I don't envy you.<eos> Whichever one of them you bring to Fenway, the other two will be mad at you.<eos> I don't want to bring any of them.<eos> Those guys are all way better than me at baseball.<eos> They'd just show me up and ruin it for me.
Hey, Todd?<eos> Can I ask you a little favor?<eos> You know, I'm kind of busy at the moment.<eos> Well, I know. I was just hoping that you could go grab my accordion?<eos> I left it over in that elevator, and I'm having a whale of a time with the stairs.
Because I have to get my accordion out of the elevator.<eos> I guess you're not gonna do it, so I guess I'm gonna do it.<eos> No, I'll get it.<eos> Well, don't do me any favors.<eos> Look, I said I'll get it, I'll get it.
Well, you might think of it as a kind of alternative therapy.<eos> My clients use the service for any number of curative reasons.<eos> "Curative"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, sure, some people do it just for kicks.
Yeah, he mentioned that he was on parole.<eos> Man, Hayward.<eos> You won't happen to have his number handy, do you?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I just kind of drop it off when it needs fixing.
You're being silly now.<eos> Come on.<eos> I honestly think you're gonna dig this place.<eos> It's a family cabin.<eos> My dad built it in the 70's and...
W-Wasn't it destroyed?<eos> Well, he was a hatter.<eos> He had multiples.<eos> Inside are portals to every realm.<eos> I used it to escape Oz.
Just checking everything is as it should be.<eos> You know what they say...<eos> A mayor's work is never done.<eos> Madame Mayor... an honor.<eos> I brought you lunch, and a little job if you'll take it.
Remember to be strong and true.<eos> I will always love you. Mother."<eos> Gideon...<eos> I know it's not easy to talk about Belle.<eos> But this book... meant the world to her, and she really wanted you to have it.
It... it can't be.<eos> Well, I'm afraid it is.<eos> Your Story Book.<eos> Or what's left of it.<eos> No way. My mom would never burn it.
Let's go. Go!<eos> - You did it.<eos> - Kinda. That won't hold very long.<eos> It's okay. The Black Fairy's got his heart.<eos> Gold's gonna get it. Everything's gonna be fine.
I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.<eos> You think his heart's down here?<eos> I know my mother.<eos> This is where she'd hide it.<eos> - If I find it...
At least, we injured something out there.<eos> I needed the creature's body. Living, dead,<eos> I don't give a shit. Because until we collect every last supernatural entity that you let in the Triangle, I am stuck in this "living anus" of a town.<eos> Willa's the Earp who let the riffraff in.<eos> I was the one who bitchslapped the tentacle, slid back across the line, and sliced it like deli meat.

The massive amounts of vomit, the out-of-pocket expenses, just to name a few things.<eos> Hey, Dawson.<eos> You don't want Molly's involved in the Drunken Mile crawl, do you?<eos> Whatever you guys want.<eos> - Yeah, good, 'cause we're doing it.
- Okay?<eos> You did a lot of good last night.<eos> Took a big risk, and you drew fire for us.<eos> I did what was needed.<eos> If you were trying to earn your place on this team, I'm pretty sure you got it.
You haven't said much. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I know. I was just... I was trying to be less impetuous.<eos> Well, I'm a good soldier.<eos> I follow my orders.<eos> You needed time. I'm giving it to you.
You want to hear the story or not?<eos> Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> One day, my gas tank was on empty, but I still had to get to my job.<eos> So, I just ignored it and it kept going.
What is your ex-wife doing here?<eos> - I'm his emergency contact.<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> Don't be upset.<eos> I'm sure he just never got around to changing it.
I-I can't do this anymore.<eos> I need, I need to get out of here and get some space.<eos> I'm moving out of the loft.<eos> What?<eos> I couldn't find your trash bin, so I threw it away in the toilet.
Like that time I put a can of pasta in the microwave.<eos> Doc! She was a human being.<eos> Wait. Where did she get some goo?<eos> Come.<eos> OK, so I found this compound that shocks the nervous system, right? It makes the demon think it's in a dying body, and then it abandons it.
So we ask the Stone Witch.<eos> - Missing.<eos> - Juan Carlo?<eos> We are not strong enough yet.<eos> We'll find it.
- What?<eos> They are looking for something.<eos> Yeah, a seal.<eos> Old news.<eos> What happens when they break it?
Yeah!<eos> Great hunt, everybody.<eos> After you have a little candy, make sure you get a good night's sleep for a Beef Boom.<eos> Time to strap on the old feed basket.<eos> I'm not even tasting it, mm.
Landlords call them "fire starters."<eos> I-I'll try to remember to give you a heads up before my friend Arson Daly stops by.<eos> Uh, we're gonna find the egg.<eos> Yeah, uh, we're gonna find it.<eos> It's just hidden really well because I hid it.
- I-I probably hid it.<eos> - No.<eos> - I-I did.<eos> - No, me.<eos> So one of you hid it, but neither of you knows where it is?
- Five bucks.<eos> - Uh, no, thank you.<eos> Oh, crap, crap, crap.<eos> It's in the restaurant.<eos> We're not even smelling it anymore.
Pudding cups, she snatches them.<eos> From who?<eos> Me, in the alley.<eos> Why are you eating pudding in the alley?<eos> Where else am I gonna eat it, Bob?
Oh, God, this egg.<eos> Ugh!<eos> The smell.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I'll take it to the ocean.
Okay, so, can you tell us your little name?<eos> It appears we're dealing with a deaf.<eos> Or, like, a Nell.<eos> Okay, let me try.<eos> I'm gonna say some common names, and you just let me know if I guess it.
As soon as we get this giant space Rock off our scanners, we can pinpoint Captain Marvel's ID and get her and your crewmates back.<eos> On it.<eos> Looks like the asteroid's destabilizing.<eos> I can't risk shrinking it.<eos> Then we don't touch it until you and Tony run a thorough analysis.
Okay, Quill, so maybe your team's dysfunction isn't all your fault.<eos> I know, right?<eos> How was it ever my fault?<eos> (GRUNTS) Hulk, take care of the asteroid.<eos> You mean smash it?
I know, right?<eos> How was it ever my fault?<eos> (GRUNTS) Hulk, take care of the asteroid.<eos> You mean smash it?<eos> How's about we disconnect it first?
You check behind the counter.<eos> God, what are we dealing with here?<eos> I got another one!<eos> And a can of oven cleaner.<eos> If he sprayed the oven and didn't wipe it up, couldn't that cause cyanide poisoning?
We didn't know what we were dealing with, and Harris figured it out, sir... Chief.<eos> If they say it's true, it's true.<eos> I want an incident case report.<eos> - Yes, Chief.<eos> - You got it.
Right, well, either it caromed to your midsection, or it hitched a ride up through your venous system.<eos> Good.<eos> Grab a DPL.<eos> A Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage.<eos> We're gonna insert a needle in your abdomen, fill it with fluid, then drain it to see if there's any internal bleeding.
I'm scared to spend the last few years of my life alone, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> How long have you owned this car?<eos> About two months.<eos> Bought it used from some place out in Hillside.
- Are you sure?<eos> I've said it five times already!<eos> I'm sure!<eos> This place will get its money, okay?<eos> Hey, how long you had it?
I-I just... I can't...<eos> Look, we're getting nowhere with Eli, so tell me you found something on the missing kids or their foster mom.<eos> I wish I could, but it's like they just vanished into thin air.<eos> The music teacher... any idea why Eli was trying to find him?<eos> He's been vacationing in Rio, had no idea Eli was camping out at his place, and the men who took Amber's body from the morgue got it by using fraudulent transfer papers.
"Lug the Grub," "Unclog the Latrine." Aw, krutack!<eos> Those weren't games, were they?<eos> Quill, I hate to interrupt this stroll down memory lane, but we need to find the sarcophagus before it falls into the hands of the Believers.<eos> Right, Rocket?<eos> Hey, is it my fault Yondu stole it?
I believe I will break free.<eos> Quill!<eos> Eyes on the enemy!<eos> Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!
"If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I'll give you the keys to the car."<eos> I said, "Uh... set 'em up, nigga.<eos> And I blew in that thing.<eos> And it made a noise. "Beep!" I said, "Uh-oh."<eos> And he looked at it.
She empties out her purse.<eos> Two dimes and one nickel.<eos> She puts the dimes back in her purse, but places the nickel on a shelf beneath a bottle of rye.<eos> On the stove is a matchbox. One match left inside it.<eos> She puts the gloves inside the oven, then lights it.
Even if it's Mr. Brady?<eos> That's right.<eos> What if it's Mr. Mayer?<eos> He just messengered this over, says he'd like your thoughts on it.<eos> You know, there's no guarantee he'll read it in one sitting.
Do you think the Sally Sweet script is lousy?<eos> I really couldn't say, Mr. Brady.<eos> Haven't read that one yet.<eos> I did love The Wizard of Oz.<eos> Mr. Mayer sent it to Mr. Stahr.
Every foster's first night is like that.<eos> Well, I can still help.<eos> I've got experience.<eos> I could write a book about raising a teenage girl.<eos> What would you call it?
The rest of the unit, they helped rebuild; every day, after work, they pitched in.<eos> All right, guys like that don't do this!<eos> Christopher.<eos> Let's take this one step at a time.<eos> Okay, we know that Kelly had the fentanyl, and it looks like he loaded it onto a cargo ship.
The FBI just seized my equipment.<eos> The mission cannot be compromised.<eos> Well, it has been.<eos> I need my equipment.<eos> And now they have it.
- Her equipment may help us find Krilov. - How?<eos> The EEG machine he stole from her is state-of-the-art.<eos> It's designed to receive updates from a main server.<eos> So it's part of a wireless network.<eos> Which we can use to locate the machine, and Krilov, once he turns it on.
Werner was very impressive to me then.<eos> International weapons dealer, a smuggler, a jack of almost every illicit trade one might imagine.<eos> I wanted an alliance-- to become Werner's most trusted associate.<eos> Raymond crafted a plan based on an ancient principle.<eos> If you want your enemy to become your friend, create a problem for him, and then solve it.
I wasn't fighting for Skaikru today.<eos> I thought I was fighting for myself, but I now know that's not true, either.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it equally because we are equal.
Look, all right, don't explain it, just type it.<eos> Okay, typing, typing, typing.<eos> I have a Yakuza enforcer ready to kill you and bring me that truck for 10 million.<eos> So why don't I just kill you right... now?<eos> Because I've already ordered the hit, and unless I contact him and call it off, you're as good as dead.
- No.<eos> The satellite's initiated its preliminary firing sequence.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'll never hack it in time.
Take a left on 22nd.<eos> Jane, take MacArthur Boulevard.<eos> It's the only way you'll make it to the tunnel before impact.<eos> Copy.<eos> Look, it might be a long shot, but I'm sending an app to your phone now, I just reprogrammed it.
Do you copy?<eos> Can you move?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Then you're gonna have to keep looking for that beacon.<eos> If you don't find it within the next two minutes, that glider will pass fail-safe.
If you don't find it within the next two minutes, that glider will pass fail-safe.<eos> - I found it.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> - Destroy it!<eos> - Shepherd swallowed it.
- All they need is a name.<eos> - We got word that Dowd's throwing money around.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll delay the paperwork until end of shift.<eos> But then Area Central's taking it.
What happened?<eos> She didn't put the money in the bag fast enough, she reached for the alarm?<eos> I never ripped no banks.<eos> I'd never catch a federal charge and go away until I'm gray.<eos> You know, what I'm disappointed about is you and your boy snatch half a mil tax-free, and you drop it on tail?
What you did for Corey Jenkins, protecting him by denying his confession,<eos> I don't know many, if any, cops that would do that.<eos> You know, I got an officer on furlough.<eos> Could use another hand around here.<eos> I'm saying I got a spot open in Intelligence if you want it.
Black people, sex offenders.<eos> I gotta hand one thing to you, Craig.<eos> You are an equal opportunity hater.<eos> I've got a constitutional right to express my opinion.<eos> You know, I don't get it.
See, I'm very sensitive to extreme flavors.<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I am not drinking that.<eos> That's the cranky cold talking, and I will not have it.
Doyle's clear.<eos> You're clear.<eos> The whole thing's closed for good.<eos> Your job's waiting for you whenever you're ready.<eos> You really don't get it.
It's... it's been hectic.<eos> There's no need for apologies.<eos> I just wanted to get a look at you.<eos> Gabriela, I know you blame me for the divorce...<eos> Yeah, well, you're the one who wanted it.
No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm good. Um...<eos> Listen, I need to talk to you about next semester.<eos> Corporate said your phone interview went great.<eos> The job is yours if you want it.
So, Mr. Halstead, the results of your cardiac cath show that your heart has been under stress for so long from the mitral valve regurgitation... that it's basically giving up.<eos> This is why I told you to get it checked regularly.<eos> If we knew about the regurge, we could've gotten ahead of this.<eos> Yeah, so what?<eos> I'll fix it now.
Can you fix it?<eos> Like before?<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We need to operate, and quickly.<eos> If the other half comes loose, the clip could end up in your brain or somewhere else you definitely don't want it.
And you escalated things!<eos> You don't have a clue what you are dealing with.<eos> Is this some kind of game to you where you get to be the hero? Is that what it is?<eos> No, this is not a game.<eos> You made a mess, and I'm fixing it. Right.
Allison did just get her braces on.<eos> Dentists also sometimes use triazolam.<eos> After you pass, you'll immediately be taken into the OR where your organs and tissues will be recovered.<eos> When that happens, will it hurt? No.<eos> The bleeding in your brain will starve it of oxygen.
A native Hawaiian. Must be fate.<eos> You might be right.<eos> Ms. Goodwin wanted you to have your nail.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't need it. He ho'omaka hou 'ana.
[buzzing]<eos> [Eep] Hi, we're the Croods of Ahhh!<eos> Valley. Or at least we were, until my dad got fed up with the place and decided to vacate and shun it.
Unlike those amateurs from Langley.<eos> The government's cutting you off.<eos> They want their money back,<eos> - or what's left of it. - What?<eos> And they're throwing me off the task force if I don't get it.
They want their money back,<eos> - or what's left of it. - What?<eos> And they're throwing me off the task force if I don't get it.<eos> No, not now.<eos> Now's the time when we need it most.
Look what I found in the stable next to his carriage. Hmm?<eos> The devil does use a pitchfork, does he not?<eos> Yes, but so do the stable workers.<eos> Well, what about his hat?<eos> He never removes it.
No, that's the Boyle family sourdough starter.<eos> It's fed us for 140 years.<eos> The bread it births is succulent and firm... tang for days.<eos> I hate so many of the words you just used.<eos> Charles, if it's so great, why would she give it to me?
- Nothing,<eos> I just realized that I just love old, sour bread so much!<eos> - Come on, Gina.<eos> - Fine!<eos> I put it under my desk and my space heater burnt it to a crisp.
Ready?<eos> I'm sorry I freaked out and ran away.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just because you messed up the practice test doesn't mean you're gonna fail the real one.<eos> I didn't mess it up.
You even got back the bumper pool table no one ever uses.<eos> Wait a minute, you liars!<eos> What's that nice couch doing here?<eos> The old couch didn't make it.<eos> The second the sunlight hit it, it turned to dust.
Wow, now nobody's asking what happened?<eos> This is insane.<eos> Okay, I should be back in an hour.<eos> If my desk phone rings, just ignore it.<eos> - I don't answer it anyway.
Not unlike a fork you would use to flip a steak on a grill.<eos> It's a meat fork!<eos> Sam, explain the meat fork to them.<eos> Again, "meat fork" is fun, but under no circumstances should anyone say that in court.<eos> We have it if we need it.
The mortgage is paid off.<eos> You can give the place to whoever you want.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Actually, I do care.<eos> Don't give it to Hitchcock.
Proceed.<eos> The money that was deposited was routed through five banks.<eos> Now, I can't link it to Hawkins, but the original transfer came from this shell corp.<eos> - Huh. - Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I'll text the squad, see if anyone recognizes it.
All men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights!<eos> That is where America is!<eos> Love it or leave it!<eos> You better love it or you better leave it.<eos> You take this stick and you hit it, and candy flies out of it.
You think so?<eos> I know so.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> There you have it, a healthy baby.
You can't see the bride!<eos> My dress is in San Jose.<eos> I picked out something beautiful.<eos> Can't afford it.<eos> You'll wear it once, then return it.
Well, let's just leave him there till we figure out what to do.<eos> No, no, that's not an option, 'cause soon enough, the toxins will seep through the pinned veins and get to his heart anyway.<eos> I've seen folks pulled out of earthquake rubble after three days and they live.<eos> That's 'cause they're trapped in an air pocket or under something heavy that hasn't actually compressed their musculature.<eos> Scotty's forearm is building up these toxins, and when the pressure is big enough, molecular level diffusions will just push it through the crush point.
Boat on its way?<eos> Any minute now.<eos> The flare got up pretty high.<eos> Hey, did the flare...<eos> Walt got it up there, all right?
What, were you raised by women?<eos> Yes.<eos> Brad's more of an outdoorsy guy.<eos> This morning, we took a nature walk, picked up litter, and saw a fox.<eos> Well, Brad saw it.
What?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - He's got a lump.<eos> - So?<eos> Well, I don't think he had it before he got here.
When I'm gay, I want it to be on my terms.<eos> How can you just sit there and stuff your face with ice cream?<eos> I wanted a snack before I walk the Green Mile.<eos> Look, Adam offered to lend you the money.<eos> Why don't you just take it?
Me, neither.<eos> You know, in four years,<eos> Katie'll be off to college.<eos> And then, in 12 years, they'll all be gone.<eos> Well, maybe we can be one of those couples that gets a little dog and pushes it around in the stroller.
Nurse, aloe?<eos> Keep putting this on, three times a day, and no strenuous activity.<eos> Come on.<eos> I feel like I got to earn my keep.<eos> You earned it when you landed a plane that was running on a sports drink.
Ralph!<eos> Yeah, he's not here.<eos> Copper wire's missing.<eos> Oh, no. Oh, no.<eos> Ralph must've taken it to the spire.
You must really like this Hannah girl.<eos> Well, she's funny,<eos> - she's gorgeous...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> And like me, she understands mid-century design, but she's over it.
Snag me another Ring Pop.<eos> This one's down to the bone.<eos> Van, I want my office back.<eos> Emily, once a space opens up,<eos> I'll be happy to give it to you, but now, I'm in the middle of something... very important.
Well, credit the man for consistency.<eos> He was lazy and inept in all facets of his business.<eos> Still, C. Gibson's full name's got to be in here somewhere here, right?<eos> Yes, finally.<eos> You found it?
Tooth is a surname, as are Charcot and Marie.<eos> They're the doctors who first described the neurological disorder which is now more commonly known as CMT.<eos> CMT attacks the peripheral nervous system, arms, legs, hands and feet.<eos> It's degenerative and the symptoms get worse over time.<eos> Now, if Carter Gibson had it, it would explain the orthopedic braces and probably the medications he was taking.
And you think it's because the killer took it with him after he used it to bash two skulls in?<eos> He grabbed it there and started swinging?<eos> The blood evidence would indicate that.<eos> An arcing motion like this... would result in blood splatter like that.<eos> So, now we know how the mess was made, but who made it?
BOB: Um, uh, it's clearing up.<eos> Don't you all look absolutely amazing.<eos> I trust everyone's comfortable in your wardrobes?<eos> Uh, my uniform is itchy and it smells like mold.<eos> As it would have in 19-aught-one, when a servant of your stature would have worn it.
There were so many doors.<eos> Wow, you guys made good time.<eos> Where the hell'd you get that pocket watch?<eos> Oh, I-it's on loan from the estate.<eos> My character Oliver uses it, so, yeah.
Don't worry about it.<eos> Sam had a thing. I get it. Yeah.<eos> It was a bad thing. Mmhmm.<eos> He's sitting on the floor right now.<eos> So, I guess my hair did this, and he grabbed it, and I couldn't even move...
"That's a pekpek for you.<eos> You want it? There!<eos> It's for free!"<eos> "Pekpek" is "pussy."<eos> There's some people that got it, but then there's some, like, "Is she giving chickens away?"
You want it? There!<eos> It's for free!"<eos> "Pekpek" is "pussy."<eos> There's some people that got it, but then there's some, like, "Is she giving chickens away?"<eos> Every weekend, she has a chicken and she gives it away?
But it never made a fucking spout.<eos> So, you turned it to the back and started over.<eos> That side had too much glue.<eos> You couldn't even open that fucking side.<eos> So you just ripped it open in the middle.
Huh? My knife?<eos> Just hand it over.<eos> Fine. Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What do you want it for?
BOB: There she is, Gene.<eos> The planetarium.<eos> So this place was your only friend, huh?<eos> Basically.<eos> Hmm. Looks like they're renovating it.
Home!<eos> I mean, maybe.<eos> Uh, it's your birthday, so...<eos> Don't-don't worry about that.<eos> I-I won't enjoy the show if you're not enjoying it.
All right!<eos> - Thanks, T.<eos> - No sweat.<eos> - (rock music playing) - So, the laser show, it holds up, right?<eos> I mean, you've never seen it before, but could you sense it holding up?
- What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Talk louder.<eos> My hearing's kind of shot.<eos> (shouting): I said I loved it, Dad!
And always remember to breathe harder than others.<eos> Adios, much... (wheezing): ... chacho.<eos> She's got asthma, too.<eos> (coughing and crying) LOUISE: The town with no moms was gonna have to go by a different name.<eos> Because of one mom, who saved all the moms, they named it Momtown.
And we got the tools. Ha!<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, take that, alien.<eos> We'll need to be careful and brave, because this alien is super tough.<eos> It's got acid for blood, so it can hurt you even after you've killed it.
If somebody was like, "We have a guy here, he has the best dick.<eos> The best dick ever.<eos> His dick has been soaking in olive oil since he was five years old.<eos> We've been feeding him nothing but butter and penises his whole life.<eos> He has the best dick, and you can suck it right now."
Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.<eos> Bring it closer.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do, but bring it closer, please."<eos> I think, at that point, you put it in your mouth, right?<eos> If you're looking at the best dick ever, and you're not sure... you wanna suck it, just put it in your mouth.
At first, I was a little taken aback, 'cause I have to say that or he'll watch it anyway.<eos> It doesn't look like he's self-aware.<eos> It just got better.<eos> Take after take, he tried to hit a target.<eos> There is a target he tried to hit, and when he hits it, it's beautiful.
Missing persons, yeah.<eos> White female, 30s, brand-newly deceased.<eos> Your jerk-off partner's already back there.<eos> [sighs] Our what?<eos> Eyeglasses, dark hair, gray at the temples, mouth like somebody used a tomato capper to scoop out a pig's asshole and glued it under his nose?
Johann schmidt, aka the red skull, in my Nazi Kidnap-Slash-Rape fantasy.<eos> Right?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, tonight your brother is going to drop the ransom money at the Griffith observatory.<eos> Archer is going to retrieve it and bring it to me.
Huh? Oh. No, dummy.<eos> Those are just Jerry-rigged ways to fix a leaky radiator.<eos> Whaaat?<eos> Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.<eos> The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.
Whaaat?<eos> Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.<eos> The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.<eos> Same with an egg.<eos> Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole.
Believe me, I know.<eos> Well, that's not very Casper-y. Poovey!<eos> Aha!<eos> Where's the money?<eos> And the bag that contains it.
I guess bad news travels fast.<eos> It's my job to prevent it from traveling further.<eos> That trafficking route used to belong to the Russians, the FSB, to be clear, but last year Hugh Meachum, on behalf of the CIA, appropriated those routes, effectively taking over.<eos> The CIA's in the heroin business?<eos> They got very good at it during Vietnam.
Someone's gonna come looking for him.<eos> - Did you get his phone?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I pulled the SIM.<eos> Well, put it back.<eos> We need it.
Location doesn't seem off to you?<eos> Look, we get three cartel murders a month up here, mostly infighting.<eos> And it sucks when it happens to a good man, but, um, this case open and shut.<eos> Look, I'm real sorry, Bob Lee, but I'd be lying if I said investigating would do any good.<eos> All right, well, for argument's sake, if you were to look into it, where would be the first place you'd look?
His kill count is over 400.<eos> Intel ran dry around 2009.<eos> The Russians wanted him so bad that they gassed a whole village, killed hundreds, mostly civilians.<eos> And they never found his body.<eos> Well, if it's up to me, they're gonna find it here.
Drink?<eos> Uh, no, we just need to...<eos> Uh, Peter, how is your father?<eos> It's been so long since I have seen him here, in his rightful place.<eos> If you came to kiss the ring, I'm wearing it now.
It means no one knows what the members look like.<eos> Secrecy is their first priority.<eos> Donny.<eos> He took Solotov's ID and wrote that damn report.<eos> I told him to burn it.

You would have wrecked it anyway.<eos> You with me or what?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To a club in Dallas. The club's for you guys.<eos> The girl who's running it, though...
Okay. It's a full on fight, Gohan!<eos> Next on Dragon Ball Super<eos> "SEE THE WALL THAT MUST BE PASSED!<eos> GOKU VS GOHAN"<eos> Don't miss it!
That's why you're here, isn't it?<eos> For safe passage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Werner's death has cost me my travel routes in and out of the continent.<eos> And I'm sure whoever has my jet at the moment is trying to decide whether to keep it or at what astronomical price they'll sell it back to me.
W-Wait, you two know each other?<eos> Well, Donald was the public face of the manhunt for Raymond when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen.<eos> Everyone in my world knows Donald Ressler.<eos> We're here to make a deal with you.<eos> If there's a deal to make, I'll make it with Agent Ressler.
If the information you provide leads us to your brother, we're authorized to slice five years off your sentence.<eos> Deal.<eos> But before you interrupted me, I was gonna rat out the prick for nothing.<eos> He's got a place in Baltimore where he keeps his booty.<eos> Checks in on it regularly.
It's ringing.<eos> Why is your pocket buzzing?<eos> But that-that's Kate's phone.<eos> - Why do you have Kate's phone?<eos> - I-I guess I grabbed it by accident when I was over there this morning.
Excuse me?<eos> I don't know what you know about me, but I'm a fixer, Mr. Bull.<eos> Sometimes I make things happen, sometimes I make things go away.<eos> It's how I got to be managing partner of my own law firm with offices in three states.<eos> People have a problem, I fix it.
Punched that monster right in the jaw, on video.<eos> Might as well have hand-delivered him another victim to kill.<eos> I went out to the landfill. I-I had no idea what I was thinking. I was desperate.<eos> And then... I'm standing there, looking down at this naked girl's decaying skull.<eos> And that's when I saw it.

I thought, This is it.<eos> There is a God.<eos> We are gonna be able to put this animal away.â<eos> So I put on my glove, and... But God had other plans.<eos> I went back to the suspect's apartment and put it under his couch.

You're gonna steer clear of her, forever.<eos> Clear?<eos> I went to see Roy yesterday.<eos> Asked him about the report that got filed against me.<eos> He put Gorham up to it.
This is surveillance footage from Birchwood Grove.<eos> That's Roy.<eos> He really was outside the club when he said he was.<eos> An hour's drive away at the time of Chantal's assault.<eos> He didn't do it, and yet his DNA was at the scene.
Somebody killed him.<eos> At first, all the forensics lined up behind suicide.<eos> There was GSR on Roy's hand.<eos> There was no sign of a struggle.<eos> We thought maybe he did it 'cause of all the heat that was coming down on him.
We'd like that man's name.<eos> Why?<eos> You think he had something to do with this?<eos> It's a possibility we're exploring.<eos> Given the work you do here and the kind of clients you do it for, that man may have been hiding millions from his wife.
Ardy Gulbenkian.<eos> So you beat up Chantal Milner and you framed Roy, so that when you killed him, people would believe it was suicide.<eos> That's... amazing.<eos> And if I'm following, all you're really basing it on is that you've uncovered some clerical errors and found some money I touched.<eos> Which, for all you know, has my prints on it because Roy stole it from me.
IT'S MANKIND AND FREAKS.<eos> The toilet issue, for example...<eos> In my view, all toilets should be gender-free.<eos> They should be well-equipped, safe, comfortable and gender-free.<eos> When I visit ladies toilets, I try to leave it cleaner than I found it.
I wore a little dress that was absolutely slutty.<eos> A micro dress.<eos> Gold sequins.<eos> Buying that was something out of my deepest obsessions.<eos> I walked by the store and saw it on one of those horrible mannequins.
Robert.<eos> Robert Svane.<eos> Well...<eos> Robert.<eos> When you have a message from Wyatt Earp for me... you tell it to me in a private.
There's no time.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sooner than expected, damn her.<eos> She's looking for the third seal.<eos> I don't have it, nor do I know where it is.
- Made of silver.<eos> - Do I know you, friend?<eos> Oh, no. We're not friends.<eos> Now, you tie that ring to this thread.<eos> And once I have it, I will throw you down a rope.
- This isn't a game.<eos> Give it.<eos> They make sure I can't do that.<eos> And no, I don't have the combination.<eos> I would say hand it over, but you might not like what that means.
What's in the case?<eos> Seriously, Waverly.<eos> Poker face.<eos> Sing, little birdy.<eos> If you don't even know what's in it, why steal it?
It was a big blow to him.<eos> But he got in a car accident three years ago.<eos> He couldn't get a transfusion and died.<eos> His blood type is MkMk.<eos> It's a rare blood type and only about 20 people in Korea have it.
Spit it out, you son of a bitch!<eos> What's with you, sir?<eos> I'll gouge your eyes out!<eos> This was my car.<eos> But some fucker stole it and sold it here.
Do you work down here?<eos> I normally write in my studio upstairs. Though, I sometimes write down here, too.<eos> Wh-What are you imagining while looking at that piano!<eos> ? Nothing!<eos> I've already forgotten about it!
You know, Sagiri... I have a dream now, too.<eos> Dream?<eos> That's right, a really big dream!<eos> I'll turn this manuscript into a book.<eos> It's out of the question as is, so I'll rethink it, and write a project proposal. I'll have my editor approve it, too.
There's a chip in your hood.<eos> Here you are, girls.<eos> Tell you what, girls, going to make some vodka luge tonight, what do you say?<eos> What the hell is vodka luge?<eos> Well, you make ice out of vodka, and then you eat it.
No, really.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I've been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you're demanding off me now I couldn't pay you lot to look at for years.<eos> And what, you swan in here off the street with your Prada handbag telling me to hand it over like you were asking to check me gas meter?
No.<eos> I'm sorry, but no.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna let you jeopardize a case this big.<eos> And for the record, Mr. Wilcox already offered testimony regarding the murder of Ms. Zelaya.<eos> Duane Pryor did it.
No. I dare to try to make mine. And my family's safer.<eos> I saw the Widows destroy the second seal.<eos> It requires a devilry I'm not certain even you can muster.<eos> Well, you've seen me before coffee, right?<eos> And if you break it, and if Clootie rises, how do you propose to kill the mighty demon
- Come on!<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> Damn it, woman, I just told you to shoot me.<eos> Doc, listen to me!<eos> If I don't break the seal, the Widows will find it and they will kill you anyway.
- The demon Clootie.<eos> - Our baby.<eos> I mean, I need to do that on my own terms, but I promise I won't break the seal. Not until after.<eos> We... we need a plan.<eos> But when that plan is in place, I will break it... with you by my side.
- Oh, God!<eos> - What are you...?<eos> Idiot!<eos> - Oh! - What is that smell?<eos> We didn't trap it, we just inhaled it.
So, Mercedes attacked Nicole. Why?<eos> Widow Mercedes thought that Nicole had the third seal.<eos> Not possible.<eos> It's safe and sound, and it's the only thing keeping Clootie from resurrecting.<eos> The Widows won't find it.
I never broke.<eos> Never told her a thing.<eos> Why do you think I chose you to hold the ring?<eos> Yeah. It's safe and sound in my coffee cup at the station.<eos> You hid it where now?
- I know that you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I wanted to apologize for my part in that.<eos> I wanted you to know that it was never my intention to get you fired.<eos> - I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.<eos> - And what if I said I was?<eos> - I'd say I wouldn't take it.
She took it, instead of going to court.<eos> And I am telling you, she regretted that for the rest of her life.<eos> Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.<eos> - Then what will?<eos> - Doing everything you can to make sure no one else ever has to feel it too.
"I can deal with this."<eos> I decided that I was going to go over and find my yearbook in my mother's attic... and I'm going to put a face on this.<eos> And then I could put some closure to it.<eos> And so I pulled out the yearbook.<eos> And when I opened it up, I saw Magnus' face.
And those were the cases that we felt we could really do something with.<eos> We believed them, we had a credible case.<eos> This is what we call a red ball case. A red ball case is any case that's gonna cause national media attention.<eos> You have to work with the state's attorneys.<eos> So, we were taking it directly to... Sharon May's office. To Sharon May.
Maskell was... I guess the best word is elusive.<eos> Did you feel like Maskell was guilty of child sex abuse even if you couldn't prosecute him?<eos> I didn't disbelieve the victims, but I just didn't have enough to go forward.<eos> So... you know, maybe in the deep recesses of my mind, yeah.<eos> He did it, you know.
I looked at the clock in the foyer when he walked in and I said, "What are you doing home? It's only 9:30."<eos> And then I happened to notice right away that his white shirt was full of blood.<eos> I was like, "What happened?"<eos> Ed says, "Oh, nothing."<eos> He says, "My boss wouldn't give me my paycheck and I know how bad we need it."
She said was gonna go and buy this engagement present.<eos> When they searched the car, the present was not there and has never been found.<eos> The Christmas after Sister Cesnik disappeared,<eos> Ed gave me this necklace as part of a Christmas gift.<eos> And just kind of came up behind me and put it on my neck.
You're so ridiculous. How... "<eos> He didn't do that.<eos> After my brother's death, Abbie sent me my brother's interview.<eos> And I never knew until I listened to that interview that this subject plagued my brother.<eos> I never knew it.
He didn't do that.<eos> After my brother's death, Abbie sent me my brother's interview.<eos> And I never knew until I listened to that interview that this subject plagued my brother.<eos> I never knew it.<eos> We never, ever once discussed it.
We heard that in August of 1994,<eos> WJZ showed a retrospective clip... of newsman Jerry Turner, who got a phone call from a gentleman who said he had information about Cathy's murder and he knew who had her rosary.<eos> We were told that in this news clip, they actually played some audio of the phone call itself.<eos> We haven't been able to access it anywhere else, so, we're hoping it's on one of these tapes, but there's a good-sized box of tapes from August.
Bob and I had cleaned out her apartment, and I was absolutely no help because as soon as I started cleaning it out... we found all this stuff.<eos> I mean, there was boxes all over the apartment.<eos> I was trying to sort through everything.<eos> That's when I found the articles that my mother cut out.<eos> She saved it all, but she didn't tell me.
So, I think that's a dead end.<eos> Diane.<eos> Can you come here a minute?<eos> Can you find the file on this case?<eos> Did you find it?
People always tell us that the Baltimore County Police say that some of the details of Jane Doe's recount weren't possible or weren't true.<eos> So, I often wonder, when Jane Doe came forward in 1994 and said Father Maskell took her to see the body of Sister Cathy, if the Baltimore County Police, have always thought her story doesn't make sense.<eos> I really can't comment on, you know, the credibility of that witness... relative to another investigator.<eos> I never spoke to her. I never interviewed her.<eos> One of the details that she always said about Sister Cathy's body being found was that... she wiped maggots off of her face when she saw it, and what we've always heard is that that was always discredited
So, why would you have gotten her a green birthstone, which is August?<eos> I don't have the slightest idea.<eos> We know Sister Cathy was out buying a present for her sister.<eos> And that, a month later, you gave this necklace to your wife.<eos> Did you show it to Cathy's sister?
Yeah, and Cathy's sister is wondering whether that might be her necklace, uh, because she knows her sister was out buying her an engagement present that night, and as you see in that necklace, it has a wedding bell... it has a birthstone that is the same birthstone<eos> So, she thinks there might be some significance to that necklace, and she's wondering whether you might have gotten it from Sister Cathy that night.<eos> Means nothing to me.<eos> Did you encounter Sister Cathy that night?<eos> Now, if people think that that was the necklace that Sister Cathy bought the night she disappeared, and you gave it to your first wife, do you understand why people are suspicious because of that?
A pretty cheap stunt, trying to chase away all my customers on the busiest weekend of the year.<eos> Hello, Dwight Monkfish.<eos> I own the pier at Blowout Beach.<eos> It's the big wooden thing sticking out into the ocean.<eos> Perhaps, you've seen it?
- You've got no evidence.<eos> - That is just plain absurd.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Mrs. Holdout, I noticed when you checked us in, that you were left-handed.<eos> Mr. Holdout, you could remember the ridiculously long name of a long-dead parrot and every other detail about the pirates. But when it came to reciting a poem that might lead us to suspect you, you had conveniently forgotten it.
"She's obsessed with squirrels, and she's kind of gotten me into it, too."<eos> But you just keep going to that main joke.<eos> That's a throwaway joke.<eos> It makes it extra cool.<eos> Now I've ruined it 'cause I doubled back and, like, I'm, like, talking about it.
You're welcome.<eos> Like, the next time you wanna, like, be like, "Yay," for me or something, let's do this.<eos> You can go like this:<eos> Okay, the denouement.<eos> Did I say it right?
Which I like, because sometimes I'll think of two, three tweets.<eos> I don't wanna spoil you.<eos> I space them out.<eos> Many years ago now, the beginning of Twitter, practically, I scheduled a tweet.<eos> I scheduled it for 8:05 p.m. Pacific Time.
- Nothing.<eos> - Louis, what's going on? - Okay, look, Donna, I'm only gonna tell you this once.<eos> Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him.<eos> It's personal.<eos> He trusts me with it.
But we still don't know who was involved.<eos> I mean, the president, anyone.<eos> Anyone could be culpable or innocent.<eos> I can't believe Harris would be complicit in something this evil.<eos> If NASA launches the gravity tractor, then the Russians will blow it out of the sky.
Anyone could be culpable or innocent.<eos> I can't believe Harris would be complicit in something this evil.<eos> If NASA launches the gravity tractor, then the Russians will blow it out of the sky.<eos> Thinking we're trying to weaponize another asteroid.<eos> But if Tanz Industries were to launch it as a private entity with Russian oversight...
- You're a raccoon, exactly.<eos> And then all of a sudden, they stand up straight, that's weird, you know?<eos> They got those tails that look like tie-dyed Swiffers.<eos> And have Swiffers even been invented yet?<eos> You got those human hands that'll [pop] pop your eyeball out, eat it like a green grape.
Anything you guys want.<eos> Do you have any memorabilia from films, things you've taken that are special to you?<eos> - Would you name them now?<eos> I have my Three Amigos outfit.<eos> - Do you ever put it on?

Hey, what's up, everything?<eos> - Hey, space grandma.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Oh, good you got the craft services that I like.<eos> Watermelon that's been in the fridge for three weeks, so that when you eat it, it's like spicy.
- Be that as it may, as I see it, you have a chance to have one more friend or one less friend. I suggest you go with one more.<eos> - Donna. - Rachel.<eos> Can I get you two anything?<eos> Coffee, tea, a copy of your article in the "Sunday Times"?<eos> - Don't need it. Read it yesterday.
- Well, if he was in a fight, there has to be an incident report.<eos> - That may be, but you have no right to access it.<eos> We're a private corporation.<eos> That's privileged.<eos> - Okay, then how about you give me the names of the guards who saw it?
- I'm so sorry, Donna.<eos> - I'm sorry too, Rachel.<eos> - Harvey, it's late. - Whatever it is...<eos> - Did you pawn that thing off to the clinic?<eos> - You asked me to drop it, so I dropped it.
- Harvey, it's late. - Whatever it is...<eos> - Did you pawn that thing off to the clinic?<eos> - You asked me to drop it, so I dropped it.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You gave it to the clinic you're affiliated with.
I just want to make sure you don't have any conflicts with any of these.<eos> Maybe your client's grandmother shops at the supermarket across the street from number 12.<eos> - I'll take a look.<eos> - Good, 'cause just to be clear, if I'd known there was a conflict, I never would've taken the case.<eos> - I appreciate you dropping it.

This is good, isn't it?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Bite on that.<eos> Please, trust me.<eos> Found it!
I like it "very a lot."<eos> How have you been enjoying color?<eos> Oh, color!<eos> Color is incredible!<eos> At first, I couldn't make sense of it. But now... it astounds me!
She's got it all on record.<eos> - I thought she didn't pursue this case.<eos> - Then you didn't hear me right.<eos> She pursued it.<eos> She just didn't want to see it through.
And did you believe what he told you?<eos> Of course I believed him.<eos> He was beaten up, and he'd been in the infirmary for two goddamn weeks.<eos> Well, if you believed him, why the hell didn't you pursue the case?<eos> I did pursue it.
My name is Harvey Specter.<eos> It's come to my attention that you're filing a class-action lawsuit.<eos> We are. How can I help you?<eos> Our pro bono work means a lot to us.<eos> We take it very seriously, and I have a very difficult question to ask you.
- What is it?<eos> - I need to know if you're happy with the way your case is being handled, because if Mike Ross isn't doing everything he can<eos> - to help you... - Stop right there.<eos> Mr. Ross has dedicated himself to finding justice for my son.<eos> And not only that, when I was offered a settlement, he convinced me to turn it down and find out the real truth, so you tell whoever's in charge that I don't want anyone else working on this case other than Mike and Oliver.
Your Honor, this suit hinges on the testimony of a convicted felon, not to mention the entire class is made up of felons looking for a chance to stick it to the prisons that did their duty by incarcerating them.<eos> Your Honor, this case doesn't hinge on the word of Frank Gallo.<eos> It hinges on the word of a U.S. Attorney who had reason to suspect abuses were taking place at these supposedly upstanding prisons.<eos> Your Honor, that file is inadmissible.<eos> We weren't presented with it during discovery.
It's a test... of how much you can hit... without being hit.<eos> The brutality is inherent... to both its appeal and to its demise.<eos> Now, there was a time in America when everybody loved boxing.<eos> When fighters like Dempsey, Louis, Marciano, Ali and Tyson were kings of the world.<eos> So, for the American fighters who still believe in boxing, why do they do it, and what does it take to be champion?
And everybody would be so mad and upset, but he's like, "Cam F. Awesome.<eos> What do you expect?"<eos> People are like, "What is he doing?<eos> That's ugly. That... What?"<eos> They don't understand that kind of style, but the boxers he's fighting... they understand it.
Five without chili.<eos> We call it ají here.<eos> Well, same thing, right?<eos> We'll take the blow from here.<eos> We'll take it to Cuba... and then directly to Miami.
My memory isn't the problem.<eos> That drive requires a unique crystal lining to operate it.<eos> We extracted that crystal from a meteorite that Darius owns.<eos> And it's the only one of its kind on Earth.<eos> The most important oneofakind device in human history, and no one at Tanz Industries even thought to properly vet the man building it?
She doesn't have student loans and a mom who can't pay her own bills.<eos> This job would literally change my life.<eos> Yeah, it's a big deal.<eos> Can I tell you something that's probably gonna sound insane to you? Tell me.<eos> Before I moved here, I took a $100 bill, and I put it into an envelope.
Evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> As promised, here is the manuscript.<eos> Right on schedule.<eos> I will read it over carefully.
I heard more than 400 thousand copies have been sold.<eos> Really?<eos> Amazing!<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Lots of people are reading it.
Excuse me.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Let me express my sympathies.<eos> Let's see, this... was found on the victim's body.<eos> You can have it back.
It didn't cost me much, but it ruined my plan.<eos> Your plan?<eos> It was Midori Suzumura who was supposed to die.<eos> If an orphan high-school girl had died in that fire, society would have enjoyed it more.<eos> They would have eaten it up.
It took me some time, but I got there.<eos> And the distance and the money and Sam, we'll figure it out.<eos> Oh, that reminds me.<eos> We have the Clayton tour, so I won't be in school to give you your lunch money.<eos> But Evan's sister Beth will hold onto it and find you during fifth period.
Really adds some shine.<eos> Nothing adds that much shine.<eos> A diamond?<eos> A really big diamond.<eos> But how come we can't see it?
How's stuff with you?<eos> How's Doug?<eos> Oh, we had a date night.<eos> Which was a total disaster.<eos> Mm-hmm. Every time we have a moment, I ruin it.
Don't.<eos> - I need your permission if I'm gonna jump.<eos> - Just get the hell out of here.<eos> - Not until I get your permission.<eos> - Fine, you got it.
- Not until I get your permission.<eos> - Fine, you got it.<eos> Give me my breakfast.<eos> - I'd like it in writing.<eos> - I'll tattoo it on your face if you like.
What's with the fluff?<eos> You having a crisis of confidence?<eos> - Fluff?<eos> This is a mustache.<eos> - Is that what you call it? Yeah.
Bathroom time.<eos> This is the common area.<eos> Good for R R.<eos> As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.<eos> The aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.
What I just put in you is called pancuronium bromide.<eos> It's a paralyzing agent.<eos> It stings a little.<eos> Don't worry, it's safe.<eos> I tested it on myself.
For now, yes.<eos> Not forever?<eos> We're not prophets.<eos> When are you gonna start telling me what we are?<eos> While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers... we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.
You think of Indians, or Germans, or any other path to glory that you can find.<eos> Jack, stop it! That's enough!<eos> Mother, I will not stop.<eos> You have returned a failure.<eos> The papers are full of it.
Get up, all of you. Right now!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Theft is a very serious crime, lad.<eos> Mr Turner was very angry last night when he reported it.
And you abandoned that baby before it even learned to fly!<eos> Okay, well, books can't fly. And neither can babies, so...<eos> You don't know.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> If I had a human baby that could fly, I wouldn't be telling the press about it.
Welcome back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Okay, we should probably get this equipment out of here.<eos> - They're gonna want it back.
It's four!<eos> - Abby, Abby...<eos> We all believe in the scientific method.<eos> I've dedicated my life to it.<eos> And we have actually done it.
I'm quite well.<eos> That's good.<eos> You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.
You're Alan Larsson, right?<eos> Yeah. Have we met?<eos> No, I've seen your picture on the back of your book.<eos> Your memoir.<eos> I studied it in college in northwestern.
Long-Term Relationship Pussy.<eos> You really need to get that taken care of.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I barely have any hair.<eos> It's like you dropped your hairbrush and your vagina caught it.
Ooh, golly gee.<eos> Oh, a noise?<eos> A high-pitched, kind of... bunny-in-a-bear-trap sound.<eos> You'll know it when it comes.<eos> 'Cause you're the one who will be making it.
You tell Jeff to meet me at his father's development.<eos> We'll go in the big pool.<eos> And I'm gonna go in naked so he doesn't have to worry about me having a gun.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna bite the motherfucker's cock off<eos> - and I'm gonna spit it in his wife's mouth.
You know, Bob, I think I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.<eos> But there's a little problem I need you to fix first.<eos> Alcaino says Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen, which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.<eos> And he doesn't give a rat's ass that our government did it.<eos> He wants his money and it's not gonna be over until he gets it.
It'll be all right.<eos> - You okay, sweetheart?<eos> - Let's go get a Band-Aid.<eos> These people are fucking nuts.<eos> I know I sound like a broken record, but I fucking heard it and I've seen it.
You have a purpose.<eos> You're always happy.<eos> How's your book coming along?<eos> I've never written about me before.<eos> I think it's some of the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Hurry!<eos> Jim!<eos> Control computer restored.<eos> Venting reactor.<eos> But we fixed it!
Very clever, Holly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?<eos> I got it in the hallway.
Rewind.<eos> Stop.<eos> What's he taking from the table?<eos> A jar of red caviar.<eos> He took it from the shelf in the front store.
Have you ever eaten fat-free cheese?<eos> -What kind of cheese?<eos> -Fat-free! Hands!<eos> -What kind of cheese is that?<eos> -You'll try it.
A concierge.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> To my dear sister, from Sasha<eos> She was choked with a leather belt.<eos> If we find it, I'll be able to describe the murderer.
Alone?<eos> With Konstantin Sergeyevich.<eos> What, is it illegal?<eos> Konstantin Sergeyevich is suspected of Novikova's murder, committed last night.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to change your testimony until I started writing it down?
Please, believe me.<eos> I'm listening to you.<eos> I forgot this token at Alyona's place.<eos> That evening when she was killed.<eos> I remembered it on the way home.
Call immediately.<eos> If it wasn't Boris but some dishrag instead, the girls might have managed it.<eos> But instead of paying, Boris probably tortured Liza and she told him everything.<eos> What about Sergey's token?<eos> Boris probably took it from Alyona's apartment and planted it on Liza's body.
Wow, you've got money now?<eos> You don't even work anywhere.<eos> It's not late yet to wash your plate.<eos> You need it washed, you wash it.<eos> As for the money, mommy, I'll take it from my dear and loved daddy.
Maybe you mixed something up or didn't listen to me well enough.<eos> We agreed that...<eos> We agreed that it would be a table by the window.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> There was a mistake, we'll fix it now.
X-rays and clinical record also disappeared.<eos> As if there hadn't been such patient in our facility.<eos> I've read this in the report, you tell me something I don't know.<eos> When we were X-raying her spinal cord, we found an external object in her stomach.<eos> We conducted a gastroscopy and extracted it from there.
But soon, it was recalled and prohibited for use.<eos> Why?<eos> Even in case of insignificant overdose, the preparation caused seizures, psychomotor agitation, and muscle convulsions.<eos> Now, it is synthesized only in surreptitious laboratories.<eos> Drug dealers call it the "angel dust".
- Hey, hey, cheers.<eos> Uh, I think we're ready for the check.<eos> No, really, it's the smart way to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- You're too late.<eos> I'm already drunk and horny.<eos> - Oh, sorry, I forgot to get turned on.<eos> I had to finish up that paperwork you blew off.<eos> - I didn't blow it off.
Now you've been loyal, Ray, damn loyal, but on this matter I am gonna require a level of loyalty that you may find somewhat uncomfortable.<eos> Are you prepared for that?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> - Now this girl, do you know how she came to be in possession of our product?<eos> I do not think she bought it.
But I am not gonna allow that misstep to ruin his life.<eos> That boy has got a bright light of a future ahead of him and not even the God damn federal government is gonna dim that light.<eos> Now you pick up that gun and you do what you're told.<eos> Don't forget your money.<eos> You earned it.
Well.<eos> I hope you enjoy our little slice of heaven as much as we do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll be fine, just... just kids.<eos> Ah, I have a first aid kit in the car, will grab it. Thanks.
It's too traumatic. I don't want to talk about that.<eos> We like traumatic stories.<eos> I mean, not about me, but in general.<eos> Plus trauma bonds people so you can totally talk to us about it.<eos> Trauma bonds people who experience it not the people that you tell the story...
Like that...<eos> Like the Grim Reaper.<eos> I figure I'm gonna die up in these mountains anyway so...<eos> I don't know... just a nickname.<eos> I didn't beg it.
Check it.<eos> Oh, suck my motherfucking balls!<eos> No thanks.<eos> How am I supposed to work with this inferior goddamn equipment?<eos> Is that what the ladies are calling it now?
I just gotta get something out of the--i gotta get-- oh, god damn man, can't you see I'm busy back here?<eos> Oh, shit, that's a lot of woman.<eos> Yeah, what you want that's so important you got to crash my love den?<eos> You're going to give that man a heart attack.<eos> Tell it again, I don't get it.
We'regonnafuck yourpussyhole.<eos> We'regonnafuckthattiny littlebrownhole.<eos> Andwe'regonnafuck youreyeholetoo .<eos> What's that sound?<eos> Do you hear it?
Let me read you some numbers tell me what's coming up on your screen.<eos> For rate of genetic mapping I have 3021 atoms per microsecond.<eos> That's what I got.<eos> You're running a diagnostic?<eos> Already doing it.
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.<eos> Her perfume?<eos> Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.<eos> How so?<eos> Because I recognised it and you did not.
I'm sorry?<eos> Not "he", "she".<eos> Yes, yes of course.<eos> Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.<eos> I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it.
My dear, you've gone quite pale.<eos> It's nothing!<eos> - Eustace...<eos> - 'Did you keep the envelope? '<eos> My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.<eos> I glimpsed it once.<eos> I believe it is of Irene Adler.<eos> You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep<eos> - and looked at it.
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!<eos> - No, it can't.<eos> 'It's called Pepper's Ghost.<eos> 'A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.<eos> 'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'
Dear Jesus, thank you for this beautiful dinner that you got for us.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Can, um, JD possibly use your car on Friday... or what time are you guys going away?<eos> Just, he just needs it in the morning, but we've both got to go out.
-No.<eos> The hospital hasn't released a statement yet.<eos> - I need to speak to the person in charge, please.<eos> Dr. Lynn do you have the medical report?<eos> -I'm getting it now.
-Did he make it?<eos> - Phil!<eos> - Alan!<eos> - I got off the record confirmation that he's dead. - Alan. Thank god!<eos> Arledge decided to run with your lead and Cosell flashed it on Monday night football.
This animal appeared in my dream standing on a river bank as if waiting for me!<eos> O Priest, what does it mean?<eos> This Unicorn..<eos> How did this seal come into your possession?<eos> My uncle gave it to me for my protection.
Turn it into holiday apartments.<eos> To be fair, they don't want to, but they're broke, too.<eos> How much do they want, if you don't mind me asking?<eos> That's the crazy thing.<eos> They're prepared to let dad buy it for 300 grand to keep it as a pub, but he's got three other pubs with the same problem.
Oh, dear, god.<eos> A witty title.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I meant that sarcastically.<eos> All right, I'll read it.
Oh, silly me.<eos> Darren, 1 think you might need to readjust my microphone.<eos> Mr. rose, I read your protege's effort and I think it might just be worth taking on.<eos> Mind you, there's something odd about it.<eos> - Can't quite put my finger on it, but I've given it to Mr. Bonar to peruse.
- Mum, what's a "lurid fantasy"?<eos> You're too young to understand.<eos> And so are you, young lady.<eos> I want to read auntie Zoe's book.<eos> - Where have you hidden it?
So she bloody well should be.<eos> Do you know what...<eos> What the new deal was?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> What you didn't know is that she never signed it.
She will bring good fortune to our home.<eos> Pop it there.<eos> By God, a little female eaglet!<eos> So you took it all by yourself?<eos> Yup, I went and got it.
"'I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid "'to trust her so far alone.'<eos> "I remember but little of the journey.<eos> "I only know that the day seemed to me of preternatural length<eos> "and that we appeared to travel "over hundreds of miles."<eos> I think we did it all.
They really can. You want the arm?<eos> You can have it. It's yours.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want it.
You know you want it.<eos> Who doesn't want an arm that can throw a fast ball?<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Are you sure you don't want it?
Who doesn't want an arm that can throw a fast ball?<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Are you sure you don't want it?<eos> - Oh, I'm sure I don't want it.
- What?<eos> Anyway, how's your essay coming along?<eos> Aunt Alexandra in the shaping of scout's...<eos> Maggie: Actually, I can read it myself.<eos> So, who wrote it?
Thought you said next week.<eos> I dropped them buds off about five weeks ago, don't you reckon?<eos> Man: Yeah, fucking reckon.<eos> Yeah... yeah I'll get it.<eos> Just don't have it at the moment.
Yeah, you lost a lot of blood.<eos> Where's your bandage?<eos> Oh, it was annoying.<eos> What?<eos> So I took it off.
He will be with you for a long, long time.<eos> He wasn't dying.<eos> He wasn't, that's a lie.<eos> You're full of shit.<eos> After he gets his first taste of blood, he will want it all the time.
But if we can knock out the signal, we can take down a whole sector.<eos> - Where are the signals coming from?<eos> - Control stations.<eos> A system of servers and satellite communications equipment.<eos> So why don't we strap it with a block of C-4 and blow it clear out of the sky?
And what if it doesn't have it?<eos> Very unlikely.<eos> The file has over 750 trillion characters.<eos> And it runs 16 million attempts per second.<eos> Trust me. It'll find it.
Right?<eos> She's hot, and she's Asian!<eos> Michael, will you shut up?<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Look, tell that fuckin' Armenian I got his money, and I'm sending it now.
Kieran was inside.<eos> It's a small place. No summer school, no guards.<eos> And someone shut him in his locker, way up by the woodshop on the second floor, where no one would come till Fall.<eos> Whoever did it never admitted it and never got caught.<eos> I wonder if they still call it "The Coffin Locker."
Josefina, please!<eos> Sir, we're closed. You have to go.<eos> Come.<eos> His toy was stepped on, and he's not sleepy yet.<eos> But he will fix it, see?
- She didn't make the Mickey emblem.<eos> - She bought it.<eos> - Bought it?<eos> Did she make the Mickey emblem?<eos> Did she go to a metal shop and make it?
Last weekend.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll tell you.<eos> All right, read it to me.<eos> "Dear Emily, I took off the necklace "you gave me and put it away.
He's gonna have to fall and fail.<eos> You know, we're not afraid of that as we used to be.<eos> I think he'll be okay.<eos> The future?<eos> I'm still searching for it.
Move!<eos> We cannot have this.<eos> I want you to go out there and find our new friend and bring him back to me alive.<eos> I want to peel the skin off his body in front of his woman and I want to hear him scream!<eos> And I'm gonna cut his fucking heart out and feed it to the one who brings it to me.
Your little fire stunt costs us four month's work.<eos> What, you didn't have fire insurance?<eos> I should've put the arrow in your eye.<eos> So, let me guess.<eos> You make your product and sell it through these two nimrods... - ...and your friend over there.
Shredder's the most notorious criminal this city has ever seen.<eos> And we had him!<eos> Now he's out there.<eos> And where did you recover this highly secured vehicle?<eos> Found it under the G.W. Bridge, abandoned and stripped.
Sorry we're late, April.<eos> You want to walk me through what's going on here?<eos> Okay, so I went to go see Baxter, but then Shredder was there.<eos> And then he was talking about opening up some sort of portal to another dimension, and then he...<eos> He took this purple ooze and he injected it into those two criminals that escaped with him.
Listen.<eos> You guys secure the portal device.<eos> I'll deal with those two.<eos> "Secure the portal device"? What does that even mean?<eos> It means kick the butt of anyone that's guarding it, wait for Donnie's go signal, and shut it down.
But I had a good reason I couldn't tell you the truth.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Do you know what a margin call is?<eos> Of course I know what a margin call is.<eos> Okay, well, I'm in the hole a lot of money, and I don't get it back, I'm done, I'm finished.
Well, guess what?<eos> Now it's double.<eos> And I want $25,000, and I want it right now.<eos> - How am I gonna get 25...<eos> - I know you've got some get out of town cash, and I want it right now, Greg.
I like negotiating.<eos> I love a challenge.<eos> Turning a no into a yes.<eos> But I really do like money.<eos> I like knowing that I have it.
Dude come running up on me.<eos> I had to fight for my life.<eos> Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old and on an oxygen tank.<eos> Did you bring the knife with you? No.<eos> Got it from his kitchen.
What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.<eos> Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window?<eos> I know guys put it out in their mouth.
What's your experience?<eos> Remind me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look... when he walked into this courtroom on day one, he was wearing the cloak of presumed innocence.<eos> He's still wearing it, and will continue to unless he testifies, then he takes it off.
You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind to dial three numbers on your phone?<eos> The prophet Muhammad has this to say about that.<eos> "Hurry with all the strength of your legs to the one who needs help."<eos> Is that what you did for Andrea?<eos> Here's the deal, Mr. Khan, and you know it.
He was that night, and to this day, the only suspect the police considered.<eos> Because...<eos> Because he was and is the only killer of this beautiful, young woman.<eos> This is not a penknife or a grapefruit knife.<eos> This knife is designed to cut through meat, and that's what Mr. Khan used it for, cutting through tendons, muscle, bone, and a heart, 22 times.
People think that he ain't crazy.<eos> No, he crazy for real.<eos> I seen him backstage.<eos> He wasn't smoking the blunt.<eos> He was just eating it.
No, no, no.<eos> And because of that, he never really learned to handle adversity in an adult way.<eos> How many people here bought my new album CONNquest?<eos> All y'all are liars!<eos> I know you didn't buy it!
I'm never gonna leave this stage!<eos> I'm gonna die up here!<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Owen, get your gear.<eos> Got it.
I was never there.<eos> Now, I remember.<eos> I remember now what happened!<eos> I bailed and you wrote the whole verse.<eos> You wrote it, and I never gave you credit 'cause guess why?
What?<eos> !<eos> Sargent mims was the first detective on the scene.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> They tagged and bagged it before he got here.
SUV peels out, cop cars show up, i wrote it down,<eos> I mean, if you guys aren't interested, it's cool.<eos> Oh, no, no, we're interested.<eos> We'd love to see the plate number.<eos> I wrote it down.
I don't remember all the details, but... I do recall finding Mrs. Graham crying out in the tool shed.<eos> There were a lot of broken things lying about, and I think she said your father had lost his temper and smashed everything up.<eos> My father smashed...<eos> Yes, but that wasn't the reason why she was crying, I'm certain of that.<eos> My father definitely had a temper, but he kept it tightly under wraps.
King Henry's crown?<eos> If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face, Until thy head be circled with the same.<eos> Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.<eos> What, is't too short?<eos> I'll lengthen it with mine. And, having both together heaved it up, We'll both together lift our heads to heaven.
Ay, Margaret, my heart is drown'd with grief.<eos> Uncle Humphrey!<eos> In thy face I see The map of honour, truth and loyalty.<eos> Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong,<eos> And as the butcher takes away the calf And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strains, Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse,
You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And who slew your father, youthful Clifford.<eos> Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief.<eos> Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.<eos> Will we show you our title to the crown?<eos> If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
Oh, thou dost infect my eyes.<eos> Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.<eos> If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, Teach not thy mouth such scorn, For it was made for kissing, lady, not for such contempt.<eos> Lo, here, I lend thee this sharp-pointed blade<eos> Which if thou choose to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked until the deadly stroke.
Henry the Sixth did prophesy that Richmond should be King, when Richmond was a little peevish boy.<eos> A King, perhaps, perhaps.<eos> My lord, your promise for the earldom.<eos> Richmond!<eos> When I was last at Exeter, The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle, And call'd it Rougemont:
What happened?<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Found what?<eos> - The wolf.<eos> - Where'd you see it?
- Should have left it alone.<eos> Come on!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> We're gonna be gone soon, and... you know...<eos> - birds will eat it in the morning.
I'm gonna need you to be brave, okay?<eos> I need you to be brave.<eos> I need you to be braver... than you've ever been.<eos> I can distract it.<eos> I can use the fire, I can use it.
The comms on the Donnager were jammed during the attack.<eos> The only Martians who'd believe us are dead.<eos> So, let's just burn hard to Ceres and we'll take our chances.<eos> No port is going to let us dock with our transponder off.<eos> And the minute we turn it on, every Martian ship in the system will know it.
You feeling confident?<eos> Come on, let's let them do their thing and we'll go get a drink in the crew lounge.<eos> You sure?<eos> I could use a drink.<eos> We'll charge it to Fred's tab.
- Who said that you could talk?<eos> - I did.<eos> Just keep at it.<eos> That's not gonna help, either.<eos> You kill the power to the magnetic seal, the backup in that locker is gonna kick in and keep it shut.
We're about to have company.<eos> I will take you down, before I let you take them down.<eos> You got a clean shot.<eos> Back of the head.<eos> Take it if you need it.
Get him under control.<eos> You're the only one who can.<eos> Some things in life are worth waiting for.<eos> It's like gettin' another stone tablet.<eos> Look, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, but we came through it okay.
A plausible story about reactor malfunctions and an urgent need for temporary dock.<eos> We don't think they bought it.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> We'll be on their doorstep in three days and that's not enough time for Fred Johnson to dismantle and hide an entire stealth tech program, is it?<eos> Yeah, that's assuming that they had it in the first place.
Yeah, yeah, I used to spout off all kinds of bullshit back in the day.<eos> Like how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<eos> Look, when I got kicked off the force, I gave you that hat so you'd keep your head, not make the same mistakes I did.<eos> Oh, I must have forgot it back on Ceres.<eos> Yeah, you forgot it back on Ceres.
But we believe they're deliberately altering their drive signature.<eos> What's their ETA?<eos> Roughly two days, sir.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> You said you cracked it.
Hey. Hey, Roach.<eos> Roach, come meet some people.<eos> Who stole my goddamn burrito?<eos> No, it's there, Roach.<eos> I just moved it to make room for my coleslaw.
Did you tell them your wish, or did you keep it to yourself?<eos> Blah, blah, blah.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means blah, blah, blah.<eos> Does that mean you kept it to yourself?
If it's talk about me, I'm right here.<eos> You have a problem, Gabe!<eos> Don't provoke him, please.<eos> Uh, if I may suggest something?<eos> If you three switch your baritone to a bassitone and then you transpose it up half a step, you'll still have a nice, clean three-part Harmony.
Oh! There's mud here.<eos> Be careful.<eos> What am I gonna...<eos> Oh. This mud?<eos> Yeah, found it.
I got a giant donut!<eos> That's amazing.<eos> My ice cream!<eos> She dropped her ice cream.<eos> How do we clean it?
I know this is a weird time to bring it up, but it is a discontinued model.<eos> It's got metal gray...<eos> It's our candidate, folks!<eos> I just want to thank all of you for all your hard work.<eos> I really appreciate it.
Now, you know this old nasty freeloading bitch is still on my nice couch.<eos> -It's a futon.<eos> -It's a professional sectional.<eos> (belches)<eos> Anyhow, we can gas up the air mattress, baby, and put it right in the living room.
(laughing) And you!<eos> Detention all week.<eos> I have football practice!<eos> Not my problem.<eos> I love your outfit. Where did you get it?
Not my problem.<eos> I love your outfit. Where did you get it?<eos> Salvation Army?<eos> (laughing)<eos> No, I got it from someone named Lady Gaga.
Join the club.<eos> I notice you've been taking a... very unusual approach with your students.<eos> Well, Principal Wayne, some of the kids are assholes, and I have to treat them accordingly.<eos> The language you use could be argued as inappropriate to some.<eos> Some of them deserve it.
They don't believe us.<eos> Like, "Well, I'm not treating for mice."<eos> You got rats."<eos> We had this wonderful... rodenticide called thallium sulfate.<eos> Can't get it no more.
No.<eos> We had to use other methods.<eos> A rat is able to learn from his mistakes.<eos> Now when a poison is put down, rats are very wary.<eos> They look at it three, four days.
Oliver.<eos> Olivia.<eos> Come on, away with you!<eos> Aah!<eos> We will try and solve the rat problem or at least knock it down.
Unfortunately, that's a problem.<eos> We can't afford to keep the boat if we can't run it, and we can't run it if it's got a broken motor.<eos> Let's take out a loan.<eos> And pay it back with what?<eos> We hire it out till we pay the loan back, obviously.
Do you have any plans in life other than slipping fart cushions under people?<eos> I don't have a fart cushion.<eos> I know men your age with ambitions, but who cares?<eos> Here's your shampoo.<eos> If you need it, you can keep it.
Oh, shit!<eos> You scared me.<eos> Why, am I scary?<eos> I told you, you cannot stay here.<eos> Listen, my car's at the Chevron, the alternator's fucked, it's gonna take 'em overnight to fix it.
Look at the world.<eos> In my dreams... I see it.<eos> I see it just as plain as day.<eos> World's goin' to hell in a hand basket.<eos> Charlie sees it, too. And when it comes, Frankie, you take your mother and you just get over to Charlie's.
Hey.<eos> - Take care of him.<eos> - I will.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Your friend just gave it to me.
- That's great.<eos> - Honey, come on!<eos> There's the guest house where you'll be staying.<eos> Great.<eos> And here's a barn, we converted it to a kennel a few years ago.
Ali Khan is afraid of trees, Mr. Nakhararyan.<eos> Not exactly, but what others feel for trees, I feel for the desert.<eos> The desert?<eos> It's just scrub and sand.<eos> That's what I love about it:
Before that, you know what they did?<eos> If someone had their leg blown off in some battle... they put the remaining stump of that leg into boiling oil.<eos> And do you think this God of yours...<eos> What did He do?<eos> Did He smell that smell of burning flesh and enjoyed it?
But he's got giant's blood.<eos> And you've got training.<eos> Sounds like a fair match to me.<eos> Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.<eos> And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.
Hey, let them go, let them go!<eos> Look, man, we're just trying to get off this island.<eos> Therein lies the rub.<eos> Danny.<eos> You guys don't get it.
I see all.<eos> Yet...<eos> I didn't expect to find you.<eos> The anomalies of my creations are always so fascinating.<eos> Jason, you will stand beside me and you will help me cleanse this world and return it to perfection.
It could've been dropped off a boat.<eos> There's a lighthouse, so it could have been thrown close to land.<eos> We've confirmed there's a lot of blood on the paper.<eos> We know that someone's name starts with a P.<eos> I think a child wrote it man is misspelled, and it says mom and dad, right?
The original by your boy George Washington over 200 years ago.<eos> The man liked to have escape tunnels attached to all his structures.<eos> They're all over D.C.<eos> The tunnel under the original church has been closed up since the '50s.<eos> But we reopened it.
New suit, Arthur?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's...<eos> You can wear it for what's left of your dinner.
Sorry, sir.<eos> Mine.<eos> Godfrey, take that phone out!<eos> -Sorry, sir.<eos> -Turn it off immediately!
Walker, help him with his phone.<eos> Walker, get a job...<eos> Frazer, stop talking and help him with his phone.<eos> I've got it now.<eos> I got it, sir.
Walker, get a job...<eos> Frazer, stop talking and help him with his phone.<eos> I've got it now.<eos> I got it, sir.<eos> Would you hold it?
Time is short, so I will be plain and offer you the same terms as accepted by the late Captain Hallendale's men.<eos> Surrender, and I am authorized to offer you full, unqualified pardons.<eos> Your ship will be commandeered and you will be given a choice of either entering into my service or being set free at the nearest convenient port, your names cleared and your accounts squared.<eos> Refuse and I shall grant no quarter.<eos> Do you think they'll take it?
Have some strawberries.<eos> I read your book.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - An incredible text on terrorism.<eos> - You never mentioned it.
I thought you'd keep on coming without me. - With a kids.<eos> - No, I don't think so.<eos> I hope she likes flowers.<eos> It'd be a shame to abandon the garden.<eos> I worked so hard on it.
Right after that, I, uh, find your journal.<eos> You know, I was wondering where I lost that.<eos> Yeah and then I meant it to give it back to you, but, um... For some reason, I didn't think I should give it back to you in front of Cathy.<eos> I mean I didn't read or anything, so I don't even know if it talks about her, but I imagine since it's a journal.<eos> And then, I forgot I had it.
All that time I spent sitting in a car, waiting, and all the time that i spent not seeing you versus the time that I actually did.<eos> - What you don't remember but I do, is that the minute you came in the house, you were so happy that you made it that you forgot everything else.<eos> - Oh, no,<eos> I just didn't want to make you feel guilty for making me drive up there.<eos> - The happier the memory, the more unlikely it is that you'll remember it.
- He talk?<eos> - No, he definitely didn't.<eos> He owes me $7,000.<eos> Where the fuck's my money?<eos> I don't... I don't know. I know that you'll get it, though.
Just come back.<eos> The '94 is actually my favorite.<eos> It's got this, uh, combination of burnt earth and plums and, like, a incense.<eos> Well, I guess you're a Scotch girl.<eos> Well, I'd drink nail polish remover if somebody handed it to me.
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai, who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?<eos> If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?<eos> We cannot.<eos> The Masters speak only one language.<eos> They spoke it to me for many years.
So, you think I'm a fruit, huh?<eos> Well, then a fruit I shall become.<eos> Oh, my God, Freddie, we can't chop down a tree with a homosexual man in it.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> I made a gay slur, then he threw it back in my face by acting like the kind of fruit that grows on trees.
It's difficult when you're away.<eos> Yes, I'm very sorry, Kitty.<eos> Tell me this.<eos> -How did Richard Crooks get the record?<eos> -She gave it to him.
And no one would enjoy seeing you triumph here more than I, obviously.<eos> But this place is just...<eos> it's so big, you know.<eos> It's nearly a thousand, three thousand people.<eos> Well, Lily Pons's voice filled it.
It ain't gonna be like you think.<eos> Cheddar already told y'all, we ain't here...<eos> Damn, nigga!<eos> You see that shit?<eos> He did it. He flipped it?
I mean, I think that everyone should have a pet.<eos> What's its name?<eos> Cancer.<eos> Wait, wait, um...<eos> Why would... you name it that?
- On the bidet.<eos> Water was flying everywhere.<eos> She came in, slipped... wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> The bidet was on?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't recommend it at a novice level.
How's the digs?<eos> - Who's the other fella?<eos> - Martin.<eos> He was a Panther, but it didn't work out.<eos> Vernon was misdiagnosed as a child genius and he never got over it.
Ord?<eos> Yo.<eos> Where's the fucking money?<eos> Safe, man.<eos> I put it in the Fireman's Fund.
Isn't that something?<eos> David!<eos> David, what do you hear about your show?<eos> Uh, it didn't get picked up...<eos> So they don't pick it up, you know, it's over.
You sound wistful.<eos> It was kind of nice, yeah.<eos> I got this huge mahogany desk when I was little.<eos> It's still in there...<eos> And I remember asking specifically for it... For my 8th birthday.
Hope you feel better.<eos> Hey... you okay?<eos> I didn't get the show, so...<eos> Oh... shoot, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, this other guy got it.
Come on.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Those locked up too? - Yeah.<eos> We're trapped in here.<eos> Rocky, the remote, do you have it with you?
Just any old thing?<eos> - We harvest from the bottom up.<eos> We passed through this field twice, all ready.<eos> Every pass we pick from the lowest level.<eos> - It's been empty since I bought it.
- I got somethin' for ya.<eos> - That's hers.<eos> - It's for you.<eos> I found it for you.<eos> - How'd you get it?
And one, and two, and three... The female body is a complex thing, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and brave.<eos> It carries the seed of our hopes, the bloom of our youth, the weight of our fears.<eos> It can nurture and tremble... inspire and terrify.<eos> It oppresses and protects us, holding within it all that we are, projecting less than we wish to be.
And, I believe, in Eastern Orthodox tradition, Lent actually ends today.<eos> When I was a child, my nurse would never let me eat every morsel put before me.<eos> Something must always remain, for Mr Manners.<eos> I know now that Mr Manners is a myth, and it is madness to appease him with delights of any kind.<eos> And now we take our right arm and raise it upright.
No, I wondered if you'd show me how to use it -- there's a long playing record I'd like to hear.<eos> Oh, how thoroughly romantic.<eos> It's simply to put me in the Latin mind-set -- for the Spanish.<eos> Of course.<eos> Then I'll do better than show it to you, I'll play it for you.
Then you'll take a hot bath to help you relax -- the heat intensifies the effects of the castor oil...<eos> He's not on his own, is he?<eos> Dr Turner's with him.<eos> Johnny is waiting for this baby.<eos> And I promise you, he will see it.
You must've made a marvellous teacher.<eos> Oh, I think that would be overstating it.<eos> But I did enjoy the work.<eos> As do you<eos> - I can tell. Do you miss it?
Picture's my souvenir.<eos> 27 years I've done at Hayward's so far.<eos> My husband did 30.<eos> He got his long-service watch before he died.<eos> Ian wears it now.
Rules are quite strict on maternity wards.<eos> It helps get babies into a routine.<eos> Many new mothers find this quite helpful, though Baby would see rather more of his or her father if you gave birth at home.<eos> I want the gas, though. Proper gas, off a machine.<eos> Someone told me if you have it at home, they give you gas through the cooker, and I think that's dangerous.
I'll be downstairs.<eos> I'm gonna have to break up with him before we leave Libya.<eos> How do you leave me on D when the party's right here?<eos> Hey, about this whole Ambo story,<eos> I don't buy it.
W-we gotta go.<eos> Okay.<eos> See ya!<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> The accent on the message, you make it out.
It's a miracle they didna shoot me in my good eye.<eos> Damn it, where's my knife?<eos> My lady.<eos> Well, where'd you get that?<eos> Milord gave it to me.
When you played him... who would win?<eos> Me.<eos> Just 'cause the brother's dead don't mean I gotta start changing the facts.<eos> So what will happen to this place?<eos> Ah, the bank will swoop in and take it eventually.
You need to get my daddy's ring back.<eos> You remember what he was like before he got strung out?<eos> Eddie's a good dude deep down.<eos> To me, what's left of him is that ring.<eos> The only reason why he didn't pawn it is because I took it away from him.
In the time that was unaccounted for, your only source of information for the barber shop shooting, Chico Diaz, went missing.<eos> He was last seen with Scarfe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Scarfe left the precinct to pick up Chico, but Chico was gone.<eos> So, he picks up a witness unsupervised, which is against protocol, doesn't even log it in, and he still has time to get to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.
You guys actually take lunch breaks like real employees, huh?<eos> Any of you guys at Crispus Attucks the other night?<eos> - Nah, man.<eos> Like I need these bitches.<eos> Aisha's ring. You got it?
Azie.<eos> It's always been wild.<eos> But people carried groceries for old ladies.<eos> Your name meant something.<eos> Maybe that's why they call it "back in the day."
I should be out there doing my job.<eos> Your job is out there waiting for you, Detective.<eos> The question is, how badly do you want it?
- Chris Denby.<eos> - New York Post. - Yes, of course.<eos> I gotta go be in makeup from morning to evening.<eos> I hate it. - Oh.<eos> You're doing it for Ian, so...
So, it's definitely not yours. So, now I got nothing again.<eos> You ruin everything.<eos> Well, weren't you gonna spend it anyway, to pay our ransom?<eos> Of course.<eos> But, like, you clearly don't need it now.
Hear that?<eos> He put it up. That's what we're dealing with, unreasonable.<eos> Do you think I'm an idiot?<eos> I'm keeping that money.<eos> I raised it, I gave you your half.
I don't even really know her.<eos> We have to save as many people as possible before this thing hits.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where's your Gateway watch?<eos> I haven't gotten it yet.
Mmm.<eos> Like what?<eos> Oh, just stupid shit.<eos> Like how we should have never signed that stupid record deal.<eos> I put everything I had into that record, and then they just totally dumped it.
That's Key Flo, a big-time drug dealer.<eos> One day while working on his alarm... Key Flo got busted.<eos> They took his ass far away.<eos> Whaz' they didn't know was in his house was a loz' of money.<eos> So I took it as a payment for all the work I did.
I don't know, but you can't stay here, nigga.<eos> - You gotta go.<eos> - It's sundown, baby.<eos> I'll get my ass purged quick.<eos> Baby, I've seen it.
- And I come right after it.<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.<eos> - And look at this. Are you a little black vampire?<eos> - It's a little ironic... that your name is Black...<eos> - because you are-- - Don't say it, bitch.
Let's go.<eos> I thought we weren't allowed to go out there!<eos> We gotta g0!<eos> Does asbestos smell like weed?<eos> 'Cause if so, I smell it. Shut up.
I got them. I got them.<eos> You go get him.<eos> Be careful, Daddy. Be careful.<eos> You stole that money and ran off to California like I couldn't find you!<eos> You took Key Flo's money, and I need it back.
Good.<eos> Story time.<eos> Well, every week, the fat man... would come into the store and he'd pick up all the fat.<eos> And the fat itself was stored in a garbage pail.<eos> After the fat man came... I would take this can out front of the store and I'd wash it out.
You're welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> She's withdrawn from the case.<eos> She's assigned it to me and doesn't want anybody from the firm spending time on it, so I'm looking outside it for some help.
This is for a month or two.<eos> It's more than fair.<eos> Two or three months, I said, not one or two.<eos> And where's the money coming from?<eos> I'm sure his parents don't have it.
It's an anesthetic vets use on horses when they do surgery.<eos> Why would anybody take that?<eos> Why would Michael Jackson take propofol?<eos> ... Same reason.<eos> He took it to sleep, didn't he?
How's the house?<eos> Anything needs work... I can always come by and fix it.<eos> Kyle doesn't really do that stuff, does he?<eos> No, Kyle doesn't have to.<eos> He pays people to do it.
Kyle didn't like them, so he took them down.<eos> He didn't like them?<eos> I mean, who doesn't like custom built-in wood shelves?<eos> Jesus.<eos> I mean... Half of us build the world, the other half destroy it.
What the hell happened here?<eos> Kyle had an accident.<eos> He had an accident with door trim?<eos> How do you even do that?<eos> - Why didn't he fix it?
If you have a six, then you can ask me if I have a six.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Then you take it and make a pair.<eos> If I've already got a pair, what do I do?<eos> You put it in that pile.
He's got heart trouble.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - Get off.<eos> Just give me my money.<eos> We don't have it anymore. It's gone.
Mom.<eos> - No, we're taking it back.<eos> - Well, it's for fixing the car.<eos> You weren't supposed to say anything.<eos> She said... She was gonna ask you to fix it anyways.
[Boom] [Gasping]<eos> [Distant explosion]<eos> It's breathtaking, isn't it?<eos> They put on that show a couple times a month.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it from my house.
Your bar?<eos> The Yo...<eos> Yo...<eos> Yoknapatawpha.<eos> We called it The Yonk.
So look again, see you tomorrow.<eos> Hello, pet.<eos> Enjoy the show?<eos> - Happy?<eos> - You missed it.
They're cute, eh?<eos> They get on so well.<eos> Yes, they almost never argue.<eos> By the way... did you listen to my record?<eos> Sorry, I'll drop it back later.
For me, there was a sexual act which may be linked to your daughter's death.<eos> So, what do you suggest] do?<eos> Want my advice, Mr Bamberski?<eos> You want to know the truth, but it's unbearable.<eos> I say, bum this document and forget it.
Maybe I wanted something to happen.<eos> - I'm a bad mother.<eos> - Of course you aren't.<eos> I didn't know her.<eos> - I didn't even know she kept a diary. - You didn't read it?
So, when will this project come up in committee?<eos> September, I think.<eos> They cannot do it earlier?<eos> I don't control the schedule, honey.<eos> How will Clyde handle it if you won't be around by then?
- She has a line of jewelry.<eos> - It's not a line yet. - Oh...<eos> - It will be.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You mean you made it?
Well, I'm humbled by your devotion to celebrating my birthday. I mean...<eos> The other day Clyde was asking me why I insist on no gifts, and I said something about how we don't need any more stuff. Which is true.<eos> We don't need any more stuff, but...<eos> I think what I really meant is you don't need to give me anything because you're here. And that's a very good gift, I appreciate it.<eos> I mean, if you have, you know, an albino alligator, I'll take it.
But I look at her now and she is becoming herself.<eos> She has become an artist.<eos> Say it again.<eos> Your work is beautiful.<eos> And it makes the people who are wearing it beautiful.
I still remember watching you practice, you know.<eos> There was this one time you were working on a passage, it was Brahms, I think... and you just wouldn't stop.<eos> Just over and over and over.<eos> You were so... determined. To just master it, you know?<eos> You're still doing it.
Yeah.<eos> It's not very good, I know.<eos> But I'm... I'm just starting.<eos> A kangaroo with a light switch for a head.<eos> What do you call it... a kanger-switch?
- Ohh! - Give me a reason!<eos> I dare you! Ohh! Aah!<eos> Things got a little heated back there, huh? I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You got to tell me what's going on with you and this case.<eos> You know we never solve it till you do.
Deep cover was easy.<eos> Who's up for a beach day?<eos> Don't put your one-piece on just yet.<eos> We tore apart their hideout and still didn't find that flash drive.<eos> Our best guess is that Nafan still has it.

- You want final judgment upon me, you will have to hand it down yourself, as I most certainly intend to do.<eos> - I ain't yourjudge.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> You are the only one who knows me, same as I know you!<eos> Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
He see us in a tent, it no mean...<eos> His whore was wearing your mother's dress.<eos> I give to her.<eos> Well, Chang's on the scent.<eos> He'll follow it straight to your contract with the Sze Yup.
When I was growin' up, people didn't really talk about miracles.<eos> I'm not sure I understood what they were or if I believed in them.<eos> A miracle is defined as something not explicable by natural or scientific laws.<eos> But then how do you explain it?
I'm her mother.<eos> And I knew, I just knew it was something bad.<eos> I'm not sure Anna can wait much longer.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I want to help you, I really do, but I've only had this job for two weeks and I really need it.
That would be wonderful, Doctor.<eos> I mean, however, there's potential side effects.<eos> Headaches, diarrhea, swelling, and some that are more dangerous, like cardiac arrhythmia.<eos> Because of that, I am required to see her every six weeks for monitoring.<eos> I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't believe it was worth the risk.
Hey, pretty girl.<eos> I like your necklace, but we're gonna have to take it off.<eos> But I like it near me.<eos> You know what?<eos> If we put it here, its power will go into the liquids, and it will protect you from the inside.
What are you doing to keep cool?<eos> What are you doing to beat this heat?<eos> Speaking of hot, hot, hot!<eos> Janet's bring the heat with the number one single in the country.<eos> I miss it so much when I don't hear it.
No, he didn't.<eos> He didn't mean anything by it.<eos> He's just a little out of touch, that's all.<eos> I'm just tired of being two different people.<eos> I played that game at Princeton, and I played it again at Harvard.
- Mm.<eos> - At least we can start from there.<eos> Okay, so what about that moment in the church before the meeting?<eos> Which?<eos> I think Bernadette said it, about you finally dating a sister.
Commercial sector 1, insured.<eos> Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...<eos> Bishop...<eos> It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop.<eos> Who says I'm going to put it?
Where is the?<eos> Do we have eye contact?<eos> Negative, it's gone.<eos> Damn it, bishop!<eos> I had it in sight.
I'm not interested.<eos> Did you find out, where do the other bastards hide?<eos> Oh, come on, Bishop!<eos> We know they are breeding like rabbits for decades.<eos> Why do you put your hologram and find it yourself, Trajan?
I mean..you bought this house, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> - No, right?<eos> So who's going to pay the rent?<eos> Sorry, I was a bit busy.. I'll send it.
I'm gonna make tea.<eos> Anne...<eos> Anne:<eos> Here.<eos> What is this? Anne: I found it on craigslist.
This helps them listen.<eos> Okay, people.<eos> We got a situation here.<eos> One of you boners stole my money.<eos> Nobody is leaving this fucking hotel until I get it back.
Guy, what do you know about me?<eos> Not much.<eos> What's one thing you do know?<eos> You like money?<eos> And do you think I spend it, or save it?
Collins noticed that the parking lot camera was malfunctioning.<eos> When he went to check it out, two masked guys with guns were at the door, forced their way in.<eos> Do we know how they disabled the cameras?<eos> Wiring appears intact.<eos> We're taking it back to the crime lab.
Otis was selling non-sanctioned products in his store?<eos> Well, the discrepancy could be an aberration in the manufacturing process.<eos> I'll know for sure once I test the T.H.C. levels in these samples.<eos> When you say "test," uh, exactly how do you do that?<eos> Well, we do burn it in a controlled environment with proper ventilation.
Let get you up.<eos> Okay, now...<eos> If it's money you want, I can get you money.<eos> Come on.<eos> If I wanted your money, I'd already have it, right?
Yeah, okey-doke.<eos> We work in silence.<eos> That's not silence.<eos> We've been digging into Joe Harris' cell phone.<eos> Maybe he doesn't carry it all the time, but if he has been, it doesn't seem like he's gone any further out of Boston than the prison over the last two weeks.
I ... Yes.<eos> I-I-I probably had my phone on me.<eos> I...<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I definitely left it in my desk when I came back from the prison.
U... N...<eos> N... I'll have dispatch put roadblocks up in front of the tunnels.<eos> I'll try to catch ward.<eos> They found his car in an indoor parking lot about 3 miles from the Asylum.<eos> Yeah, he must've parked it and walked back so we wouldn't see it here.
She even brought her flowers.<eos> Or maybe that was her birthday.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> This year's humanitarian award for her work with homeless homing pigeons and reprogramming the left handed, Emily Atkins.<eos> I was in awe of her, never dreaming that on June 4th, 2004, at 3:26 pm, she would take my heart, throw it in a backpack, toss it in a Van, and drive away with it.
Of the rent.<eos> Soon.<eos> There are a couple of unforeseen expenses.<eos> And I'm asking for a raise tomorrow at Martin's computers.<eos> Do you think you're gonna get it?
You guys know what chard is?<eos> No.<eos> It's like the fat free yogurt of vegetables, which is bad because vegetables are like the soy milk of food.<eos> Ethan, you need a new oven igniter.<eos> I'll order it tomorrow.
Yeah, that's fantastic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> I'm really excited.<eos> You deserve it.
Plus this is not the first time dorsa has had a nightmare and imagined things.<eos> I'm just saying you're only a bad sleeper when you're stressed.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's my... Annual draft notice.<eos> Why didn't you mention it sooner?
And basically that was the menu, and I said, that's for me.<eos> Now I have ultimatums, you know.<eos> ...except that I'd like to be able to say that. I bought the agreement back from them for two million, seven hundred thousand dollars.<eos> I got the name, the Golden Arches, basically it was a matter of me working longer and harder than anybody else.<eos> I'll take every resource that I have and I'll put it in and I'll go for broke if I believe in it.
Yeah, and then I got back to the house, and I was running around and, uh, I broke a glass.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> And then one of your guys just called.<eos> Uh, actually, uh, uh, I cut it before.<eos> Maybe I opened it.
She loved him.<eos> Well, they were obsessed with each other.<eos> And she really did love him.<eos> They had hot sex.<eos> Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.
To rockingham?<eos> Who else could have?<eos> Take a step back.<eos> I mean, doesn't it seem odd That this glove just happened to be at rockingham At the same time that detective fuhrman<eos> Just happened to find it?
Detective, could you tell us what you see here?<eos> These are photographs of the area I was inspecting behind Mr. Kaelin's residence.<eos> And in them is what I then identified as a possible glove.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I approached it and I looked at it.
And in them is what I then identified as a possible glove.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I approached it and I looked at it.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> I didn't touch it.
What does that mean, Mr. Bailey?<eos> That means arresting drunk and disorderlies.<eos> Sorry, Your Honor.<eos> Slipped into some. Marine-to-Marine talk there.<eos> Detective, did you take a glove from the Bundy scene and then wipe it on the interior of the Bronco? No.
Slipped into some. Marine-to-Marine talk there.<eos> Detective, did you take a glove from the Bundy scene and then wipe it on the interior of the Bronco? No.<eos> You did not?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Couldn't you have fit this into a plastic bag, then put it in your sock?
Detective, did you take a glove from the Bundy scene and then wipe it on the interior of the Bronco? No.<eos> You did not?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Couldn't you have fit this into a plastic bag, then put it in your sock?<eos> And then place it at Mr. Simpson's home, so that you could find it?
Those gloves are too small.<eos> Yes, Bob.<eos> I tried the glove on in there... myself. It didn't fit.<eos> It will... never fit him.<eos> I think we should have him try it on in court.
Inflaming the public's passions in an attempt to exert political pressure over His Honor.<eos> In an attempt to pressure the court into admitting in the Fuhrman tapes.<eos> Mr. Darden!<eos> This case is a circus!<eos> And the defense has made it into a circus.
I was raped in Italy by a waiter.<eos> And I buried it.<eos> Didn't forget it.<eos> Just... sort of stuffed it.<eos> When I had my first rape case, what happened to me, of course, came flying out from whatever rock I had jammed it under and...
So you make contact on my wedding day.<eos> You now have very powerful enemies, at the Soviet Embassy and within your own government.<eos> You are being watched -- at your house, your office, your clubs, your bars.<eos> You best be quick or I'll be missed. Where's the money?<eos> The Duke's niece is bringing it from London.
Grand Duchess, may I introduce you to the Shelby brothers?<eos> Small Heath, Birmingham.<eos> And, erm, good luck with this one, Tom.<eos> Give me the money.<eos> I was told to give it to Mr Kaledin.
- Oh, that's cool.<eos> What's the saying?<eos> Once a knock around girl, always a knock around girl?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jabs, Jabs, listen, I know I owe you money, I owe almost got it all, I promise.
And how will she do that?<eos> I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.<eos> Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it.<eos> I've been all over the world.<eos> I've seen more of it than all of you combined.
Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.<eos> I've sworn to protect you, my lady.<eos> You heard them.<eos> We can send the Blackfish a raven.<eos> Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.<eos> Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.<eos> You're right.<eos> I made a terrible mistake.<eos> I carry it with me every single day.
What if everyone starts demanding their independence?<eos> She's not demanding, she's asking.<eos> The others are free to ask as well.<eos> Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.<eos> They left the world worse than they found it.
The others are free to ask as well.<eos> Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.<eos> They left the world worse than they found it.<eos> We're not going to do that.<eos> We're going to leave the world better than we found it.
If you think I am pushing you, it's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come.<eos> You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor.<eos> You're pushing to see if I snap.<eos> It's not fun... having your mind read, is it?<eos> Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it.
Kubo, we both want the exact same thing.<eos> You want to take my other eye.<eos> That's what you want!<eos> Well, yes.<eos> But do you know why I want it?
Well, we're missing a kidney.<eos> I've gone through the bag twice.<eos> You think Ron would manage to send us all the organs for crying out loud.<eos> Well..<eos> What if the person who killed him took it?
I need you to come out of your head for a couple hours, okay?<eos> Give her a hand.. Make her realize she still has one loving child left.<eos> Or at least pretend.<eos> I had to stop by Ron's for that file he forgot and he, he told me a joke.<eos> - You wanna hear it?
Gloria thinks there should be a ballet company out here.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - I hate the ballet.<eos> Get her to do that modern shit you love.<eos> I thought you enjoyed it last time.
Richie, this is Kip Stevens.<eos> You guys ready?<eos> Sure.<eos> Next time bring some blow for me, yeah?<eos> You don't need it.
What do you think is gonna happen now?<eos> When you live in our ghetto, you sign a contract. Get it?<eos> - Do you get it, you little fuck?<eos> - Don't do this!<eos> When I ask for your car, you give it to me.
Are you okay? Have we hit something?<eos> I saw a deer running alongside the train.<eos> No, my god.<eos> What a thing to say!<eos> - Yeah, me too, I saw it.
Similarly, there is a pleasure boat With three crew.<eos> The rough seas with waves over six meters have prevented Civil Protection from being able to help.<eos> As dawn comes and sea conditions improve...<eos> I am the judge Vicente Louro.<eos> In order to move the body, you need to identify it.
There will be no Kurultai.<eos> Only war.<eos> Your mind was far from war on that day... was it not?<eos> I remember.<eos> I remember it well.
This starts with a clean and healthy foto.<eos> What we're about to do to you has been done to your fathers and their fathers and all of your forefathers.<eos> The paste will help numb you a little, but not enough.<eos> The pain will help you remember Kasa Boyo.<eos> And trust me, you will remember it.
Mrs. Kimbale.<eos> I will have 10,000 or that door will not open.<eos> Of course.<eos> The money you earned.<eos> I need it now now, Phiona.
I will have 10,000 or that door will not open.<eos> Of course.<eos> The money you earned.<eos> I need it now now, Phiona.<eos> I gave it to the man on the boda boda.
So was the commander.<eos> What clarke did at mount weather weakened her.<eos> The ice nation is emboldened.<eos> Their queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people believe she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you.<eos> What was that?<eos> You almost gave that poor man a heart attack.<eos> Paulina Zander, get in here!<eos> She deserved it, Mom.
Although your guest, I'm sure, will order the caviar.<eos> Myself, my wife and my niece travelled by train, then coach, then on foot through the Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea.<eos> On that journey I lost a toe.<eos> I don't know. I woke up one morning and it was gone.<eos> All of a sudden I saw a dog and it was eating it.
It's not formal.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It's made in Paris.<eos> It was stolen in Birmingham.<eos> My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning, 1901...
What do you think of that?<eos> I think you should not drink vodka with champagne.<eos> Does your wife know that the sapphire she's wearing has been cursed by a gypsy?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing on earth would make me wear it.
MPs, army officers...<eos> When all we're trying to do is save the country from revolution.<eos> This is for the killing of the spy and a down payment on future services.<eos> Does your wife know that the sapphire she is wearing has been cursed?<eos> Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.
If he's involved, I'm out.<eos> He needs to die.<eos> Are you always so violent?<eos> I killed a stag today and it hurt me to do it.<eos> But I treated it with respect and the spare meat will go to poor people.
Madness.<eos> Killing.<eos> I am the first one... .. who understands you.<eos> I found her perfume.<eos> Put it on.
There will be some men coming down from Birmingham.<eos> And you put them up here in the house, you put them in the front - and back of the house and you feed them...<eos> - Why are they needed, sir?<eos> I bought a cursed sapphire into this house, Mary.<eos> And now I'm paying for it.
The Russians all turned and ran.<eos> The Cossacks didn't run, Arthur.<eos> Mr Shelby, welcome.<eos> How is my car?<eos> I think I'm in love with it.
Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?
It's the branch of physics dealing with the production and effects of extremely low temperatures.<eos> My understanding is that there were some promising experiments being carried out in the program, but, alas, it was shut down.<eos> When was that?<eos> Two or three years ago.<eos> Thomas Wayne killed it, along with a few other odd programs.
She's sick.<eos> She's in pain.<eos> Everyone that comes in here is sick or in pain.<eos> Have your doctor write a new prescription.<eos> Then I can refill it.
Jim.<eos> Heard you were able to save the day.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I don't believe in luck.<eos> You saw a problem and you solved it.
Don't you take that bag!<eos> You have any idea who you're stealing from?<eos> Aah! Leave it!<eos> That's my money.<eos> Boo-hoo. You stole it.
I was there.<eos> Remember?<eos> When you first caught the Wayne case.<eos> I know what it means to you.<eos> You think that if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past.
I did it to Gordon once, and I can do it again, 'cause peoples' brains are just a mystery, and once you figure it out...<eos> Look. Helzinger?<eos> Can't stand criticism because of an overbearing mother.<eos> Wants love and approval.<eos> Gets mad when he doesn't get it, so I give it.
In ten minutes, everything within a quarter mile radius will be dust.<eos> That's madness.<eos> If you want to live... which I do, frankly... we had better leave.<eos> We detected a radioactive material down there.<eos> You got it out first, right?
There wasn't enough time.<eos> They forced my hand, but I calculated the chances of a radioactive cloud is fairly low.<eos> If you're wrong, thousands of people could die.<eos> Yes, yes, yes, but paying that price will be better than releasing what's down there.<eos> How do we shut it down?
Nothing.<eos> There's no mail thing.<eos> There's no mail thing.<eos> But it's my sperm.<eos> How did you even find out I wanted it?
Wow.<eos> That is so very illegal.<eos> He's not doing that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You have 48 hours to do so, or I'm gonna take your sperm, and I'm gonna dump it into the East River.
Oh, thank you.<eos> It burns!<eos> - Oh! - The vapors burn!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I'll take it back!
- I'd love that, son.<eos> This is nice.<eos> - If you screw this up and hurt her in any way, I will throw you in jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, Dad, so do not test me.<eos> [clears throat] Okay.<eos> - I still liked the hug even though you used it to threaten me.
You can't give a celebrity case to Amy.<eos> The last movie she saw was a documentary about spelling bees.<eos> Wrong; it was about the font Helvetica, and it played like an action thriller.<eos> You already have a case, Peralta.<eos> I assigned it to you this morning.
All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> Here's where we're at.<eos> Bad news:<eos> Cheddar is still at large, and you know that slippery little bastard is just laughing at us.<eos> We need a new plan, and we need it now.
Oh, look at that.<eos> A bunch of old family photos and personal belongings.<eos> Pimento's mementos.<eos> I know you have a gun on me. I just couldn't resist the rhyme, sorry.<eos> I stashed it all when I became Paul Sneed.
Mm-mm. Gentlemen, I just thought of a plan.<eos> Stage Pimento's death and go to the meet-up ourselves.<eos> Great plan, Sarge!<eos> No, I was gonna say it first.<eos> I thought of it before you did.
I just followed Terry into a dark closet.<eos> Hey.<eos> You solved the puzzle before me.<eos> Nerds.<eos> They solved it first.
Sorry that wasn't Scar-Joe.<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Talking about your feelings is for losers.<eos> I guess Adele's a loser in your world.<eos> Look, the funeral's almost over, we basically pulled it off.
Yeah, yeah, sure, he's here. Who's calling?<eos> It's Vicky.<eos> From Forensics.<eos> Hello?<eos> I've just sent you a text, have you seen it?
Hello?<eos> I've just sent you a text, have you seen it?<eos> No.<eos> Please have a look.<eos> - Have you seen it? - What's this?
Every time I'd just drop in, spin, fall, get up, and walk up the ramp over and over again.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I wouldn't have given up for anything.<eos> On my twelfth try, the spin was fast, I had enough height.<eos> I shifted my weight and threw it back.
- A lot of girls do.<eos> But not you!<eos> Remember what happened to the goldfish?<eos> That was two years ago. You can't make a bed, make coffee, boil an egg.<eos> We gave away the dog, because you never walked it or fed it.
OK.<eos> Ken Sir<eos> We're all set.<eos> This number from the suspect<eos> I passed it to CIB (Criminal Intelligence Bureau).
It's against regulations.<eos> I could lose my licence.<eos> I need this oily.<eos> I need this to lubricate the world.<eos> I need this dog to have some grease on it, so when I eat it the grease will lubricate my throat.
What the fuck is going on, man?<eos> Did you see that shit?<eos> No, I didn't see...<eos> Gary, look, listen to me, -What? You got to stop with the noise, okay?<eos> We can't deal with it anymore, we can't sleep back there.
He's right.<eos> The safest place for this isn't behind walls or guarded with guns.<eos> The safest place lives outside the realm of anyone's awareness.<eos> If the English can't find it, they can't take it.<eos> I told her we were taking it, just not where.
All the dom I drank, I got too tired.<eos> You know how many funk acts they have over there at koronet records?<eos> Not gonna remember your name.<eos> He said my name a lot.<eos> He got it down.
Okay, there is no need for that kind of language, ma'am.<eos> Okay, well $300 is a lot of fucking money to me, so you'll excuse me if i don't appreciate the fact that you're trying to fucking steal it from me.<eos> - I'm doing no such thing.<eos> Oxygen sensors fail all the time.<eos> If you've got a broken one and you don't repair it, your car's gas mileage is gonna drop, and over time, it's gonna cost you a lot more.
He just, sort of knew what they wanted to hear.<eos> - Um, cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> How did you get the money over there?<eos> - I delivered it in a suitcase.
I don't know, yeah, sometimes, a little.<eos> I wanted to tell you,<eos> I sent the link to your reel, to Adele.<eos> - You did?<eos> When did you send it?
You must be really brave?<eos> - No, I'm not brave.<eos> - No, I think so.<eos> - Anybody want more wine?<eos> - Yeah, I'll get it.
- No, I'm not brave.<eos> - No, I think so.<eos> - Anybody want more wine?<eos> - Yeah, I'll get it.<eos> No, no, no, I'll get it.
Maybe it doesn't count yet.<eos> Got to go.<eos> Lip?<eos> We're, uh, almost ready to start.<eos> When the priest asks for the ring, you just hand it to me, okay?
- What's the next routine?<eos> - It's called Wiiliam Tell.<eos> A remote Swiss relative.<eos> - But much nicer than me.<eos> - Did you or Footit write it?
What's he done now?<eos> He and Anatole Kuragin and that dreadful Dolokhov, they found a bear somewhere...<eos> - A bear?<eos> - That Pierre!<eos> ..and put it in a carriage and went to... to the actresses, you know, and the bear got out.
But do you have his will in safe keeping?<eos> - His true will, I mean.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> And that other will he made, when his mind was disturbed... naming Pierre, that was destroyed?<eos> He still has it.
- What's what like?<eos> Actually, you know, being in combat.<eos> Bloody awful, if you're on the losing side.<eos> But seriously, it's one of those things no-one can tell you about.<eos> You have to experience it for yourself, like being with a woman for the first time.
Do you hear me? What is it?<eos> Is it her voice that's funny?<eos> Or maybe it's Ms. Welles dying. You think that's funny.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> It's a beautiful moment and you've ruined it.
I should've known you were behind this.<eos> I hate that you're about to see me like this, but I don't have the strength to fight you anymore, Ray.<eos> Damn it. Is this what you wanted?<eos> I didn't get the job.<eos> They gave it to somebody else.
Fuck! - Shit! - Fuck!<eos> Fuck! Fuck! - Shit!<eos> Fuck! Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Day in, day out, I make Justin a sandwich, and these other boys just go right ahead and smash it.
His son died in that fire.<eos> You turn in the man responsible for this atrocity, otherwise, we will consider each and every one of you to be an accomplice to this crime.<eos> You got no proof that any of us had anything to do with that.<eos> You ungrateful little shitheels!<eos> We gave you work, you threw it in our face.
- Yeah. - How the hell did you manage that?<eos> Well, it wasn't easy, but it's done. Now I'm free.<eos> - Shall we skip?<eos> I have some work I need to do. I need to focus.<eos> But you said that the problem was seventh period and now I fixed it, so come on, Bill.
What the fuck?<eos> Smelly work, but it was worth it!<eos> So we can do this...<eos> If you try pull it out again what the fuck!<eos> We'll crank it up higher.
We'll talk to you guys tomorrow or something, all right?<eos> Come back after lunch.<eos> Here.<eos> And stop dropping the fucking things and breaking them, you yoyo!<eos> I didn't drop a fucking glass and break it.
But Ian ain't ready to grow up just yet.<eos> Jack, Jack, where did your horse come?<eos> Fuck knows.<eos> Well, you gonna fucking check it?<eos> Or give me the name and I'll check it for you.
Come on, Phyllis, I've grown a beard by the time you're ready.<eos> I've only got one pair of hands, can't do two things at once, you know.<eos> That's 250 pound, please, love.<eos> Have you made that coffee for me yet?<eos> Um, yeah, I'll bring it over to you when it's ready, okay.
- All right.<eos> I'm just gonna stay out here for a bit longer.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Could you not do that to my car?<eos> My cat is missing. Have you seen it?
- Running, you ass!<eos> Look, he can't just murder people with a gun, okay?<eos> That's fucking boring.<eos> What if the murderer strangles someone?<eos> Because strangling is scary 'cause it's really personal, 'cause you have to, like, look 'em in the eye when you do it.
I don't know.<eos> It's been, like, a day or two, or...<eos> Oh, no, we haven't had a cat like that come in here yet.<eos> Well, how do you know?<eos> Maybe you killed it already.
Three flights up.<eos> Lift's broken but it keeps you fit.<eos> _<eos> Yeah, chicken sounds great, love.<eos> A couple of days out of date is fine, as long as you cook it well.
Rob Singhal.<eos> IEA.<eos> Rob.<eos> I want you to put his name out.<eos> Splash it large.
Do you cook... "souvent"?<eos> "Souvent" no. but I can make a souffle that's to die for.<eos> No, no, I meant to say, do you cook often?<eos> Oh, yes, I love to, as often as I can.<eos> Chicken and potatoes, I don't know how many times I've made it.
When she realised that the worst had passed, I managed to convince her, if not...<eos> she would still be here, on the front line.<eos> Easy.<eos> The trick is to scare the octopus.<eos> You dip it into boiling water three times.
she would still be here, on the front line.<eos> Easy.<eos> The trick is to scare the octopus.<eos> You dip it into boiling water three times.<eos> Take it out, and then you cook it, depending on the size of the octopus, about half an "horiña", yes?
You.<eos> Spain has a Ministry that can travel through history?<eos> Who would you tell such an incredible secret to?<eos> The American government.<eos> They told me to give it to you secretly. Is it serious?
Why all the secrecy?<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> A telegram arrived from the 1924 Ministry.<eos> It's from Amelia and for you.<eos> They told me to give it to you in secret. Is it serious?
- Rafael.<eos> - Go on, Rafael.<eos> In my bag...<eos> In my bag, there's a necklace, a cameo that was my grandmother's, God rest her soul.<eos> I would like it if... well... if someone were to have it, but I won't be able to give it to her in person, I fear.
Six years later he returned to Spain, and to teaching, and he began with that phrase, paying homage to Fray Luis de Leon who had done the same exactly 400 years earlier<eos> That's why the students laughed.<eos> - Ah, ok, that's why.<eos> - That is why.<eos> It's incredible, you experienced a historic moment and you didn't appreciate it at all.
I've told you that it's a private matter.<eos> But if you must know...<eos> With your permission.<eos> I've come to give this cameo to a native woman here.<eos> The other day a soldier died, Rafael Ríos, and on his deathbed... I promised him I would do it.
It wouldn't be good to be constantly losing phones so every time that one enters or leaves, it gets registered.<eos> You know how it is, when the big boss is around - we all become very professional.<eos> - Well there shouldn't be any problem finding out whose number it is.<eos> Here we are.<eos> That phone was signed out by Salvador a few months ago and he hasn't returned it.
Delicious!<eos> Thank you.<eos> 85% cocoa, that's the trick.<eos> and I make them with oat bran, something that's not so bad for His Lordship.<eos> You look repellant in that apron and you've been wearing it too long.
a very clever flower.<eos> Think about that.<eos> I think there might be a garden here, after all.<eos> Arthur's book, it's gripping.<eos> Where did you get it?
Look after it, it's the only one I've got.<eos> i am amazed you trust me with it.<eos> So am I.<eos> I bet even Arthur would have been daunted by this garden.<eos> No, he would have relished it.
Thank you, again.<eos> The pleasure, Miss Brown, is all mine.<eos> I am so honored you gave me that book.<eos> Now I know the story.<eos> No, I only lent it to you.
I am so honored you gave me that book.<eos> Now I know the story.<eos> No, I only lent it to you.<eos> When I'm pushing up the daisies, then you can have it.<eos> In that case, I don't want it.
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?<eos> Always another level.<eos> I'll take my chances, sweetheart.<eos> Follow the blood arroyo to the place where the snake lays its eggs.<eos> You have it now.
Okay...<eos> Well, thank you, sheriff, you did a great job.<eos> You know, there's a lot of crazy stories about this island..<eos> Some true... most not.<eos> You know, somebody embellishes an old tale and credits it to natives, and you got yourselves the truth.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I definitely got to get me one of those.<eos> Maybe you can get one for your pops, too, for his birthday, so he can keep an eye on you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Maybe I'll get him one with a joystick, too, so he can shove it up his ass.
Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Uh, a DUI checkpoint, sir.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Who authorized it?
Oh.<eos> You motherfuckers, I'm gonna kill you both.<eos> The tracking App.<eos> The pin will tell us where her phone's at.<eos> They would have turned it off after she called.
Of course he had a burner.<eos> His personal cell phone is missing.<eos> He got rid of it.<eos> Any number of reasons.<eos> Or somebody took it.
For Silver, that text is as good as a signed suicide note.<eos> Suicide solves a lot of problems on the tenth floor.<eos> Two dead cops, friends.<eos> One a hero, one a criminal overcome with remorse.<eos> They'll call it a suicide, but we both know it's not.
He's as much in the dark as I am about what you're up to.<eos> I got a friend who works out at a gym near PAB.<eos> He says that Irving's in there every day at lunch.<eos> Hitting the heavy bag.<eos> Wearing it out.
The surviving officer's cooperating.<eos> She's given a statement.<eos> She has?<eos> According to her,<eos> Nash planned your husband's murder, and she and his accomplices carried it out.
So you just laid down on it.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - Fuck that, no choice.<eos> And what about his real name?<eos> Did you ever get it?
No, it makes me a survivor.<eos> And there's gonna come a day when you wish you were too.<eos> Here.<eos> You flip the solenoid, saves you the trouble of rewiring it.<eos> I take it back, Raymond.
Kaan amp; Asycophants, huh?<eos> Monica, Monica, Monica.<eos> Oh, you'd be so much more handsome without these warts and goiters. You should really have them removed.<eos> And let's talk about how sad it is that you're here pursuing business that you're never gonna get.<eos> Ah, well, you know, we just wanted to see the place before you raped and pillaged it.
Can I see it?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Cool!<eos> Where did you have it?<eos> Mom brought it to me from Vienna.
Look, bro, I haven't talked to my mom in a year.<eos> I don't know where she's living, or if she's living.<eos> A few months ago my dad got in touch with me... started sending me money.<eos> Sending you money where?<eos> Well, I didn't have my own address, so he sent it to his place.
Fiberglass hull, obviously.<eos> It's hard to tell the model with all this damage.<eos> Maybe mid '80s or early '90s?<eos> A Bertram or, I don't know, maybe an Albemarle.<eos> - You ever seen it before? - Me?
[Leonard Nimoy] I rarely turned down any paid engagement.<eos> I'd seen many of my actor friends go to work on a series for a few years and live up to the level of their income, and then when the series was canceled, they were once again looking for work<eos> with no steady income and no money in the bank.<eos> I made a private pact with myself that this would never happen to me and my family.<eos> So every time I was offered a paid appearance, I took it.
"Yes."<eos> Four days later, on a Friday evening, the lawsuit settled.<eos> My lawyer came to my house with a check.<eos> An hour later, the script arrived.<eos> I sat down and read it through that night.
Why the fuck are you cutting my drugs?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> We're not gonna play this game.<eos> You ungrateful piece of shit!<eos> I gave you a job when you needed it most, and now you're fucking me?
- Go!<eos> Over here!<eos> Glenn! Glenn!<eos> Can you get the gate?<eos> Appreciate it, pal.
Almost 3 months ago.<eos> He was volunteering at farms through a few different programs.<eos> At least I knew he was getting food and a safe place to sleep.<eos> Have you sent him any money?<eos> He wouldn't accept it, if we did.
-I've got this incredible job.<eos> -What is it?<eos> -I can't really talk about it yet.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -If I'm... If I'm lucky, you hear about it soon.
Charly!<eos> Me too.<eos> - Listen.<eos> There's been a change of plans.<eos> Hulk will explain it all to you.
You have to give them the code for the formula.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> OK, no problem.<eos> Anyway, the file on the server's empty.<eos> I never transferred it.
I'm king of the ship!<eos> That's not the line, asshole!<eos> I fucking deserve a partnership, Marty. You know that!<eos> You "deserve" it?<eos> I do fucking deserve it. - Guys, guys...
I do fucking deserve it. - Guys, guys...<eos> - Yes!<eos> Do you know what the word "deserve" means? - Guys...<eos> - Yes, I do!<eos> It means you fucking earned it. - Fuck you!
And you have shit on your blouse.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thank you so much. Excuse me.<eos> Hey, remember when that crazy girl stabbed you in the leg?<eos> I will cut your dick off and I will stir my champagne with it.
Nadia's baby is teething.<eos> Have you ever heard a Russian child scream?<eos> All the time, in my Putin nightmare.<eos> Look, get Cece to sign the loftgreement.<eos> Nick wrote it, so he'll like that.
- Oh, how funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Miss Dunhill is our new librarian.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Hi. I was reading, and I left my bag, and he so thoughtfully returned it to me.
Put that down, that's my...<eos> Hey, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?<eos> Excuse my language, Miss Mimi.<eos> I got the equipment all lined up.<eos> Sergeant Pete's bringing it over.
Wukong...<eos> Wukong<eos> I was just left with no choice to do that<eos> Are you going to use this incantation to keep me under control?<eos> As long as you don't kill the innocent I won't use it anymore
I've brought a small gift for my godson.<eos> Oh, that's kind of you, George.<eos> Papa!<eos> Look, my very own horse!<eos> Uncle George bought it for me.
I'd really like to think I was right considering you for Managing Partner.<eos> Christine...<eos> Call accounting, and get a record of all the hours we billed for XHP last quarter.<eos> Got it.<eos> Get it for the entire year.
-Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.<eos> -What?<eos> Barbara Holland's car.<eos> Seems she ran away after all.<eos> Staties found it late last night at a bus station.
Get back here!<eos> Get back here, you little punks!<eos> Good gift for a college student...<eos> Well, thank you for your time.<eos> We appreciate it.
Fuck.<eos> "Fuck" is right.<eos> I have Nina Totenberg and Tim Phelps asking me about Clarence Thomas and sexual harassment.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Did they say who leaked it?
We can take the vote today, but you'll lose.<eos> Clarence, it's Jack.<eos> It's not that they don't want to vote for you. They just don't feel they can with all the heat they're getting on this thing, so we need to delay the Senate vote and hold a hearing.<eos> Air all this out. Get these votes back.<eos> The only way the Senate will approve a delay is if you ask for it yourself.
- No!<eos> By mutual agreement, they say.<eos> That is bullshit.<eos> The deposition is going into the written record, so the senators will know what she said.<eos> If they read it, which they won't.
I was talking to the head counsel of g.E., and they're looking for a new head of h.R.<eos> I can put in the word if you want it.<eos> Is there s-- is there some reason I can't keep doing my job?<eos> No. What do you mean?<eos> I heard about a position, so I presented it.
Last night was incredible.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> I'll get back to you about Tuesday.<eos> Forgot my phone.<eos> Did you leave it upstairs?
Take it in all the way.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, I miss you already.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> You gave it to me. What's the problem?
Have you seen the video?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, I uh, She's gotta get out of her, I tried... I-I did try.<eos> But she's... I think she's in shock, and to be honest with you, I-I don't think she sent that email.<eos> Oh, no she sent it.
You need anything?<eos> Water, coffee?<eos> - No, I'm good. - All right.<eos> And thanks for making the time.<eos> - I really appreciate it.
I just dealt with it.<eos> So you don't have a job at Kirkland anymore, how is that my problem?<eos> You have connections.<eos> Go out and get another job and stop blaming me.<eos> You recorded us having sex, and you used it against me.
- Fuck you.<eos> I'd like for you to read your poem, Ezekiel.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather not.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because, I didn't write it.
I'm always happy, Stan.<eos> Sadness is for suckers.<eos> Come on, we'll get an egg cream.<eos> But, Ms. Green, your poetry contest was poetry writing, not poetry reciting.<eos> So, you did write it.
Do you think that they took on the burden of raising you just so you could drop out of school? Be dead, be in jail by the time you turn 21?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -You don't know.<eos> Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you really didn't write this poem.<eos> I wrote it.
It's in the Ambassador's residence.<eos> What's in there, sir?<eos> Is it really that important?<eos> In a safe, there's Khaled al-Asiri's cell phone.<eos> Jamal gave it to us.
"I hand you the magic, Grasshopper."<eos> "Do not underestimate the crayon."<eos> Look at Dizzee.<eos> "You must solve the mystery as one."<eos> What the fuck are you looking at it like that, bro?
And the only mystery I know is how your ass fell for that shit.<eos> Hey, yo. Chill out, both of you.<eos> Grandmaster's real.<eos> I'm real.<eos> This crayon, I don't understand it yet, but it's real.
No, no, listen.<eos> We record our own demo.<eos> You work your magic.<eos> You make Mylene great.<eos> And then we sell it to Asheton.
- Cadillac's paying me to dump it.<eos> - Fuck that motherfucker.<eos> I know. I know, I know.<eos> But it's good money.<eos> We dump it come nightfall, we get paid.
- Shao didn't know, right?<eos> Close that shit.<eos> That body turns up anywhere but on the inside of that trunk...<eos> Cadillac gonna make sure we all gonna be the next ones stuffed in there.<eos> The cops find it? Gonna lock us up regardless whether we did shit or not.
No, no, no.<eos> No, it's all very clear to me now.<eos> Francisco said you wouldn't accept the money from him.<eos> And... we need the money, Ramon.<eos> He said I should put it in the collection a little at a time.
No, no, no, tío.<eos> I want this. I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.<eos> Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be at Marrakesh, same as Misty.<eos> I trust you to protect me and Jackie to guide me.<eos> I'll let you write the contract and I'll sign it, but we wanna be at Marrakesh.
And I love him.<eos> - Ugh.<eos> - I think.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You love his dick and all the pretty dark hair that surrounds it.
I totally forgot.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Um, listen, some... - some things came up, so...<eos> - So nothing.<eos> This space is exactly what you've been looking for and they've got someone ready to snap it up if you don't act fast.
Then why'd you buy them that big fucking dog to make them like you more than me?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I didn't buy that dog.<eos> That's Diane's birthday dog. Do you remember?<eos> She asked me to take care of it.
Uh, yeah, payroll would have that.<eos> - Yeah, and you work in payroll.<eos> - No, I work with payroll.<eos> - I don't work in payroll. - Can you just get it for me?<eos> Payroll's gonna ask what you need it for.
Lightly. Lightly used.<eos> Well, that's the policy on returned workout equipment, 'cause I guess people sweat on it or something.<eos> I didn't even take the Zero Runner out of the box.<eos> A lot of people don't.<eos> They see it on TV and they get overambitious, but, you know, that thing is not a toy.
You'll regret this abuse of power!<eos> Now go beddy-bye.<eos> Nobody listens to my advice, too bad for you all!<eos> Use mine.<eos> Not sure I have any minutes left, I just use it for music.
Some ill-intentioned folks, probably Romanians or Africans, have stolen our purses with all our money, ID, and credit cards...<eos> Everything.<eos> So I was thinking what I could do is leave you our car registration here, and come back tomorrow to settle everything.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> We're going to get it now and will bring it back here, in the meantime, give our compliments to the chef who never ceases to amaze, it was wonderful!
I need to make one more bet.<eos> Do you have your 20 euros still?<eos> You blew it all?<eos> Give me the money I handed you before,<eos> I'm the one who took it!
- Everything okay, ma'am?<eos> - Yes...<eos> Don't worry, leave me alone.<eos> Let me come up for a minute.<eos> Renato said to give it to me.
- Yes...<eos> Don't worry, leave me alone.<eos> Let me come up for a minute.<eos> Renato said to give it to me.<eos> Give it to her?
Yeah.<eos> Petey Piranha and King Boo ride together in this multiplayer game.<eos> - "Mario Kart: Double Dash!" - Correct!<eos> I totally remember that game.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't remember it fast enough.
All right.<eos> What's it about?<eos> A high school girl gets put on hospice care the day before her prom.<eos> It's a great premise, but it's all I got.<eos> Okay, what if her friends bring the prom to her and have it at the hospice?
Hi.<eos> Uh, can I get you a robe?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'd throw on my dress, but your roommate tore it in half like a phone book.
- What?<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes, of course, there are still a few details that we need to work out, but consider this deal as good as done!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Now Jade wants to tweet it out so the blogs pick it up, is that cool?
- Yay, us.<eos> Of course, now she wants a rematch, so let's step up our game today.<eos> We'll do that.<eos> Ooh, and I did see the press release.<eos> Gawker even picked it up.
[Thad and Kelsey laugh] I just heard an amazing pitch from a psychologist, actually, whose book is basically a guide to your 20s.<eos> Well, you'll have to let me know the release date.<eos> I've got a 19-year-old I want to scare straight before he starts a nonprofit.<eos> [chuckles] I sent the sample chapter to Thad.<eos> - You'll send it to him?
Uh-huh.<eos> Give me. "While strolling Bedford Avenue, "a few girls noticeably tousle their hair.<eos> "One waves longingly from across the street, "but he maintains that for now, his heart only belongs to Inkburg."<eos> [sighs] Well...<eos> I mean, he didn't write it.
That is one of the things I love most about you.<eos> That's me.<eos> - Guys? - Whoa!<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Please, I'm not made for roughing it.
- There it is.<eos> Hey, shooter..<eos> Shoot the ball, shooter!<eos> He's gotta shoot that.<eos> - I know you're only passing it 'cause you're scared.
I really think that we should check that out, you know.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Okay. Yeah, you're right.<eos> You see, the package has cried itself gently to sleep.<eos> I can't take it!
I brought it up 'cause I was thinking about Seth.<eos> Remember Seth Buckley?<eos> On one hand, dude is super smart with policies and politics, but in his personal life, he just can't...<eos> he can't take a hint. You obviously hate him. And he keeps pestering me for your phone number, so I told him don't even worry about it.<eos> I didn't give it to him.
You don't have to be shy.<eos> Seriously, I-I-I'd really like to get to know you.<eos> Really?<eos> Here's something that I learned from our relationship.<eos> When you feel a knot... you take a deep breath and you stare at it and face it without fear or judgment.
Marie: Did you look at any schools closer to home, maybe?<eos> Well, the thing is that, um, even if I had a good scholarship or whatever, I would...<eos> I would still have to take out loans, and then that would affect both of us, because we would be raked over the coals for the next 70 years.<eos> Right, so, um, we just wanted to know if you wanted to give us a loan, actually.<eos> Instead of going through the bank, right, so... We would pay it back quickly, because we're both really good at what we do, and-and we just kinda wanna avoid all the interest, you know, and-and the bank foreclosures, or whatever, destiny foreclosures or whatever.

- Well, why didn't you? Because.<eos> Because you wouldn't have wanted me to, and-and money means nothing to him, Nick. I don't need money.<eos> I don't need your dad's money.<eos> Okay, then we won't...<eos> We won't take it then.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill?<eos> Seen a few showdowns in my day.<eos> A greyhound is a racing dog.<eos> Spends its life running in circles, chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit.<eos> One day, we took it to the park.
the dog spotted a cat.<eos> I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt.<eos> He ran.<eos> Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running.<eos> Until, at last, he finally caught it.
He ran.<eos> Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running.<eos> Until, at last, he finally caught it.<eos> And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.<eos> Tore it to pieces.
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some... some threat to me.<eos> I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.<eos> My sister probably picked you for the same reason.<eos> I earned my place.<eos> Nobody handed it to me.
He's a senior advocate.<eos> He's been asked to defend you.<eos> I've been asked to, but I don't particularly want to.<eos> Then why don't you go home?<eos> Because your case is so bad, no one else will take it.
Did you bring him?<eos> Where is he, boy?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm an evil genius hiding a relay.<eos> Where the fuck do I hide it?
I work at the practice opposite, on the expressway.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Which lump of concrete was it?<eos> It's gone now.<eos> The morning barge took it.
Two or three days is OK.<eos> But this...<eos> It's been two weeks now.<eos> Even if you don't pay, they can't cut off the gas.<eos> - They haven't cut it off.
I can imagine.<eos> But I can't talk about it right now.<eos> I have to go into work.<eos> Wha... what was that video?<eos> Why did you send it?
Uh, oh, no, no, no!<eos> Last meeting didn't go as expected?<eos> When I was eight and Sean was nine, our father locked us in our room.<eos> Told us there was only one candy bar.<eos> Said whichever one of us was still standing in an hour got it.
Or what our-our daughter's life would be like if this happens?<eos> So we win. Let's say we win, okay?<eos> Great, we win.<eos> Monica's bleeding out. We've pounded Skip into a fine dust. Then what?<eos> We mix the dust and the blood, put it a goblet and drink it.
Yeah.<eos> Ron, can I have a word please?<eos> They can't really do this, can they?<eos> I think they just did.<eos> You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman, and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal," but you took it anyway because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life?
But I'm owning my mistakes. - Oh.<eos> - I am staying positive.<eos> Enough about me.<eos> Let's take a look at that contract.<eos> I would red-line it, but... I'm not allowed to have a pencil.
No, Mama, not...<eos> I'm not talkin' about that. I'm...<eos> I'm talkin' about the work I do.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> I just don't think I got it in me anymore.
Not that boy's fault your dumb ass splitting eights on a 10.<eos> Gimme your fuckin' lighter.<eos> I already gave you my lighter, Credence.<eos> You know, that blue one that I...<eos> You'd have gave it to me, I wouldn't be fuckin' askin' for it!
You know, that blue one that I...<eos> You'd have gave it to me, I wouldn't be fuckin' askin' for it!<eos> - Man, fuck.<eos> - Give me your fucking lighter.<eos> You got it, man. What's the matter with you?
Our factories make the finest paper in the world.<eos> 100 years of product development, Finnish pulp, blah-blah-blah...<eos> What do you think you should make?<eos> - Shit paper.<eos> People will always need it.
Now you can calculate how much you need to make a month - so that you could pay off your debt in, let's say, five years.<eos> That looks doable.<eos> - The interest isn't included yet.<eos> The annual interest rate of this quickie loan is really high.<eos> I took it in an emergency situation.
I was taught how to be organized with money.<eos> I had to vacuum the house and mow the lawn for my allowance.<eos> You can imagine that the lawn was pretty big...<eos> I mean...<eos> You want me to massage it?
- I haven't bought anything.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> It must be super expensive.<eos> It's our money.<eos> - I thought you bought it.
Thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Are you going to give it to your dad?
Bits of this and that.<eos> Do you have many friends?<eos> I have a lot of classmates.... ...from when I went to school.<eos> Do you remember the first big fire you were involved with?<eos> Yes, but it's hard to describe, if you haven't experienced it.
Yeah.<eos> On-set teacher.<eos> - For the show, um...<eos> - Witchita.<eos> - Have you heard of it?
They got fuckin' conviction.<eos> They know somethin' about somethin' that I ain't figured out yet.<eos> Well, you got this place and... that's something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The "Versailles of northwest Arkansas" is what I call it.
Right, right.<eos> Junkyard dog...<eos> Oh, someone who's gonna be ferocious in court.<eos> Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court.<eos> I prepare the case, I don't present it.
Court rise.<eos> Just walk.<eos> Say nothing.<eos> The trial took an extraordinary turn...<eos> Why did Rampton drop it?
Yeah.<eos> Just to say we've been told to expect the verdict on Tuesday.<eos> On Tuesday?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You know, I don't think they'd have said it unless it were true.
It was your book.<eos> Your book held up in every aspect.<eos> Every aspect.<eos> Every detail.<eos> We defended it.
I'm complimenting you.<eos> You got a gift.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Yeah 'cause...<eos> You don't really use it with us.
Are you listening?<eos> Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.<eos> Did you buy the car?<eos> Antoine's old one.<eos> Mom bought it.
Here, back then, owning a car...<eos> But he worked.<eos> It was his car.<eos> It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.<eos> Sunday mornings, he washed it.
But he worked.<eos> It was his car.<eos> It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.<eos> Sunday mornings, he washed it.<eos> Washed the hell out of it.
My... Yeah? And I think that's what we... why our relationship is good.<eos> It has its, of course, it has its moments, when he has to get up at six and he wants his friend to say, "OK, sleep until ten."<eos> I'm, like, "No, gotta get up at six." He's like, "NJ!"<eos> I didn't set the mark.<eos> You set it.
Nurse, come-- come over here.<eos> Look on him with eyes of mercy, give him patience under his affliction, and, in thy good time, restore him to health.<eos> And enable him to lead the residue of his life to thy fear and to thy glory.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I took a vow to keep it flying, and I damn well will!
Good job for a loner.<eos> Now, are you sure I can't get you an orchid to take home?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'd just kill it.<eos> - You can have more time if you need it.
All right, Evan, baby. Get a broom so we can get up these pine needles.<eos> I can't.<eos> I told Eric that I'ma hang with him for a little bit.<eos> But you love decorating the tree.<eos> I know. But when y'all mess up, then I get to fix it.
And it's just so nice how it just, you know, shapes your face real nice.<eos> Thank you, Lonnie. I appreciate that.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Thank you. Yes, indeed.<eos> It's like you did a big-ass peach and a big-ass wig and you put that wig on top of that peach, and you drape it the same way.
Yeah.<eos> You want to put your number in my phone?<eos> And I'll just send it to you when I get off?<eos> Okay, I'll put my number.<eos> Okay, put it in.
There was a time when we used to talk about moving to St. John, or some other tropical island, opening up a dive shop, living the rest of our lives in paradise.<eos> Some real Hemingway-type shit.<eos> And that picture was a reminder of why I do-- why we keep doing what we're doing.<eos> You're just taking these risks, and making easy money the hard way, but...<eos> I can't keep doing this shit forever. So if there's even the slightest chance that I can make that stupid fucking pipe dream a reality, I'm going for it.
- Ah.. Who is the groom?<eos> - Arun the cruel.<eos> Ah, is it his name?<eos> His full name is arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.<eos> But we keep it short.
Bend your knees.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now imagine... there's a big tree in front of you.<eos> Do you see it?
Yeah.<eos> - It's made out to you?<eos> - Yeah. I don't understand.<eos> Well, I, um..<eos> I came up the idea for a game and I sold it.
Ain't much of a choice, Joni.<eos> Why can't we just ask Ruth about the money?<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> How would you explain it to her?<eos> - The same way you explained it to me. - Mm-mm.
The money, where is it?<eos> Don't fucking lie to me, son.<eos> Point to it.<eos> Clever little nigger.<eos> I didn't steal it from nobody.
He soaks the sheets with sweat at night.<eos> He has waking nightmares.<eos> He'll have a burst of anger and then, like that, he's fine.<eos> It sounds like he's having a period of readjustment.<eos> We see it with a lot of vets.
- Where'd you even get this?<eos> - Get what?<eos> - His diary.<eos> - No, that's a song book, my friend.<eos> His sister found it, gave it to me.
That we're not afraid?<eos> Maybe it is. I mean, look at us.<eos> We did get away.<eos> We won.<eos> Maybe we didn't kill the dragon, but we definitely tamed it.
I... I... I like this town, but everywhere she went it was like she saw something that she wanted to forget.<eos> I wouldn't have pictured you and Ali to be the ones to stay.<eos> Different reasons, same results.<eos> You got your degree, didn't you?<eos> Took a while, mostly nights, but I got it.
Ezra?<eos> You okay?<eos> Were you working on the last chapter?<eos> It's finished.<eos> Do you want me to read it?
You work shifts and studies.<eos> How should I pay when I don't get paid the same as a man?<eos> I solder the same metal gadgets and must pay the same bills.<eos> Right now it is about the children's best interests.<eos> Next time you can't cope with the task, the state must do it for you.
Come with me.<eos> You, too.<eos> The principal shall have a terrace.<eos> Soil must be raked off, gravel laid and tiles on.<eos> If there is even a tiny edge, you have to make it all over.
They beat him almost to death.<eos> After three days he had still not woken up.<eos> Even Mrs Oskarson was becoming worried.<eos> It didn't help that I got my eternity note.<eos> I had been waiting for it for four years but it was not as I had expected.
- Oh, okay.<eos> Did you guys see a phone?<eos> - Did it have a case? - No.<eos> Caseless.<eos> I haven't seen it.
- Yeah, we need a Lady Luck.<eos> - The more the merrier.<eos> I'll be your Lady Luck.<eos> But I really wanna find my phone.<eos> And I'm actually kind of feeling like I left it in my house.
- The more the merrier.<eos> I'll be your Lady Luck.<eos> But I really wanna find my phone.<eos> And I'm actually kind of feeling like I left it in my house.<eos> Like, I did not even bring it here to begin with 'cause I'm chill and I wanna unplug.
You wanna know what your Uncle Greg does for a living?<eos> - What?<eos> - I make every candy in the whole world.<eos> No, he's not your Uncle Greg.<eos> If you've tasted a candy, I made it in my kitchen.
And I leave my phone here because my mom tracks me.<eos> As if I can't be trusted!<eos> Here's the genius part.<eos> I strapped the phone to the dog's collar, so your mom will think you're moving around.<eos> Why don't you hold it and move around?
You're up next, buddy.<eos> Jackson and I will be cheering you on.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I'm not going out there, Mom.<eos> I need my super-magic scarf, but Aunt Stephanie took it.
Take her to the zoo.<eos> -Hey, everybody!<eos> Dad, you don't have to ring the doorbell.<eos> It is your house.<eos> I wasn't ringing it, I was, uh, cleaning it.
How does our new, very expensive quad look?<eos> Uh, don't know yet.<eos> It's still in the box.<eos> Let me know when you get it up and running.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'm not paying for it.
- Get in.<eos> - What is it you expect me to do?<eos> - You're gonna fix me.<eos> Tell me... who were you stealing this pin from?<eos> Why did you want it so badly?
Two in the hole.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Two cards in the hole.<eos> No, nothing's going in my hole.<eos> I don't know what game this is, but we're not gonna play it today.
"Not goddamn Cyrus."<eos> He's a character.<eos> I love him, though.<eos> Hates the fact that I don't whup my kids.<eos> Hates it.
"Fine."<eos> I don't know what wheelchair shit is, people.<eos> I have no idea what wheelchair shit is.<eos> True story.<eos> I went out, I bought a handicapped sign, I put it in the driveway.
"Let me get a caramel macchiato.<eos> "Caramel macchiato.<eos> "Light ice.<eos> Not heavy.<eos> "If it's heavy, I'm not gonna drink it.
Oh, I did.<eos> The dress was delivered today.<eos> Yeah, right, just in time.<eos> It's... (SHARON GIGGLES)<eos> I'll wear it tomorrow.
Martin's sure gonna miss you, Vera.<eos> - Shut your face, Gitty!<eos> - Martin, watch your mouth.<eos> Martin, this chicken's delicious.<eos> - Where'd you buy it?
- Is this it?<eos> What is this place?<eos> It used to be a restaurant.<eos> But the new owner lives abroad, so it's almost always empty.<eos> So, in the end, no one uses it.
It's called a blue-ringed octopus.<eos> - A blue-ringed octopus. - Yes.<eos> It has the same poison as a puffer fish.<eos> You're safe if you don't eat puffer fish but this critter bites.<eos> So be sure not to touch it.
So tired.<eos> An octopus arrived today.<eos> Some strange octopus.<eos> An octopus?<eos> It's poisonous and lethal so don't touch it.
- Leslie Nielsen?<eos> Wesley Snipes.<eos> (laughing) You said Leslie Nielsen.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Nobody heard it.
There was an old friend there, who came to tell me that my job is done.<eos> And this place... where are we?<eos> It's a waiting room between life and death.<eos> I am being called.<eos> No, Abbie, we began this journey together, we will end it together.
Look, if the U.S. attorney is really coming, maybe it's better if we don't make you more of a target.<eos> And more important, Garth Sykes from flagship.<eos> Hated seeing you on the cover of the post with that goddamned oceanfront mansion.<eos> Teachers in that pension fund make 40 grand a year.<eos> People who have it spend it.
And more important, Garth Sykes from flagship.<eos> Hated seeing you on the cover of the post with that goddamned oceanfront mansion.<eos> Teachers in that pension fund make 40 grand a year.<eos> People who have it spend it.<eos> People who don't have it like billies better who spend on other folks.
Keep working.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're treating this article like it's a warrant.<eos> Somebody wanted to hurt Birch, and they wanted us on the ass end.<eos> So they leaked it.
Mid-size firm, has a big distribution contract with that bakery company Yumtime.<eos> Been holding 50.<eos> Fundamentals are solid.<eos> I don't see the short play.<eos> I don't need you to see it.
there can be only one.<eos> I don't blame you, Ken.<eos> I'd do the same thing.<eos> But I'm up 32% this year, which, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.<eos> Well, you can call it what you want, but I call it "careful."
- What's the address?<eos> - Only sent it to you<eos> And while I remember.<eos> I just read your report<eos> Hopefully you just sent it to me?
We were on the right track<eos> And then those arseholes from Reykjavík show up<eos> You only sent the report to the commissioner<eos> They'd have just sat on it<eos> They would have killed it and no one would've known
Let's start from the beginning. What happened in 2008?<eos> Did Dad just come to you and confess the murder?<eos> No, it just happened<eos> And it had to be you?<eos> You couldn't let someone else handle it?
So what took you so long?<eos> Well, if I knew you felt like that, I'd have come sooner.<eos> Look...<eos> I want you to take your prenatals, get good rest, bring the baby to term.<eos> When you have it, give it to Hakeem, and... I'm-a give you ten million dollars.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about working here at Bijou.<eos> Is there anything I can do around here?<eos> Melea, you're too late.<eos> The lady who just left, uh, Miss Lee, she's thinking of buying the place.<eos> Well, you're gonna sell it?
From that moment on, music was my life.<eos> Through the music, I was able to find ways to express all my angst and frustration and insecurities and actually reclaim my voice.<eos> [Mike] Four of us decided to move into this two-bedroom apartment.<eos> It was probably like... five hundred square feet between two floors.<eos> [Steve] The space was small, so we cleared it out and we threw in as many people as we could.
And releasing my album one week before.<eos> I just can't believe this is real.<eos> I've been touring nonstop lately.<eos> So the hardest part is carving out enough time to finish my album.<eos> [Steve] And when you sing it, imagine...
Everyone down on the ground.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> How much you got?<eos> I-I almost got it.<eos> I almost got it.
We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.
Easy now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> These are the M80 firecrackers that ShotSeeker picked up a half an hour ago.<eos> See how precise?<eos> ShotSeeker picked up the sound, located it correctly, and identified it as firecrackers.
It's a decoy, Ms. Groves.<eos> A fake.<eos> Samaritan planted this decoy on Carrick's computer to frame him for Krupa's murder.<eos> How adorably ruthless and elaborate.<eos> Carrick has done this sort of thing before in Ecuador, so it's more than easy to assume he did it here.
Be a dear and wake me up when you're done asking the same question.<eos> How do you shut it down?<eos> There's nothing in my lapel, John.<eos> No, but you've got a kill switch in here somewhere.<eos> You wouldn't trust anyone but yourself with it.
Now we have to confine the outbreak, locate a remedy, figure out who's behind this and why.<eos> I'll stay close to Doc Mason, see if she can provide us with any clues.<eos> The lab sent Ko's test results over to the CDC.<eos> Until they can analyze the virus and locate an effective antiviral, we'll have to provide for ourselves.<eos> How do we slow it down?
Grab some guns, Sameen.<eos> You'll feel better once we shoot some people.<eos> There'd be a better way to fight this war if we hadn't closed the system.<eos> If I believed that, I wouldn't have done it.<eos> What if I said I hard-coded a little something extra into the system before you closed it for good?
Lay down.<eos> There there.<eos> Say.<eos> There is a poem about birds that I like very much.<eos> Should I read it?
Because they leave total creative control and they let everybody keep their jobs, which I know you care about, because you love these people.<eos> Good talk.<eos> The Beijing boys are here.<eos> Oh, God. No one wants Chinese coffee.<eos> Well, we're selling it.
I had become love.<eos> She doesn't talk to me now, though.<eos> She blames me for the divorce, and so she's angry at me.<eos> And...<eos> I deserve it.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I got a lot of things I'd like to say to you.<eos> Well, say it. Say it!<eos> See, you just waste time.<eos> See, I give you a gift and you just waste it!
You can save 40-50% off...<eos> Let's just say this girl was worried about my invisible side...<eos> Which she's not, 'cause she just likes to fuck.<eos> But say she was...<eos> How do I, like, show her I got it?
We're so lucky.<eos> We never thought, at this point, a baby.<eos> We have his room all ready.<eos> Yeah, of course. Have you brought the money?<eos> Yes, Abel brought it.
Well, I still have the money.<eos> Isn't that fucked up?<eos> Well, what are you gonna do with your ring and a bill?<eos> You're gonna mail it.<eos> And you'll leave a note in it saying to send it to Mandy.
Look at you, a young woman now.<eos> It's a mistake, Khatun.<eos> If you stay, there is no more suffering.<eos> All the pain of life, gone.<eos> Soon, you won't remember any of it.
I'm sorry about the violence outside.<eos> But you should know... I can't let you go.<eos> I can't.<eos> Khatun had fed me a mystery.<eos> I couldn't understand it, but I could feel it inside me.
In that time, I often doubted I'd ever met Khatun at all.<eos> But Homer never gave up.<eos> He'd seen something of the experiment.<eos> It became a quest for him to understand what Hap was doing.<eos> He took all the feeling bottled inside him and channeled it into this mission.
Hap always smelled his fear.<eos> Homer came back again and again and again, remembering nothing.<eos> But he kept trying.<eos> Some days I thought he was doing it just for me.<eos> Some days I thought he was doing it to spite Hap.
I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.<eos> Don't.<eos> And I know we're both worried about the same thing.<eos> Will we ever find the fifth movement?<eos> One of us will get it.
The rings of Saturn.<eos> They sing.<eos> That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.
They sing.<eos> That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.<eos> We will get it.
That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.<eos> We will get it.<eos> We will get it.
What if, I don't know... we change?<eos> No...<eos> We won't change like that.<eos> No way.<eos> People who want power will always try to control those who truly possess it.
There's... a lot of glass.<eos> Kind of like the space we're in now?<eos> No, the light's different and... there's a... clanking sound.<eos> Like a metallic... like silverware.<eos> Uh, the moment that I catch it, it just disappears.
I know, why do we always try to understand?<eos> The future is dark.<eos> Not dark, like, bad.<eos> Just dark.<eos> You can't see it.
Let me see your license.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> Office, this has never happened to me before.<eos> I left it on the table in my foyer.
Well, the red one was obviously the coolest and the leader so.<eos> And the hottest.<eos> Right.<eos> It's like I thought I knew what I was doing with my life.<eos> You know, like, I had a plan and I wrote it out on paper.
And the hottest.<eos> Right.<eos> It's like I thought I knew what I was doing with my life.<eos> You know, like, I had a plan and I wrote it out on paper.<eos> I didn't even put it in my phone.
No way, that's not a thing.<eos> I swear to god.<eos> I use it all the time.<eos> I say "all the time" like I get hit on all the time.<eos> In reality I've used it like seven times.
I use it all the time.<eos> I say "all the time" like I get hit on all the time.<eos> In reality I've used it like seven times.<eos> Six times.<eos> I've used it three times.
Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, you're so cute sometimes.<eos> It's endearing, don't worry.<eos> So how did cass end up keeping the apartment in the divorce?<eos> I gave it to her, like I gave her my heart.
- Where's this whiskey now?<eos> - It's safe in the mess hall.<eos> - With the guy from of mice and men and the chubby one?<eos> - I like to consider it the ranger up and article 15.<eos> - I'll have one of my guys grab it and take it over to range 15.
- It's safe in the mess hall.<eos> - With the guy from of mice and men and the chubby one?<eos> - I like to consider it the ranger up and article 15.<eos> - I'll have one of my guys grab it and take it over to range 15.<eos> - Why don't you just test it here and distribute it amongst the people?
- I'll have one of my guys grab it and take it over to range 15.<eos> - Why don't you just test it here and distribute it amongst the people?<eos> - Our building was compromised and most of the scientists were killed.<eos> The remaining ones, we sent over to ranger 15.<eos> - Well then, we'll just take it over to range 15 ourselves.
- Okay, so you want us to follow behind you?<eos> - Yes, but I'll be on foot.<eos> Can you take the whiskey?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - I need you to take the whiskey, dick and hold it with two hands.
- Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?<eos> - I just saved your life.<eos> You see the whiskey is the primary element needed to cure zombies but it requires an adequate delivery system.<eos> Kill cliff is that delivery system.<eos> It's unique blends of caffeine and vitamins creates a covalent bond shell with the viper semen, protects it, while it infiltrates the zombie cells.
- You know when I saw that video of Gene taken from one of our space satellites, I just knew that we would have to give him yet another medal of honor.<eos> Well done, Gene.<eos> What marvelous images, in the midst of a zombie apocalypse,<eos> Gene get's this incredible video.<eos> He took the crew and the camera and shot it himself.
I don't have another way to explain - once the game begins, only two paths exist.<eos> Completion and death.<eos> - Can you tell me anything else about the game?<eos> - Mm, very little I'm afraid.<eos> Only a scant number have played it but, uh, every few years or so, it always ends up back here.
Completion and death.<eos> - Can you tell me anything else about the game?<eos> - Mm, very little I'm afraid.<eos> Only a scant number have played it but, uh, every few years or so, it always ends up back here.<eos> - Uh, why do they return it?
Yes.<eos> So the radio reports you made along the way, those were falsified. Is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the mailbox?<eos> Evidence couldn't find it in aguas frias.
So the radio reports you made along the way, those were falsified. Is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the mailbox?<eos> Evidence couldn't find it in aguas frias.<eos> You sure that's where you saw it?
- What's wrong?<eos> ! Come sit down!<eos> What's wrong with the donkey?<eos> It kicked me.<eos> So I drugged it, It calms down a little.
Look, Stella, why don't you forget about boys and focus on what you're gonna do with your life?<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I mean, I have a degree in theater arts.<eos> It's crazy that I'm not using it.<eos> Oh, you're using it some.
Sit down.<eos> Desi?<eos> Stupid fucking little hammer.<eos> Why do we even have this little hammer?<eos> Because my mom gave it to me my freshman year.
Yes, Bob?<eos> Have you ruled out suicide?<eos> Uh, we haven't ruled out anything as yet at this stage, but that's an area seems highly unlikely. Yes?<eos> What makes you think the Powers Division can handle this investigation properly after the Wolfe debacle?<eos> - I wouldn't call it a debacle.
Like Mount Vesuvius or like a giant ro...<eos> What else?<eos> The lividity patterns aren't consistent with her body position at the scene of the crime.<eos> And she wasn't wearing her flight suit when she was killed.<eos> Somebody put it on her after?
Oh yeah, the knack.<eos> What's that?<eos> How do you get it?<eos> It's not a thing. It's just...<eos> You just get it.
Form fillers.<eos> Form fillers?<eos> That's how they get you.<eos> Anything you want to do in life, you got to fill out a form. And they've got forms for everything.<eos> You fill it out, it goes upstairs, and then they make you fill out a new form, just to confirm it was you that filled out the first form.
No. What?<eos> Wait!<eos> I've got an underground bunker.<eos> This tunnel leads directly to an underground chamb...<eos> I haven't dug it yet. Oh!
I care about an album doing well enough for the label to let the band do another album.<eos> They wanted the band to work, they shouldn't have sacked lead guitar.<eos> You don't need Duck.<eos> You got your deal despite Duck.<eos> And you're gonna blow it if you don't move on.
- Casper:<eos> Just a bowl.<eos> Scott:<eos> Fuck, now it's like the duck and the rabbit.<eos> Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
Not drugs, grass, and don't worry, he's in his room trying it.<eos> I told him not to smoke it here or you'd have a cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> Hey, um, uh...<eos> Are you gonna eat that last piece of sturgeon?<eos> Why, do you want it?
Hi!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you read the book I gave you?<eos> You know I did. I'm almost finished with it.
To her, you're a stooge of the oligarchy that runs this country.<eos> So why me and not you?<eos> Because she also believes that men have kept women down.<eos> Oh, Jesus, and where the hell does she find such a big poster of Che Guevara?<eos> She, uh, she got it from Allen, he went into town, he picked up a lot of books for her, and he, uh, picked up the poster.
How am I going to find out?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Maybe just take the briefcase back.<eos> How am I gonna get it back?<eos> Just say that you left it there by mistake.
Jesus, you sit here with these brilliant notions, and I carry them out.<eos> - Uh, excuse me, miss?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I left my... that's mine.<eos> I left it in there.
Look, I'll find you.<eos> Everything is good?<eos> You wired the money like you said you would, so, yeah.<eos> Everything's good, Samar.<eos> I took it back from Khaled without telling him.
Are we ready to risk our lives for that?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need to get out of the tunnels.<eos> Back to the loft.<eos> We'll wrap it up and carry it out.
File formation, bounding overwatch.<eos> Never be more than 20 yards away from cover.<eos> It might have a locator.<eos> You're just telling us this now?<eos> If they can track it, why aren't we surrounded by Redhats?
- Let's get back to work.<eos> - You guys grab the feet.<eos> I'll grab the head.<eos> I need you to track this number.<eos> Should I ask how you got it?
Welcome to he Yoknapatawpha!<eos> I practiced that all morning, which is why it will always be the yonk to me.<eos> I wanted to personally stop in and say how proud we are to have the Yonk back open and contributing to the community once again.<eos> This institution is another strong example of the progress that we are making in the Los Angeles Block, as law and order are restored.<eos> Rest assured, this place is critical in the transitional authority's long-term plans, so we will have our eyes close on it to assure that everything moves ahead as smoothly as possible.
Shoshanna, hello.<eos> Um, what... what are you...<eos> are you here for work?<eos> It's all right. You don't have to be kind to me.<eos> I know I took a spiked dildo and I frickin' rammed it right into your heart hole.
We need to nick something big or we're not gonna survive another winter here.<eos> You make it sound so easy.<eos> Never said it was gonna be easy.<eos> The ship!<eos> Where would we hide it?
"I'm not keeping up the tradition just because"?<eos> - There's no money left in the trust.<eos> - Where did it disappear to?<eos> It paid for the pageant every year.<eos> Did you borrow against it to keep your business going?
Before nightly prayers, he'd always tell me a story about a farmer and his sons.<eos> A farmer was on his deathbed and gathered his sons around to discuss the inheritance.<eos> "I would have you know that in my vineyard, there is a hidden treasure.<eos> Dig.<eos> Dig, and you will find it."
And much worse than we remembered it?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective.<eos> Spearhead, for example.<eos> In my reality, we invaded, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.
Everything's changing.<eos> Green to red.<eos> It starts here.<eos> This place...<eos> I've seen it.
Well done... Uncle loves you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop pulling...<eos> Stop pulling! I can't sell it if you mess it up.<eos> I need it as a whole big piece for BBQ.
No, a lot of fucking respect.<eos> Courtesy on Axelrod.<eos> I speak first.<eos> I answer questions first at every presser.<eos> And in the future, if I put you onto a case, you take it ASAP. And in the future, if I put you on Who's the confused dog now?
I-it's not safe.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Now, you're going to place the specimen in that case, and you're going to give it to me.
We talked about this.<eos> There are bigger fish than the SSR, and right now, they're more concerned with a breach of national security than evidence protocol.<eos> How is the accident at Isodyne a breach of national security?<eos> If the material that Wilkes stole falls into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous for the United States.<eos> Well... if the SSR has it, it's in the right hands.
Mum, we can't have you weeping all through the ceremony.<eos> Can I help crying when I'm happy?<eos> Where is my blasted handkerchief?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Let's get this dress off before I stain it.
- No, no, no, no.<eos> No, I'm not!<eos> No, I'm just trying something different!<eos> Oh, okay. What would you like?<eos> You want me to throw it in the trash?
Yeah, but I've thought about it, and, oh, no, no, she's definitely a BLOB.<eos> Kaylee gave me her number today.<eos> How long do you think I should wait before I text her?<eos> I don't know, three hours?<eos> Too late, I already sent it.
I love you.<eos> Love you, too, man.<eos> Oh, yeah, don't forget about this.<eos> My phone.<eos> I took it from Goose after Tucker knocked him out.
Well, it was your best yet.<eos> Millie...<eos> You must be careful about pushing Sir Winston too fast.<eos> Oh, it's not me pushing, ma'am, it's him.<eos> He wakes up every morning with a plan, he calls it "action this day".
You want Vernon's job.<eos> No.<eos> I want more.<eos> I want a seat on the council.<eos> She bought it?
No.<eos> I want more.<eos> I want a seat on the council.<eos> She bought it?<eos> She wasn't happy about it, but... my blood's still on the inside, so, yes, she bought it.
I'm really sorry, I tried my best and I.. and I...<eos> You didn't sell the membership.<eos> I did not sell the membership.<eos> And now you're expecting to be fired?<eos> Would it be easier if you just, like, wrote "you're fired" on a piece of paper, and left it on my desk?
He IS fuckin' awake!<eos> No! Go... go back to sleep, please!<eos> I never really believed we would find that bale of cocaine.<eos> For me, it was just one of them adventures you go on, like looking for your G-spot.<eos> You don't really believe it exists and you're not sure what to do with it if you find it.
How could you?<eos> Yeah, Mark, how could you?<eos> There she is<eos> You are imbeciles<eos> Why the hell did not they give him the money when he asked for it?
'Cause my little girl is gonna take on the world.<eos> Don't you ever tell my daughter that she is anything less than perfect. 'Course not.<eos> I was just saying, you know, I think...<eos> She has a big test this afternoon, that's all...<eos> And she'll ace it!
My name is Ben.<eos> - Hello, Ben.<eos> - Hello. Just so you know, we have a special tonight, the steak, dry-aged 30 days, Wagyu beef, mint on top, medium rare.<eos> It melts in your mouth.<eos> I had it last night and it knocked me out.
Are you finished?<eos> Uh... no. I'm not...<eos> I mean, her steak is a little bloody.<eos> So maybe we can take it back, make it well done.<eos> You want me to take it off the bill?
He's waiting.<eos> You'll address him as sir, and his wife as madame.<eos> The Treaty of Versailles forbids any other form of address.<eos> His left arm is slightly deformed.<eos> You will not refer to it or look at it.
And the Gestapo turned up at the house today.<eos> If they knew any more than that, you'd have been arrested by now<eos> - When can you do it?<eos> - I need more time.<eos> - You may not have it.
But I told the Austrians,<eos> "You got what you wanted.<eos> Stop in Belgrade!"<eos> I wrote a telegram to Vienna, "Stop in Belgrade!"<eos> They never sent it.
- Yes.<eos> - Everyone knows.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Kaiser's wife got a telegram.<eos> I'll find out who sent it.
And we are very much at the experimental stage.<eos> I attended one demonstration recently at the laboratory in Potsdam where ten disabled children were each given a red balloon to play with, and then injected in the heart with a solution of concentrated phenol.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Phenol.<eos> You probably know it as carbolic acid.
He's just asleep.<eos> - You've got somewhere to go?<eos> - An address.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> I betrayed my country, but I won't abandon it.
Get down!<eos> Enemy down. 14 to go.<eos> One more for the team.<eos> Well, it looks like your little plan didn't work out so well.<eos> You guys still don't get it, do you?
And now I've lost my husband, and you've started a new war, so go pray that the tribes will fight by your side.<eos> She is a foolish girl.<eos> Right now we have to attend to the tribes.<eos> Call them to council.<eos> Tell them you hold the throne just as you always have, until you pass it to your eldest son... Jonathan.
What's my secret?<eos> This little device right here.<eos> I just take a little blow... (Blowing) (Electronic beep) and it tells me when it's time for a little top-up.<eos> Because when I first got this, I used to ride it around 0.20, which is fucking wasted, 24/7.<eos> But now I leave it at 0.12, which is perfect.
Oh, my fuck!<eos> You got popsicle all over Lucy's car, and it was just waxed!<eos> Wipe it up!<eos> Wipe it up, Ricky! I'm opening the frigging gate. Ricky, just...<eos> Oh, you want me to wipe it up?
Lucy: Look at this!<eos> We've been going through inventory like crazy, we haven't been paid a fucking cent yet, and you still don't have the wedding money!<eos> What the fuck, Ricky?<eos> If you can't get the money back from Julian, I'll get it myself and you'll fucking regret it!
We've been going through inventory like crazy, we haven't been paid a fucking cent yet, and you still don't have the wedding money!<eos> What the fuck, Ricky?<eos> If you can't get the money back from Julian, I'll get it myself and you'll fucking regret it!<eos> I'll get it, Lucy!<eos> I said I'd fucking get it, and I'll fucking get it!
Everything's under control.<eos> No, I'm not going to calm down.<eos> This is fucking ridiculous.<eos> I need the wedding money back right now.<eos> Go get it! Do whatever you have to.
No can do, Mr. Lahey. I'm staying out of this shit.<eos> But, Randy, you don't understand.<eos> It's bad!<eos> Barb's got me by the short and curlies.<eos> She's holding a secret over me and she's going to expose it, unless I play balls with her and help her with her Julian shit...
We can finally get you a wedding dress.<eos> Hang your fucking horses, Jacob.<eos> We don't have the money yet.<eos> It's on credit.<eos> We're going to have it soon.
Hang your fucking horses, Jacob.<eos> We don't have the money yet.<eos> It's on credit.<eos> We're going to have it soon.<eos> As soon as we have it, I promise you, you're going to have the biggest, bestest, sparkliest dress in the whole of the world.
Ricky:<eos> I can't believe you're mad that I don't want greasy things involving you and some Hollywood film dummy to happen to our bed!<eos> If you're not going to be enjoying it, an you're going to be thinking about me the whole time, why are you getting all fancied up like you're going to the fucking bars?
Shit, it's time to go.<eos> Let's roll, ladies.<eos> Julian, isn't there something you want to tell Snoop.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, man, we should, uh, we should talk about the rest of the money you're going to invest, right?<eos> You know? And when you can get it to us.
Are you okay, bud? No, Mr. Lahey.<eos> What the hell's going on, Barb?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you. And I want it back!
What do you want?<eos> What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you. And I want it back!<eos> And so should you!<eos> But I don't, Barb. Don't you get it? I don't want it back.
What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you. And I want it back!<eos> And so should you!<eos> But I don't, Barb. Don't you get it? I don't want it back.<eos> You want it back?
A heron, look!<eos> - What a beautiful animal!<eos> A heron!<eos> - Your luggage?<eos> The chauffeur will bring it.
- No. - I was reading about it online.<eos> It's a treatment for nightmares.<eos> Kind of cognitive behavioral therapy.<eos> You help the person change the end of their nightmare while she's awake so it's not upsetting.<eos> So, if you don't like the end of the story, you just change it?
- Not if you keep shouting.<eos> - You're sick!<eos> Sit down and watch me.<eos> Enjoy the show.<eos> Then I might give it back.
What about Crusoe?<eos> Pango's right, we can't leave him here.<eos> Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.<eos> But I think I got a plan.<eos> Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
You told me about the experiments, remember?<eos> Your puzzle?<eos> I like puzzles.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I left it for you.
The baroness was infertile.<eos> Not experiments.<eos> A cure.<eos> She was pregnant the night of the wedding.<eos> Before they burned her... the villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it in the aquifer.
This is where you began.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You know... you look just like she did on her wedding night.<eos> The night they took her from me.<eos> The villagers cut out the fetus and threw it in the aquifer.
- Farm Station.<eos> - That's the beacon.<eos> - This belongs to us.<eos> The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
We know not to make treaties with our enemies.<eos> The Commander bows before no one.<eos> Stand down, Titus.<eos> She even prefers the enemy's language.<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.
We're working digital.<eos> What are we missing?<eos> How is the president gonna remember a number that long?<eos> Not well.<eos> Want to bet he wrote it down somewhere?
Then we're at an impasse.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> He's ready.<eos> Takes away pain.<eos> It doesn't cause it.
Holy?<eos> It's a corporate logo.<eos> Wrong.<eos> This is the sacred symbol of the Commander to whom I've dedicated my life.<eos> Now, how did you get it?
It's a corporate logo.<eos> Wrong.<eos> This is the sacred symbol of the Commander to whom I've dedicated my life.<eos> Now, how did you get it?<eos> Again, Jaha gave it to me.
This is the sacred symbol of the Commander to whom I've dedicated my life.<eos> Now, how did you get it?<eos> Again, Jaha gave it to me.<eos> This would be Chancellor Jaha.<eos> Yes. He told me it was the key to the City of Light and that if I swallowed it, the woman in red would take me there.
- So, a twist, a turn.<eos> - Every three pages.<eos> - Yeah, something big. - Uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Um, I don't want this to seem like I'm just shitting on your script.<eos> Oh, my God, I just appreciate you reading it.
- All right.<eos> So, do you both edit reality TV shows?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Kyle gave me my first job.<eos> Oh, cool. So, do you, like, hate it or...
Gus the tutor.<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay, here's what happened.<eos> He wrote a spec script.<eos> He asked me to read it.
No, it makes me a survivor.<eos> And there's gonna come a day when you wish you were too.<eos> Here.<eos> You flip the solenoid, saves you the trouble of rewiring it.<eos> I take it back, Raymond.
- A poem.<eos> "And though my soul departs the Earth, "I count my days till my rebirth.<eos> "I will wait across eternity for my love to come back to me""<eos> The knife.<eos> You gave it to me, and the inscription, it was a poem... a love poem which promises...
You know what, don't give a shit then.<eos> But at least take my money.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> There's more where that came from, Marlon.<eos> You know who wants it more than you?
Six to one on that fight.<eos> It was fucking fixed.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> I want my fucking money.<eos> - And I want it right now.
- Ethan, don't.<eos> - Listen, motherfucker.<eos> - Ethan, there's another way.<eos> You took a quarter million fucking dollars from me.<eos> - I don't have it. What can I tell you?
I don't have a wallet, it weighs me down.<eos> There, you see these?<eos> It's real.<eos> It smells, it rustles... It's been handled, it's full of germs, at the bar I buy a coffee... and I get change.<eos> I order it from the barman, or I don't, and suddenly I look out at the street and put my hand in my pocket.
So I stopped having dark thoughts.<eos> And your letter too, which helped me to understand many things.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like the pain a child can feel when he loses his mother.<eos> I got through it, but... I risked losing my life.
Joe Silverman.<eos> Joe Silverman.<eos> Exactly.<eos> He's the foster father for a few days.<eos> She hands the kid to Joe, he hands it back.
Yeah, try that out.<eos> So are we good here? 'Cause I'd like to get this done fast.<eos> We should have these bikes back right on a new rack... 33, 34 minutes. Something like that.<eos> 30 minutes?<eos> Yeah, I'm going to paint it orange too.
It's chocolate.<eos> Okay, guys, you're in for an awesome surprise.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, good to eat some real chocolate once in a while, huh?<eos> You guys earned it.
- Yes.<eos> Yeah, sure I have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what they did, they built a big wooden horse...<eos> They built a big wooden horse and placed it outside the walls to the city.
Don't sleep with her.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> It is absolutely amazing out here, Zack.<eos> How do you afford this location though?<eos> My dad left it to me.
Just throw the damn ball.<eos> - So, how was your day?<eos> - Pretty good.<eos> I've thrown various balls with six different middle-aged men.<eos> All right, stop talking, you're ruining it.
Oh! Spare me your melodramata!<eos> Marge, I can't have a baby.<eos> Coordinating our sleep schedules will be a nightmare.<eos> Plus, the only good relationship I ever had was with my hat.<eos> Then the wind blew it away.
Cthulhu!<eos> Your Spot!<eos> Your role in history is complete.<eos> I want to savour this moment, Howard Lovecraft.<eos> And I shall savour it after I gobble you up and slowly digest you over 1,000 years.
How?<eos> I won the grand prize drawin' at the reunion.<eos> I don't even remember there being a drawing at the reunion.<eos> I don't remember the reunion.<eos> But I'll fucking take it.
You can take trips home.<eos> "We."<eos> Did I miss us having a conversation about this somehow?<eos> We bought the boat together.<eos> We designed it together.
"We."<eos> Did I miss us having a conversation about this somehow?<eos> We bought the boat together.<eos> We designed it together.<eos> Yeah, but we skipped the part when we talk about when and how we're using it.
Yeah, but we skipped the part when we talk about when and how we're using it.<eos> You hate this idea?<eos> No, I don't, 'cause I see how much you love it.<eos> And I get why it would be a once-in-a-lifetime for them.<eos> I'm just trying it on for a sec.
No.<eos> You could think about it.<eos> We could ask for a waiver or something.<eos> And, uh, it's my money.<eos> They gave it to me when I turned 25.
Ever kill a man before?<eos> I did.<eos> - Paco, fill it in.<eos> - These fellers have stepped in the wrong pile of shit.<eos> Let's not rub it in.
There's--the only deal is you don't give me What I want, then I blow your brains across the wall, And then I'll move down, and I'll get<eos> ♪ - They didn't bring it.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - There is money.<eos> I saw it.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I sealed in the cat.<eos> If it dies, it'll stink up the whole house.<eos> Also, the kids like it.
Dollar Bill earned a $10 million bonus last year.<eos> You know how much he took out?<eos> 2 grand.<eos> You've known about this for weeks.<eos> You're bringing it up now because you wanna know something. What is it you wanna know?
The ground is shifting, and you don't even see it.<eos> Or you refuse to see it.<eos> But if this were some stock play, it wouldn't be about pride.<eos> You'd have already cut your losses.<eos> Lara, the ground is shifting because I'm the one moving it.
The police out East may have come into possession of a video of the incident taking on someone's phone, which purports to show you striking Mr. Layner.<eos> - That should cut our way.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> - How bad is it?<eos> - Well, I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told it's damning enough that they're planning on arresting you as early as tomorrow.
Each of them had a phone out.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> I fucking love when you do that.<eos> Your love is touching, but what I need right now is to find that original video.<eos> Find it, pay what we need, get it.
Not what you're looking for... yet.<eos> That's what I want to talk about.<eos> You know...<eos> There's a move.<eos> Guys try it so often, we call it the Bojangle.
What the fuck is this?<eos> That's our internal audit on Kemlot Biochemical.<eos> When Axe takes a big position on Kemlot, long, that audit is going to be a key piece of evidence proving he went against the numbers because he knew something.<eos> There is nothing that connects that document to Axelrod.<eos> Axe sent it to me.
Why would you show him...<eos> I...uh... I tell my dad everything.<eos> And when I brought that book home, I needed some advice.<eos> I knew what would happen with it, and I didn't know if I could or should be involved in that.<eos> And he convinced me to bring it in.
I gotta confess.<eos> I-I'm working on my boasts and rails with a pro. Mm. 300 an hour.<eos> But hey, at least I don't suck anymore.<eos> You want his number?<eos> You just gave it to me.
He should know the fucking risks.<eos> Right.<eos> Like he's a... haberdasher making uniforms for the Nazis.<eos> Oh, that's a big contract.<eos> Right, but you don't care if he loses it.
That was mean!<eos> You saw it was me.<eos> Maybe I don't want to talk to you.<eos> You didn't erase my number?<eos> No, I kept it in case you called, to avoid answering.
Yeah.<eos> So why didn't you run here after you found the body?<eos> I thought they might be missing her in the pub.<eos> Or was it because you thought the body was too close to your granddad's land?<eos> Is that why you moved it?
So Anne Marie texts Nicole,<eos> "Running late, be with you soon."<eos> Only the poor love makes a mistake.<eos> Instead of texting the secret phone they've been using behind your back... she texts her usual phone.<eos> And you pick it up, cos you're at home.
You know what?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I did not.<eos> This endorsement is the race.<eos> Your father saw it today... the place where Adam was kept.
Well, it's tough.<eos> For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.<eos> That's... that's how they flip most people.<eos> We have a polygraph back at the compound.<eos> Maybe we should make everybody take it.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.<eos> Sorry it didn't work out.<eos> I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.<eos> Andrew showed them to me, okay?<eos> So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
And you're gonna get tatp?<eos> I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.<eos> I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.<eos> Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?<eos> Ready when we need it.
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!<eos> This is a highly unstable substance, okay?<eos> It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!<eos> Now you want to see the video?<eos> Because I have it here on my phone!
- Who should we give it to?<eos> - Dimonda.<eos> September 11, 2001... a plane crashes into the North Tower.<eos> You short aviation stocks in the European markets making hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> And you take that money, and you call it Axe Capital.
Well, there was one more thing I was a bit curious about.<eos> You want to tell me a little bit about your time in prison?<eos> Why you went in?<eos> Who told you about that?<eos> No one told me, I just looked into it.
She seemed to enjoy ruffling feathers.<eos> Cicely is quite the tourist attraction.<eos> I can see why Zoe Dyer's dig isn't popular.<eos> Uniform have recovered her phone.<eos> They're sending it to Tech for analysis.
Ah-ah-ah.<eos> You made me suffer...<eos> And now, I shall make you suffer.<eos> And I've got such a wonderful punishment for you.<eos> You'll probably appreciate it, too.
And I'm sorry about that, Jemma, because... because maybe there was another way... and there was something else that I could've done.<eos> Will died saving me.<eos> What you did was kill a thing, a monster.<eos> You've been nothing less than extraordinary this whole time.<eos> So, um... about this... chasm, as you call it.
I want the magic word.<eos> Please.<eos> And video's intact.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't delete it.
What the fuck? !<eos> C'mon!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You locked the attic.<eos> Wh-wh-why did you lock it?
I demand that we get very fucking stoned.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Is that dress yours? - No.<eos> Crystal's.<eos> She, uh, bought it for her niece's baptism.
- What?<eos> There's three rolls of masking tape around your neck.<eos> You glued me into my clothes?<eos> Your hair came off in the sea.<eos> But it's okay, 'cause I stuck it back on...
Put down the gardening equipment, Clive.<eos> Get out of my house before I strim that stupid fucking wig off.<eos> Where's my car? !<eos> Don't tell him, Clive.<eos> Pete took it for the parade.
Time's what we need.<eos> We move at dawn.<eos> All right.<eos> We need to disable that rover.<eos> If they take it out, it doesn't matter how many Grounders they kill.
Last chance to pull out.<eos> This plan has a high probability of going south.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.
I'm a spy, Bryan.<eos> I've been passing information for...<eos> Hey, shut up.<eos> Found the bug.<eos> You put it there?
I had to save our people.<eos> I was going to save everyone.<eos> I wish you could've.<eos> Shove your regret up your ass.<eos> I had a hell of a time prying open the subassembly, but I got it.
How you lead is your choice.<eos> Here.<eos> I recognize the sacred symbol, but what is that?<eos> This is the Flame that holds the spirits of the Commanders, of Lexa.<eos> Will you take it and become the next Commander?
And you know, we're only part alien, and it's not a disease... it's an awakening.<eos> Interesting word choice.<eos> I mean, for me.<eos> Terrigenesis made me who I was supposed to be.<eos> I was given a gift, and I use it to stop bad people from doing bad things.
Pasta.<eos> You know, if I wanted to eat a giant harsh-mellow, I'd be hanging out with Vause right now.<eos> You get some power in here, they come gunning for you, darling.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Especially when they ask for their pay and you don't have it.
Hey, buddy.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I was just seeing how you're doing, you know, making sure everything's all right regarding the van or whatever. Look, it ain't my fault I got your job, okay?<eos> I got assigned.<eos> I didn't even ask for it, so...
I lead a hard life, I abuse alcohol.<eos> I'm DT'ing.<eos> I just need to get it out of my system before we start.<eos> DT'ing?<eos> Yeah, I use it sometimes.
I don't give a fuck about who's paying who.<eos> I don't give a fuck about the money!<eos> Eighty thousand pounds is a lot of money.<eos> Do you know the ritual?<eos> Shall I leave you to do it?
Drink it!<eos> Look, it's starting to congeal!<eos> Good.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> Don't throw it up.
Yes.<eos> When we're ready.<eos> So much I've put her through.<eos> Her life has been...<eos> I stopped her breath when she was Brona and gave it back to her as Lily.
Now I'm gonna go home and go to sleep, all right?<eos> - Hey, Sam.<eos> - 'Cause I am so...<eos> Oh, for Pete's sake, Meg.<eos> The desk sergeant just found it.
You do not get divorced.<eos> I'm sorry, Daddy, but no, that's...<eos> Honey, I love you, but all you know is life with me, life with Ken.<eos> You think the world just exists.<eos> It's made, by men who bend it to their will, and the women we care for either choose to live in our world, or leave it.
Oh, y-you can leave that here.<eos> I mean, if you want to.<eos> Just make yourself at home, man.<eos> Any kind of envelope, anything at all shows up at any precinct with my name on it, they need to call me.<eos> If they see who delivers it and let that person get away, they need to kick their own ass and call me.
Is it Jewish? Uh...<eos> It's... it's Ukrainian, ma'am.<eos> It's all... this is all very sad.<eos> It is, but thank you for your time.<eos> We do appreciate it.
- Coincidence, surely?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> But two incidents where both of the customers have come to harm, it could be something more.<eos> We're taking the baby food off the shelves in case there's glass in any of the others.<eos> But she's sure she got it from here, is she?
So far as my father would allow.<eos> I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Richardsons.<eos> A happy family, would you say?<eos> No more or less than any other.<eos> Leo makes money, Annette spends it.
How can you be so sure?<eos> Because there's no alternative.<eos> Lovely piece.<eos> So where's the map?<eos> Atticus Nevins bought it earlier this year, but after he pulled his Jimmy Hoffa act, every relic hunter, dealer and wannabe came to town, raided his entire collection.
You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know I had that map.<eos> But once I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it somewhere safe.<eos> So... thanks for the heads-up.<eos> Tell me you got it.
I tried to convince myself that it was just superstition talking.<eos> But you knew there was some truth to it.<eos> So you studied everything you could on the supernatural.<eos> My whole life I've been looking for proof that there is another world out there.<eos> And you... you've been living in it.
- The Prime Minister recently sent his personal attach้, Yuri Krupin, to this site.<eos> The reason ... to shut down this entire project immediately.<eos> The Prime Minister is against a sanctuary?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because his opposition supports it ... namely, the Ministers you see before you.
Dirt under the fingernails, haven't showered in a week.<eos> What did you learn from Patterson's boss?<eos> He's either totally in the dark or part of the cover-up.<eos> What about you?<eos> Well, I cloned the corporate e-mail server and sent it to Eric and Nell.
- You forgot?<eos> Oh, she forgot!<eos> Only, on one of those calls, Jamie left a voicemail.<eos> - I never received that.<eos> - Yes, you did, because yesterday you erased it.
I'm in a bit of trouble.<eos> I could do with somewhere to stay.<eos> Just call me when you can.<eos> Now, Jamie left that voicemail at 8:32am Tuesday morning, the day he was killed.<eos> And according to the phone company, you played it at 8:36am.
I could do with somewhere to stay.<eos> Just call me when you can.<eos> Now, Jamie left that voicemail at 8:32am Tuesday morning, the day he was killed.<eos> And according to the phone company, you played it at 8:36am.<eos> And then yesterday you erased it.
Why'd you do that?<eos> What trouble was Jamie in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But, whatever it was, I didn't want him bringing it here.<eos> But why did you erase it?
- What?<eos> The phone!<eos> You said you got it on eBay!<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Tell her where you found it.
My wife made that cap for...<eos> This cap..<eos> Isn't it illegal to make them work like this?<eos> The cap was donated.<eos> Who..who donated it?
Just listening to her scream.<eos> - You just left her?<eos> Tied to the bed?<eos> - In a way, yeah.<eos> I took a kitchen knife and, shoved it in her ear.
You keep killing high-profile businessmen and seizing their assets.<eos> - That's no...<eos> - You mean, traitors?<eos> Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup, but that still doesn't...<eos> Yes, because you orchestrated it.
-What did Manny say?<eos> -I got your shift, bro.<eos> -What about the car?<eos> -The Fusion.<eos> I can reset the odometer, park it in front of your place after work.
I have some calls to make.<eos> I'll come to your office after.<eos> Get me LeAnn Harvey.<eos> Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski.<eos> He owned the second-largest bank in Russia until Petrov seized it in 2013.
It's an old relationship move I call "turning into the skid."<eos> If you just play along, sooner or later Lisa will lose interest in her terrible idea.<eos> You haven't used that trick on me, have you?<eos> No, no.<eos> I learned it from observing other marriages.
Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, the residue from the bombs, it's got nitramene in it.<eos> I don't know what that is, but your tone of voice makes it sound bad.<eos> Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II.
Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II.<eos> It causes implosions.<eos> Mm. That's weird.<eos> Weird how?<eos> That they got their hands on it?
Uh, it's a liquid, so...<eos> - We could freeze it.<eos> - How?<eos> Liquid nitrogen.<eos> There's, um... we use it in the cooling jets on the containment module.
Remind me, why did I quit the law firm to be a writer?<eos> Uh, because it's your dream and in this family we follow our dreams.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, how was your day?<eos> Uh, exhausting, but I think I've got a handle on it.
Well, you better find him and fast.<eos> I own his tail.<eos> You know, I think I know where he went.<eos> All right, shouldn't take long, just keep the meter running.<eos> Charge it to Monkey Up, he'll cover it.
I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> I'm with the neighborhood watch.<eos> Did you jack that banana from the Andrews' house?<eos> Don't you lie to me.<eos> Oh, please, I borrowed it.
Oh, it is so life-like.<eos> We could sell a ton of those at the store.<eos> Oh, and we should get one for Sophie for Christmas.<eos> She's always going on about wanting a pet monkey.<eos> Where did you get it?
And can you believe someone was gonna throw this stuffy away? No, wow.<eos> Well, we can use it as a prototype.<eos> It is a little chubby, kind of like the Pillsbury Doughboy.<eos> But we can slim it down.<eos> - Can I borrow it?
No, I do not have a damn picture of a video...<eos> - Okay, I did.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, you got the crystal.<eos> I sent it early.
I just...<eos> I need a little bit more time.<eos> I won't wait forever.<eos> I know, I'll take it.<eos> I'll take it. Can I have a kiss, too'?
Please.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> It's always the traditional things that work, the bottomless sleeve hanky, the bottomless cup of coffee, the bottomless love from a mother to her kids.<eos> They know it's there.<eos> Sometimes they just take it for granted.
The girls are with me.<eos> What are you talking about, where?<eos> I love you so much, and, you know, it's just... It's hard to share, you know?<eos> Sort of like how you feel about your LEGO pirate ship.<eos> You know how you didn't want anyone to touch it?
Are you in the psychiatric wing? No.<eos> My son had an asthma attack.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry about that.<eos> Is he okay? Yeah, he's all back to normal, so I'm getting him this candy.<eos> I got you, we'll get it.
Yucky?<eos> Is that a technical legal term?<eos> You got a better word for it?<eos> Grace, I'm gonna level with you. Nobody wants your case.<eos> I drew it because I'm low man on the totem pole in a place where seniority means everything.
And I turned the corner, and right there in front of me was this church.<eos> It had this old sign out front, but it just stopped me in my tracks.<eos> And the sign... the sign said,<eos> "Who do you say that I am?"<eos> And as I read it, I could hear the Lord speak to me.
Most of the people in the rainforest try to avoid contact with the outside world.<eos> Their isolation is important for preserving their culture.<eos> It's still a good story.<eos> Paula, is your steak cooked enough?<eos> Or can I put it back on the grill?
Charles ran out to the yard to bring our daughter's toys inside.<eos> And I hear him howl like he hurt himself.<eos> I ran out - and found him on the ground covered with some kind of...crust.<eos> I took his hand... and we saw flashes -- random events, ending with a horrific car crash.<eos> He sees it, too?
Long story... though Daisy's so confident in her ability as an Inhuman, she believes - she can change the future.<eos> That's funny.<eos> We're trying to do the same --<eos> Power is intoxicating, isn't it?<eos> And he's right -- you never really feel it until you take someone else's away from them.
Don't go to prison!<eos> Over here!<eos> Over here! Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Reynolds.<eos> Mr. Reynolds, what inspired you to create a hotel full of sharks?<eos> I wanted to create the greatest hotel in the world, and with this hotel, I give it to 'em, and I achieved it with clean energy.
Will this be for logging or home use?<eos> - Lot of people recommend the Stihl 3000, but personally, sir, I say you can't go wrong with this baby.<eos> Homelite calls this one the turbo model.<eos> That's right.<eos> And when those pesky teenagers start snooping around our property, we take this bad boy and hand it over to my brother Gunnar there.
He's very loud.<eos> Mom!<eos> Seriously.<eos> Why don't we talk about money?<eos> Because I don't understand it, okay?
A day?<eos> If they've traveled north.<eos> Compass.<eos> This path cuts east.<eos> We'll follow it while the raptor covers all other terrains.
There isn't time.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Gideon!<eos> Where's Savage's money now?<eos> Dr. Boardman theorized that Savage entrusted it to the Bruemberg Group, the oldest bank in the world.
6 months.<eos> Dad, I'm sorry for all the losses.<eos> You were right.<eos> This sport has no future in India.<eos> There is a future... but you don't see it.
- No!<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Because tomorrow, it's you and me.<eos> I'm gonna break every single bone in your body.<eos> I'll pack it up and send it to your wife.
Such a subject I am for you.<eos> So full of neurosis.<eos> No, Miss, so full of pain.<eos> All of which is true.<eos> You manifest it in any number of ways so you can make sense of it.
I've barely seen it for the past year... especially in such abundance.<eos> I've been somewhat the same.<eos> Healing, in a way.<eos> Trying new things, dipping a toe into what this world offers.<eos> And how do you find it?
Of course not.<eos> - Never.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, this priceless artifact is yours.<eos> If you want it, just give me the damn crystal.
Oh, this leader of yours must be a real charmer.<eos> We don't have leaders.<eos> We're walking towards a common goal.<eos> That's what they tell you when you join a cult, but it's actually not true.<eos> Eventually, you'll get it.
And your wallet, but it was nothing personal.<eos> What the hell is that man doing?<eos> He has no idea what the core is capable of.<eos> Relax.<eos> He's the one who invented it.
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not the sentimental type.<eos> No, but your partner, the physicist with the big brown eyes, is.<eos> Turn the core back online.<eos> You will turn it back on, or I will put a bullet in your friend's head.
If I ever get my hands on you, I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV" on your ass.<eos> I'm gonna remember that, comrade.<eos> We must leave now, Colonel.<eos> There's still one more intruder, and he has the thermal core.<eos> We don't need it now.
The young blond-haired one.<eos> He knows something...<eos> So?<eos> You want a coach, don't you?<eos> What if I could make sure you get it?
Without a second thought.<eos> Love, Morse.<eos> Imagine that.<eos> So where's the money?<eos> We'll find it at Paul Marlock's.
What it could carry.<eos> Why the hell would you want to keep a tiger in here?<eos> How could he afford to feed it, for one thing?<eos> I don't think he did.<eos> I think he was keeping it for someone who could afford it.
I suspect if we were to put her in a line-up, his colleagues would soon pick out Lady Georgina as that young woman.<eos> Your sister discovered that not only was the animal that attacked her alive, but that Dr Lorenz was using it as part of his research.<eos> I think she planned to use the tiger to exact her revenge, only Goggins got careless and the animal escaped.<eos> It looks as if it was your sister who stole the tigress musk and dosed Dr Lorenz's handkerchief with it, in the hope that it would bring the animal to him.<eos> But Ingrid Hjort borrowed it.
We'll want firearms too, if it comes back.<eos> I'll need to use your telephone.<eos> There's no chance this is all some ghastly mistake?<eos> We found her bag at Goggins' place, presumably soaked in this musk in an attempt to bring it back.<eos> All the same, how do you know that Georgie put it there?
Who parked in my spot?<eos> Bastián, I need you to sign...<eos> -You want an autograph?<eos> -...something.<eos> Here, you can now sell it on eBay.
You were amazing, Mrs.<eos> -Miss!<eos> -Excuse me, Miss!<eos> We're having a cultural event and we'll have music.<eos> But, if you have any problem, I'll turn it down.
- Or you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry.<eos> - Are you talking about the bracelet?<eos> - I know you're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you!
A few months, he'll be... bu... bu... blind.<eos> Phil, stop looking at your phone.<eos> She's mmm...making me fall asleep.<eos> There's a new treatment in Prague.<eos> And they just won't do it here but... I'll try anything.
What is it for?<eos> You know... what it is.<eos> You felt its power.<eos> Really?<eos> Why did you give it to me?
Or you can take some voluntary leave until the inquiry's over.<eos> It's completely up to you.<eos> So... before I do this, I'm gonna need some kind of guaranty that you're not completely insane.<eos> Rich, I think that this bracelet's controlling my life.<eos> The woman that put it on me...
The woman that put it on me...<eos> The woman you shagged from the casino?<eos> Can we forget that a bit?<eos> Nope!<eos> The woman that put it on me said it's yin and yang.
I won that money on a crooked roulette wheel.<eos> You don't know that for certain.<eos> I know that the woman who was with me that night is a criminal.<eos> The woman who gave me this.<eos> Then why did she give it to you?
I have CCTV footage of him gambling at my casino the night my father was killed, after he called in Harry's debt.<eos> Yet, detective Clayton led the murder investigation.<eos> Where is the footage?<eos> Somewhere safe.<eos> Well, when can we have it?
Yeah, I was aware of that.<eos> Well, turns out you were right about the Kevin Grey suicide.<eos> Does the name Golding mean anything to you?<eos> Why?<eos> I got it from one of the inmates.
POLICEMAN:<eos> A package for the boss.<eos> SURI: What did you do with the money you won at the Green Dragon casino?<eos> HARRY:<eos> I burnt it.
Believe me, Eve.<eos> No-one wants any harm done to you.<eos> You're too valuable... and unique.<eos> You started all this by giving the bracelet to Clayton.<eos> Your father... never wanted you to have it.
Mr. Drake has guests, as you know.<eos> He must hear this, however.<eos> Frank, save the shoe leather.<eos> I'm sure it must be near run through, and new boots are costly.<eos> Were it not for the fact I think you'd enjoy it too much, I'd take this piece of machinery and I'd shove it up your...
It is a sight you would not forget in a hurry, not unless it was you who stuck the knife in his neck, which is the way I currently look at the world.<eos> Do you deny it?<eos> Would such denial be plausible to you, Inspector?<eos> Why don't you try me?<eos> Each night, they wipe it clean.
Our condolences for your daughter.<eos> I will take the drink, Croker.<eos> I don't think I'll trust you enough to sit.<eos> Fair enough answer.<eos> Do you have it?
Uh... I hold, along with some colleagues, the patent for the original prototype, which we designed more than ten years ago now.<eos> So, this technology is now found on volcanoes around the world, and it's revolutionized the monitoring of gas emissions from volcanoes.<eos> It's my baby.<eos> I'm really glad to see it.<eos> I haven't seen it for two years, and here it is, still working.
It exists only in a single manuscript.<eos> For Iceland, it is as important as the Dead Sea Scrolls are for Israel.<eos> The codex was given as a present to the king of Denmark by an Icelandic bishop in the 17th century.<eos> The Royal Codex, or Codex Regius.<eos> In 1971, Denmark returned it to Iceland.
Yet another reason to reconsider inheriting a psycho killer's web legacy.<eos> Hey!<eos> The Morgue is not her podcast.<eos> I'm just co-opting her listeners.<eos> Right now, I'm using it to help figure out exactly who those pranksters were.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My hands, they're in your hair right now.<eos> - I'm stroking it real soft.<eos> Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
We cannot move the body.<eos> There's drones.<eos> Stop it, Lolly.<eos> We cannot move it.<eos> If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Yes.<eos> Describe him, the orderly.<eos> Nondescript.<eos> Look at his face now.<eos> Let your eyes move over it. What do you see?
No.<eos> You think I'm a spoiled bitch.<eos> We're not to engage in conversation, Miss.<eos> What's the treatment tomorrow?<eos> They call it hydrotherapy.
the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.<eos> Or put makeup on you, or take it off.
Then they'll sedate you.<eos> Then they'll strap you to a table.<eos> Then he'll use a drill to open your skull.<eos> It's not a medical thing, it's a drill for woodwork.<eos> Then he'll put a clamp on your skull... and crack it open.
You don't want to see?<eos> - Mink.<eos> - You steal it?<eos> Got the receipt.<eos> Uh-uh, thanks, but I really don't need it.
Why didn't we do this years ago?<eos> The bank doesn't just give you money.<eos> They actually buy the house and let you live in it till you pay back the loan with interest.<eos> Or not.<eos> We need a down payment of $3,500, and we need it, like, now.
No.<eos> Why do you get the last word?<eos> If you want to go get a mortgage with your name on it, then take Carl's money.<eos> But otherwise, we'll find another way.<eos> I'll just spend it on my ride.
An alpaca farm, possible wolf attack.<eos> Could be wild wolves, but there was overkill.<eos> Better be safe than sorry.<eos> Clay and I can be on the next flight out of Syracuse.<eos> Let Jorge take it.
Not even after you've inherited your father's title.<eos> You think we're the same.<eos> Fellow outcasts.<eos> But if you could undergo this treatment... if you could have every horrific moment struck from your memory... every time your work was denigrated and you were treated like filth.<eos> If for one moment you could feel like a lamb, and not like a beast... wouldn't you do it?
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I've been thinking, perhaps we might return to our old home.<eos> I spoke to the landlord and it's available, should we want it.
Yeah, they call them Ghost Riders.<eos> Hang on one second.<eos> Hey. That's my jersey.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Coach gave it to me at practice.
Okay?<eos> If you've done something, we'll get through it.<eos> - Oh, babe.<eos> - We'll do the program.<eos> My parents did it.
The beacon we set, its signal travels far and wide.<eos> All the aberrations of evil that wander the Earth... awake... and come hither.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Guys.<eos> Oh, my cell phone, I left it on top.
Abbie.<eos> You. Mmm.<eos> You, your plan worked.<eos> Crane found me.<eos> I was trapped in this place; Pandora called it the Catacombs.
No, please, no!<eos> No luck in the land of Nod?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Or last night.<eos> I had hoped your hiatus from the FBI would help facilitate your rest, not hinder it.
Hey. You sitting down?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I am standing the length of two men, Lieutenant.<eos> For I am bringing the desert climate to our Mid-Atlantic abode.<eos> It is nonsensical, it is quite unnatural, and yet, because I want it, it is so.
During and after the Kindred failure,<eos> Franklin experimented with Kindred proxies... undead creations of bricolage soldiers that he brought to life without the Kindred's immortality.<eos> He wanted to study these beasts, so if he ever found a piece of Death that would allow him to raise the formidable Kindred, he'd know how to control it.<eos> Alas, this yielded no results.<eos> Or maybe he just hid it very carefully.
The cave in Iraq you took more than just gold.<eos> Oh, even back then I was always looking for something extra-special to sell.<eos> I managed to sneak away from my unit and what do I find?<eos> I had no idea the power I held in the palm of my hand.<eos> And then I felt it, immediately.
How are you?<eos> Well, I fought a ghoul so horrible.<eos> Come here.<eos> Nevins got away with the one document Corbin's been trying to keep from everyone for 20 years.<eos> Well, then we'll go get it back.
Daisy is not Andrew.<eos> I pull the trigger because you order me to.<eos> You're the Director.<eos> I didn't ask for the kill switch to Lincoln's vest.<eos> You gave it to me.
Save her. Oh! Is he out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I thought you had her scent.<eos> I lost it.
I left this mountain almost 10 years ago, and, yes, I was lost.<eos> I robbed, I stole, I lied, I cheated, I sinned.<eos> I lived in a building that was 500 feet tall.<eos> I communed with so-called holy men, liars, all of them.<eos> I acquired money, spent it on women and poisons.
- What?<eos> - Cami, you have to listen to me.<eos> One of the Strix witches knows where you are and she knows that you have the white oak.<eos> You're a little late, kiddo.<eos> She already took it, which means, I guess, the Strix have it now.
Didn't, didn't really make it.<eos> Hey, umm, I actually, I wanted to ask you something.<eos> Already?<eos> Why did you delete that text about Toby?<eos> You saw it?
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her phone at lunch?<eos> Yes.<eos> To prove to her that she shouldn't trust me.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> Yeah, but then you never told her that I took it.
It means that I can't help you.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Um, th-this is the truck that I was asking about.<eos> Do-do you know who drove this last night?<eos> Maybe I lent it to a friend.
I'm curious about the process.<eos> How does it work with you two?<eos> We're still figuring that out.<eos> Really?<eos> I was hoping you had it down by now.
You're nothing...<eos> 'You're nothing but a foul...<eos> You're nothing but a foul demoness.<eos> 'You're nothing...' 'Take one.'<eos> 'If divorce were an option, I'd have done it years ago.
No. No, it's not still a possibility.<eos> He's got a ten-year option on my contract and you can bet your boots I'll never work in this or any other town again.<eos> No, trust me, darling, the only way I'll escape my caro marito is with one of us in a box.<eos> Are you going to tell us what happens?<eos> And spoil the ending for when we see it at the cinema?
Hmm, let me guess... didn't end well?<eos> She had an affair.<eos> They got divorced.<eos> And then Richard sent Dr. Shaw a death threat.<eos> It's been more than a year, but that kind of anger can bubble up when you least expect it.
The container is missing.<eos> I heard you.<eos> Then why aren't we out there recovering it?<eos> Why fuss?<eos> I suppose if somebody wants it badly enough to steal it, then perhaps they should have it, then.
Not exactly.<eos> Ah.<eos> Or it's because you think that everybody's out to get you.<eos> That's because they are.<eos> But trust me, I didn't choose it.
I'm no thief, I'm an actor, Louie delgado.<eos> I had an arc on Party of Five, look me up.<eos> I love L.A. Even the homeless have an IMDb page.<eos> You care to explain why you were caught pawning Tim Dunlear's championship ring?<eos> Listen, more importantly, why did you take it to a pawnshop?
I can't describe it.<eos> He has a newfound appetite.<eos> An insatiable hunger he just can't seem to fill.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I've seen it before.
If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't risk it... her life's at stake.<eos> Right. So you're just gonna get both of you killed then, are you?<eos> He needs this money to leave town.<eos> I won't give it to him until she's safe.
Dad, mom, just--<eos> As of now there is no charges being pressed on the kids, but that could change.<eos> Who the hell did you steal this desk from?<eos> We didn't steal a desk the desk from anyone, dad--<eos> We got it out of a dumpster.
Thanks.<eos> Your mom, she set out that vest.<eos> That's too small for you.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll just tell her the same thing.<eos> I tell her every time she tries to make me wear it.
Stand!<eos> Sing.<eos> Help me, help me, the rabbit said Or the hunter will shoot me dead<eos> Bring it down!<eos> Did you touch it?
Which reminds me... Your presence is no longer required.<eos> You can thank my agents for completing your mission.<eos> Their idealism will doom this planet.<eos> No.<eos> That's what will save it.
- You know exactly what I mean.<eos> I'm going to find its lair.<eos> And when I do, I will drop this human coat I wear.<eos> I won't freeze.<eos> I will break its body in half and bury it in the dry sand.
Well done.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, shit, man, if I knew you guys were gonna clap, I would've brought my tap shoes.<eos> Uh, you know, to be honest, I never really believed in this bullshit before, you know?<eos> I'd go to rehab and no one told me that you guys give it away for free in here.
Keep your heads up, okay?<eos> And... take care of each other.<eos> This is beautiful work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And I'll believe it when I see it.
Just like that?<eos> Well, he'd done it before, I just followed.<eos> And what about the lip?<eos> Each turret, it has a lip.<eos> How did you get over it?
What's that bitch gone and said?<eos> - Watch your mouth.<eos> - We found your stash, Eddie.<eos> That's not mine.<eos> I've never seen it before.
Starting in the front, up through the windshield, continuing down the side of the vehicle, where we actually have gunshot residue.<eos> The shooter was right next to the car, just outside the vehicle.<eos> Yeah, if she was dealing, then mama stopped to make a heroin sale in front of the wrong house.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Our victim braked her vehicle but kept it in drive?
- I didn't come here to argue.<eos> - Gary, okay, you don't...<eos> I just got a question I got to ask.<eos> I-I apologize for the zoo thing.<eos> Oh, oh, is that what we're calling it now?
Well, not according to her status reports.<eos> They say Sharon Beck has passed all of her drug tests, hasn't missed an appointment with her probation officer, has all of her A.A. logs checked.<eos> She recently changed residences, but she reported that.<eos> Now, I have a new address for her and a phone number.<eos> If you need it...
Why don't you get down on the floor right here, Buddha, and we'll check on all of that.<eos> This isn't necessary, officer.<eos> You're really big, and I really can't shoot you.<eos> No work orders matching up to the plates on half these vehicles.<eos> I say we shut this place down and search it inch by inch.
I plant the gun in Reverend Copkiller's church.<eos> And this phone.<eos> You planted it, too.<eos> And that's important why?<eos> Because someone used it to call both Tamika and Emile right before they were murdered.
She always sounds believable no matter what she says.<eos> If your client could tell us where Gary is, it would help us take her version of events more seriously.<eos> Gary has one of those disposable cellphones.<eos> Does that help?<eos> If you know the phone number and if Gary is still using it.

What are you gonna do?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We've done as much bad as good here.<eos> - We've lost our place.<eos> - We earn it back by not fighting for Travis.
True form?<eos> It needs a total of four living souls to consume and then it'll walk the earth.<eos> Four souls, one for each corner of hell where it's trapped.<eos> After that, it's unchained from its suffering and it's free to walk the earth.<eos> Well, how do we beat it?
For all of you.<eos> When technology becomes able to improve and reproduce itself, it is the moment we become inferior to the machine.<eos> You killed someone, Niska!<eos> Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you.<eos> Dad didn't destroy all his work before he died, he hid it in us. You were right.
- Yes?<eos> - The woman Riphagen worked with.<eos> I'd like to use your archive to find her real name.<eos> - No, the archive is mine, remember?<eos> - Would you look for it then?
There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Why are you still Lengcheng?<eos> Everyone is trying to get you.<eos> What about the shipment?<eos> Police are checking it, I didn't expect them to be so fast.
"Where's your show?"<eos> And I go, "The Pittsburgh Improv."<eos> "Where's that?"<eos> I fucking Google it.<eos> I send it to him, and the phone rings.
Very dry.<eos> Two olives.<eos> No, no, no, I said very dry.<eos> That's way too much vermouth.<eos> What are you gonna do, serve it in a cauldron?
I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Bill's dad had a motorcycle accident.<eos> Some truck hit it.
That's an unplaceable accent you've got there.<eos> But if it's for your sick Aunt Fiona, please.<eos> Is that my boyfriend Jack?<eos> Yeah. What do you need?<eos> I'll get it for you, I got it.
ALLISON, LINDSAY AND SAM: "Thank you."<eos> Um, I just called a car to come get Jack, bring him to the train station, so maybe we'll wait outside for that, and then after that, I can show you guys the theater.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's the theater?<eos> Well, my dad actually bought this old porn theater and we're gonna fix it up, turn it into an improv space.
... even if it makes people uncomfortable or mad.<eos> Because there's no way they're gonna fix these problems if they don't know...<eos> So what do you think about what Monte said?<eos> Callie: I mean, how can we expect a bunch of lawmakers and social workers to know what we're really going through when they're not living our lives?<eos> The only way real change can happen is if we demand it.
Did you talk to anyone about me?<eos> 'Cause I just got taken away from my foster family and put in a group home.<eos> I thought you didn't like them.<eos> I don't, but this new place sucks.<eos> Well, I mentioned it to this woman I've been working with, but...
Characters like Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, they fought to the end.<eos> And, of course, eventually, the end did come.<eos> I'm honored to be Sitting Bull's relative.<eos> You know, we're actually to a point now where we can survive and thrive, so we need to do that in order to honor our ancestors, to honor Sitting Bull, because they didn't want to lose their way of life.<eos> And we fought and died to keep our way of life, and we still have it.
The $3,600 was for the reward.<eos> The three names you gave me wound up dead.<eos> I took a big risk giving up those names.<eos> I know you did.<eos> If I had the money, I'd give it to you. But I don't.
And then I... got here, and... it's amazing I survived as long as I did not knowing that I was a Magician.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> So, okay.<eos> There's a spell if they question you so they can't read your minds.<eos> I'll write it down.
Mine too.<eos> Pointless and toxic.<eos> I didn't really learn magic formally as a kid.<eos> I heard you never got invited to take the Brakebills entrance exam.<eos> How'd you even find it?
Okay.<eos> Um, just before, um, can I...<eos> Why did you give me that book?<eos> "Fillory and Further," book six.<eos> I thought you'd appreciate it.
"Fillory and Further," book six.<eos> I thought you'd appreciate it.<eos> I lost it.<eos> Guess I was wrong.<eos> No, you're not, I... I need to read it. I just, I can't find it.
She's moving drugs down the Hershey highway.<eos> Check it out.<eos> All right, she's probably got some guy that she's meeting at visitation, and he kisses her all long and passionate, but then instead of slipping her the tongue, he's slipping her a packet, see?<eos> And she has to swallow it because of the post-visitation strip-search and double-ended "Say 'Ah's."<eos> So, she goes and she poops it in the shower where it's easier to pull the goodies out of the fuckin' Cracker Jack box, 'cause you don't want your shit getting lost in the toilet bowl.
Thank you.<eos> I just have one more question.<eos> On the docks, before you were taken, did Aurora have the shot?<eos> I saw her.<eos> She didn't have it.
Leave it.<eos> -That's how Grace likes it.<eos> -Are you OK?<eos> Well, no.<eos> I would actually like some tea. But if you make it, then I'll decide that we also need toast,
Baby, you know where my black bag is?<eos> No. Did you get up in the night?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Did you get up in the night?<eos> Oh, found it.
How hard is it? You walk up to the fucking platform,<eos> - you exchange the suitcase.<eos> - I know.<eos> I got an eight-year-old that can do it.<eos> You give it to this fuckin' Pollack, look what happens.
If anyone's seen anything out of the ordinary and tweeted about it, I'll find it.<eos> Great.<eos> Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and I to the neighborhood where Will was found.<eos> Yes.<eos> They call it Kidneyville.
Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and I to the neighborhood where Will was found.<eos> Yes.<eos> They call it Kidneyville.<eos> Kidneyville?<eos> Yes, that's the name the locals have given it.
The vessel from Egypt, sir.<eos> It arrived in the port overnight.<eos> Do you have the paperwork?<eos> The manifest?<eos> I have it right here, sir. Oh.
I am aware you are anxious to take action.<eos> Each day we wait our task grows harder.<eos> The Master is building an army.<eos> I will not be rash.<eos> I made that mistake once before and I will not make it again.
We will find them tonight.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?<eos> He did better than that.<eos> He led us right to the facility where they were keeping it.
Alright? Here.<eos> I will get them back for what they did to us.<eos> This book, it is bait!<eos> You want the Master?<eos> He will come for whoever possesses it.
Anyway, thanks for taking my call.<eos> Goodweather...<eos> I'm doing the talking.<eos> I got your goddamn book.<eos> If you want it, you're gonna have to come through on your end.
OK.<eos> Ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, little monkey, how are you gonna get that tasty, tasty blood?<eos> That's right. You grab the pipe, you stick it through the cage, pull the dish towards you.
Neither Tommy nor I can be incriminated in any way, or the deal is off.<eos> Ghost just told me he's gonna take out Milan.<eos> - He's using Ruiz to do it.<eos> - I know you had a plan with Ruiz.<eos> Ruiz told me about it, right before I stabbed him.

You see, this is the problem we've got, Mr Jenkins.<eos> We know you couldn't have got Mr Knight's money out of the bank while he was in prison.<eos> Because Mr Knight was the only one who could get it out.<eos> So this is what we're thinking.<eos> Once you were sure Mr Knight had his money, you went to his room in the middle of the night, killed him, and stole it for yourself.
When I opened the bag it was just that.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> That's why you broke back into the room the following night.<eos> Because you were still searching for the money.<eos> You didn't find it that time, either, did you?
Did he refuse?<eos> After all you did for him?<eos> You, erm... .. spent two years in prison.<eos> Why did you confess to a crime you didn't commit?<eos> Who says I didn't commit it?
Now listen, Jackson.<eos> This is very serious.<eos> A man has been murdered.<eos> And this was his phone.<eos> Now, for the last time, how did you get it?
60?<eos> 25 plus.<eos> Yeah, 25 plus 35.<eos> Listen.<eos> If I make a deal with you are you going to keep to it?
Yes.<eos> Though my hair was much shorter.<eos> What is the name of your kingdom?<eos> China.<eos> And who rules it?
I told you, you have no choice.<eos> If you have any feelings for your son or care whether he lives or dies.<eos> Now, drink.<eos> Here is my crossbow.<eos> No one expects you to be able to fire it properly.
- Good.<eos> Take me with you.<eos> The only other person that knows as much about this case as you is me.<eos> You came to me once, for help.<eos> I saw where it was going, I told you to drop it.
Yeah, he's hiding something.<eos> And you know that how?<eos> Five decades in uniform is how I know.<eos> Same way I knew that you busted my car window playing ball even though you said you didn't.<eos> I didn't bust it playing ball.
And you know that how?<eos> Five decades in uniform is how I know.<eos> Same way I knew that you busted my car window playing ball even though you said you didn't.<eos> I didn't bust it playing ball.<eos> I hit it with a bat.
I asked that question myself.<eos> Something about my DNA makes the process just... Go.<eos> And you just signed up for it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> They just did it.
It's throbbing like crazy.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, sit down, and we'll get started.<eos> I thought you liked pain.<eos> Only when I ask for it.
They stick their heads up, I want us there.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Agent Pritchard, a word.<eos> Pritchard, I know some of these other agents are looking at you sideways for turning your partner and your boss in, but from where I stand, that was damn fine work.<eos> - You took an oath, and you defended it.
A deal this big, I want to know everything about a person.<eos> So, what do you know about me?<eos> I know this business used to be Ray Carson's.<eos> And now it belongs to you.<eos> I know you run it better than Ray did.
We're prepared to fully cooperate with this investigation.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> Something's going around in my head that's been bugging me.<eos> I thought it was that you knew her nickname.<eos> But it's not that you knew it.
Excuse me for a moment.<eos> Something's going around in my head that's been bugging me.<eos> I thought it was that you knew her nickname.<eos> But it's not that you knew it.<eos> It was the way you said it to her, and what you said about her.
It's oil of vitriol.<eos> It's a toxin, it darkens a victim's liver, and it is not mine.<eos> It's not.<eos> Given that Francis' liver was blackened.<eos> Do you think Narcisse planted it?
Where?<eos> I will go in your stead.<eos> Ride to the cathedral at Saint-Denis where Francis is interred.<eos> Find the embalmer who removed the king's organs.<eos> Ask him if the liver was already black when he removed it.
"I confronted Mother about her poisonous soup.<eos> Asked her why she felt that I deserved to die."<eos> Those are my personal thoughts and feelings!<eos> You have no right!<eos> "I grabbed the poison she used on me, put it to my lips, "hoping that she would finally see the excruciating pain that she had caused me my whole life."
You didn't go out after eight o'clock? I stayed in my office until about, ooh, er...er... ..half past three in the morning, maybe four o'clock.<eos> May I see your whole wardrobe?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Last autumn, your tailor made you a suit in this material.<eos> Do you remember it?
Someone standing at a bus platform burnt the lapel with a cigarette.<eos> So...you're having it mended?<eos> Oh, no, no, I hate anything that's damaged, no matter what.<eos> You threw the suit away?<eos> Oh, no, I gave it away.
So...you're having it mended?<eos> Oh, no, no, I hate anything that's damaged, no matter what.<eos> You threw the suit away?<eos> Oh, no, I gave it away.<eos> I took it out with me one evening when I was walking by the Seine, as is my habit, and I gave it to a tramp.
Where was it found?<eos> Down by the river.<eos> His mate took the trousers.<eos> Moncin could be telling us the truth, Chief.<eos> If he gave it away a week ago, he wasn't wearing it two nights ago.
His mate took the trousers.<eos> Moncin could be telling us the truth, Chief.<eos> If he gave it away a week ago, he wasn't wearing it two nights ago.<eos> Get it to Moers. See if he can tell us how old the burn is.<eos> And if it's less than two days old, then Moncin's lying about when he dumped it.
It's a dark thing.<eos> Maybe an animal.<eos> - It is a dog.<eos> - A dog?<eos> Now, Elena.. ...i want you to take this dog and take it out of the room.
They also took all our Toblerone and toilet paper.<eos> This is not good, Scooter.<eos> I-I got to go talk to Piggy.<eos> Kermit, everyone seems to love the show!<eos> I think we did it!
Okay, lads, you've got ninety minutes.<eos> Any subject you like.<eos> Your time starts now.<eos> We've all have one thing we're ashamed of, the memory of one moment so embarrassing we don't think we'll ever get over it.
A cautionary tale about giving power to an impressionable mass of fragrant and unkempt urchins.<eos> Not that that's ever going to happen in my class.<eos> Okay. Books open please, page one.<eos> "The boy with fair hair lowered himself down" the last few feet of rock. And began to pick his way toward the lagoon.<eos> Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, "his gray shirt stuck to him..."
I can't.<eos> My nerves.<eos> You're gonna win.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I don't know the first thing about rugby but... I feel it in my bones.
- "But" nothing.<eos> If you don't know what you're asking, Pascal, be careful what you're insinuating.<eos> Walter, I need your support.<eos> Everything hinges on this.<eos> We - the team-we need it.
That's enough I said!<eos> You hear me?<eos> Ah, for fuck's sake.<eos> We all have that one thing we're ashamed of.<eos> A memory of one moment so embarrassing we don't know if we'll ever be able to forget it.
Get me Janvier. Janvier?<eos> It's the chief.<eos> Chief? "Find out how long the cream-and-blue Citroen's been broken down at the Quai Henri IV.<eos> And release details of the car to the Press.<eos> We want anyone who saw it to come forward.
I saw it pull up outside Au Petit Albert.<eos> And what is Au Petit Albert?<eos> A little bistro, run by a husband and wife near where I live.<eos> The wife stinks of garlic.<eos> When did you see it?
You were... you were seen in a video with him, below deck, opening a container.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about, ma'am. ♪ But I think that you're wild ♪ ♪ When you flash that fragile smile ♪<eos> Okay, I just need the manifest.<eos> I wish you congressional aides would talk to each other.<eos> I gave it out to another guy this morning.
I'm okay.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> If Vorza got away, he'll be back with an army.<eos> All right.<eos> We need to move the body before somebody discovers it.
It's a halfway house over on Birchwood.<eos> She said she lived in a beautiful doorman building.<eos> Anyway, I also found a video in her file.<eos> I just sent you the link.<eos> Great, we'll look at it now.
LAPD has a photograph of her riding her bicycle on the Santa Monica freeway.<eos> In the carpool lane. ♪ Say it's all right ♪ ♪ It's all right ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause it's all right... ♪ Just be careful, okay, sweetie?<eos> That's my work bench.<eos> Oyster King of L.A. is coming over and this little garage ain't gonna know what hit it!
Already coordinated with San Diego PD, so...<eos> Cool.<eos> Well, shit, Knox.<eos> I smell a promotion.<eos> And unlike Angela, you've done it without sucking anyone's dick.
I smell a promotion.<eos> And unlike Angela, you've done it without sucking anyone's dick.<eos> She didn't suck Mike's dick to get on the task force.<eos> DOJ drafted a deal.<eos> If Ruiz takes it, finally have a witness to testify against Lobos.
No.<eos> Does Tommy want to keep the baby?<eos> Tommy doesn't know?<eos> I really want to tell him.<eos> I just... I haven't decided if I'm keeping it yet.
This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's 14-year-old son.<eos> And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum.<eos> Not many Secret Service agents buried at Arlington.<eos> I'd say he earned his place.<eos> I took it for granted, how important he was to me, how much I leaned on him.
Alright.<eos> Let's talk about this phone.<eos> Can you tell us how this iPhone5 registered to a Ms. Annie Green came into your possession?<eos> I found it.<eos> You found it? Where?
Can you tell us how this iPhone5 registered to a Ms. Annie Green came into your possession?<eos> I found it.<eos> You found it? Where?<eos> At that Lebanese restaurant.<eos> Did you tell anyone you found it?
I found it.<eos> You found it? Where?<eos> At that Lebanese restaurant.<eos> Did you tell anyone you found it?<eos> So basically you stole it.
So basically you stole it.<eos> Look.<eos> I've obviously wandered into something here.<eos> You're telling me this phone is linked to a murder. I don't know anything about that.<eos> I picked up a phone, turned it on to see who it belonged to. I was about to return it and next thing I know, you lot are arriving outside the bleeding restaurant.
You won me plenty today.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> I think I'm gonna save up my money, just like you, Massa.<eos> You earned it. Thank you.
We got every man with a gun out looking for him. Uh-huh.<eos> This your boy?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well, you a damn fool if you ain't got him tied up good. That Nat Turner's a fever.<eos> You never know which nigger's gonna catch it.
Good schools.<eos> Are you familiar with a gang called "Los Guapos"?<eos> It's their turf, but, uh, we have an understanding.<eos> So I assume that would extend to my baby as well.<eos> Okay, so if a baby does poo-poo, would you, like, wipe it front to back or back to front?
Wow, you could be in a lifetime movie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We gonna do this the easy way.<eos> You want the couch?<eos> Whoever sits on it the longest gets it.
-Ah. -Thanks to your ridiculous security requirements.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Unless, in the name of mercy, you could untie the bindings.<eos> I'd still be in your medieval straightjacket, but at least I'd have some degree of control over the movement of my arms.<eos> Hey, maybe you don't get it.
When I lost my medical license i set up an illegal clinic.<eos> Before I often did plastic surgery for idiots who wanted a smaller nose, larger breasts, sometimes a larger penis-- more to the point, you then became interested in...<eos> Gender change operations, yes.<eos> After I could no longer officially practice, I discovered a huge black market for that kind of surgery.<eos> Most people who want it don't want to go through the endless waiting period, and, in addition, many times they can't afford the enormous costs.
The package is here.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Wait. Why "uh-oh"?<eos> Guess who just signed for it?
Okay.<eos> Okay, moving on.<eos> What would you do with a million dollars?<eos> What if I told you I had one million dollars?<eos> - Then I'd steal it.
Okay. You know what?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> We have this new heat-activated antiseptic gel.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> Astronauts use it to masturbate.
I love you. Ha-ha!<eos> But you are getting me a real ring.<eos> You're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.<eos> We can go tomorrow.<eos> We'll pick it out together.
Jack, why don't Mae and I go ask the deputy for assistance interviewing Malik's ex-fiancée, and then you and Simmons can go talk to Omar without a babysitter?<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> Khan el-Khalili market is the original burial site for the Fatimid dynasty, who founded Cairo.<eos> "Wow"... yeah.<eos> That's exactly what the ancient romans said when they saw it around 100 A.D.
You owe your sister a great debt of gratitude.<eos> I wasn't aware the money came with any debt attached.<eos> Of course it doesn't!<eos> This is what you deserve, Arthur.<eos> We want you to have it.
My mustache.<eos> I've been growing it for weeks, and the two of you have been conspicuously silent.<eos> It's very dashing.<eos> What mustache?<eos> Right, Jay. Like I'm supposed to believe you didn't see it.
Well, that does nothing.<eos> It's a Himalayan vessel, shaped like an elephant head.<eos> I use it to flush mucus out of my nasal cavities.<eos> It was on the kitchen sink.<eos> Well, then hopefully I threw it away.
I remember his puffy drawstring pants.<eos> Well, he's helping, too.<eos> He'll haul the tank into my bedroom.<eos> Don't worry about the body.<eos> Once I've left it, Skipper will take care of everything else.
According to the latest diagnostic information, the agent has been identified as influenza "A"<eos> with hemagglutinin 7 and neuraminidase 2, or H7N2, an avian influenza that, until now, has not been known to be transmitted between humans.<eos> It appears the genome of this virus has been manipulated to give it higher pathogenicity and to make it capable of human-to-human transmission.<eos> We discovered a vial in patient zero's belongings that had traces of a biological agent.<eos> We must assume he brought it into the country and into the hospital, where he infected Dr. Sanders.
We're taking orders from her.<eos> That's the way this works.<eos> The only people whose jobs are threatened right now are yours and mine.<eos> What, so, we're just supposed to take it?<eos> I don't like broccoli, but my doctor says eat it, so I do.
Yeah.<eos> I'll tell him you're a badass is what I'll tell him.<eos> Also, the satellite phone the thug brought in, it had a government serial number on it.<eos> Lex thought I was calling him from an APB phone.<eos> That's weird, right, that they had it?
Hey, you got a small cheese here?<eos> Yeah, just throw it on the table anywhere, please.<eos> Would you mind if I borrow your work phone?<eos> - Yeah, your boss gives you a phone so his business pops up on a customer's caller ID when you call.<eos> May I borrow it?
That's gonna raise a ton on the black market.<eos> So you want to go from the Cordon straight to prison?<eos> Minimum security prison.<eos> It's better than this place.<eos> And who's gonna prove we did it?
- No.<eos> He's hurting the kid.<eos> You're hurting him.<eos> I don't care.<eos> My brother needs it.
Have one.<eos> This enclosure was built for the purpose of common recreation and study.<eos> I had it repurposed into a garden worthy of our splendor.<eos> I dare say it's my favorite place in the entire Kingdom.<eos> It pleases me that you've seen it with your own eyes before...choosing to leave us so suddenly.
Are you cool, though, Dwight?<eos> I mean, I just said that it was happy hour at the Pussy Bar and Dwight eats for free, and you're telling me no?<eos> Is that cool?<eos> I haven't finished the job.<eos> I-I haven't earned it yet.
What am I doing out there?<eos> You're practicing.<eos> We have to give up our guns, all of them.<eos> We can't.<eos> If you keep it, and they find it, someone dies.
Maybe.<eos> Then make me a bullet.<eos> You're not talking me out of this, Eugene!<eos> You owe me, and you owe him.<eos> And if there's a price, I'll pay it.
Maybe he'd have less anger issues.<eos> I'd go back and tell him to seize the Suez Canal early on.<eos> That'd secure most of the Mediterranean, giving the Third Reich easy access to oil.<eos> I can't.<eos> They need it over here.
Who did that to you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It's done.<eos> Well, you can't go around with that horror.<eos> I probably deserve it.
Like, she stole... my hair.<eos> Isn't that kind of flattering, though?<eos> What if I missed my only chance to get physical with another person?<eos> You don't need a time machine for that.<eos> That closet is right where you left it.
Like, from the ground? Um...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was a baby...<eos> And it was small and slippery... and not like a jelly bean at all, Flaca.<eos> And when I swallowed it, I felt its little feet, with toes.
Of course, that means going straight through the garden and the greenhouse, which we've been tryin' to avoid.<eos> What did Caputo say?<eos> He hasn't picked up his phone all morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I'm calling it, then.
Thought maybe Svetlana or V could help.<eos> Nah, they're at home getting their vaginas interviewed.<eos> Whoa, whoa, what do you mean you got kicked out, though?<eos> I had to meet with a counselor, and he forced me to enroll in a alternative program for teen moms.<eos> They call it distance learning, but you know what I call it?
Nothing.<eos> I'm just happy.<eos> [Laughs] Hey, how's To-Go going? Is it taking off?<eos> Oh! What happened to your cast?<eos> I let the boys cut it off. [Chuckles]
Probably not. Water leaks take a long time to fix.<eos> I feel bad we never went back out there for dinner.<eos> Oh, they're fine.<eos> We heard them leave.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah. I also heard the sound of tinfoil, so I think Jessica wrapped up our country ham and took it with her.
You know, this is that four-minute window Wednesday afternoon we have the whole house to ourselves.<eos> Louis.<eos> I've been so efficient because of my wristband, I even had time to pick us up a French CD.<eos> So extravagant.<eos> I got it on loan from the library.
On the phone?<eos> Of course, silly.<eos> My number's easy to remember.<eos> It's 407-555-corn.<eos> I figured it out one day.
This isn't gonna make...<eos> Kid can make a mixtape.<eos> The hell?<eos> Where's the computer? !<eos> We put it away after being publicly shamed in front of Eddie's entire school.
We won't have time for it anyway, what with the 100 hours of community service we have to do.<eos> You'll sign me in, right?<eos> But you just spent all that money on it.<eos> Well, the good thing about computers is they last forever.<eos> We'll hook it back up in a few years
I'll judge.<eos> Damn!<eos> That is a nice vest he's wearing.<eos> Huh. Wonder where he got that vest.<eos> I bet he got it at Structure. [Gasps]
You said I have to be five pots tall.<eos> You are now, son.<eos> I'm so excited for you.<eos> You're giving me your apron?<eos> Yes, to hand-wash for me, and then you'll give it back to me.
The guy's like, "Where's your proof?"<eos> And I'm like, "Right here.<eos> Oh." Eddie, don't make everything about pizza.<eos> This is about responsibility.<eos> I know if I buy you that watch, you'll wear it for one day, then toss it aside.
I guess, technically, the medicine was in us.<eos> So, I guess you didn't go to law school, either?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> We did. We did.<eos> We just... hated it.
Where's my watch? !<eos> Where's my dad? !<eos> I lost Dad's watch!<eos> Give us all the details.<eos> I had taken it off to shower on Saturday.
Where's my dad? !<eos> I lost Dad's watch!<eos> Give us all the details.<eos> I had taken it off to shower on Saturday.<eos> I know I put it in a safe place...
On top of G-Dubs.<eos> One witness...<eos> Toy glowworm.<eos> And then, I don't remember.<eos> I don't know if I put it back on afterwards.
Twist.<eos> Talk to us.<eos> Well, on Saturday,<eos> I walked past Eddie's room and saw he had carelessly left my watch lying on his bed.<eos> So I took it to teach him a lesson.
Talk to us.<eos> Well, on Saturday,<eos> I walked past Eddie's room and saw he had carelessly left my watch lying on his bed.<eos> So I took it to teach him a lesson.<eos> And then I lost it.
He switched it to Saturdays because he gets so worked up during "American Gladiators."<eos> _<eos> Gladiators, ready!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He just took it off to shower.
Wait.<eos> If that's your watch, then... whose watch is this?<eos> It's a new one.<eos> I bought it.<eos> I saw my watch lying in your room, and I thought you were being careless, so I took it to teach you a lesson.
And I work at an aquarium.<eos> Well, I work in...<eos> Ugh. Take the name.<eos> You can have it.<eos> I don't want it.
Listen to me, Busta Rhymes.<eos> People expect greatness from Topaz Industries.<eos> That's what my name means, and that's what I expect from you.<eos> When my father died after swallowing all those buttons,<eos> I didn't take over his steakhouse and turn it into the number-one hip-hop label/ clothing line/multimedia empire to play it safe.
That's not how Erica got the flight info.<eos> Instead, she found a weak link: a low-level marshal fell victim to a classic spearfishing campaign.<eos> Leaked the flight number and the U.S. marshal transporting the witness.<eos> What about the witness's name?<eos> I don't see it anywhere here.
You can use those to chat with friends, order drinks...<eos> Can use it to send the marshal a warning.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Checking the manifest.<eos> All right, I got it.
You don't want in?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Just check before you include me in something, okay?<eos> That book gets published over my dead body.<eos> You haven't even read it, Garrett.
We'll take it from there.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you do what I said?<eos> You put the ipecac on his brownie?<eos> Yeah, the goon wolfed it right down.
You're busy chasing a shield when a cop could've been in trouble?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not gonna apologize for wanting a career.<eos> Well, I need a partner I can trust.<eos> So you ever sit out a 10-13 again, you can find somebody else to ride with.<eos> So after seven years of asking for the car, she finally leaves it to me in her will.
Okay, I have everyone's assignment except... Jenna's.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Paper?<eos> What, did you write it with a quill by candlelight?<eos> Why don't you just fax it to me while you're at it, huh?
Maybe we shouldn't take the risk.<eos> We can't sell a dead man's gear.<eos> If it's upside down, it may be flooded.<eos> The only thing is really Uusimäki's scooter.<eos> If his wife gets it back, and we could find a buyer for it.
He chose to appear as Aaron, and no, I'm not crazy.<eos> It happened.<eos> Does this sound even remotely possible?<eos> Yeah, there's some pretty trippy shit going on with that tea.<eos> They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads.
This was no accident.<eos> The fail safes were disabled.<eos> This was deliberate.<eos> The lens array is totally fried.<eos> Someone put it in backwards.
Why did you say we love drugs?<eos> I was being cool.<eos> I don't know where the "yum-yum" came from.<eos> [sighs] Well...<eos> Maybe it's fine if we take it.
Excuse me, what the hell is going on?<eos> Honey, is that you?<eos> Daddy!<eos> So, like... there's this crazy Ninja thing and then just rams the knife in her hand through Ted's head.<eos> She rips it off and then takes the knife, takes the...
His name's Flesh.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Ex-feeder dude.<eos> How'd he get a tag like "Flesh"?<eos> I didn't wanna go there but I guess he's keeping it.
To change the world.<eos> But in your case, this is truth.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.<eos> But you will not save it.
He said I'd better listen or he was gonna hit me again.<eos> We drove...<eos> We drove for a long time.<eos> But I never saw the puppy again, though.<eos> Never saw it.
Yeah, but Gina Bryant never mentioned any baby.<eos> Well, Violet could have had the baby before Gina was abducted.<eos> Gina wouldn't even know about it.<eos> We, if we're right about any of this, that means there's another kid somewhere out there.<eos> Then who's taking care of it?
Wait!<eos> Please!<eos> Even if you deliver me to the king and queen, they'll never pay!<eos> Look what they've done to this once proud kingdom.<eos> They plundered and destroyed it and ruined all of our lives!
You can publish this or you can write a real book that tells the American people who you are, what you've been through, what you think about what you've been through.<eos> A book that is truthful.<eos> A book that is hard.<eos> This book was easy to write and easy to forget.<eos> The book you need to write will be hard, but people will remember it.
He wasn't like me and Noel, or like Bonehead.<eos> You know, we were fucking pretty mental.<eos> He was suffering from nervous exhaustion as rock stars always are.<eos> Or "My exhaustion is fucking getting me nervous," I don't know.<eos> I never had it myself.
"I mean, are we like the biggest three cunts in the world?"<eos> It didn't deter us.<eos> We got to New York.<eos> Bonehead got up.<eos> "You're playing bass and we do it as a four-piece."
I loved every minute of it.<eos> It meant the be-all and end-all, man.<eos> Life or death.<eos> And I wouldn't change anything.<eos> I'd do it all again in a fucking heartbeat. This is history!
Classic dad deflection.<eos> "Can we have a pony"<eos> "Well, let me think about that one"<eos> And how is that pony, huh?<eos> I haven't seen it.
Dad, can we let Amy convert everything to the new system?<eos> - I'll think about that one.<eos> - Dad! It's a no-brainer.<eos> This is exactly what we need.<eos> I said I'll think about it.
Hey.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> I just wanted to say I love that book.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Uh, to be honest, I felt so weird about reading alone, I just sort of opened it to the middle.
And you can help me.<eos> That case is officially closed.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> You know it isn't, Angela, okay?<eos> - Cross re-opened it.
Well, I'm glad to know that defeating a mere mortal still holds a certain charm for you.<eos> You know, it's wild.<eos> I've never really even played video games before.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't rub it in.
- JP? - Mm?<eos> That's all very fascinating, but you might want to look over there.<eos> What is that?<eos> - Caroline knew about your affair.<eos> - She never mentioned it.
I'll be back in a minute to take you through for your speech.<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't send that report.<eos> I told you.<eos> If you end it with Francois before I get on the plane, I'll drop it.
Mr Hammond?<eos> A few months ago I interviewed for Caroline's replacement.<eos> Everybody on that panel knew I deserved the job.<eos> Yet still they snubbed you.<eos> Gave it to some Oxbridge tosser who'd spent his career in Brussels.
Those who are marked... who are chosen...<eos> - often did not choose it themselves.<eos> - I feel you, sister.<eos> The Tate family were cattle rustlers.<eos> They stole livestock and rebranded it as their own.
We thought you'd find this place and our appearance less upsetting.<eos> Yet you seem upset.<eos> My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger.<eos> Zoom is on a rampage with the power that he stole from me, and you are keeping me here.<eos> You were given a rare and precious gift, and you rejected it.
Yet you seem upset.<eos> My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger.<eos> Zoom is on a rampage with the power that he stole from me, and you are keeping me here.<eos> You were given a rare and precious gift, and you rejected it.<eos> No, I did not reject it.
You hear herb shapiro bought an 80-footer?<eos> Herb?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tried to talk him out of it.<eos> Two best days in a yacht owner's life are the day he buys it and the day he throws himself overboard.
Rosie, what are you doing?<eos> Questioning witnesses.<eos> Mr. Peters has information on our victim.<eos> So you were saying.<eos> His dog dumped on my yard for years, and he never picked it up.
But all this... It's just gossip.<eos> How can you believe in --<eos> Pastor, it's really not that simple...<eos> Still insisting...<eos> This spirit, have you seen it..?
Man, that car's been with him through thick and thin.<eos> War and peace.<eos> It was his everything.<eos> I mean, it didn't even have a CD player though.<eos> True that... but he loved it.
Forget the stupid book.<eos> Chasing that thing's only going to give you a leg cramp.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I don't?<eos> You're the one who grew up your entire life looking for that book, and you never found it.
Stop it!<eos> What is your genius plan for getting the book back?<eos> Throw one of our epic parties tonight.<eos> And the kids who stole your car will show up.<eos> We might not be able to find the book, but we can go after the ones who are searching for it.
Someone gave my piece a read and decided against it.<eos> Their journalistic style couldn't be more outmoded.<eos> - Satire?<eos> More like "sa-tired."<eos> - I never even thought they'd read it.
This is why I didn't want to do another TV show.<eos> Everything was perfect.<eos> BoJack, this shit is bananas.<eos> B-A-N-A-N-A-S.<eos> I can't promise everyone will love this show. No matter what, people will remember it.
O Lord God.<eos> It's me, Selina...<eos> Grant me wisdom and strength.<eos> Give us Your comforting presence...<eos> I've got it now. - I've got it.
We were holding out on some other boat...<eos> We were scared, but we were surviving.<eos> Our hull got dinged when we were leaving the marina in Long Beach.<eos> We... we panicked.<eos> We thought we patched it up good, but we rushed it.
We'll never want for anything.<eos> Savings.<eos> A home for Celia and Luis.<eos> These vistas for us.<eos> This place makes me feel like the rest of the world has fallen away and... we don't need it.
I mean, sometimes court systems can move faster, - especially if you have money for...<eos> - I'm going to smoke in my room.<eos> - Oh. Mother fuck.<eos> - Special occasion.<eos> If we stack that same loop on top of the bit-level encoder that we took from Hendricks, and then we tethered it to the routine we were trying to use...
Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it. Sorry, babe.<eos> We're just out of it now. We gave up social media and all the ugliness that goes along with it, and we're in a better place. Humans.<eos> I'm warning you, Skankhunt, this video is really gonna rock your world. Can you please call me Gerald?<eos> !<eos> It's a very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone's even seen it over here. This is why we all have to come together, Skank.
Have a seat.<eos> I'll go fetch the documents and my Montblanc.<eos> Psst!<eos> So, slight hiccup. I tracked down the woman who bought the drive, but she wasn't interested in selling it back.<eos> Apparently, she's already given it to her elderly father and booked the Geek Squad to set it up for him this afternoon.
Did you tell them that my Fage's off-limits?<eos> Oh, that... that won't be a worry.<eos> Come meet them.<eos> All right, guys, who wants to start work on the fragment uploader?<eos> Uh, Gleb, why don't you and Sanjay take it?
I know who you are.<eos> You are that demon Bill.<eos> Oh, sorry, Baal!<eos> You know that that book can send you back, right?<eos> So you want to scramble my brain until I give it to you.
But you don't survive a bite.<eos> Oh, you don't believe I was bitten?<eos> I don't believe in miracles.<eos> - Miracle is your word.<eos> - What would you call it?
No. Not until I know where that book is.<eos> Now spill.<eos> Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> He always keeps it with him, so the book is here now.
And then what happened?<eos> You told me you were too tired pretending to be nice all night, - and I needed to leave you alone.<eos> I'm a real jerk, huh?<eos> Yeah, but you're honest, straightforward, not fake nice and don't beat around the bush.<eos> Your heart is tender, so you protect it from people, but sometimes you open up a wall and it's incredible.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, he was.<eos> I'm sorry, Travis.<eos> His neck was sort of jacked, you know?<eos> Like he broke it going through the glass.
-Maybe you should hold it.<eos> -Uh-huh. -No, I'll take it with me.<eos> -All right. -No, you hold it.<eos> -Sure thing, yeah.<eos> -No, put it in my jacket pocket. -Right here.
Tricked again!<eos> -[ringtone playing]<eos> -Todd, it's ringing.<eos> This is it. Oh, no, my phone!<eos> Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway!
-[ringtone playing]<eos> -Todd, it's ringing.<eos> This is it. Oh, no, my phone!<eos> Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway!<eos> Now, other people are kicking it and it's sliding across the floor!
Hawaiian.<eos> We'll have a luau.<eos> Yeah, somebody called me that in high school, and the nickname just stuck.<eos> - Pakistani Denzel.<eos> - I mean, I don't see it. But everybody else does. So...
I eliminated the Gavin problem, and at the exact same time, I closed funding on our first strategic investment.<eos> We bought a blog.<eos> Oh, cool. How much do blogs cost?<eos> - What? - Oh, nothing.<eos> We practically stole it from them.
Big Head, you're broke?<eos> We're broke, dude.<eos> Erlich, it's time.<eos> You have my number.<eos> I left it on your voicemail.
Uh, what?<eos> But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Well, actually, I'm doing this new show, The BoJack Horseman Show.<eos> -I don't know if you've seen it or--
The ratings aren't great, but we have this upcoming episode, and we're looking for a really big guest star.<eos> You want me to be on your show?<eos> Well, I just thought it would be really fun for... the both of us.<eos> You know, like the old days.<eos> I have the script with me if you want to take a look at it. Um, okay.
You want me to be on your show?<eos> Well, I just thought it would be really fun for... the both of us.<eos> You know, like the old days.<eos> I have the script with me if you want to take a look at it. Um, okay.<eos> Why don't you put it on that pile over there?
- Get a cocktail.<eos> - What hotel?<eos> Eavesdropping.<eos> Well, if you must know, we got a suite at the Fairmont, and they're sending a car.<eos> I think Richard deserves it.
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you, Gilfoyle.<eos> There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.<eos> I can see by the sour, pinched expressions on all your faces that Richard has filled you in regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to relinquish my stake in your fair company.<eos> Erlich, uh, you should know that I have written a press release.<eos> - Oh? - I'm not going to release it yet, but if I hear wind of these rumors spreading out of control, I'm going to send it to every tech publication and blog on the face of the earth. Do you understand?
Fuck it. I'm gonna take her to the "W."<eos> She's so drunk she won't know the difference.<eos> Hey, it's CJ.<eos> Listen, I'm hearing a rumor about some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper.<eos> I've heard it from three different people now.
- "We did it!" 'Member?<eos> - Sure, I 'member.<eos> - What do we do now? - Don't you 'member?<eos> Ooh, I 'member.<eos> Okay, now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth. You got it?
I mean, especially during due diligence, like the kind done by VCs or possible future reviews done by certain regulatory bodies.<eos> It also had photos of my auntie.<eos> Anyway, Gilfoyle, have you seen it?<eos> I have not.<eos> Well, Richard, keep an eye out for it, will ya?
Randy, you were the last person to see him alive. And you didn't tell anyone.<eos> Tell me you have an explanation.<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Because Mateo told us.<eos> Made a video, found it at his house. He laid it all out.
None of that matters, Rita.<eos> You know that.<eos> [sighs] So a late disclosure, so no rape kit.<eos> No, but the maid saw Abby's dress was stained.<eos> Showed it to Laura, her mom.
Well, we'll need to take a statement from the three of you.<eos> Also we'll need access to Abby's friends and social media.<eos> We understand that there was a dress.<eos> There is.<eos> Okay, we'll send it to the lab.
I should have made her talk to me.<eos> All right, but when you did find that dress, you asked her about it.<eos> That was good.<eos> Well, my housekeeper, Pilar, found the dress in the trash on Tuesday.<eos> When Abby came home from school, I asked her why she'd thrown it away.
"John Lennon's plans for the future."<eos> This record, this record I'm holding in my hands, becomes a special object...<eos> You see?<eos> And you don't know who owned it before?<eos> Didn't I tell you I bought it down in Porto Alegre at a used records store.
Yeah.<eos> Except maybe your own patients.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Oh.<eos> This in-between place... some people call it purgatory, where you go to be cleansed, make you worthy of entering heaven.
That woman is my shot at the Oval.<eos> I cannot convince Susan Ross to do something she has no intention of doing.<eos> I think you can.<eos> I think you have certain gifts...<eos> Okay, I gave her that bracelet only after you said you didn't want it, so you can't use it against me.
And if they don't get it, well, they just fall apart.<eos> Fitz didn't have any fight in him.<eos> He didn't know how to stand on his own two feet.<eos> I mean, I saw the potential.<eos> We all saw it.
The publisher says it will take at least six weeks to get it into bookstores...<eos> Who says we need bookstores?<eos> Several pages of the former First Lady's upcoming memoir appear today on the D.C. Dish's website.<eos> Both the publisher and Senator Grant herself denied being the source of the leak.<eos> The book, however, is being described by those who have read it as explosive, revealing, and deeply personal.
He'll shoot.<eos> Says what, your spidey sense?<eos> SWAT has sharpshooters in place.<eos> They're gonna shoot that incompetent whack job you recruited.<eos> They're gonna take our hero moment away from our hero and give it to some jackass sharpshooter.
And if you don't, you'll go back into whatever box you came out of and you'll stay there.<eos> So what if I am sleeping with the enemy, turning a blind eye to whatever my father is up to with Jake?<eos> I am choosing.<eos> It's a choice.<eos> I'm playing the game, and I'm playing it better than anyone.
A coiled wire spring covered by a snake-patterned vinyl sheath?<eos> Lisa, our weekend in Capital City will make us friends again.<eos> I don't see your saxophone.<eos> That must be a relief to you.<eos> Honey, I want you to bring it.
And you are...?<eos> Jay Leno.<eos> Hey, do you still have that money I gave you for the car?<eos> Sure do.<eos> Well, uh, I'm gonna need it back.
Yeah.<eos> Here's your money back.<eos> Can I have my car?<eos> Unfortunately, when I went to register it, it wasn't your car.<eos> So the-the police took it.
You're alive, oh.<eos> If you're wondering what you're hearing, it's me, Dr. Tobias M. Curtis, and I am talking to you because activity will help keep both of us warm-- me by working my jaw, and you by working your brain.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know I've called you cold and unfeeling, but this is ridiculous.<eos> But your heart is still warm, and you'll stay okay as long as we can keep it warm.
We put the Sun Gun panels in it, send it off, and Rahal is now decades behind schedule if he wants to make new ones.<eos> Remember, he didn't build these, he found them.<eos> The Sun Gun could land anywhere.<eos> Which is why I am running the numbers to predict the exact time and location so the aerostat crashes in the Mediterranean.<eos> Where the Navy SEALs will pick it up in a watertight bag.
Like a Frisbee?<eos> Sort of.<eos> I'm not a sports guy, but you need to catch it.<eos> We can't let it break.<eos> We need it to free our legs from the mortar.
Focus on the main event, okay?<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Rebecca didn't ruin this day.<eos> She brought a party bus and just wanted everyone to have fun.<eos> Greg ruined it.
Oh, I'm proud to be your son.<eos> Kind of.<eos> We love you so much, Jerry.<eos> We're here for you, and we'll always be here for you.<eos> I love your support and I need it,
Inspector?<eos> Get out, Thatcher.<eos> The world beside.<eos> - You, is it? - Come on.<eos> - Oi, I only came to run you a note. - Then give it.
Yeah. I didn't do it.<eos> Big game Saturday.<eos> Any chance you'd cut me some slack this time?<eos> I'll give you a one-day extension.<eos> But you have to have it in my in-box at the end of the day tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?<eos> Does the name Addison ring a bell?<eos> The investment broker.<eos> Billy owed Addison a lot of money.<eos> Addison's boy said Billy keeps it in a locker at the golf club.
The last time I checked, there was over $10,000!<eos> Billy cleaned it out.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If he was so scared of Ed, why didn't he just give him the cash?<eos> Maybe he was giving it to somebody else?
You and Billy's?<eos> Well, at least we'll be safe there.<eos> The police are patrolling the neighborhood.<eos> Did Billy buy you this car?<eos> We bought it together.
Let's go sell my car.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How much?<eos> Not enough.<eos> I still think Billy withdrew all the money and hid it somewhere.
Yeah, but how did they seem when they were talking to you?<eos> Concerned.<eos> They were asking about that man, that's all.<eos> What about the car?<eos> We covered it up, they didn't see it.
The only way out is through that front gate.<eos> Well, can't we just leave it where it is, under the tarpaulin?<eos> But what if the police come back?<eos> What if they look around?<eos> I don't know, set it on fire?
Put them in the right order.<eos> Write something wrong, you should shred the paper.<eos> -Have cell phone ?<eos> -Now.<eos> Take it to work.
You had coffee all over you.<eos> Was that hot?<eos> Uh, it wasn't real coffee.<eos> I was jok... it's okay. Oh. See?<eos> - I bought it, kind of. - Oh...
I don't think we should put all our eggs in one basket, so you assist the Captain.<eos> I'll enlist Detective Bell to commandeer the Omar Velez case...<eos> Because the person who killed him is probably the same one who put a bomb in his gut.<eos> So, this is where Omar Velez's body was discovered.<eos> Apparently, the jogger who found it almost tripped, it was so close to the path.
Or what?<eos> Or I'll prove it was you.<eos> I read the report on Hector's assault.<eos> You were careful.<eos> There's no evidence that you did it.
Yeah, well, he wasn't paying for it.<eos> It always comes back to money.<eos> I was a single mother and a government worker.<eos> I didn't have endless resources.<eos> I saved from the time you were born to give my only child a college education, and you took that gift and threw it away.
The guy doesn't have a coat on.<eos> Says, he gave it to his kid, 'cause he couldn't afford a new one.<eos> Your dad takes off his own coat...<eos> It was vicuna, I remember.<eos> ...and he just gives it to the guy.
Not since 1992.<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> Come in.<eos> I went through the East Africa report again last night.<eos> There's been a change since we sent it to you for approval.
You don't say.<eos> Wudang also owns an American subsidiary called KPT Building.<eos> It's based in Arizona.<eos> That's Stone's home state.<eos> CIA has been all over this report since we started compiling it.
The map I was telling you about... to buried treasure, underground missile silos, whatever you were thinking.<eos> I wasn't thinking anything.<eos> The map's for Dany.<eos> Remember Dany?<eos> Client of Dany wants it.
That I'm a silly little girl whose head was turned by the first man who paid her any attention.<eos> Quite the opposite, cousin.<eos> I think you are the most remarkable woman that I know.<eos> All I am asking is that you stop - just for a second.<eos> Ignore your heart, because I've no doubt that you've given it to him.
How about now?<eos> Supergirl.<eos> What exactly makes you so super?<eos> That symbol.<eos> I've seen it before.
What was that about?<eos> Winn was just drafted by the DEO.<eos> What?<eos> Which means we lost our best hacker while we're dealing with a living extraterrestrial computer.<eos> And now would be the time where Hank usually tells me what we're dealing with and how to catch it.
For decades, I searched the Phantom Zone with my mind.<eos> Looking for a way out.<eos> And then... I found you.<eos> I activated your pod.<eos> I linked it to the prison.
- Yeah, but you have to, like, try steak at least once in your life.<eos> Yeah, it's really good.<eos> It is really good.<eos> I'm a great cook.<eos> If you're going to eat it this is the way to go, right?
Think they'll show?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Don't really care.<eos> Either way, I'm getting my jolts.<eos> You see, Cat, I'm still 50-50 if your heart's actually beating, but I'm gonna stop it anyway.
Turn off the engine!<eos> Come out with your hands in the air!<eos> Whoa! This is a little bit over the top for cutting a class.<eos> Okay. What are you doing in Nick's car?<eos> I... I just borrowed it so I could take Emma out.
And what better way to do that than starve the kingdom of funds when we need them the most?<eos> Mother, is there any truth to this?<eos> I oppose Claude's marriage to Narcisse's friend, the duke, absolutely, and the rest is amateur fiction.<eos> Amateur is whoever you paid to commit the crime.<eos> They took the gold right after Boinel signed it over to me.
I could help you with this.<eos> Martin, that's very kind, but I've already arranged to give the child<eos> - to a loving family.<eos> - You don't want it?<eos> Of course I want it.
You should advise them not to loose.<eos> We don't want a bloodbath.<eos> All I want is my gold.<eos> Well, your gold, in truth.<eos> You did earn it.
It's not quite the same as being innocent.<eos> What kind of doubt?<eos> Doubt about Amy.<eos> Her odd behavior.<eos> Others saw it.
A beaker full of the warm south.<eos> The blushful Hippocrene.<eos> You know your stuff.<eos> Mmm. It's a funny thing about knowledge.<eos> It's been known for more than one person to have it.
But there's lots of Wesen with neurotoxic capabilities.<eos> What do you know about the victim?<eos> Someone took his face.<eos> Come again?<eos> Surgically removed it.
Fuck.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> Let's make camp here, everyone.<eos> Why do you care so much about that watch?<eos> A friend gave it to me.
God, will you stop it with that?<eos> ! He just showed me around the golf course.<eos> Yeah, and bought you a putter in the pro shop.<eos> For old white guys, this is as good as a promise ring.<eos> He only bought it because I told him I always wanted to learn to play golf, which isn't even true.
- Maggie, I was just...<eos> - I'm already in the hot seat with Blair.<eos> I don't need you taking any risks with this case.<eos> - You can't bench me now.<eos> Let them handle it.
Witness protection.<eos> - Burn it all down. Start a new life.<eos> - Oh, my... come on!<eos> Okay, all right. Everybody just calm down.<eos> We just have to get to his phone before he sees it.
Ugh, but he's on the thing all the time. Dammit!<eos> Wait!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Guys, I just remembered something!<eos> He doesn't have his phone with him. Yeah, he accidentally left it at home while he's at Tae Kwan Do.
No.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Come on, let's get this mess cleaned up and you can tell me what happened. I'll just...<eos> Just leave it, I'll get it later.
You are just gonna have to live with the uncertainty.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna be sad and angry, and you're just gonna have to live with it.<eos> Because I'm not quitting this job.<eos> Not this time.<eos> 'Cause I love it and I'm, like, really good at it.
Mr Shaw's looking for a new ganger.<eos> I told you're his man.<eos> It wouldn't be right, sir, with Jack not even in the earth.<eos> Someone's gotta keep this ship afloat.<eos> Would you rather I gave it to another man?
I'm telling you.<eos> Me. Emori.<eos> You are making a mistake.<eos> The minds of everyone who has entered the City of Light are on that server.<eos> If you destroy it, our minds will be gone forever.
I knew a Vice Squad detective who walked home one night and found himself thinking every woman he saw was a hooker.<eos> So, he put in for a transfer the next day.<eos> Remember him?<eos> It didn't happen overnight.<eos> I thought about it for weeks.
Remember him?<eos> It didn't happen overnight.<eos> I thought about it for weeks.<eos> You caught yourself, corrected yourself.<eos> Tim didn't, so I did it for him.
Before it broke, I checked.<eos> We have to go to like a place called Red Fox.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, do you know where that is?<eos> We'll find it for sure.
I called my agent.<eos> It's between me and one other guy. Oh, that's great.<eos> I called Frankie. There was no answer. -Oh.<eos> I did pick up another map, and you are not going to touch it.<eos> I will treat it like a baby if I touch it.
The chandeliers melt, but then they stick together.<eos> And then when they cool down, they are hugging forever.<eos> Nothing can break this new double chandelier apart.<eos> Except if it falls back into the volcano. Or slips into a geyser."<eos> I mean, or if you drop it from a large height, then it-- i will shatter. But then...
Wow, nice watch.<eos> It looks good.<eos> Oh, this?<eos> It's something I borrowed.<eos> I borrowed it.
I haven't had the guts to sit at my dad's desk since he left.<eos> I still feel like the little girl who used to play hide-and-seek under it.<eos> Look.<eos> This is your desk now.<eos> You've earned it.
I feel good.<eos> As a friend, I need you to take care of yourself.<eos> But as your co-worker, I'm helping you solve this case.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I found it in the victim's pocket.
-I have to find out where it is.<eos> I'll call Martin.<eos> It's Ayda. Yes?<eos> Turn off the engine.<eos> How did you get it?
-Risto?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -I found the computer with a fence.<eos> -I knew you would fix this.<eos> -When Adrian is free, you'll get it.
Amy, please don't swear like that in front of the kids.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Do not make me call your fathers.<eos> What the fuck? You're not answering your phone?<eos> - My family hid it.
- Outbreak?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Another dozen infected.<eos> We lost two officers this morning.<eos> But the rest are isolated, so we have it under control.
These Hyenas have burned six of our labs.<eos> Now we have nothing.<eos> That's him. How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?
Now we have nothing.<eos> That's him. How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?<eos> No, but he kept it.
That's him. How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?<eos> No, but he kept it.<eos> Didn't know we chipped it.
Against what?<eos> The future.<eos> This project is massive.<eos> It is.<eos> That's why we're calling it "Titan."
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called The Witness.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before the Mossad does, we find Titan, we find The Witness, we cut the head off of the snake.<eos> That's not gonna stop the storms out there.<eos> We save the world by killing the one who destroys it.
Just speak from your heart, and say whatever is on your mind.<eos> I want everyone here to see what I see.<eos> I want them to see that Powers are important, and that you are taking up their mantle.<eos> You are making the world a better place, a safer place, just like Janice and Harley did.<eos> I couple make this speech, and I usually do, but I'm giving it to you.
What?<eos> You caught Retro Girl's killer?<eos> FBI have him.<eos> Where is your uniform?<eos> I didn't wear it.
Here.<eos> Take it.<eos> This bastard...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Don't want it?
Take it.<eos> This bastard...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Don't want it?<eos> W-Well, I guess I'll have to take it.
She's not a friend. She's nothing to me.<eos> Huh?<eos> Hey, let's make a deal.<eos> I hid my treasure around this area.<eos> I'll give it to you in exchange for my life.
But lately I've been remembering all the little things about her that bothered me.<eos> Like her general looks and personality.<eos> Well, have you given any thought to dating again?<eos> No, and I'm pretty lonely, too.<eos> I mean, I sometimes make a drink and have it in front of my three-way mirror just so it feels like I'm at a party. You know, but that-that's only natural.
You know who's not burying words?<eos> The Chinese.<eos> I know there's lots of things I can't do.<eos> I can't read two books at once.<eos> I can't put on a winter coat unless I lay it on the floor first.
Some noob put up a sign for a lost sock.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> That is so lame.<eos> Did they find it?
I'm assuming it's not something bad.<eos> Why didn't your mom sign it?<eos> Didn't see her this morning.<eos> It's a trip to go back east to look at colleges.<eos> The school's organizing it.
And how many years is that gonna get us?<eos> It's my fault that Linda's in this situation.<eos> We can't let her die.<eos> We're sabotaging that rocket.<eos> We have to send it off course without alerting anyone at NASA.
Okay, launchpad's a mile away.<eos> You'd better get those security cameras looped by the time I get into frame.<eos> Okay.<eos> I forgot to cancel my second follow-up text.<eos> Do you want to read it to me?
Love you, too.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Cabe, come in.<eos> Merrick's got the detonator.<eos> He's demanding that you get over here, or he's gonna use it.
Crazy weird.<eos> But be okay with it, 'cause it's... it's great.<eos> Um, okay, so we'll help you clean up the goop in the morning?<eos> Oh, actually, no.<eos> I was gonna make papier-mâché figures with the ballistic gel and then heat-dry them in a kiln, because the gel changes color when you heat it up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
Look.<eos> Facial droop.<eos> That's... it's a classic sign of a stroke, right?<eos> Yeah, it could be a stroke.<eos> If it's a clot, the TPA will bust it right up.
- Parents say they don't know.<eos> Please, help him.<eos> Please.<eos> CPR was done in the field.<eos> We had a faint pulse, but we just lost it.
Take care.<eos> What's up?<eos> So, you, uh, you got the job?<eos> If I want it.<eos> Is that gonna be a problem for us if I take it?
The pond?<eos> Why the pond?<eos> It's just a pond.<eos> It's very much more than that.<eos> As borne out by the fact that you've returned to it again and again. More than 20 times.
While you're away, the Pastor and his wife will have an accident.<eos> Hey, Paige. Guess what?<eos> - We're going to Epcot.<eos> - What?<eos> She'll think about this, and she will figure it out.
Mr. Travis?<eos> - Clay Travis.<eos> - Mr. Travis.<eos> I may run a brothel...<eos> But I run it in accordance with the law.
I know this is very sudden.<eos> But this feeling was just as sudden.<eos> That day when you went on a date, I didn't like it at all.<eos> And when you got this makeover...<eos> I hoped that you did it for me.
Finally got to bed at 2:00 and then at 3:00, we all woke up with food poisoning from the tacos.<eos> Did I win this game?<eos> Mimi, you seem really overwhelmed.<eos> Are you gonna be able to come to my charity thing tomorrow?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
Lyme disease?<eos> Yeah, it's probably from a tick bite on one of your field trips.<eos> It explains your knee and the rest of your symptoms.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> I'm putting you on an antibiotic course, and hopefully we got it early enough to avoid any long-term consequences.
- It's show property.<eos> - Well, you know the saying...<eos> "Show property is yo' property."<eos> That's not a saying.<eos> Okay, I look good in it, so I stole it.
You won't even touch me.<eos> And then I find Beth's uniform?<eos> So you tell me, okay?<eos> What do you do with it anyway?<eos> You... you... you sniff it, you snuggle it, you put it on a coat rack and dance with it? !
I can do that, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, I presume you did this to get my endorsement.<eos> Well...<eos> You've already got it.
I miss you, darling.<eos> Take care of my Leonard.<eos> Yes, ma'am. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪<eos> When we were boys, we had to learn that sacred chant by heart and understand its meaning.<eos> By the end of this weekend, I expect all you boys to know it, too. ♪ ♪
The napkins.<eos> So... tell me, Nicky, how's the singing racket?<eos> Not bad, but it would be a lot better if I had a partner.<eos> My nephew warned me about this.<eos> Don't think about it.
In 1949, he started a construction business.<eos> And then, just three days ago, at the age of 100, he passed away.<eos> So Musaka kills his partner in cold blood.<eos> Then he stays here living under the radar for 75 years.<eos> And now, after all this time, he dies, and somebody goes right to the secret bunker and cleans it out.
They rose to power and continue to rule with an iron fist.<eos> It wasn't a world I wanted to live in.<eos> So I vowed to do something about it, not just for me and the people of Wayward Pines, but the entire human race... those awake and those heroes who still sleep, dreaming of a future for humanity<eos> as we battle to survive.<eos> I was wondering if I could borrow your bikini because you're not using it, and... I'm going swimming again tonight.
- Basically, yeah.<eos> - But it feels good.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> - Makes sense.<eos> - I--I... don't want you to fix it.
- A few hours ago, they didn't even know one another.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, wouldn't know it to look at 'em.<eos> - Shared trauma.<eos> Saw it in the Navy.
Damn!<eos> You all right, sweetie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you get your check okay?<eos> I got it right here.
Every night with those goddamn radios.<eos> - I can't hear myself think.<eos> - Well, close the window.<eos> Then it's too hot with the radiator.<eos> And you can't complain, you know, like yell out for them to turn it down.
Thank you, the dog will love it.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It is not a dog toy.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna chew on it.<eos> But who is gonna chew on it?
You look terrible.<eos> Sir Galavant, it's me, the Chef.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Why have you got Isabella's amulet?<eos> She never takes it off.
Yes.<eos> I can sign the contract right now.<eos> I'm in a foreign country but I can do internet banking with my phone.<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I'll send it in an hour and send you a text message.
- See you later, honey.<eos> - Okay, I will see you.<eos> - What's wrong again?<eos> - I lost the ring.<eos> I clearly put it in my pocket before the surgery.
"When you die in a nameless land for the sake of your country..."<eos> "the place of your death becomes your grave..."<eos> "and your uniform becomes your shroud."<eos> "This should be your mind-set whenever you put on your uniform."<eos> "If you have put it on with such mind-set..."
You should talk face-to-face.<eos> You're not the one to talk.<eos> It's always a hand-to-hand combat for me.<eos> What is this for?<eos> Who are you going to throw it at?
Give it to me.<eos> Come take it from me.<eos> Don't do anything you'll regret.<eos> Can't you take it from me?<eos> I said you'd regret it.
For some reason it seems like I should feel touched right now. I'm fine.<eos> I like the current Sergeant Seo Dae Young.<eos> The Seo Dae Young I know is either wearing an uniform or not wearing an uniform.<eos> It's only one of those two.<eos> Unless I take it off, nobody is touching that uniform.
Oh, you can't.<eos> I wasn't able to wash my hair today.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you didn't have enough water?<eos> You typically don't even wash it so why are you pretending like you do?
Oh!<eos> Oh?<eos> Oh.<eos> Why is the car like this?<eos> Why wouldn't know when you crushed it that much?
I think that they got the grasp of our strategy as well.<eos> The situation that we were worrying about has just started after all.<eos> Lieutenant Yoon./ The vehicle that was bringing over the medicine were all robbed from what I hear.<eos> Please stay with us while we treat Lieutenant Yoon.<eos> Whoever stole it, we should catch that bastard.
- Then...<eos> - You said my present is on the way.<eos> Can I open the present now?<eos> Keep it safely with you.<eos> You know that I need to buy that if you lose it, right?
If you want my advice, you should take advantage of this disturbance, forgo sleep, and find an activity which tests your abilities.<eos> Escaping elaborate restraints, for example.<eos> If that doesn't bother you, then why did you choose an activity that included noise-canceling headphones?<eos> I didn't say I was impervious to the noise,<eos> I merely said I was using it as an impetus.
I don't know anymore.<eos> Do you want me to talk?<eos> I was in love.<eos> He died.<eos> I found out he left me a message that he loved me, but I didn't get it.
Who else would want a record of this fever dream?<eos> Oh! Are you gonna finish this?<eos> They didn't budget a staff meal.<eos> It's our own fault we're poor.<eos> When we had money, we spent it all on drunken sailors.
I'm... just gonna...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm starving.<eos> Mmm. Oh, this bird is fantastic.<eos> Mmm! And when you mix it up with the potatoes and the... the beans...
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.<eos> I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.<eos> Just Richard and Nancy.<eos> I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.<eos> Only... I never needed it.
Oh, my God.<eos> My teeth.<eos> How much do you have?<eos> As much as I could make.<eos> When are you gonna tell me how you get it? If I told you, everybody's know.
Yes. Normally it takes years to become life threatening.<eos> Never happens this fast.<eos> Is there a possibility it's contagious?<eos> I hope not, 'cause this would really freak a lot of people out.<eos> Hmm. Listen, if I hadn't seen the body myself, I wouldn't have believed it.
This hyper-accelerated aging doesn't seem to be too rare.<eos> According to this research paper,<eos> "Medical Abnormality Linked to Extreme Aging,"<eos> there have been half a dozen cases in and around the Portland area in the last three years.<eos> They call it a disease cluster.
I made it for her on the day I realised I would be queen.<eos> When was that?<eos> I was 13.<eos> I was having a history lesson with Lehzen.<eos> She showed me the family tree and I looked at it for a long time.
It'll probably go away.<eos> Although, clearly, your ex husband is not about to.<eos> I tried to tell you that.<eos> Listen, if this case survives tomorrow, and it shouldn't, but if it does, my marching orders are not gonna be to merely argue the case.<eos> They are going to be to destroy the man bringing it.
This is who I am.<eos> You weren't always.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Even when I was a coward, I craved power.<eos> The only difference is, now I have it.
Yes, please.<eos> Hey, will you promise me something?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - No more secrets. Okay?<eos> You have a problem, you come to me and we figure it out together.
We're cool, right?<eos> Uh, one of my guys found the car abandoned this morning.<eos> Abandoned?<eos> Well, you know, unlocked.<eos> So he brought it here. Uh-huh.
Ah Chi ...<eos> you let yourself get stabbed because you like me, right?<eos> All I know is that 2 taels of silver are important to you.<eos> Do you like my body?<eos> You've earned it with your life.
Thrust and twist.<eos> Circular slash.<eos> These are the most basic killing moves.<eos> Your 1 3-Sword Style can only kill me if I err at my 7th move.<eos> A swordsman who knows his mistake but repeats it deserves to die.
Okay.<eos> Snap you like a string bean!<eos> Enough, enough!<eos> God.<eos> You guys don't stop it, I will lock that baby up, and none of you will ever see it.
Why are you being like this?<eos> You're about to be a grandma.<eos> Isn't it something even you can enjoy?<eos> For how long?<eos> Once you get the baby in that house, I'll never get to see it again.
I-I put it on Samuel and apparently he never sits down.<eos> The son of a bitch logged seven miles.<eos> That is not a believable number for you, my friend.<eos> Don't you think I know that?<eos> No, that's why I got to roll back the mileage before Molly sees it.
Why?<eos> Oh, you just go to the app and you hit a button and it'll find your wristband.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, because, I mean, maybe whoever found it needs it more than me.
never give a broad your phone.<eos> You walked seven miles?<eos> Mike, that is amazing.<eos> How did you find enough time to walk that far?<eos> You know, now that I think about it, this-this could have happened when I put it on Samuel for a few minutes.
And I saw online that somewhere between receiving the audio book approval copy and when she was murdered, Grace replaced her name on the book with a pen name.<eos> Maybe her husband wasn't as cool with Grace's book as he's letting on.<eos> Let's go pay him a visit.<eos> - She took her name off the book?<eos> - Grace never mentioned it?
Oh, come on, man, you're telling me the rich tech guru didn't spring for the microchip implant?<eos> - The tracker's not in the dog? - You're holding it.<eos> It's in the dongle.<eos> We're not far from the park where our missing tech guru was abducted.<eos> The kidnapper probably tossed it.
The publisher sent the PDF.<eos> "The little fool had no idea I put hemlock in her salad.<eos> "There she sat, her molars mashing the leaves into the shape of her destiny."<eos> "The shape of her destiny"?<eos> She wants me to send it to my editor, but I can't do that to Lerna.
You sent that email.<eos> Your nurse Todd confirmed you had a window box planter.<eos> The week before Grace's death, you ordered him to take it down, trash it.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He gave it to another one of his patients.
Your nurse Todd confirmed you had a window box planter.<eos> The week before Grace's death, you ordered him to take it down, trash it.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He gave it to another one of his patients.<eos> Now we have it.
Hey.<eos> Hey, Liv. What's up?<eos> Clive didn't tell you?<eos> About my lottery ticket?<eos> First I've heard of it.
Balls.<eos> So, the prognosis for me is, uh...<eos> The McDermotts, together in life, until its tragic end on State Route 520, shall be united in eternity in their custom-order double casket.<eos> I'm betting they were the kind of couple that finished each others' sentences.<eos> Ordered one dessert and shared it with a single fork.
If she loved you, would she have asked you to do this?<eos> Our forensics unit is sweeping the apartment.<eos> They just need one strand of DNA.<eos> One hair, a piece of skin, a drop of sweat.<eos> And when we find it, your chance at a deal is off the table.
Liv, sometimes closure's a bad thing.<eos> It didn't work out too well for poor Cassidy.<eos> Nick's our guy.<eos> His ankle monitor puts him at the time and place of the murder.<eos> We'll use it to track him down and arrest him.
-Why do have to make it all emotional?<eos> I have a body, all right?<eos> Can't you just think of me as a sexual object? Fine.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You want to back up that booty, back it up.
I do.<eos> - "Almost any..."<eos> - Wait.<eos> If Bailey was making a big buy from Steve, and he pats her down...<eos> - Discovers the wire... - Uses it to strangle her.
Oh, I got news for you, Steve.<eos> The money Bailey was gonna use to buy your Lucky U, the money you stole from her after you killed her, those were marked bills.<eos> Guess what's gonna happen to you when I find that money?<eos> Save me some time.<eos> Tell me where you've got it.
It was self-defense.<eos> You saved both of our lives.<eos> Maybe we don't report it.<eos> And we, uh...<eos> We, we smuggle the body out, and dump it in the bay.
It looks like a fucking IKEA schematic to build a credenza.<eos> I gave you an estimate.<eos> Use the original.<eos> Borns Tech has it.<eos> We haven't found it yet in the discovery,
Hmm. Happy hour start early in here?<eos> Big find in the tunnel collapse.<eos> A belt?<eos> How'd a belt get inside the tunnel?<eos> Guessing somebody disposed of it after they used it in a murder.
On American citizens.<eos> And that crossed a line.<eos> Larry and I decided that the potential for abuse was too great.<eos> So we mutually agreed not to tell the NSA about our daemon.<eos> You developed it at the NSA, so it's considered classified defense material.
ISI activates their network, they code it into the app.<eos> See, that's the odd part.<eos> Eric analyzed the app this afternoon, and he couldn't find the daemon anywhere.<eos> That's because it wasn't in the app this afternoon.<eos> It wasn't even in the code they showed Callen, but I was able to dig deeper, and I found it.
Or maybe you threw<eos> Overson's laptop into the marina.<eos> And maybe the coast guard fished it out a couple hours ago.<eos> And maybe Overson waterproofed his hard drive.<eos> Because he did use it in a boat after all.
Good news.<eos> You're an asteroid.<eos> Uh... please tell me what to say next.<eos> Perhaps I should explain.<eos> While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you. Oh.
Do not fire Callahan.<eos> Kill him.<eos> I ain't gonna kill the motherfucker just 'cause you say so.<eos> We also have your product, Duse.<eos> I will require you to sell it in your nightclubs.
Uh, supposed to be camping in Joshua Tree this weekend with friends.<eos> - Joshua Tree?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Did you check to see if he's actually there?<eos> That's where the phone showed up when I pinged it, and Watch Command figured, based on her history, Amanda was probably with him.
And it would be great if we could access this phone.<eos> Well, she's only turning 16.<eos> Maybe her parents have her password.<eos> It's, uh... 9-5-6-6.<eos> We check her cell on a regular basis because we pay for it, and because that horrible boy once sent her a text that...
Yes, yes, we fought, and she was mad about how I was going to go to Joshua Tree instead of her birthday party.<eos> Oh, uh, didn't you just say you only lied to your parents?<eos> You didn't go to Joshua Tree.<eos> Your phone went to Joshua Tree.<eos> You gave it to a friend, and then you ran off to Mexico, which is where criminals go when they want to hide.
We, uh, ended up moving into a new house ourselves.<eos> Starting over.<eos> You hid the door to your own basement in your own house because...?<eos> Basement wasn't up to code.<eos> We didn't have the money to fix it, so we just sealed it up as best we could and ended up renting it.
Uh, no.<eos> And, by the way, we've made our decision.<eos> Wow. That was fast.<eos> You have until 9:00.<eos> We don't need it.
Is there something we can do to this being to change a little way, to make it do something else?<eos> We are not scientists.<eos> We are experimenters.<eos> My implant is a microchip in my left hand, which is about the size of a grain of rice.<eos> I use it to access the office.
Sure, there's a danger to upgrading.<eos> Sometimes you move ahead before you're ready to go.<eos> However, if you don't change, you're gonna die.<eos> Great to see so many volunteers that want to try this new technology.<eos> The RFID chip is supposed to have a life-span of more than 120 years, so it will definitely live longer than you will if you keep it in.
Sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was kind of surprised that it was so fast for me to accept the chip as part of me.<eos> I still get, like, this "wow" feeling every time I scan it and it actually works.
The device is doing it for you.<eos> I don't care, and I don't have a family.<eos> It's my heart.<eos> I want it out.<eos> That's not possible, because if we take it out, you will die.
The kid is allergic to Keflex.<eos> O-okay.<eos> D-did he...<eos> did he go into anaphylactic shock?<eos> No, luckily, they caught it in time.
It made me think of Landigal.<eos> When we breached the mud hut with the boy.<eos> I don't want to talk about that day, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just brought it up because it reminded me of...
He's an expert in a field called transgenics.<eos> So what "transgenic" means is that you've taken a gene which you have constructed in the laboratory, and you've introduced it into the genome of the animal.<eos> When you look at this snout here, you'll see it's got a yellow tinge to it. Yeung:<eos> Hey, piggy, piggy.<eos> So what they've done is, they've taken the fluorescent gene, which is naturally present in jellyfish, and they've put it inside these pigs as a little marker, so they know which ones are transgenic or not. Yeung:
Yeung:<eos> Just egg-hunting.<eos> 16 eggs.<eos> You did great.<eos> We're taking one sperm, and we're injecting it into the yolk of the human egg.
Eventually, the more I dug into it, the more I began to find individuals who had been involved in some piece of it or who had witnessed some piece of it.<eos> And that meant talking to Americans, talking to Israelis, talking to Europeans, because this was obviously the first, biggest, and most sophisticated example of a state or two states using a cyber weapon for offensive purposes.<eos> I came to this with a fair bit of history, understanding the Iranian nuclear program.<eos> How did Iran get its first nuclear reactor?<eos> We gave it to them...
"Mike, I don't want any president ever to be faced with only two options, bombing or the bomb."<eos> Right? He...<eos> He wanted options that... That made it... Made it far less likely he or his successor or successors would ever get to that point where that's...<eos> We wanted to be energetic enough in pursuing this problem that... that the Israelis would certainly believe,<eos> "Yeah, we get it."
She was, but she's there now.<eos> -Hard to keep track of our girl, huh? -Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, it's pretty cut and dry here.<eos> We plant an egg in a viable body, we fertilize it and out comes a baby.
I mean, now I have something concrete to talk about at my Condé Nast meeting, and she mentioned publishing excerpts in Vanity Fair, which would be amazing.<eos> It's not really what I do, but it's good for now.<eos> And it's money.<eos> Money is nice.<eos> Now I have to hang out with her more to get a handle on the first few chapters so we can bid it out and see who wants it.
-Your lucky outfit?<eos> - Do not mock.<eos> I am not mocking.<eos> It's a great outfit.<eos> You were wearing it when I saw you in Hamburg.
- What do you think that means?<eos> - Luke, look.<eos> My mother took my advice.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> The advice that I gave her, she took it.
Uh, Liz Taylor just rose from her grave to say, "What?"<eos> Well, even Claudia just called him "your guy," like it's a beach blanket movie.<eos> We have been together, steadily, for nine years.<eos> Luke hardly ever comes by the house for dinner.<eos> I didn't have his number until I got it from Rory.
The one that's been after you forever, begging you to come work for them?<eos> - BrendaBlabs?<eos> - SandeeSays.<eos> Go there.<eos> - Have you seen it?
I'll do that!<eos> - Hi there.<eos> - Uh... just need your permit.<eos> Hold, please.<eos> I thought I put it in my pocket.
I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me, to ground me forever, to tell me how disappointed he was in me.<eos> And nothing came.<eos> And finally, I got up enough courage... to look up at him, and he was standing there... with a pretzel.<eos> A giant pretzel covered with mustard.<eos> And he handed it to me and he said, "Let's go."
So... you need money.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll get the checkbook.<eos> But, Mom, I... I wanna use Luke's franchise money.<eos> He doesn't want it.
But, Mom, I... I wanna use Luke's franchise money.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> It's just not who he is.<eos> Luke likes his empire small.<eos> And I know Dad left it to him, and I wanna honor Dad's memory, but... maybe this could honor it, too.
-No, it's okay.<eos> Rory's got it.<eos> She looks so grown up, but she is still a kid.<eos> -She wants Rory to take her nose ring out.<eos> -I'll take it out.
-Is that an actor?<eos> -No, it's the computer operating system.<eos> I know about it from Halt and Catch Fire, and I didn't watch the show that closely.<eos> Well, I have the instructions here Mr. Roundbottom gave me. Hold on.<eos> "Turn computer on." Did you turn it on?
- Go on.<eos> ♪ You are me in pants ♪<eos> ♪ And you are me in a dress ♪<eos> ♪ It fits a bit askance ♪<eos> ♪ I've tried it on, I confess ♪
I asked him to.<eos> He thinks we could imply someone else was there.<eos> Well, it will keep the jury occupied.<eos> They seem to want to chase the murder.<eos> Question is, will Cuesta let it in.
A-ha. - What is it?<eos> - It's a cheroot,<eos> Florence. Like the ones Tosh smoked.<eos> So, tell us, Mr Farrell why did you mop the floor of your boat?<eos> It was dirty, so I cleaned it.
The knife, as well?<eos> - Tosh's mobile?<eos> - That must have been in his pocket.<eos> Then what did you do?<eos> I brought the boat back into the harbour, cleaned it up.
Now, not too hard to achieve.<eos> I mean, he was already half-cut, as he was most days at that time.<eos> So, a few more swigs of booze would just tip him over the edge.<eos> And once he was out for the count,<eos> I assume you went and found his diving knife... and then planted it somewhere you could easily recover it when you needed it later on.
Because it wasn't the last time Sam saw Tosh. Was it?<eos> Cos on his way to the bar,<eos> Sam took a little detour via Newton Farrell's boat. Didn't you, Sam?<eos> You followed your dad along the quayside... and then onto Newton's boat.<eos> And once there, with Newton spark out, you took Newton's knife and you used it to kill your father.
I mean, not rubbing it in or anything, but my CV is basically bombproof. Whereas mine will look like a poster for a lost dog.<eos> Just take the bank job, then, JP.<eos> The suit is clearly your destiny.<eos> I can't wear the suit because I sashimied the suit.<eos> If I put it on, I'd look like I was in an explosion in a cartoon.
It's not so hard to believe.<eos> I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that you like me.<eos> Come on, Ben.<eos> You've got a charm switch.<eos> I've never seen it off.
Tell her I know what it's like to be sitting in this room, waiting to hear if everything's okay.<eos> Explain the procedure is called...<eos> Heterotopic transplant.<eos> Deana's heart will stay inside her.<eos> We'll take Thomas's heart and connect it on top of Deana's piggyback.
That's what you get for being better at school.<eos> When you're done with the dishes, mop the floor, Paige.<eos> Ha ha. Probably Stan.<eos> Uh, tell him there's no leftovers.<eos> Henry, if that plate is not clear by morning, you're eating off of it for breakfast!
_<eos> _<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> An owl.<eos> You saw it?
I'm offering to lead an army against theirs in open battle.<eos> Benedict.<eos> How did you know exactly where to find his reply?<eos> Concealed in the binding.<eos> I went over the book twice before you arrived, but you were able to find it right away.
I can do that style from memory.<eos> Your new orders.<eos> Details of your duties as commander of the garrison.<eos> Commander?<eos> New York may assign a new man, but since you have already held the post when I was a prisoner, I would imagine they'll let you keep it.
Oh, did I forget to tell you guys?<eos> I got great news.<eos> I sent all $800 to Erin, my love, in the mail.<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> You took our money that we all pooled together for the entire year and just gave it to your girlfriend?
What'd you just do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, guys...<eos> I think I'm doing that.<eos> The phone is telling the gate to lower and then I put it in the Faraday Bag, it blocks the signal, arm lifts back up.
Can we trace these components back to the person who built it?<eos> There are no fingerprints, no biologicals, no forensic trace of any kind.<eos> Whoever assembled this hardware-- they were very careful.<eos> I've imaged each component.<eos> Sending it back to Tear Down now.
Yeah, I'm with Raven.<eos> Jake reached out to a lot of people about the breach.<eos> Check out this hacker forum.<eos> See, this is how it all starts.<eos> You execute your first big hack, you start bragging about it... and nobody believes you actually did it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Go.<eos> Call 911!<eos> Do you have the hard drive?<eos> Achilles has it.
Screen one, that's Jake in the café at 3:04 p.m.<eos> Can we get closer to see who he's texting?<eos> No, I tried that, but the picture gets grainy.<eos> My guess is it's the fake Wizard, Echo.<eos> Well, we tried calling his phone, but we can see from the footage he's got it in airplane mode.
- Hold on. - [rasping and whimpering]<eos> - You're gonna be okay.<eos> - What can you tell me about Jess?<eos> How long has she been here?<eos> - She runs it.
Big, huge, definitely a dude.<eos> - Okay, you got the hair color, the eye color?<eos> - I already told you the lights were off.<eos> - Okay, just show me the profile.<eos> - She--he already erased it.
Oh. Available at most gas stations in town.<eos> What about the fuse?<eos> Ye old Zippo lighter.<eos> Wonder if this is actually covered under its lifetime guarantee.<eos> So the suspect pours diesel all over Kayla's office, lights it up and hopes she gets caught in the blast when the gas line ignites?
Fraud.<eos> Last few weeks.<eos> Small amounts at first. A few thousand here and there, and then, yesterday, after Captain Grant was killed, the entire account was cleaned out.<eos> A million dollars.<eos> You think Tyson Reed stole it?
I know what they are. I wrote half of them.<eos> You and Captain Grant were having an affair.<eos> Not technically.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means we never acted on it. We just talked about it.
- Thane!<eos> - At least the weather's nice.<eos> Good day for a walk.<eos> - I shouldn't have touched it.<eos> - Nonsense, you were brilliant sweetheart, we got it.
- Teela, I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> - Oh, don't be sorry.<eos> Yours is the hardest path and the darkest, and it will grow darker still before the end.<eos> - Thane, have a good time.<eos> You deserve it.
You know, self-policing is really the only way to go.<eos> My kids do not have a smartphone.<eos> They have an old-style flip phone.<eos> I'm not ready for them to have stuff that they can keep completely private yet.<eos> It's kind of a tightrope to walk to how do I give them enough freedom so that they know how to use it while, at the same time, make sure that they're using it responsibly.
Hack after hack, he could do more and more.<eos> [Henry] All technologies I use help me regain control over my environment.<eos> I found a power wheelchair I liked.<eos> A medical equipment vendor fitted it with a head array so I could drive with my head.<eos> I also have a device I control with brain waves which lets me sip single-malt scotch whiskey without needing a caregiver to spoon it to me.
You have a new girlfriend. Why is this a problem?<eos> 'Cause it's their fourth night of marathon activity in the last week.<eos> It's distracting.<eos> Quiet is indispensable to my process.<eos> How do you not hear it?
And you and I can be sure that someone will always be here to let us in when things finally go sideways.<eos> Exactly.<eos> This was a NORAD communications center back in the '80s.<eos> Guaranteed nuclear survivability.<eos> Tested it, have you?
Shut out.<eos> But not "discriminated against""<eos> Ahem. Who here has the law degree?<eos> I hope that was rhetorical.<eos> Uh, actually, I have it right here.
Jennings, I...<eos> I would've lost it.<eos> And we would not have gotten out of there alive.<eos> I was just doing my job.<eos> You do it very well.
Listen, it was Tom.<eos> He was supposed to get himself and Lila on the bus, and I...<eos> I don't know, I guess he just got mixed up about the schedule. And now he thinks it's all his fault.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I mean, he had the pick-up schedule printed out, but, I don't know, I guess he just read it wrong.
QUILL: Whoa! I am Groot!<eos> Hey!<eos> Give that back.<eos> I always wanted to get my hands on this artifact.<eos> Although you're not the one I was expecting to find in possession of it.
You couldn't wait, like, five minutes?<eos> Hey, you were the one who said we should go dig up info.<eos> Tell him what you found on the Spartax spy network, Drax.<eos> Ronan is performing a Kree purification ritual in an ancient temple.<eos> Ronan only does it once every celestial cycle.
There's really no need.<eos> Jameson's on notice.<eos> I'd like to see how he does.<eos> Thank you, Major.<eos> General Arnold has it in hand.
I'm either home or having the best hallucination ever.<eos> Anybody?<eos> Mm.<eos> I smell coriander.<eos> Laypeople call it curry.
The bloody rebellion, Jonathan.<eos> The bloody...<eos> Benedict Arnold tries to nab 3,000 Yanks and comes over with two bargemen.<eos> He's a rat who didn't get the cheese.<eos> The ship must be near sinking when the rats are leaving it.
Though I will not apologize for the punishment that Lieutenant Gamble received in kind.<eos> Gamble knew well the risks of our particular business.<eos> I suppose that Sackett knew the risks as well.<eos> I must say that he was quite impressed with the ruse that you concocted with Sutherland and Shanks.<eos> A master stroke, he would have called it.
Taylor: Yep, proper footwear is the key.<eos> This place is 62 acres. We walk it three times a night.
I like him. And I want you to run a background check on him.<eos> Romantic.<eos> Seriously. In this day and age, you can't trust anyone.<eos> I don't want to fall for the guy and then discover he's got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.<eos> Okay. I'll, uh, check it out.
Hello. Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter to the watch's battery.<eos> You think it's CIA, left over from my Thailand mission?<eos> Possible. Doubt we'll ever know for sure.<eos> Can't we track down where it was purchased?<eos> No. I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible.
I take it that you heard about what happened at Austin Elektra's house last night.<eos> You said you'd keep me in the loop.<eos> Look, we can explain.<eos> Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon.<eos> And our lab tested it this morning... it's clean.
To keep tabs on you, I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm.<eos> And I placed it...<eos> In my watch.<eos> That was you.<eos> Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.
He gave me up, didn't he?<eos> I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.<eos> No, Trevor. You gave yourself up.<eos> Back when your studio was doing Heat Wave, I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.<eos> But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid.
- Yes, I've been helping him for over a year.<eos> - Abe!<eos> - Ever since the murder of Captain Joyce.<eos> Oh, yes, I heard about that during my unfortunate captivity.<eos> They said the drummer did it.
- Abe!<eos> - Ever since the murder of Captain Joyce.<eos> Oh, yes, I heard about that during my unfortunate captivity.<eos> They said the drummer did it.<eos> No, Rogers said the drummer did it.
I'm ready, John.<eos> Took quite a lot to perfect the high roll.<eos> Did I get it right?<eos> You spent so much money tailoring this dress.<eos> Sure you want me to take it off?
This is helium, or you can use nitrogen.<eos> It's kind of a cooling effect.<eos> If you pulled that down and tightened it, you would be dead within five minutes.<eos> It's not aesthetic, you know, a plastic bag, but if you can't get any other way to, um... to die, and you wish to die desperately, then this is as good as any.<eos> And thousands of people have used it.
Thank you.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> We need to take a look at the AB-33 section, okay?<eos> The message is muddled.<eos> I wrote it, and I don't even know what it says.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.<eos> Her house is locked and she's missing.<eos> Even her phone's switched off.<eos> She's a hooker; Won't be easy to trap her.<eos> Will she be asking for a share in the money.. ...or ask for all of it?
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.<eos> The SIM Card... has been issued to this college ID.<eos> First year student, Holy Cross College.<eos> And listen... they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.<eos> Please tell brother to pay it.
Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Just asked.<eos> I'll tell you if I find it. - Okay.
Manik, you're so naive.<eos> Locking the door from inside... is an old grandfather's technique.<eos> The computer's hard disk is missing.<eos> Her cellphone isn't here either.<eos> There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
"This phone is no longer in service" thing.<eos> Well, m-maybe she got a new number.<eos> Yeah, or maybe she forgot to pay the bill.<eos> Or couldn't afford it.<eos> Or just didn't bother telling us she changed it.
This is Emma's mother's.<eos> She was wearing it in the hospital. Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I would never wear that.<eos> - Can I have it?
That was the plan all along.<eos> Admit it.<eos> Art, the world's only reluctant swinger, was just an act.<eos> I know your coat, Virginia.<eos> You wear it to the office every day.
We appeal, again and again if we have to, each time to a higher court.<eos> Which could actually be preferable to an outright win.<eos> A long, drawn-out case?<eos> How is that preferable?<eos> We take it to the national stage.
- It wasn't a sacrifice.<eos> - Bill...<eos> It wasn't.<eos> I did not do this for you or Libby or anyone else.<eos> I did it for myself.
I do beg your pardon, but you gentlemen seem to be having the most delightful game of five-card brag, and I would<eos> - surely love to buy in.<eos> - It's called Texas Hold 'em.<eos> Rules have changed a lot since your day.<eos> - Oh, I reckon I'd pick it up.
- No! No way!<eos> This is Earp land,<eos> - our land!<eos> - We can't hold off revenants from it. Not until we find the talisman...<eos> I know because I'm the one who buried it.
- We're talking about a woman's body.<eos> She has the right to choose what to do with it.<eos> - Yeah, and inside of that body, there's the baby's body, and that's the body we're talking about.<eos> - But it's inside the woman.<eos> - She doesn't even come into it.
Please.<eos> - Let me.<eos> - No.<eos> I cannot... I will not... Allow you destroy yourself, nor will I allow them to destroy you.<eos> Time will show us the way if you will but let it.
What if he takes his whole foot?<eos> Han needs all the height he can get.<eos> Didn't you say something about us having a money cushion?<eos> We can't use the cushion.<eos> We need it for the dessert bar in case we have a slow start.
[Kumpaya in Martu Wangka] Let me talk a bit about fire.<eos> This is how we learnt.<eos> Burn the country to create a burnt area and hunt there after the fire.<eos> We hunt game from the country.<eos> [Curtis Taylor speaking English] It's really important, the storytelling around a campfire... 'cause it kind of reminds us... that a lot of story about fire and how all the ancestral heroes used it, stole it, made the land and people better.
Just being out there, and just being out in the...<eos> [speaks Martu Wangka] [speaking English] ...in the homeland.<eos> Like, Kumpaya, she looks a bit frail. But when's she's out in the country and hunting, it makes her feel better.<eos> [in Martu Wangka] This goanna is full of shit!<eos> [Curtis speaking English] In preparation of the animal being cooked, we throw it over the fire, burn the sinew... and then we bury it inside a hole just beside the fire and cover it with coals.
It's funny taste, but smoking, it's got a smoked smell on it.<eos> You get it out from the fire, it tastes nice.<eos> [Kumpaya in Martu Wangka] Put more wood on the fire.<eos> [Michael] You know, behind every electric outlet, even behind every microwave oven, there is somewhere a fire burning, probably of fossil fuel, but it's hidden from us.<eos> Here we see it.
He says... Called me Roy. He says, "Did you cook this pig?"<eos> I says...<eos> I was afraid to say yes [chuckles] because I didn't have any business doing it, but then again, I said, "Yes."<eos> He said, "Come here."<eos> And so I really thought I was gonna get... get really blown out... but he got the moonshine jug and... poured a little bit in a glass and gave it to me.
It can be chef's recipe.<eos> He can create anything with the fresh, raw material.<eos> [Nestlé chef 2] We have a chicken tikka Maggi.<eos> So, first we capture the flavor from here.<eos> We take the kabob, we skewer it, and then we just put it inside.
The countries that make up this region today, from Egypt to Iraq, can no longer harvest enough wheat to feed their growing populations.<eos> So they have to import it from places that have surpluses, like Russia, Ukraine, Australia and the European Union.<eos> This imbalance creates a complex global wheat economy, in which countries like Morocco must rely on wheat harvested thousands of miles away.<eos> Every day, we get 300 metric tons of grain, that become 240 tons of flour.<eos> When we receive the grains, we clean it, we mill it, we sift it and we have different types of flours that we sell.
Now, in a big rustic loaf like this... it's a little harder to squish it... but it's still mostly air.<eos> And if you look inside, you can see that there's bubbles everywhere.<eos> Air is mostly what you're eating when you eat bread.<eos> Bread is a fascinating combination of cooking and biology and physics.<eos> Biology is involved because bread is alive before you bake it.
I prefer when they go in one at a time.<eos> I'll show you why.<eos> They come out nicer if you hold them back just a little bit.<eos> You know, I came into it with the question of, like, you know, "What is bread?<eos> And what is it about it that's worth doing again?
Hey, man, what's up?<eos> So, you look good.<eos> Death suits you.<eos> Pocket square come with the promotion?<eos> Bought it with the pay raise.
He a co-worker?<eos> He's an employee.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I dig his ink.<eos> Recognize it from Texas.
[Joon's mom] That would make me very happy.<eos> One other thing.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Park?<eos> This ring belonged to my mother-in-law.<eos> I've been keeping it for Joon's future wife.
Okay.<eos> Boop.<eos> This might be a stupid question, but can we chew the gum out?<eos> No, honey, I-I think we're gonna try the peanut butter next.<eos> I ate it all.
They set you up to be a hero.<eos> What is it you think I don't know?<eos> That you are one of us.<eos> Like it or not, you're a Grimm, and you understand how things really work.<eos> The Kehrseite have had this world for too long, and they've ruined it.
Every email you've made, every text you've sent, all of your contacts.<eos> I wouldn't be using that phone if I were you.<eos> I knew something was wrong.<eos> That's why the phone was in my left pocket.<eos> I normally put it in my right.
And what about the ones who didn't?<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your wedding ring.<eos> Oh, um... They never gave it to me.
By planting them in the first place.<eos> 'Cause nothing would grow in Wayward Pines.<eos> Why is that, Kerry?<eos> What's wrong with the soil here?<eos> Why didn't Pilcher account for it?
I'm sorry, you make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.<eos> They set fires at the corners, so that it would spread faster.<eos> The Abbies never used fire as a weapon before.<eos> Not in all the years we've been here.<eos> Until we used it against them to harvest the crops.
Don't worry.<eos> It wasn't either of them.<eos> This may be Idaho, but we're not that twisted.<eos> Well, don't dwell on the past, Kerry.<eos> Let's not even discuss it.
Maybe you'll have one.<eos> Maybe even... a different one.<eos> Yeah, or maybe I'll never get out of Idaho at all.<eos> The past.<eos> You carry it with you wherever you go, no matter what you do.
Pilcher told me!<eos> Jason, what is happening?<eos> I am your partner in everything!<eos> The past.<eos> You carry it with you wherever you go.
The sutures on Mr. Welch, they holding?<eos> They should be fine.<eos> I just wanted to say, sir, what you did in there with Jason...<eos> The pericardial tamponade.<eos> You didn't drain it first.
They should be fine.<eos> I just wanted to say, sir, what you did in there with Jason...<eos> The pericardial tamponade.<eos> You didn't drain it first.<eos> You didn't drain it at all.
I will see you in the mountains.<eos> So I noticed something interesting while doing the paperwork.<eos> Jason's blood type is AB negative.<eos> It's rare... something like less than one percent of the population.<eos> There were only four people awake in Wayward Pines who have it.
Ah, you got good taste, Miss Lady.<eos> James Baldwin.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> I'm buying it for you, then. How much?
- Yes, sir.<eos> - And full of wisdom.<eos> And I can't help but think that... the two of you must have been through all kinds of hell together.<eos> Doing what you've done. And looking how you look.<eos> You take the baton from the ones who've come before, and you carry it as far as you can.
- And full of wisdom.<eos> And I can't help but think that... the two of you must have been through all kinds of hell together.<eos> Doing what you've done. And looking how you look.<eos> You take the baton from the ones who've come before, and you carry it as far as you can.<eos> And then you hand it off.
(Didi on phone) No.<eos> But two of them did.<eos> Not exactly a smoking gun.<eos> But still a link.<eos> We'll take it.
You guys just got another follower.<eos> - Who?<eos> Ders.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I didn't get it yet.
There's my boys, Rancho's three biggest web celebs.<eos> You think I'm a celeb?<eos> Totes McGoats, man.<eos> You've been cranking out some epic content.<eos> Appreciate it.
- Man, later.<eos> Trilly's... Trilly's the best.<eos> Hey, you guys need to clear out of here.<eos> I'm gonna film a new Instagram video where I karate chop my head through a vodka-infused candied ham.<eos> I'm calling it a "feast of strength."
- Pete...<eos> The usual, please.<eos> That states the buyer's intentions, which could include anything<eos> - from rebuilding or remodeling...<eos> - They want to tear it down?
It was her case.<eos> It was supposed to be my case.<eos> Do you think I should tell him to take it back?<eos> Jo, you already did.<eos> If you wanted it, you'd be wearing it.
Frank?<eos> Mama is looking for you.<eos> You're to open the ball.<eos> Good.<eos> You shall open it with him.
She told me not to go into that tent, and I did it anyway.<eos> - I left her.<eos> - Chase, it's not your fault.<eos> We know that Phenotrans is responsible for the East Mission outbreak.<eos> - That the US Army covered it up.
But don't worry, Afterlife will still happen just the way you wanted it to.<eos> You're willing to kill me to save humanity.<eos> Are you willing to make the same sacrifice?<eos> None of us want to kill anybody, but I will.<eos> There's a Telnet port open in the network security appliance, we use it for local management.
No, probably not, but here's my selfie stick, and you guys can play with that.<eos> Use it to peer around corners as lookouts.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> I was wondering why you were using it.
I wasn't fighting for Skaikru today.<eos> I thought I was fighting for myself, but I now know that's not true, either.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it equally because we are equal.
Yeah, well, losing a wife can do that to you.<eos> I got meetings up the ass. What's this offer?<eos> Well, um...<eos> Dion and I have... Well, actually it was Dion, Rie, and me... We, uh, we've always wanted our own place, a restaurant.<eos> We'd name it, um, Thirio.
There's, uh, there's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> Which is?<eos> I need, uh... I need legal advice.<eos> Look, we're about to open up this restaurant, and the investor's given us this massive contract.<eos> Look, is there any chance you could eyeball it just to, I don't know, let us know if... I don't know, if it looks okay?
- A burner... so no GPS.<eos> - TARU just triangulated.<eos> The last call came from Saxon Woods.<eos> I got an emergency exception to put a Triggerfish on her phone.<eos> If it's on, we'll find it.
You're the one who shot at her last night.<eos> All I'll say, they were right.<eos> She did it.<eos> Find the money?<eos> Not all of it, not even what I lost personally, so I'm not sharing it, if that's what you're getting at.
Hi.<eos> So, what are you doing over there?<eos> We just might've solved your problem about using my office.<eos> I don't have a problem with that.<eos> Well, whoever's problem it is, I'm gonna fix it.
Anyway, maybe he fixed it to protect your feelings.<eos> No, that doesn't sound like Ed.<eos> (Clears throat) (As Ed) Maybe he fixed it to protect your feelings.<eos> (Normal voice) Anyway, enjoy your photo and your parking spot, and, of course, the $15 gift card.<eos> Hmm. Actually, they... they raised it to $25.
Put the stuff down for a minute.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> If you have turned this into an office for me, I don't want it.
Don't try and get me to open up.<eos> Won't work.<eos> I made a bad decision once, and my Uncle Ben paid the price for it.<eos> So I understand.<eos> But the past doesn't make you a monster unless you let it.
The point is getting someone's hopes too high can be a dangerous thing.<eos> Yeah, but so is living your life in darkness.<eos> Now, are you gonna tell me what you got or not?<eos> All right, what we know is Babish was using a credit card in town the last two days.<eos> He rented a car. NOPD found it.
Well, if it was here, it's gone now.<eos> Patton, tell me some good news.<eos> Why you think they keep me around?<eos> I went deep diving through Zorn's credit card history.<eos> Turns out, he bought his laptop six months ago. And that particular bad boy has built-in geo-location software. And I tracked it right to Babish's pad in Lafitte.
Yeah, I don't think so, buddy. We're in said pad, and it ain't here.<eos> That's the pinging locator sound.<eos> The rest should be self-explanatory.<eos> Sounds like it's in the chimney.<eos> You want me to come down there and get it?
And here you are, in my wedding gown.<eos> I mean, you may as well have just signed a confession.<eos> First of all...<eos> I look amazing.<eos> And I'll admit, I was surprised when I tried it on and it fit like a glove.
Who are you?<eos> Okay, this is just creepy, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.<eos> Help, somebody!<eos> Ivanka Trump is trying to kill me!<eos> And then I took my heel and threw it right at her face and just ran as fast as I could.
Re-establish trade with the lake walkers...<eos> Machk won't... Machk will listen to you.<eos> He has to, Or his people will not survive the winter.<eos> Once I kill benton, you swear to me, You'll leave his empire in ashes.<eos> Swear to me you'll see to it.
Only that Greshamsbury will not be saved by the gold from the oil of Lebanon.<eos> Thorne.<eos> Can I help you, Scatcherd?<eos> You know what I told you about the will?<eos> I do, and it troubles me that you have not altered it, if you've done something you don't want to do.
Dude, my wife's gonna kick my ass.<eos> And we're supposed to have sex on Tuesday.<eos> What, you have to schedule your sex?<eos> Lame.<eos> I have it every Thursday I want.
Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.<eos> Sheldon, did you draft the contract?<eos> You bet I did.<eos> Ooh. You're gonna make out so hard tonight.<eos> So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
Jesus.<eos> Yeah, that'd do it.<eos> Pelican Cove.<eos> Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the place yesterday.<eos> I wanna take it.
- How far away are you?<eos> Quite a ways.<eos> I missed my flight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, not missed it but...
(sighs) And in those days, you didn't have a choice.<eos> I mean, you just had the baby.<eos> I was young and stupid.<eos> I went through my eighth grade pregnant.<eos> Then I had the baby and I gave it away.
All right, I said some stuff yesterday, you know, trying to be a tough guy when I said...<eos> "I don't care if you sell this place,<eos> I don't need this, I'll be okay without this. "<eos> Well, I won't.<eos> I just won't, so please, please don't sell it, Horace.
And then we have a little bit of money and then- and then what?<eos> - Horace...<eos> - I got another idea.<eos> (chuckling) Okay.<eos> What if we split it three ways, like she's saying, but we keep it open?
You're still a little high, aren't you?<eos> I sure am.<eos> There.<eos> You wanted you wanted to know my net worth.<eos> You got it.
Okay.<eos> I can do that, but I can tell you right now you're not going to like what you find.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> There was a lot of money in there.<eos> We spent most of it, but I think it's Sara you're worried about, right?
It's like all the power in this ship is pulsing through me.<eos> I feel almost invincible.<eos> We should shut down the link.<eos> Why the hell would we do that?<eos> We don't need it.
Even if that is true, how do we know they haven't messed with her programming?<eos> In case you haven't noticed, we're playing catch-up.<eos> We need to run diagnostics, check systems logs.<eos> The fastest, most efficient way to do that is with a link.<eos> Maybe, but you know what could happen if you maintain it for too long.
- ...just 18.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We know.<eos> This security video from the ATM where your father and uncle were killed, it'll be pretty gruesome, Buzz.<eos> You want me to watch it first?
Well, I can't have an abortion.<eos> I'm too far along.<eos> I'm... I'm not even suggesting that, Mom.<eos> Well, what are you suggesting, besides that I'm a terrible person with no ability to change?<eos> That you have the baby, Mom, but you put it up for adoption so that the child has a decent chance at a normal life.
Okay.<eos> First... First we look at the color.<eos> Is it neon purple or ruby garnet?<eos> Crystal clear or slightly hazy?<eos> Now we swirl the wine, get some air into it, you know?
Oh, my God.<eos> My God.<eos> Where'd the tart come from?<eos> Preserved lemon.<eos> - Val added it to the braised rabbit. - Mmm!
Coming!<eos> Wait a minute, hold on!<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Andy! There is a deal to be made here.<eos> Trust me, if there was a deal to be made here, My mother would have made it.
And they say people don't change.<eos> But you're saying, Mike, that this currency was never distributed to the Sunnis?<eos> No.<eos> According to records, the Army personnel in charge of financial support were caught in an ambush and were ordered to torch the cash.<eos> And then it shows up here, where our victim uses it to tip a girl in a strip joint.
No, Vince wanted the American dream... beautiful wife, great car.<eos> He just... just didn't have the skills to make it, man.<eos> Like you do.<eos> The knife.<eos> Vince took it off a dead Republican guard, brought it with the money.
Screw you!<eos> Terrorism?<eos> !<eos> Does the FBI actually expect this terrorism charge to stick?<eos> Well, now that they know who did it, they'll be able to reverse-engineer Vince's Internet uplink.
Lighter fluid, maybe.<eos> But it looks like people might've grilled here.<eos> We've already covered that a half-hour ago, Beforeyouwere late.<eos> Kendall, you get anything from this mess?<eos> I mean, we'll know better once we sift through it under a microscope, But i'd say the victim was cut up.
And the thumb -- i'll do what i can.<eos> How lieutenant tao thinks he could get a full print From it, i don't know, but yuck.<eos> Does julio still have anger issues?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You don't just get therapy, Find the problem, and then fix it forever.
i knew it.<eos> That recent photo of adrian sent from their computers -- Not so recent.<eos> Well, how old is it?<eos> 126 weeks.<eos> Someone took an old post of adrian's, repurposed it, And sent it to his social-media team.
I don't care how mad you are at someone.<eos> Divorce is always better.<eos> As for me and mine, for example, We just found ourselves unsuited And decided to go our separate ways.<eos> After you beat her with a clothes hanger And locked her in the closet for two days.<eos> We call it a wardrobe.
No, this is the first time.<eos> You worked with Jeff Dellinger?<eos> For five years, cubicle by cubicle.<eos> And you were working with him, next to him, when this alleged espionage took place?<eos> I don't know why they call it espionage.
Mr. Froines, to your knowledge, did Mr. Dellinger access classified documents and information<eos> - while he worked under you?<eos> - He did more that that.<eos> He... downloaded classified material<eos> - and leaked it to journalists.
- after he shot up the cameras?<eos> - Uh, no, sir.<eos> It looks like our nutjob just wanted what was in his car.<eos> Okay.<eos> After he unpacked his vehicle, did he just leave it behind?
- Do we know?<eos> - Uh, the computer requires a log-in before we can search it for that, but the attendant gave our killer a HOLD slip for the DMV, so whatever car he came back for has an expired registration.<eos> They don't tow your car for that.<eos> But it's a good reason to not drive it around with a bag load of guns.<eos> So maybe that's why he left it.
4300 block of Eagle Rock Boulevard.<eos> Buzz: Elliot Chase only has a PO Box listed, and his secondary address is his ex-wife's house in Mid-City.<eos> Hold up. Captain. Do you think the photo of the suspect should go out to the media?<eos> No.<eos> If Mr. Chase has a plan, I don't want him to accelerate it due to a press report.
Very Vanilla.<eos> What difference does it make how vanilla the smoothie is?<eos> Look, that oxy...<eos> That cost me a lot of money.<eos> I would never split it with that smug bastard ever.
He's told so many lies about me, I still wake up mad as hell.<eos> Did you happen to run in to Mr. Cushing lately...<eos> This morning, yesterday evening?<eos> Your phone could probably tell us.<eos> You want us to check it out?
a student maybe.<eos> Run that video back a bit, Buzz, to the moment where campus doll 101, gets into Eric's very nice car.<eos> It's not exactly mine.<eos> I drive it a lot, but...<eos> Well, it's registered in your name, and the dealer said you paid cash for it.
You little...<eos> where's the remote?<eos> Put the remote back on the table right now, Or I will arrest you for theft.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't want it anyway. You probably touched it.
That's why.<eos> Yeah, he was screwing my little girl.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Last week, Brie came by, And while I cooked dinner, She took our dog for a walk and left her phone on the counter.<eos> It lit up with a text from Bobby, and I saw it.
He's not a real uncle.<eos> He's in the Army. How 'bout where he lives?<eos> It's so great he gave you this gift.<eos> Can I just look at it again for a moment?<eos> I'll give it right back to you, I promise.
See you in five. (Laughs)<eos> Hey. What, you're riding with me?<eos> - Yeah, why not?<eos> - Well, what about your car?<eos> Someone will get it.
White shirt?<eos> He told me to tell you that he must leave soon.<eos> Huh'? !<eos> He said he wrote a message for you on the inside of the old wardrobe.<eos> He said to read it before it gets thrown out.
(gunshot)<eos> Modern medicine has made incredible advances in restoring eyesight, thanks to cutting-edge technology and a revolution in cost-efficient materials.<eos> And that could mean a total transformation for millions of visually impaired people desperate to see again.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> The white, cloudy, substance you're seeing is the cataract, which is a cloudy lens, so I'm just very gently teasing the lens until it's free, and now we're going to remove it from the eye.
Dr. Handa's just attaching the actual device now, and then wrapping it around with a sort of belt to keep it in place.<eos> Those little dots there are the 60 electrodes?<eos> Handa: Correct.<eos> It's incredible that what looks like this tiny little piece of plastic could possibly give the gift of sight back to someone's eye.<eos> So now I'm putting it into the eye. Yeung:
Is it in the distance? Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> Holding it the wrong way? I think we're holding it-- Yeah.<eos> Makes more sense.<eos> You can turn it different ways to make it what you want. But while Marti is now trying to make her way in the sighted world, her transition out of total blindness wasn't easy.
The flag poles on the map were in the same order of the actual flag poles on the property.<eos> And once you figured that out, you could just count them on the map. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12... One, two, three, four...<eos> And then run down the rows and count the same flags to match the flags that were in our books.<eos> This is a map of the grounds.<eos> Just keep it between us.
They're going to make it, guys. They're going to make it.<eos> JESSICA: Our train is right here.<eos> (ALL GASP) DANA: Are we moving?<eos> ! We missed the train.<eos> Could they have missed it?
I had a heart attack?<eos> How were her electrolytes before she coded?<eos> Good. Within normal limits.<eos> Her heart rate was over 200 on the monitor.<eos> Did Lisa see it?
Oh, God!<eos> Um, uh, I need a suture kit.<eos> No.<eos> You know, I actually...<eos> I don't need it.
Okay, fine.<eos> Fine, great.<eos> Then I don't deliver Charles' placenta.<eos> After I cut the cord, I sterilize it.<eos> I put it back inside, and we put Mom on antibiotics.
Sure.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> She's... she's wearing her wedding dress.<eos> Was that not discussed?<eos> Your father brought it by earlier.
If you don't take it, it's going to be zero cents on the dollar.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> This money is from our partner buy-in fund.<eos> It's the only cash we have.<eos> And once the partners find out that we're using it to settle, they're gonna come after it.
I can't afford Zane's buy-in.<eos> What?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Jessica, listen to me.<eos> You know what I did that Hardman found out about, but what you don't know is why I did it.
Go.<eos> We get a sample of the poison that Bobo used, and maybe Black Badge can reverse engineer a cure.<eos> There's a whole whack of it in the basement.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> 'Cause I was there when Bobo's guy made it. Shh!
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.<eos> - Her head is crushed.<eos> The ice is penetrating through the side and the back of her skull.<eos> Yeah, looks like the ice clipped the carotid.<eos> It's up against the wound, but if we move it, she'll start to pump.
Mr. Tacker, I promise you we'll talk about this later, but right now, our concern is your safety, so we got to get you up to surgery.<eos> No, no!<eos> Cut it off!<eos> - We'll talk later.<eos> - I want it off!
It's not part of me.<eos> How long have you felt this way?<eos> Since I was a little boy.<eos> Four or five.<eos> I'd look at it and it just felt strange.
- Good.<eos> - Clamps.<eos> - Clamp.<eos> I don't see the vessel.<eos> It's buried in the fat, but you've got it.
He slipped his restraint!<eos> He made a tourniquet out of tubing.<eos> - Half milligram dilaudid.<eos> - Yes, Dr. Charles.<eos> No, no, no, don't touch it!
No, keep it. That'll make this business.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Hey, the kid may have small hands and short arms, but one thing we now know he can do is the boy can run.<eos> He's even quicker chasing the ball. Believe me.<eos> Listen, when I'm wrong, I own it.
Gabriela said you had some news regarding your campaign?<eos> I wanted to announce I'll be deferring the alderman's salary if elected.<eos> And what inspired that decision?<eos> There's still families Alderman Becks hasn't helped out after the tornado.<eos> They need it more than I do.
They need it more than I do.<eos> Is that one of the issues you'll be bringing up in the final debate?<eos> The final debate was last week.<eos> Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.
Oh, don't you play coy with me.<eos> You know that's just for buying cars.<eos> Okay.<eos> I... I-I couldn't stand to see you in a dress anymore, so<eos> I threw the dress into the Paretskys' backyard, their dog saw it, came over, cowered a little, and then he had diarrhea all over it.
You got good wine, Pete. - I didn't say he didn't.<eos> - You know, Horace, just--<eos> Stop your pressing his fucking buttons with your passive-aggressive shit.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - The guy in the wine store said that this was a good wine for the price, and that if you open it up an hour before you eat, it gives it time to breathe and for the aromatic--
Pay yourself an extra 50¢ an hour, make up the difference.<eos> - An extra buck an hour.<eos> - Done.<eos> Nice stroller.<eos> Where'd you get it?
Zoning board is on my ass.<eos> Where is that, uh, environmental impact study for the redevelopment project?<eos> - Which one?<eos> - The west side.<eos> I'll call Fitz, tell him we need it ASAP.
We're planning on redeveloping that whole block.<eos> You sure?<eos> Remember what happened to that chicken place over on LaSalle?<eos> Homeless guy started that kitchen fire to stay warm, burnt half the building down.<eos> If I stayed on as manager, would you keep it open?
- with an ophthalmologist right away.<eos> - Could he lose his eyesight?<eos> The thing is, the eye's paralyzed.<eos> It's trapped in the fractured socket.<eos> We get in there, we free it, then we drain the blood.
I got a very nice guest futon.<eos> You ever have any guests?<eos> Well, you would be the first to actually stay on the futon.<eos> Yeah. Why am I not surprised?<eos> Why'd you even buy it?
Knock it off, or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.<eos> - You wouldn't. - Watch me.<eos> Fine, I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you for the thoughtful gift.<eos> I really do appreciate it.
Standard plumbing pipes aren't big enough for humans to fit through.<eos> No duh, but they are small enough to easily clog.<eos> I can modify a toy submarine with a GPS tracker.<eos> Drop it into the municipal system.<eos> Sly controls it from the garage.
Your country thanks you for a job well done.<eos> Now I'd get lost if I were you.<eos> TOBY:<eos> W-wait, uh... you forgot a diamond.<eos> It's a little smudged, 'cause, uh, we used it to cut through steel.
Fan out!<eos> Here's your hall pass.<eos> Don't let the principal catch you.<eos> (badge smacks)<eos> I swear I had it.
Mm-hmm. At the wedding reception, I'll introduce you to my boss's daughter...<eos> Perfect match.<eos> I like your school uniform, Hennessy.<eos> It's funny because it's so close to my normal aesthetic,<eos> - but why are you wearing it?
It's the target.<eos> We ask for compensatory damages in the amount of $80,000, and $10,000 in punitives, along with a clear instruction from the court that the defendant may not shoot drones out of the sky.<eos> Actually, Your Honor, I would like an opportunity<eos> - to examine him first.<eos> - He's already admitted to shooting it down.
Peter, you're always being indicted.<eos> If it weren't today, it would be tomorrow.<eos> I'll have my lawyer call.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot a drone, so he brought it down safely and he returned it.
Why?<eos> We're being offered a plea bargain by the AUSA.<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Three years in prison?<eos> The evidence doesn't support it.
If you're worried about embarrassing me...<eos> I'm not worried about anything, Alicia.<eos> When people think bad things of you, they keep thinking bad things.<eos> What you have here is office gossip.<eos> Who got it for you?
What you have here is office gossip.<eos> Who got it for you?<eos> Your investigator?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna use it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I make a confession to you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I never liked wine.<eos> I only drank it 'cause you liked it.
We're offering a chance for something better.<eos> Connect with Frankie, believe in Frankie.<eos> And you get... better.<eos> Now, we have the message.<eos> Next question is, how do we communicate it to the people?
648, to be precise.<eos> Having read the bulk of them, I confess I do see the appeal.<eos> If you strip away the silly outfits, square jaws and skull-sized breasts, there is a cardinal devotion to justice.<eos> The attention to continuity, however, is laughable.<eos> This is the tenth issue from the 1940s, and you took it out of its bag.
Not him, not the things he stands for.<eos> It's just funny how you had your own Midnight Ranger costume all ready to go.<eos> I didn't have it "ready to go."<eos> I had this costume for years.<eos> I bought it to go to a comic book convention.
Uh, you hear about the Midnight Ranger murder?<eos> Yeah, the guy in the cape.<eos> Heard he got shot the other night.<eos> That was his phone.<eos> He used it to alert police to street crimes he couldn't handle alone.
Our rebellion against Him was entirely just.<eos> Just or unjust, your rebellion failed.<eos> Yes, we failed.<eos> And we fell to a place so far from the light that we forgot what light, and life, even was.<eos> - We call it Hell.
No.<eos> See, I listen until it builds into something like a roar.<eos> And then I wait for that perfect moment to silence him.<eos> See, murder is a fine art.<eos> I would have done it just for the Dark Lord's honor.
It's a good ad.<eos> Well-produced, but it's dead, bro.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can't use it.<eos> So we scrapping it?
Or what?<eos> What are you people going to do?<eos> Oh, for the record...<eos> I know you didn't really transfer that money into my account, and that's okay.<eos> I don't want it.
And neither tied Frank Thatcher's dockers to that pony.<eos> I am watched.<eos> By Mr. Shine?<eos> He wishes to dice me for his cooking pot.<eos> I shall not ask it of you again, Drum.
It's high school... a fresh start.<eos> First impressions are key.<eos> Most people decide what they think about you within the first seven seconds of meeting you.<eos> It's in this fascinating book I've been reading.<eos> I found it by happenstance because it was erroneously mis-shelved.
Lily, we were gonna open Grams' gifts together!<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> Grams left you a watch.<eos> Oh! The note says,<eos> "Your grandpa tore it right off of a dead kraut's wrist."
- Hey.<eos> - Hey. - Got you a coffee.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I don't know if you take it black or with milk or soy or anyway... I brought everything.
I made a joke.<eos> You cut the car in half.<eos> No.<eos> The firefighters did.<eos> They were already slicing it up to try to extricate Phony Tony, so I just asked them to go ahead and bisect it.
Mm-mm.<eos> No, no, yeah.<eos> She calls us.<eos> Tells us when and where to pick up the money.<eos> Where do you drop it off?
We are not letting her walk, McGee.<eos> We are absolutely sure that Senator Kelly did this?<eos> I don't trust a word she says.<eos> How did she learn about the senator military secret?<eos> Journalists, political rivals-- nobody could dig this up, but some hustler figured it out?
I just gave you a great opening to lie one more time and you didn't take it.<eos> Look, there is no way that I can possibly explain this to you.<eos> Then try by telling me how you'd explain it to yourself.<eos> Okay, I used to think what if there was a button that I could push and all of the things that have complicated my life would just unhappen?<eos> I would push it, and all of the people that shouldn't have died would still be alive.
- Where are you going?<eos> - To get the file.<eos> The more information they have on her, the better.<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - Where did you put it?
- To get the file.<eos> The more information they have on her, the better.<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - Where did you put it?<eos> I-I don't know, I had it with me when I went to Toby's this morning.
- It's gone.<eos> - Where did you put it?<eos> I-I don't know, I had it with me when I went to Toby's this morning.<eos> I took it.<eos> I gave it to Toby.
Oh. We'd be implicating her in the murder.<eos> Uh, Elliott just sent me a text.<eos> It's a pin drop of his location.<eos> How does he have your number?<eos> I gave it to him when I was looking after Ali.
Afterward, I walked you to your apartment so I could tell you about my job.<eos> But there was this violinist playing on Kenyon so we sat in this stoop for a minute to listen... And I thought why ruin the moment.<eos> And when we finally got to your door I started to tell you about my job but you were distracted looking for your keys.<eos> I couldn't stop staring at that little cleft in your chin... thinking about how I wanted to trace it with my finger... And kiss you.<eos> 'So I never told you about the job' and I called them the next day and I told them that I didn't want it.
That's noble... But you can't hide this forever.<eos> At some point, people are gonna expect, you know... a wedding.<eos> Oh, my God, my bracelet.<eos> I-I had a gold chain bracelet on, and now it's not here.<eos> Well, when did you have it on last?
Okay. Um, Spencer Hastings, this is Detective Marco Furey.<eos> He is my new supervisor on the Rollins case.<eos> - It's nice to meet you.<eos> - Yes, you as well.<eos> Uh, well, I'm sure you guys have a lot of work to do so I will let you get to it.
You wanna tell me why you're here?<eos> Alison found a slip of paper with this address on it at her house.<eos> So we told her that we would check it out.<eos> Do you have this slip of paper?<eos> We left it with her.
Yeah, well, Toby's squad car probably scared them away.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't tell you guys earlier but I really screwed up today.<eos> Jenna showed up at the house asking for Elliot and now I think she knows that we're on to her.<eos> Thanks to me, she knows about the burner phone and I'm pretty sure she can figure out that he wouldn't just give it to us without a fight.
Bartender...<eos> They look... really excited.<eos> That why the Airstream was broken into.<eos> Noel wanted that file.<eos> Well, if Noel did steal it then there's something in it we didn't see.
Okay.<eos> I went to get Yvonne's things and the only thing missing in that Airstream was that file.<eos> I'm so sorry that I dragged you into the middle of this.<eos> Toby, I feel terrible.<eos> Well, I'm gonna find out who took it.
Jessica had a file on each of us.<eos> She was investigating us.<eos> Yeah, all of us except Aria.<eos> She doesn't have a file.<eos> Do you think somebody took it?
You can't just buy something like that at a costume store, which means he had...<eos> Either the killer is an expert tailor and mask maker, or he had it made by someone who is.<eos> Okay, I was thinking the second option.<eos> Okay, so, then, all we have to do is use ourselves as bait to draw the green meanie in, and then figure out a way to cut a piece of fabric off his costume and bring it around to all the fabric stores in the area,<eos> see if they recognize it like they do in those forensics shows.
Because we are a real couple.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> And then, maybe... just maybe... when Dean Munsch dies,<eos> I'll rip that ring off her cold, dead finger and give it to you.
Of course it will.<eos> Um, I'm not...<eos> I'm not sure that it will.<eos> I mean, it might scald a layer of brain tissue, but I don't think it'll leave any lasting damage.<eos> Plus, she won't even feel it.
We performed a nerve block in your neck so you won't feel any pain, and I've given you a mild dose of clonazepam - to keep you calm. - Mmm.<eos> Calm?<eos> Okay.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I mean, you opened up my brain and exposed it to the world.
What are you doing?<eos> Kara, this is crazy. Why can't you tell me what's going on?<eos> - Where's the diaper bag?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I thought you had it.
MacMillan Utility is basically Sonaris virus with lipstick.<eos> And only two KLOCs out of 452 separate it.<eos> And those two KLOCs completely changed the functionality and purpose of the entire program.<eos> It's completely amazing.<eos> And, you know, I pulled it apart in less than a day.
But you should be able to get a sense of the place.<eos> I know I speak for all the investors when I say how delighted we are with the growth of the individual user base.<eos> That tastes terrible.<eos> I mean, that tastes just like... ugh.<eos> Look, we may not have seen it at the start, but the people have spoken and you truly are the thought leader that we always knew you were.
Raymond, without that consummation there will be no Louis coutures, no Sun King, and no golden age of France.<eos> Which means by extension no Madame Curie, no Louis Pasteur.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, history will be totally screwed, but I don't have to be there for the actual... you know, consummation, do I?<eos> It's beautiful, Your Grace.<eos> As is yours. Who gave it to you?
March 23, 1972, you walked out of a movie theater --<eos> "Slaughterhouse-Five."<eos> You loved it, and you bumped into a big Marine and you knocked him flat on his ass.<eos> You were embarrassed, and he laughed it off, said you could make it up to him with a cup of coffee.<eos> So, you went to, uh, Mulroney's and you talked and he was cute and he knew the words to every Zeppelin song, so when he asked you for your number, you gave it to him, even though you knew your dad would be pissed.
You're just bad at your job.<eos> Yeah, and you're better?<eos> So much better.<eos> You drive back roads, catching cases at random.<eos> You get word a body's dropped, you check it out, and maybe you even kill the thing that did it.
We have a problem.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Now what?<eos> Well, we got her number.<eos> Let's head back to the bunker, and we'll put a trace on it.
Maybe that means something?<eos> There was a news story about this area a couple months ago.<eos> Some locals cried miracle when a nearby creek ran red with blood.<eos> Turns out there's a slaughterhouse with a drainage issue nearby.<eos> They closed it down.
And even with a big payoff, it would have been tough to get him to walk away from that role.<eos> Unless you promised him he could keep it anyway.<eos> With your brother dead, the life rights would revert to you.<eos> I could care less about the El Oso biopic.<eos> I told him he could direct it for all I cared.
Her first word.<eos> Her last.<eos> We need to get her body back. I need to see it buried.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> Molly, I want her body back, too, but they're not gonna give it to us.
Where do you-- do you have far way to walk, shamefully?<eos> - Not very far.<eos> - Hmm. - So what's your deal?<eos> You own this bar.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yeah, my sister and I and my cousin, we own it together.
Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club to get the worm program.<eos> When Marcus came back, both him and his laptop stunk like cigars,<eos> - and that's all I know. - Where's Marcus' laptop now?<eos> Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm program on here,<eos> I might be able to find out who created it.
That envelope was my payment to the judge.<eos> I'm being blackmailed, same as your sister.<eos> What does the judge have on you?<eos> What does he have on Dee?<eos> This diary, have you given it to the cops yet?
Christian's GPS log...<eos> The one you sent me.<eos> There was no record of him being at Dee's funeral... But he was there.<eos> The log was from your cell, not his.<eos> You took a screenshot of your own phone and passed it off as Christian's.
We're gonna take this to the next level, okay?<eos> Look, I just told you I can't give you what you want.<eos> And now you want more.<eos> Look, Christ, what is it with everybody, huh?<eos> You make an agreement, and then they change it on you?
I find that boring too.<eos> You have a book i want.<eos> We had just found out where it was--<eos> In the hands of another grimm A mr. Josef nebojsa<eos> In prague. We tracked it to a book dealer in leipzig And then here to portland.

In the hands of another grimm A mr. Josef nebojsa<eos> In prague. We tracked it to a book dealer in leipzig And then here to portland.<eos> Turns out the book dealer who bought it Is related to a friend of yours.<eos> The book dealer was blutbaden Yet he chose to give the book to a grimm.<eos> I believe that you now have that book And you will give it to me.
You know, plus, you know, acting is fun.<eos> Well...it's an Oscar-worthy performance.<eos> But...how did nobody know?<eos> I mean, w-what about that amulet thingy?<eos> Y-You told me about it, some... silly charm that burned brightly in the presence of you.
I was stupid.<eos> Naive.<eos> I thought if I could show my sister that there was something more than just us, something better than us, then maybe she'd change.<eos> Maybe she'd stop... being...her.<eos> But... every time I'd build a new world... she'd destroy it.
Congratulations, Fred.<eos> It looks like your directing debut is a wrap.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Wow, kids. Great job!<eos> I can't believe you actually did it.
I could curse Monty for not being here.<eos> Missing the Yuletide ball!<eos> The great and the good.<eos> Oh, I appreciate the moral support.<eos> I'm surprised you need it.
5' 7", brown hair, green dress.<eos> If she asks, you haven't seen me!<eos> Aren't you excused?<eos> An attack of gout doesn't get me a red card.<eos> She merely views it as a challenge.
Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> Was anything missing?<eos> His eiderdown, and lamb.<eos> It's his favourite toy.<eos> He's not allowed it at night.
His eiderdown, and lamb.<eos> It's his favourite toy.<eos> He's not allowed it at night.<eos> Nanny says he'll get crooked teeth.<eos> But I always put it by his bed so he can see it.
Talking in riddles as usual.<eos> And who is Jocabed when he's at home?<eos> She.<eos> Moses' mother.<eos> Who put the child in a basket and hid it in the bulrushes.
- Hey.<eos> So, I got your text. What'd you want to talk about?<eos> Uh... look, you know, I know you liked that lingerie I got you...<eos> No, I loved your gift.<eos> I'm wearing it right now.
I changed my mind.<eos> What?<eos> You don't change your mind.<eos> You still think left-handed people just haven't learned how to use their right hand yet.<eos> That calf will bring $1,200 if we can get it to the sale.
I was powerless.<eos> She must have a larger goal.<eos> I-I need to know what she is doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> When Alexander encountered the Gordian knot, a knot so complex no one had ever been able to untangle it... he just removed his sword and cut it in two.
Gray Pharma.<eos> They actually have a warehouse here in Gotham.<eos> You think they could be a target?<eos> Well, they're the only pharmacy that carries the drug.<eos> If somebody wants it, they'll have to go to the source.
Your wife told me that you asked her to stop at the cash machine this morning.<eos> I just didn't want Rafe Carey paying for everything, like he always does.<eos> But we checked, Leo.<eos> You didn't take any money out of the cash machine.<eos> You HAD money, but you didn't withdraw it.
Four out the six knives are gone, so... It's gone... It's all gone.<eos> Whatever it is I was, I'm not any more.<eos> I've thrown it off.<eos> It's gone.<eos> The river took it.
Maurice is back on the bottle.<eos> So am I.<eos> Lisa...<eos> He took our money.<eos> All that money that's been coming in from you and Jack... he took it, ran off to Florida with some woman he met a month ago.
Tea?<eos> No.<eos> Lisa's done, too.<eos> Put down my cigarettes?<eos> Yeah. I-I put it out. Sit down.
- I'm not sorry, that's true.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> It's the Air Force.<eos> I mean, should I respond to their email?<eos> Ignore it?
You can't ignore it.<eos> It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.<eos> Guys, come on, we're meeting everyone for dinner.<eos> One sec.<eos> I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.
It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.<eos> Guys, come on, we're meeting everyone for dinner.<eos> One sec.<eos> I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.<eos> Dude, the minute you opened that email, they knew you got it.
It's not nonsense.<eos> This is how the US military works.<eos> If it's even the US military.<eos> It could be foreign military pretending to be American.<eos> You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.
- that repeatedly battered...<eos> - Connor, enough.<eos> Instead, you're putting the burden on the victim!<eos> Young man, you need to rein it in.<eos> My client has suffered a lifetime of horror, and you're just continuing the cycle of abuse, and I won't allow it!
My license is up to date, so the case will continue as scheduled tomorrow.<eos> And him, he's still gonna be the first chair or whatever?<eos> Dude, okay, I wasn't that bad, all right?<eos> We'd be in much better shape if you just told us what you did with the money.<eos> I spent it. I told you. On what?
Better to just make a statement in private, promise to go to anger‐management classes.<eos> I'll probably hit people there, too.<eos> I really need to retire.<eos> The Sam insurance money is that good?<eos> I spent it all.
Big balls?<eos> Oh, my... no.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Look, I found who e‐mailed the slap.<eos> Ooh, who sent it?
You don't understand!<eos> This isn't about her!<eos> It's about the baby!<eos> She's gonna have it in jail, and then what?<eos> Who's gonna take care of it? No one.
I went to the bathroom.<eos> I came back, and it was gone, and I will call security if I have to.<eos> - I dare you.<eos> - Ain't afraid of no Po-po.<eos> Okay, open your bag then and prove you don't have it.
I just had a feeling it was him.<eos> He's always so aggro about you and that he's never gotten to be first chair, and... and with your job on the line, I just thought maybe I should just look through his computer.<eos> She stole his computer for the arbitration outline.<eos> We can't give it to the university, though, right?<eos> Otherwise they'll know that Michaela stole it.

- I did this for you, Annalise.<eos> No, you did it for yourself, to get the love that no one ever gave you.<eos> But guess who did.<eos> Me.<eos> And you spit it right back in my face.
It's better than that.<eos> You might even want me to replace Simon as first chair... again.<eos> You stole the boy's computer.<eos> Now you want to steal his job?<eos> - He deserves it.
- An anonymous source.<eos> They've provided information that ties you to the charges.<eos> Now do you want your attorney?<eos> You lost your phone?<eos> Last I had it was at the library.
We've been seeing each other for the past year.<eos> He knew about our texts, so he e-mailed me the article as a joke.<eos> Always a freakin' secret e-mail address.<eos> Or a secret boyfriend!<eos> I didn't want Mom to sabotage it.
We'll start fresh tomorrow.<eos> What... you're shy?<eos> You're not?<eos> It's not how your body looks...<eos> It's how you use it.
Thank God I know how to separate sex from feelings.<eos> Even with Oliver?<eos> Whoa. Your mom's calling.<eos> - You're driving.<eos> - Why? So Asher and I can screw in your back seat and leave you to clean it up.
- Pull the trigger!<eos> - Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it!<eos> Pull it!<eos> - Please don't do it!
So you do still talk to her.<eos> So it is true?<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> This office is not investigating Annalise Keating.<eos> And why I helped you get this job is because you deserve it.
I had to open hostilities somehow.<eos> You acted too soon.<eos> Another month and Marseille would have been yours.<eos> That would have been too easy.<eos> If I give you the power will you turn it down?
Conviction Integrity Units don't usually investigate cases from the sitting D.A.'s tenure, let alone ones that D.A. personally prosecuted.<eos> Time for us to break out of the mold.<eos> It's our second case.<eos> And Wallace kind of gave you this job.<eos> Correction... he blackmailed me into it.
Bit by bit, now!<eos> After this case was filed.<eos> Because she knew that this will be brought up in court.<eos> She is a professional and has a sharp mind.<eos> Why do you twist every fact and then present it?
No, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> I want to say this and I have to say this.<eos> Yes, we took the money, sir.<eos> We demanded money and we took it!
Because Rajvir Singh is from a reputed family,.<eos> He is young, a bright future awaits him.<eos> Also the testimonies of the doctor the waiter, the manager and the investigating officer support this contention<eos> The aspect of consent has been forcibly introduced by the defense because it is fashionable these days...<eos> And that's why they have plugged it out of convenience
You mind explaining the designs on your tablet?<eos> Yeah, the magnetic susceptibility meter and the magnetometer will locate our underground evidence.<eos> And this is gonna photograph it.<eos> Ground Penetrating Radar?<eos> But not like you've ever seen it.
Oh, you did, now?<eos> You did, now, huh.<eos> So, uh, bring that, uh, sleeping bag with you?<eos> No.<eos> No, didn't need it.
It's not poison oak, Mike!<eos> Why don't you look me in the eyes and say that.<eos> It's not poison oak...<eos> Mike.<eos> Then why don't you go ahead and rub it on your balls for me?
Paint stains?<eos> Smells like a bait shop?<eos> Yeah, I might have worn that hat last night.<eos> What?<eos> You might have worn it or you did wear it?
Okay.<eos> Kilmer's got it in 50 pieces by now.<eos> We... we... we couldn't get to Kilmer's.<eos> W-we... we had to drop it in the salvage yard, the one we used for the bank.<eos> So, the car with Craig's blood and a dead cop's bullets in it is sitting in San Pedro waiting to be found?
Hey, what happened to that phone I just gave you?<eos> I tried calling you today.<eos> Yeah. I was walking on the beach.<eos> I didn't hear it.<eos> Sorry. Then put it down your pants on vibrate.
Nobody else. No one else gets hurt.<eos> I want you to see something.<eos> Nice view, huh?<eos> I know the developer.<eos> Lease is mine if I want it.
We're running out of time.<eos> Those explosives could disappear at any moment.<eos> Yeah, she's wearing a scrambler on her wrist.<eos> I pointed it out to Nate before I slipped him a tracker.<eos> Well, let's hope he uses it for help and not for a wild goose chase.
What is that?<eos> What?<eos> When I found the container this morning, it was in the fridge.<eos> So?<eos> So in this video, I just left it on the counter.
No one knows better than to rob the Baptiste family crypt, except Boyd, who apparently was desperate enough to try.<eos> Which Lieutenant Murray suspected, but when he got on Boyd's trail, you were afraid the investigation would lead back to you.<eos> No doubt the missing wire's the murder weapon used to kill Lieutenant Murray.<eos> Missing wire?<eos> I... That must've been what was taken when they broke into my place, I... I didn't report it 'cause I-I didn't think anything was missing, but that's obviously what they were after.
Said he needed it to authenticate some kind of ring he was trying to sell.<eos> A ring?<eos> He's supposed to get back to me.<eos> Haven't heard from him. Apparently, he doesn't have the bone yet.<eos> That's because we've got it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I feel like we should say something to each other.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> It's us against the world.<eos> The world won't know what hit it.
We have everything for a permanent majority.<eos> I look like her, don't I?<eos> I looked online.<eos> Except for the hair.<eos> Maybe if I put it back?
Why?<eos> Well, nothing you said, certainly.<eos> You and I have lived together over a span of almost five years.<eos> I have a certain grasp of your... rhythms.<eos> Plus, on three occasions this summer, you wore a rather chic ensemble into the field and then, several weeks later, you wore it again.
Yeah, I've seen how he handles your provolone.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> No, I'm just hurt and angry.<eos> Do you have any idea how what I'm going through feels?<eos> It feels like you just took my heart and tore it from my body and then just shoved it right up my and then it just lies there, covered in flies.
You're an idiot.<eos> No, I'm just hurt and angry.<eos> Do you have any idea how what I'm going through feels?<eos> It feels like you just took my heart and tore it from my body and then just shoved it right up my and then it just lies there, covered in flies.<eos> Even the dog doesn't want it, even though he ate it in the first place.
How about extremely fast and out of control?<eos> Forgive me, getting a little beaded up about this plan.<eos> Beaded up: sweaty, worried.<eos> I know my pilot terms.<eos> Lieutenant, that fancy plane you're flying, all the minds who designed it, compared to us they're morons, so no need to sweat it.
Okay, they're in communication with Admiral Pace, but their sonar, depth finder and radar have all gone dark.<eos> The fastest way to find the sub would be to use the sonar capabilities of the USS Corbett.<eos> But the Corbett's under control of the hackers.<eos> Yeah, so we'll need a top-down approach.<eos> You get it?
Thank you for your help.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Okay, that's the last of them-- is that enough, Walter?<eos> The magnetic field is strong, and the sub's already entered it.<eos> But it won't disrupt the hackers' signal unless there is an electric current running through it, so get out.
I've no money to pay you. Do not seek payment, only to pass the time in conversation.<eos> Well, go on then.<eos> I'm looking for someone.<eos> He's not too young, but not as old as yourself.<eos> He's 17 stone and carries a staff, although I don't think he needs it.
And what do you believe their motivations were?<eos> I cannot say.<eos> Cyprian, you have an ear to the ground here.<eos> Is this an isolated incident, or is it a symptom of some larger rebellion?<eos> There is some civil unrest. I wouldn't call it organized. It may have been personal.
Mostly fine.<eos> Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.<eos> Oh, actually, I made it to fit me perfectly.<eos> It's constructed out of a proprietary alloy, and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.<eos> I even wore it in space once.
I was hoping to torture you a little bit first, but since you're in such a rush, I will be glad to accommodate you with your schedule.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> That exo-suit?<eos> I invented it.
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say we're on the island of...<eos> Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you learn to speak my language?<eos> I studied it for many years.
Wait, what?<eos> You let the Shogun steal a 21st century super-suit?<eos> After I crash-landed trying to rescue you.<eos> How does the Shogun even know how to operate your ATOM suit?<eos> I designed it so an idiot could use it.
- So it's impenetrable?<eos> - Not quite.<eos> Underneath the left thruster is the alpha-stabilizer.<eos> - Alpha-stabilizer, got it.<eos> - If you destroy it, the photons that stream from suit's weapons systems will overheat, theoretically causing somatic overload.
Look, I've been doing this time travel thing for a little while now.<eos> And if I've learned one thing, it's you never know what's gonna change history and have massive consequences.<eos> What, you think this doesn't make me angry as well?<eos> But we have a job to do.<eos> And if we don't do it, we can make things a lot worse.
- Trying to be cool.<eos> Maybe this was a bad idea.<eos> You know, this may shock you, but I was considered extremely cool when I left my cushy six-figure Silicon Valley job and started my own tech company.<eos> Ladies were lining up.<eos> Listen, Haircut, if you want to fit into Snart's shoes, you gotta find the pain, the darkness, the anger. You got it in you?
Well, I was collecting the bounty on a pissant by the name of Quentin Turnbull.<eos> - As in "Turnbull Country"?<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> That's because it's not supposed to exist.<eos> This book has changed since the last time I saw it.
He wants to see me pushing up daisies just as bad as I want to see him do the same.<eos> Because why?<eos> Little town in Oklahoma.<eos> Goes by the name of Calvert.<eos> Turnbull and his men were harassing it.
Bye.<eos> He didn't even say thank you. What is that?<eos> I think it's a transponder.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> I may or may not have stolen it.
Capone's men are taking over the ship.<eos> We got bigger fish to fry, honey.<eos> Rex's killer?<eos> He's tossing the ship. He's looking for the amulet.<eos> It's only gonna be a matter of time before he finds it.
Only one way to find out.<eos> What are you looking for, Cisco?<eos> You ever seen "Twin Peaks"?<eos> Of course not. Why do I ask?<eos> This is an old backmasking trick they used for the Man from Another Place, where they record his audio backwards and then play it forwards.
Let's get you to the lab.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's to test how your ability affects molecular motion.<eos> That shaft is solid tungsten, and it's heated to over 2,000 degrees centigrade.<eos> I want you to cool it down, and when we determine how you can do that, we can figure out the best way to help you.
What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.<eos> Well then, it's a good thing for me I found this little contraption in my satchel... forgot I brought it.
So besides Shade, Magenta, and Clariss, there's still three unaccounted for.<eos> Okay, well, if more come, then we'll stop them.<eos> But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell.<eos> And besides, burying our head in the sand is not gonna make Alchemy go away.<eos> Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.
I'm sorry. When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?<eos> Since I trust you.<eos> You do?<eos> I mean, all things considered?<eos> If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
Does your story have a point?<eos> Yes.<eos> That without unity one cannot accomplish anything in life.<eos> As I got older, I realized it also meant something else, that scum never amount to anything without help, that the Solntsevskaya Bratva can pull at the turnip all they want, but they will never, ever, ever<eos> set it free.
It's one step forward, two steps back.<eos> That's it.<eos> I think that's what's called being in charge.<eos> Heh.<eos> The truth is, you're all this city has, so...however you go about your business, just keep doing it the right way.
- What's that?<eos> - I like to call it my 3PO processor.<eos> I am fluent in over 6 million forms of communication.<eos> And it speaks Dominator?<eos> I didn't specifically program it for that, but in my defense, I didn't know the Dominators even existed.
We tried to plug human tech into a Dominator power source.<eos> Of course it overloaded!<eos> We need a regulator, ok, something that can handle the Dominator juice.<eos> Van Horn Industries was working on a prototype for NASA over a year ago.<eos> Maybe they perfected it by now.
You got me drinking and then you fed me a piece of misinformation...<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> I wrote a number on a piece of paper...<eos> A number that you faked.<eos> ...to see if you'd steal it.
You were handsome.<eos> You could dance.<eos> And what you had, that thing you had?<eos> Courage.<eos> You had it in fucking spades.
It has all this extra skin.<eos> Confronted Caleb about that chick.<eos> He's screwing her.<eos> - That's a nice stroller.<eos> Where'd you get it?
Begging forgiveness?<eos> Begging, then name-calling, then begging some more.<eos> Nice sex-hair.<eos> Ah, Tinder rocks.<eos> Free sex, any time I want it.
If you turn on Figgis, this doesn't have to end badly for you.<eos> You still have that file with all the evidence against him?<eos> You mean the one you handed me?<eos> That was a good idea at the time; we all thought that.<eos> Yes, that file's in a safe place, and you're never getting it.
I know Figgis, and you're in far more danger than I.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> And I guarantee his soldiers find this place.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> I rent it out under a shell corporation.
- I just don't know what to expect.<eos> Have any of you ever dated a handicapped guy?<eos> When I was in high school, my boyfriend had a glass eye.<eos> Was it a problem?<eos> No, I loved it.
- Be careful.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am being careful.<eos> - Do you want me to do it?
- Uh, this isn't a good time. - But we had sex.<eos> You know, I understood what the "it" was you were referring to.<eos> Uh, hi. Yeah, I'd like to reserve your first available flight from New York to Cusco, Peru, departing Newark.<eos> Immediately.<eos> No, no, "first available" means I need it much sooner than that.
You know, good intentions but no follow-through.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> You need that car?<eos> Uh, no, you can take it.
NO.<eos> NO.<eos> THERE ARE SUBCULTURES THAT EXIST,<eos> AND SOMETIMES YOU HIT ONTO<eos> ONE OF THEM AND YOU REALIZE
AND THOSE WERE NICE, 'CAUSE I KNEW I DESERVED THEM.<eos> I WOULD LIKE TO, FOR INSTANCE, IN FILMS,<eos> DO MORE SERIOUS FILMS.<eos> I'D LIKE TO<eos> NOT ACT IN THEM BUT TO WRITE AND DIRECT
May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?<eos> Are you chief of police? Indeed I am.<eos> Is your name Kevin?<eos> Indeed it is.<eos> "And He looked at them and raised His hand, but they did not wave in response.
I'm of sound mind and body and give consent to go... to go wherever they went.<eos> Amen.<eos> So, the two women in that house, they recorded this?<eos> One would assume.<eos> And we're also assuming they're just gonna lead us right to this device they told you about?
What?<eos> Still hiding back here?<eos> I know you like the quiet.<eos> Nurses wouldn't mind their break room back though.<eos> They can have it.
And I don't think that Hanna had anything to do with Charlotte's death.<eos> What about her friends?<eos> I can't vouch for them.<eos> Now, I've see too many things that they're capable of.<eos> Do you think they did it?
They're afraid of you.<eos> When their leader comes, they will kill you.<eos> Yeah, well, shit happens.<eos> Do you know what Boko Haram does to girls?<eos> They will sell them as slaves, and they'll be raped by their so-called husbands, forced into motherhood before they can even be children themselves.
Sure they are.<eos> We all do whatever it takes to survive, and if that means breaking a few laws or betraying the people who believe in you, so be it!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're letting them get away!<eos> They're not our target.
It's only sex.<eos> It's rape!<eos> They'd all had sex before.<eos> Why does one more time make a difference?<eos> They did not get the choice.
- Ants?<eos> You know... [snarling]<eos> They don't look like that, but we have them.<eos> And you needed to spray for them at 2:45 in the morning?<eos> - I was up. I figured they were, too.
I don't understand. What's going on?<eos> -Why did you change your mind?<eos> -I hadn't thought of the consequences.<eos> It'll mean the end of the operators, of my friends and their jobs...<eos> -Right now, they think I'm a traitor.
- Now.<eos> My children are U.S. citizens.<eos> I have their birth certificates to prove it.<eos> And I realize that.<eos> They're safe.
You caught him?<eos> Please tell me you caught him.<eos> We can't discuss an ongoing case.<eos> These people... look at them.<eos> They've all lost someone.
"For, behold, from henceforth," "all generations shall call me blessed."<eos> Ofwarren.<eos> Honey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> "Then the handmaidens came near," "they and their children..."
No, he's right.<eos> People are already talking.<eos> At least the doxies are.<eos> And who can blame them?<eos> I'm allowed further into camp than they are.
Just... just hold it.<eos> No one's gonna get in or out of this bitch.<eos> - Yeah, except for the chicks.<eos> - Except for the chicks.<eos> - Yeah, they can come in.
Let's go.<eos> Don Francisco, I'm sorry to have called you at home. It seems it wasn't enough for Miss Aguilar to ruin the king's call.<eos> She thinks the switchboard room is her parlor and went inside with her friends.<eos> [Alba] It's all my fault.<eos> They're not to blame.
I didn't say I'd give you the money. It'd be a loan.<eos> You could pay it off and come back to work tomorrow.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll find a way out of this, like I always have.<eos> Alba, if you don't stay, the girls will lose their jobs.<eos> They'll be the ones who pay.
No.<eos> We need a couple of really big breakthroughs to get to our theory of consciousness.<eos> We might be right now where the ancient Greeks were in the study of matter or where Descartes was in thinking about biology.<eos> We hadn't had, Newton hadn't come along yet, or Darwin hadn't come along yet.<eos> As computers become more intelligent than us they'll be processing information in more integrated, more creative ways.
The neutral face of displeasure.<eos> I need a plan, bro.<eos> Well, just buy her some flowers.<eos> She hates flowers.<eos> They die.
!<eos> - Three different girls?<eos> - Three? !<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> They were all a part of this big crowd that saw him get shot down by Lindsay.
They were all a part of this big crowd that saw him get shot down by Lindsay.<eos> And-and they felt sorry for him.<eos> That's good.<eos> - That's good strategy.<eos> - No, they were impressed.
And-and they felt sorry for him.<eos> That's good.<eos> - That's good strategy.<eos> - No, they were impressed.<eos> They said that they'd never...
Are you listening to me?<eos> Julie Sullivan was standing...<eos> Hey.<eos> ...right in front of me,<eos> These women are sinners, even if they don't know it.
- Petition the fairies?<eos> Fairies?<eos> Do I know about the fairies?<eos> They exist outside our realm.<eos> They can be contacted, and they have great powers.
- Hypothermia.<eos> She got knocked out by the ketamine, and then she froze to death.<eos> Hiding from the predators.<eos> I'm telling you this has Goldwin written all over it.<eos> I've been reading blogs written by other women who have been victimized, and they all have the same story.
These two women.<eos> They were at your apartment.<eos> Look at me.<eos> What happened?<eos> They came over.
Who's "we"?<eos> We keep the names of our members secret.<eos> We got followers from all over the city.<eos> We're an army.<eos> Yeah, the thing about that, Craig, is that all the IP addresses associated with Perv Hunters in Chicago, they all trace back to the same place.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I heard your dad's doing well.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure he's making the nurses miserable.<eos> They can handle it.
I was a black man, a dangerous black man.<eos> That's all he could see: a threat.<eos> And I couldn't stop thinking about my daughters.<eos> And their future.<eos> And how years from now, they could be walking down the street, looking for their kids' Moo Moo, and get stopped by a bad cop.
That's all he could see: a threat.<eos> And I couldn't stop thinking about my daughters.<eos> And their future.<eos> And how years from now, they could be walking down the street, looking for their kids' Moo Moo, and get stopped by a bad cop.<eos> And they probably won't get to play the police card to get out of trouble.
- But now she is. - (screams)<eos> Okay, I'll give you ladies and your dolls a moment to look at the menu.<eos> FYI, the dinner dolls must stay in the restaurant area.<eos> They're not store dolls, they're dinner dolls.<eos> They've accepted it.
No.<eos> That's what makes our mystery guest so intriguing.<eos> I know Mr. Kaplan said that the two of you can't coexist, that... that was her truth, but I still hope it can change.<eos> I have found in my experience people rarely change.<eos> And when they do, they're not to be trusted.
Walked out to the edge of that cliff we call fate, and then,<eos> for whatever reason decided not to jump.<eos> You know the feeling.<eos> You're about to make a life-changing mistake, and then... You don't.<eos> The only thing about those bullets you dodge, is they do keep traveling, and sometimes, they come back to hit you right between the eyes.
Men.<eos> "The world is mine, I will go out however I like."<eos> There is something about this point.<eos> Women don't feel that.<eos> They are not in their own world, they are in men's world, so they need to be careful, they need to be conscious.
Man...<eos> You're right.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> If these new sisters are so wonderful, why would fake your death?<eos> Because it turns out they were the fakers.
Then I went in and I sat down in a desk.<eos> Sister Cathy was the type of person that was approachable, and you knew that you could talk to her.<eos> You didn't get that all the time from the older nuns.<eos> You didn't feel like you could connect with them.<eos> They were more authoritarian.
"I know he's weird and all, but you have to go."<eos> When you were called over the loudspeaker to report to Father Maskell, a dead silence would come over the classroom, and other, um, girls would look at you with sad eyes.<eos> And the teachers, they... They would just, you know, look down or whatever.<eos> It was like...<eos> They knew something was going on.
She had gotten permission from her local superiors to try living outside the convent in an apartment in Catonsville with Sister Russell.<eos> This is what she looked like when she left Keough to go teach in a public school while remaining a nun.<eos> Cathy Cesnik and Russell Phillips were trying this experiment.<eos> I understood that Mother Maurice gave them permission to experiment with teaching in public high school and being nuns out in the regular world.<eos> I was surprised that they were the ones engaging in this.
Cathy's life,<eos> Cathy's death and this abuse... this is all connected.<eos> These girls have lived with this all of their life.<eos> I've lived with the loss of... Of... My best friend, my sister, all my life and I will carry that.<eos> But they also have pain they are carrying.
Certain behavior's permitted.<eos> Certain behavior's not.<eos> Cheers.<eos> With other girls, right?<eos> They have to remain strangers.
You probably read your data wrong.<eos> I bet that guy told you exactly who he was.<eos> You just didn't want to hear it.<eos> I tell the truth to girls all the time.<eos> They hear what they want to hear.
- I can't...<eos> Stop. It doesn't matter.<eos> Putting somebody into hibernation requires special equipment.<eos> Remember the facility where they put us under all the procedures we went through.<eos> These pods are designed to keep us in hibernation, they'll wake us up at the right time but they can't put us back to sleep.
I'm truly sorry we never got a chance to actually meet, but with over 2000 employees all over the world, well I can't be expected to meet everybody.<eos> People think you gotta wash your hands after you take a piss.<eos> As if your dick is filthy.<eos> My penis is immaculate, it's been in my trousers all day long where it belongs.<eos> Now my hands, they're filthy dirty.
- Hey Griff, I got more information on that Elaine parks girl.<eos> - You leave it on my desk.<eos> - Don't you wanna hear it? - Steve, captain wants us to lay off the case.<eos> - Are you serious? - He says we have a policy of leaving the witches alone.<eos> He says they've lived in this town a long time and he doesn't like to mess with them.
- I don't know, but the customers really like 'em.<eos> - They're friends of the witches.<eos> I seen them come in together before.<eos> - Yeah, the witches.<eos> They're everywhere.
They don't pay good money for a dead rat.<eos> I pick the traps up at dawn. There are times when it's still dark. That's when the snakes come out.<eos> I sell the rats I catch to a dealer named "Mr. Ret".<eos> He buys rats from many people.<eos> I'm not sure where they end up.
This is Jerry Simon coming to you live from the charred remains of the Snake Eyes Strip Club.<eos> It seems that our fair city, which just last night played host to the bloody massacre of two of our most violent street gangs, must now bear witness to the fiery destruction of its most notorious strip club.<eos> Girls said they were the only dancers in the club at the time.<eos> Luckily it was between shifts.<eos> - They see anything?
- Looks like time stood still.<eos> They kept cows here?<eos> - So I'm told.<eos> - Pretty sparse.<eos> - Well, they're just here to die.
I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.<eos> We cherish our young women, Mrs Busby, and they keep us on our toes.
It's not a criticism.<eos> I know that we're here to help without judgment, but but I'm struggling to do so in Miss Whitmore's case.<eos> You've dealt with unmarried mothers before.<eos> And with great compassion.<eos> They were less like me!
You want me to bring the ladies out...<eos> We gotta learn a few basic rules.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> First and foremost, no kissing the ladies on the mouth.<eos> They don't like it.
! You know what we're talking about!<eos> Choose a side!<eos> Look.<eos> I know your heart is in the right place.<eos> But these four walls, they, they box you in.
Don's amazing... he practically invented jury research.<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> We're gonna have a downtown jury, which means heavily black. If I can make it black women, we are in good shape.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - They'll sympathize with Nicole.
I made it and so will you.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if you're a wolf or a lamb.<eos> I'm glad you wonder that.<eos> Do you know the answer?<eos> I think I have an ability to appear to people as they want me to be.
People will find out.<eos> Everyone will reject them.<eos> Many will die.<eos> My duty is to protect our secret.<eos> - They'll give birth in...
Try telling that to Alan Greenspan.<eos> Nice burn, Bob!<eos> I should've known Maura wouldn't be able to control herself.<eos> Strong women, they're just drawn to me.<eos> You know, they're all right angles, and I'm nothing but curves.
Okay, okay. You get it.<eos> Um, so now if she asks you any questions, you just say as little as possible, okay?<eos> Now show me your most inscrutable face.<eos> I don't really make choices, when they... about... about women. They just...<eos> They come to you.
Did the topic of her boyfriend come up?<eos> Oh, Steve.<eos> You're killing me.<eos> I won't lie.<eos> They... they expressed some concern that he doesn't hang out with them as much as they would like.
Hey, Moses.<eos> Best view of the city.<eos> Great show last night.<eos> Saw you talking up them girls.<eos> Um-um, they were talking up me, my friend.
As a child I often went out in my forest<eos> From a bona I lifted birds so small and put them in cages of straw<eos> I let them grow among moss and green<eos> Eventually I put the windows ajar<eos> They did not fly cow ...
What happened?<eos> I just asked you that.<eos> Is... where are they?<eos> Where'd the girls go?<eos> They did this?
That just sounds stupid, Freddie.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I just sent you a link.<eos> Having trouble meeting girls?<eos> Do you do better with girls when they don't know what you look like?
My dad lets me play video games whenever I want to when I'm at his house and he's having a special time with his girlfriend but mommy says video games rot the brain and daddy's girlfriend is a bad influence<eos> Guys, can we get a kid in here whose stepmother is not on a pole?<eos> Meeja is the name of our guinea pig.<eos> Guinea pigs are rodents, Cavia porcellus.<eos> I have two mommies and they tell me I shouldn't trust boys.
She didn't want her daughters to know about us.<eos> I was just trying to respect that.<eos> - So you're protecting her?<eos> - I was trying to.<eos> They were her priority.
And you know the worst part of this is is the guy is basically my age.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with that.<eos> See, I almost exclusively date older women.<eos> Listening.<eos> They know how to take care of a brother.
We fight, we argue.<eos> The more we love, the more we fight.<eos> Don't you quarrel with your wife?<eos> I believe that wives are born to get into fights.<eos> They're born fighters.
Excuse me?<eos> We're gonna need a lot of manpower to program that beast.<eos> I can't do it alone.<eos> My gals are ready.<eos> They can do the work.
And that's Zirconia.<eos> Zirconia?<eos> I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.<eos> Plus... I don't think it's allowed.<eos> They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
I don't know if this accident has changed me in any way.<eos> Would it help my family if I quit and found something else?<eos> They know that I have to dive.<eos> My wife asked the girls if I was still allowed to dive.<eos> They said: "He has to", because he is so mad when he can't."
We know this from their phone records.<eos> After their December 10th meeting with Dr. Reybold, they agreed to an experimental treatment which, in actuality, was simply twice the usual dose of chemo.<eos> The following week, he upped it to three times the amount.<eos> By the time they wound up in the hospital, it was at seven times.<eos> Because they confronted him about what he did, and he was afraid of being exposed.
I'm sorry, habit.<eos> Go on.<eos> So I think I got it figured out.<eos> The girls are poisoning Martina against me.<eos> They say I'm vanilla.
- I don't know.<eos> Ever since the girls came back, things have changed.<eos> I know, but why?<eos> It's not like they're babies.<eos> Well, they make a mess.
I know, but why?<eos> It's not like they're babies.<eos> Well, they make a mess.<eos> They keep us awake.<eos> They stress us out.
It's not like they're babies.<eos> Well, they make a mess.<eos> They keep us awake.<eos> They stress us out.<eos> they're babies... giant babies.
I liked it when he was gone, even though he never left much food.<eos> Do you know where the disappearing place is?<eos> I didn't get to go.<eos> He only took Violet and Sheila once.<eos> They were more special.
I knew as much.<eos> That man is not a person.<eos> That stranger is a ghost.<eos> Get a move on!<eos> All those people in your village, they've been taken over by the ghost.
She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback, and we are all completely fucked. It's my fault, really. I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit.<eos> And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you, she is piiiiiiissed.<eos> Now our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because we're very close to the end. The end?<eos> Of what?<eos> Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online. And unless we start kissing their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.
No, wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge.<eos> Oh, yeah, I 'member. Wrong. Waaaah!<eos> 'Member stormtroopers? Sure, I 'member. Not those stormtroopers!<eos> The real old ones. People want to 'member?<eos> They're gonna 'member.
- They were generous.<eos> - They were generous.<eos> Well, did you have Doc check the girls out after they left?<eos> I hope they weren't too generous.<eos> We checked them out, sir, and they're in good shape.
She's the victim here, not Pablo.<eos> Could have fooled me.<eos> Any word on Martina yet?<eos> She's MIA.<eos> Great, we got four women who say they did it.
Maybe, but you have to wonder why they never considered this before.<eos> Because their lives didn't depend on it until now.<eos> Speaking as a psychiatrist, I would suggest that we make sure that is absolutely true before we force them to face the decision.<eos> They are extraordinary human beings.<eos> They live in their own private world that we are not a part of, and no amount of technology will truly allow us in.
- Go, go!<eos> - Got it!<eos> What the hell were those things?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But they're going to be a bitch to deal with.
And now that money is just sitting there in escrow.<eos> There's more than enough to resolve my nursing crisis.<eos> It's not that simple, Leanne.<eos> Then I'll make it simple.<eos> Allocate those funds to my E.R. nurses or not only will they walk out, I'll lead them.
I'm listening.<eos> I'm hearing it. The Human Rights Commission has opened an investigation into Dr. Baral.<eos> It seems he's accused of impregnating very young women with many more embryos than is ethical or safe for the girls to carry to full term.<eos> And the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation also has a case against Dr. Baral, for selling babies on the black market.<eos> So he impregnates young women with multiple eggs, they carry to term...
I suppose every story has to start somewhere.<eos> "They bewitch everybody who approaches them.<eos> "There is no homecoming for the man who draws near them unawares.<eos> ...with their high clear song, the Sirens bewitch him..."<eos> "...as they sit there in a meadow piled high with the moldering skeletons of men whose withered skin still hangs upon their bones."
Uh, lots of people.<eos> Rich Weiner proposed to Allie there,<eos> Jeff proposed to Leslie.<eos> I proposed a threesome to the Flet sisters.<eos> They proposed I go fuck myself.
Everyone runs towards Rajvir's room.<eos> This is because Minal demanded money from Rajvir inside.<eos> He refused to pay.<eos> They had an argument and when the girls realized their mistake, they fled.<eos> They wouldn't have run off if they were innocent.
They should not live alone.<eos> Boys can. Not girls.<eos> Independent girls confuse boys.<eos> Girls should never smile during a conversation.<eos> In fact, even if they are giving good news they should do so with a grave face.
Your sister?<eos> Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!<eos> Do they go to parties?<eos> - They go to family gatherings.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Rabin.<eos> This is exactly what happened, yourhonon<eos> Even the so defined "modern Day" girls are just girls at heart.<eos> When they go for dinner and drinks with a boy they are going for an evening out
Thank you, Rabin.<eos> This is exactly what happened, yourhonon<eos> Even the so defined "modern Day" girls are just girls at heart.<eos> When they go for dinner and drinks with a boy they are going for an evening out<eos> They don't know it goes with a 'tag' of being 'available'.
I am not!<eos> Come on, ladies.<eos> Get my back here, right?<eos> See?<eos> They're with me.
You can't make me...<eos> I may be crazy and, yeah, maybe I see things.<eos> But...<eos> There are things in my life that are real.<eos> They really happened.
- Yes, we did.<eos> We didn't tell them, we didn't give them a chance.<eos> Chance to what?<eos> Not adopt me.<eos> - Callie, they wouldn't have...
Captain, ‭you didn't save the world.<eos> You unleashed the worst in human nature.<eos> You really want to save the people, you need to terrorize them.<eos> You need to take them by the neck and shake them.<eos> You need to be more terrible so that they don't have to be, and deep down inside, you know it's true.
What about those headstone looking things, there?<eos> Those are what we call stelae.<eos> Stelae.<eos> Stelae. And they commemorate periods in the Mayan calendar.<eos> So we see that they would have been dedicated to periods of time, such as every 20 years, every 10 years and especially every about 400 years, the ending of the great b'ak'tun cycles.
They are shared words and distant memories that form the glue of our civilization.<eos> We don't all share the same creation story.<eos> We all come from different places, but all of us, whatever we believe, can share in one thing, the wonder and gratitude that we are here at all.<eos> It is my fervent hope that people will open their hearts and minds and see that, our beliefs don't have to divide us.<eos> They have the power to unite us, to allow us together to achieve remarkable things.
-Well, it's a good school.<eos> My girls will get a good education.<eos> -Right.<eos> So let me ask you.<eos> At this "good school" they go to... They teach the girls how to give a sweet blow job at the same time they teach them to read, or is that a separate class?
Is this the part where you wish I had a gun, Detective?<eos> Shut up, Lucifer, I got this.<eos> You pretended to be a friend to those girls.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> They called me!
But it's rotten luck.<eos> We dream of winning the lottery, and when it happens we can't tell anyone.<eos> - Not even our wives.<eos> - Or not.<eos> They like money too.
Did he even ask you?<eos> You can do this.<eos> They're not going to believe me.<eos> Hey... don't give up on people.<eos> They're all we've got.
Well, it might be awkward because I'm gonna be right nearby, but I'm not gonna have much time.<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> You want me to help you make the girls not be upset that they still won't get to see you, even though you're gonna be around.<eos> It's a really big opportunity.<eos> Zander, they don't care.
Zander, they don't care.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Yeah, I'm telling you good news here, man.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> They're living their lives.
-I mean, what is a pack of cards gonna tell me about my life, anyway?<eos> - Well, I-I think the better question would be, what can you learn from the answer?<eos> - What if it's something I don't want to know?<eos> I mean, I can put these cards back into the deck, but you can't just walk away from what they're saying.<eos> I mean, they'll always haunt you.
If she had told you the truth, how would you have reacted?<eos> My whole life is a lie.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Your actions define you.<eos> And they do not lie.
If you are willing to plead guilty to sexual assault in the third degree...<eos> Sexual assault?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> These chicks were begging for it.<eos> If anything, they assaulted me.
At that point, I didn't know what to believe.<eos> Or what his angle was.<eos> The Jane sisters were psychopaths who tortured and murdered their patients, but what is even more frightening is in this house even those killers were terrified.<eos> So your research told you they were killed by the spirits here.<eos> No... they told me themselves.
Ask her out for a drink.<eos> I mean...<eos> I know how it's done.<eos> It's not like I haven't dated before.<eos> I've dated super models, W, and they've dated me back.
Wow.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Well, thank you. I am excited to meet your parents, um...<eos> But the Armstrong sisters seem tough...<eos> They are for another day.
- coming out now?<eos> - You know, when I came out in the '70s, the group that I came into in Charleston was fighting for women to have the right to have a credit card in their own name.<eos> Hello.<eos> Women couldn't have a credit card in their own name.<eos> - They oftentimes couldn't own the property that was theirs that they brought into a marriage.
And how's he gonna do that?<eos> The same way that anyone convinces anyone by ranting about it online.<eos> I created accounts for us on several Dark Web sites known to host conversations about black market goods.<eos> We'll monitor them for posts of the stolen artwork, and hopefully the thief should reveal himself soon enough.<eos> "Give to a gracious message a host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt."
Fake deaths don't count.<eos> And besides, Moriarty did that to you; you did not do that to her.<eos> Listen, breakups are never easy, but they don't have to be that bad.<eos> So just try and remember:<eos> "Give to a gracious message a host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt."
-You didn't.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Keep your personal emotions out of the case.<eos> Emotions are good.<eos> They drive me forward.
These particular ferns, figs and orchids live only on the branches of other trees.<eos> 1,000 plants growing on one single tree.<eos> Throughout the forest, this story is repeated endless times.<eos> As a consequence, jungles are home to more species of plants than anywhere else on Earth.<eos> And they, in turn, support a wealth of animals.
Now, only the most specialised predators on the plains can make a living.<eos> She may be spotted like a cheetah, but this cat is no sprinter.<eos> Instead, she has extra-long legs which give her a high vantage point.<eos> But a serval cat's main weapon are enormous radar ears.<eos> They help her pinpoint prey hiding in the grass.
You're crazy.<eos> You've lost your mind.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> But, but... our families are enough of a reason.<eos> They're trying to get far away to escape the radiation, but the roads are jammed. The cars aren't even moving. They're all now walking on their feet.
But when they flap around chaotically...<eos> Behind the front wheel, it's pretty ugly.<eos> that indicates velocity-reducing drag.<eos> But don't worry, the doc has a solution.<eos> Well, we've got these little critters called vortex generators and they will cause the flow to stir and mix and reduce your pressure drag.
A mistress?<eos> While Mum was still alive.<eos> You confronted him?<eos> There'd have been no point.<eos> He'd have just lied and said the letters were fake or they weren't reciprocated.
The Blind One is coming.<eos> He's going to suck out your intestines for a thousand years and use your ribs as toothpicks.<eos> - Urn... okay.<eos> - Did I mention he's going to roast your nuts over an open fire?<eos> While they are still attached, of course.
I bought you these.<eos> Flowers?<eos> What do I want with flowers?<eos> They...<eos> They only die.
The van is going.<eos> Healing could take place, and any proceeds could go towards the nuns.<eos> The nuns?<eos> What did the nuns ever do for you?<eos> Well, not much, but when the donations start rolling in they'll realise what a catch I would have been.
Why do you want me so bad, Roger?<eos> Fuck yeah.<eos> Same as any of those other women of the night?<eos> Tell me about the hookers, Roger.<eos> You're so much better than they are.
Do you see these women?<eos> Your sisters.<eos> Each and every one of them dedicated their lives to this fellowship.<eos> They did everything that was asked of them without question, without complaint.<eos> They lived happily in the service of my will.
- Yeah, but how?<eos> Were you playing with fireworks the day that Andy Lau went missing?<eos> - No.<eos> - What about the Hartley sisters?<eos> - How are they involved?
The other Alphas on the council cannot know he was here.<eos> Or that Malcolm escaped.<eos> We'll have to hide the body.<eos> We go get Malcolm.<eos> We know where the witches are, they left their card, okay?
Oh, good heavens. Where on earth did you get that from?<eos> ~ From them.<eos> ~ Oh, Samantha.<eos> You're imagining things.<eos> They did mention, though...
"It's not my fault, blame somebody else...<eos> "I was ill, I'm a victim"...<eos> But who stepped in?<eos> You did - and I'm grateful, but you have to stop.<eos> That bond was never there - so it's no surprise if they don't love you.
Look, and this makes sense, okay?<eos> Bedbugs drink our blood.<eos> They're bugs, not Dracula.<eos> And now that you been necklace shopping in Burritoville, you gettin' 'em for sure.<eos> - Man, why they still makin' our food... - Whatever. ...when they're the infested ones?
We didn't even read them.<eos> Jones just pulled 40 out of a pile randomly, and those were the winners.<eos> That's your system?<eos> Random selection?<eos> My system is to make the ladies think that there is a system. So they don't hate us for not getting the job. They're mad at themselves for not having what it takes.
I'm not judging you.<eos> I enjoy a drink myself.<eos> And when I've over-indulged... .. I hear things sometimes.<eos> Christ, I even see things sometimes.<eos> Mr McLeod, if you weigh up your drunken, retrospective insights against the very real evidence gathered by the police, you'll find they have little substance.
Don't confuse that with the burden the Commander in Chief faces.<eos> Francis has given the order to kill.<eos> He's buried soldiers he's put into harm's way.<eos> And every day, he wakes up bearing responsibilities you can't possibly imagine.<eos> They would crush you if they fell on your shoulders.
Zoya and Nika were alone.<eos> But they proved in the womb their incredible survival ability.<eos> They lived off the milk of a goat and fallen acorns from a tree.<eos> They watched the wolves and by the age of four could hunt.<eos> They taught themselves to speak, to sing, and even to play instruments that they carved themselves.
- May I help you?<eos> I'm with the sheriff's office.<eos> Wondering if you can help.<eos> I'm trying to get some information on these girls.<eos> They weren't members of my congregation.
That's selfish. -Okay. -Very selfish.<eos> I'm sorry. Why don't you guys make out right now?<eos> We'd love to.<eos> Should we make out right now?<eos> We'll do it, if they do it kinda thing.
We discussed it.<eos> You'll have to kill me to keep me here.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Thanks to Eva Sinclair, you are linked to 8 teenage witches, remember?<eos> If you get hurt, so do they, including Davina.
Not today.<eos> Today, it's all a rush.<eos> If they have time, they have a little sex...<eos> Sorry, father.<eos> I feel I've fallen asleep in the prime of my youth... when women took care of me... and I woke up in a world in which they prefer... their Pilates class, their yoga class, their waxing, their green juices... to sleep and cuddle with me.
I feel I've fallen asleep in the prime of my youth... when women took care of me... and I woke up in a world in which they prefer... their Pilates class, their yoga class, their waxing, their green juices... to sleep and cuddle with me.<eos> You're feeling like a cicada, right, son?<eos> You sang all summer long...<eos> When winter came, you woke up and had no food.<eos> While they, like ants... worked hard for a place in society. And now that winter has arrived... they've accumulated courage, independence, confidence...
"Into herself she stays curled."<eos> "May the Lord protect us from girls."<eos> "From their curls and whorls and pearls."<eos> I'm in love!<eos> "They're a bundle of fake notes."
You gave up our love!<eos> You gave up our love for money, and for this... For damn jewelry!<eos> You locked us in an attic for three years!<eos> Cathy, I always manage to make the wrong decisions.<eos> I think they're right when I make them... But they never prove anything but wrong.
Because you have a big heart.<eos> You care more than anyone.<eos> I think it makes you beautiful.<eos> And that's why I love you so much.<eos> Now tell me what you were talking about with your friends, and I will tell you why they are the stupid ones.
If I'm right, I've got a friend down that way.<eos> He can help me out.<eos> I made this map myself 15 years ago.<eos> Now, there'll be new routes up there, they'll turn you around.<eos> But you watch the mountains, and they'll be your guide.
[ sighs ] But before you say anything...<eos> It's just -- [crying] it's been so hard.<eos> Knock it off!<eos> You made my friends clean the apartment?<eos> No, they offered.
'Cause I just would feel better if I knew someone else had gone through it too, you know?<eos> Luke doesn't believe me. He thinks it's all in my head.<eos> I feel like everything is spinning out of control. But I refuse to believe that it, I mean there has to be something.<eos> Right? Some sort of answer.<eos> My daughters, they they don't talk.
It didn't happen just like that.<eos> We have kids.<eos> Don't drag them into this.<eos> What do you mean, "Don't drag them into this?"<eos> They're having a birthday party downstairs.
What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Mitch, I'm just outside.<eos> What are you doing at my house?<eos> If you go near my wife again, I am gonna kick you in the balls so hard that they go into your throat.
[Flynn]: Broken glass, stolen car.<eos> Got it, thanks.<eos> So, forensics confirmed Peter's DNA in Wayne's shop. Blood splattered all over the wall and floors.<eos> The girls are all safe and accounted for.<eos> They all recognized Wayne from his photo, but they all knew him by different last names.
Really?<eos> So there are ghost students that go to school in the Monster World?<eos> How interesting.<eos> And your little reaper friends there?<eos> They attend Monster High as well?
Ab, try it.<eos> Live in the moment.<eos> You just said that to me.<eos> Our foremothers didn't pin dudes on (Bleep) Tinder.<eos> They'd spray their pheromones all over and yell, "wanna 'fook'?"
It was a bad dream, that's all.<eos> And I don't want you discussing my son.<eos> You know... losing mates in the war was bad enough... .. but pretending they never existed... that's plain wrong.<eos> We all wearing comfortable shoes for our nature walk, ladies?<eos> Even though Dr Samuels rescues these women from surgery, he still ends up a very rich man once they're dead.
Not after that night.<eos> The other girls, the ones who didn't escape-- well, I saw you.<eos> The bitch who broke my hand.<eos> You think you went through hell.<eos> Oh, but they suffered more because of you!
You've spent your entire life since you were a baby surrounded by beautiful women.<eos> What is your secret?<eos> My secret?<eos> Make women your religion.<eos> That way, they'll always know.
Since when are you interested?<eos> Since I saw her girlfriends.<eos> Forget it, you have no chance.<eos> - Me?<eos> They date college guys.
They can do this, Natalie.<eos> Your mother did dozens of covert entries for us.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Those skills were drilled into her.<eos> They'll come back.
If you want big tits, you click big tits.<eos> Buying girls from the internet, I don't know, seems weird.<eos> Yeah, but if you don't manage the page,<eos> How are we supposed to get a piece of the other girls' action?<eos> But they got this whole setup.
These girls don't walk the streets.<eos> This isn't 1979.<eos> You put skin shots on the Internet, and that's how the johns find you. Mm-hmm.<eos> We supply the girls cocaine and the ability to front cash.<eos> They sell the johns coke, and when Johnny wants to do 'em a second time, can't pay for it, we loan 'em the money.
Things are looking up.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Looking up, Pop?<eos> I mean, we spent all that money that you got from the Armenians on that coke just so six hookers can get high all day.<eos> They understand the value of a solid business plan.
Stolen?<eos> All she can do to fix it is blame us.<eos> You mean she blames you?<eos> She's just got it in for me 'cause all the girls like me better.<eos> They listen to Josie.
Mother, don't.<eos> My husband has told me what was said earlier this evening, Inspector...?<eos> Er, Game.<eos> And I must say I am rather outraged that you are trying to lay the blame for this situation at our door.<eos> With girls of that class, one can never really know what kind of trouble they've created for themselves.
At least, not until morning.<eos> W-what are you doing?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> They don't know I'm paying you a visit.
Will it?<eos> How do we know what's normal?<eos> All I have to go on is Catherine.<eos> If there are any other noblewomen who have been...<eos> Well, they're keeping it to themselves.
And it worked.<eos> She won't even speak to me.<eos> And for what?<eos> All these women either want to marry me or they look at me like I'm some sort of torturer.<eos> I'm scared to death that I won't get an erection, and they'll feel terrible about themselves, or I will get one, and Jane will hear about it, and I'll be sleeping in the office again -- which is murder on my back!
On the other hand, if you gassed us all at birth, who'd deal with a puncture?<eos> Oh! Not that old chestnut.<eos> Well said, Harry!<eos> I know you'd know what to do cos you like getting your hands mucky.<eos> Anything technical, women - normal women - they just stand there holding their handbags going...
Some of these names are from a single complaint.<eos> How do we know it's not neighbours settling scores?<eos> Personal grudges?<eos> Well, again, Sinclair, it's about trust.<eos> I trust my sources; they trust me.
I'm also male talent.<eos> I used to be bullied and made fun of in school, and now I'm the shit, technically.<eos> Pretty much, in a year, I went from a dishwasher loser working at Outback, to living in Miami Beach in a five-bedroom house with my own car.<eos> I just drive my girls to and from shoots.<eos> They pay rent.
And been with you.<eos> And I believe in you.<eos> No, truth is just truth.<eos> Telling the truth, being truthful...<eos> Sometimes words have to mean what they say, or-or else they'll just mean whatever you want.
No.<eos> But I made him believe that.<eos> And the women?<eos> The women stayed out of the operations.<eos> Some informers say they participated in the thefts.
Because my daughter and her friends, live in a world that's French and I don't speak French.<eos> Which is why we are looked down upon.<eos> We are not respected.<eos> It's destroying our children.<eos> They want to be proud.
You just called yourself Duffman.<eos> Duffman never took off his tights!<eos> Let's go, girls!<eos> But we're managers here.<eos> They learned the register better than me!
My nieces are coming to stay with me.<eos> They get in this afternoon.<eos> Hope it's enough.<eos> All things considered, do you think that's such a good idea?<eos> The girls, they...
They get in this afternoon.<eos> Hope it's enough.<eos> All things considered, do you think that's such a good idea?<eos> The girls, they...<eos> They-they don't have any options right now, so...
Hope it's enough.<eos> All things considered, do you think that's such a good idea?<eos> The girls, they...<eos> They-they don't have any options right now, so...<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I mean, we got a storm coming and it's Halloween tomorrow, so... maybe they should just wait.
The old man says that the storm brought something with it, something evil.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell her why.<eos> On the eve of Halloween, before the storm hit, the townspeople, they burned six girls at the stake for... for practicing witchcraft.<eos> Now, as the story goes, before the girls burned to death, they summoned a storm... lightning struck each one of them, pulling their spirits up into the storm, so that they could return as something far, far more evil.

Dear friends.<eos> Dear Norwegians.<eos> Demonstrating the strength which we saw involving Russian troops, is absolutely unacceptable.<eos> They grossly violated Norway's sovereignty.<eos> They violated our freedom.
It's a military matter and deserves to be handled accordingly.<eos> But most women don't see it that way.<eos> Women of Virginia don't see it that way.<eos> You see military rape.<eos> They just see rape.
You know, it'll get easier.<eos> But it'll take time.<eos> I love the children we have.<eos> You know, it really wouldn't have been fair to them.<eos> It was a really special time when they were small, but we are in a different place now, our family feels complete, and so... maybe in a way... maybe this is what's best.
- Any time. Yeah.<eos> - We're so lucky to have you here on Spilling the Tea.<eos> As you can see from our P.A.<eos> over there, who has a little crush on you, you have quite the female fans.<eos> Yeah, they're beautiful.
Thank you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you<eos> For now, I think that we don't have to try to get rid of the personalities by force.<eos> Since the personalities and you are one person and they're pieces of your wounds.
Transference killing.<eos> He looked at all his victims as his wife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He sat in meetings, and when he heard his own story being told, he found his victim.<eos> They were all his wife, and he got to kill her again and again.
Rossi.<eos> Hey, did Markayla take her good clothes with her?<eos> Yeah, and some of her mom's makeup, too.<eos> Meg took her favorite Jean jacket and boots.<eos> These girls were definitely planning on meeting boys, just maybe not the ones that they thought.
- I didn't say anything.<eos> - He took his car.<eos> He took his stupid, precious car and I don't know where he went.<eos> - Okay, let's take the girls inside.<eos> - No, they stay with me.
It's bound to be ghastly.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Greer, how can you afford this?<eos> And who are your new housemates?<eos> They're not my housemates, though, uh, they do... live here with me.
Sorry. What?<eos> ! I'm out of the band?<eos> ! Well, good luck getting my sisters to play without me!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They're out, too.
One down.<eos> Two down.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> Where are they?
That looks delicious.<eos> Do you want me to run it out to the girls?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> This is for us.<eos> They're having nachos.
You already told me that.<eos> So what is it you're trying to do here?<eos> Look, if a client calls and I give them what they want, it's good word of mouth.<eos> Her friends call.<eos> They book more dates.
When I was at Girls United, most of the girls refused to call me "he."<eos> And my label is what got me through.<eos> My label got me into an LGBT home where I can just be... you know... me.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> I'm not saying labels are for everyone... but sometimes they can... I don't know... make us feel not so alone.
There is no time.<eos> The boy must be saved.<eos> Saved from what?<eos> The witches.<eos> They were after him.
It just means time... .. a little time.<eos> But that's not the sort of thing you could ever understand, is it? Mmm. - What do you think of the towers?<eos> - I love them.<eos> - Then why are you ignoring them?<eos> - They're ignoring me.
Tell them the truth, Teddy. Come on!<eos> Rayna, the truth is that I pled "not guilty," remember?<eos> And my attorney is confident that I can beat this thing if we just drag it out long enough, wait... wait for the public to lose interest.<eos> Teddy, your daughters are not gonna lose interest.<eos> They need to see you.
And my attorney is confident that I can beat this thing if we just drag it out long enough, wait... wait for the public to lose interest.<eos> Teddy, your daughters are not gonna lose interest.<eos> They need to see you.<eos> They are being harassed every single day.<eos> They are asking me, "why won't our daddy see us?
Yes, but the silver lining is that by making love with Maddie and her dorm mates I got this great idea for your business.<eos> It is not acceptable to have sex with 18-year-olds.<eos> I agree, it was distasteful.<eos> No, it was gross, you old perv.<eos> The only reason you're even with these girls is that they're the only ones that can stand you for more than a night.
So, your moms don't want you to be the godmother anymore?<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think it just kinda caught them off-guard.<eos> - They'll come around.
Here, let me.<eos> So, have you talked to Father Pena yet?<eos> Uh, no, not yet.<eos> Where are your moms?<eos> Um, they're not coming.
But we have to, okay?<eos> And that includes you.<eos> Can I say something?<eos> Jude, you know, parents don't love you more because you're biologically theirs.<eos> I mean, your moms... they don't love you because you're easy to deal with or because you keep your mouth shut.
I posted a video, and it's the highest-rated instructional diapering video on YouTube.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, wait, you were bragging?<eos> Women are complicated, you know?<eos> They-they want men to come in and... and-and take what's complicated and uncomplicate it.
Because my bladder just thawed, so I gotta pee really bad.<eos> And because she ended the squirrel wars, President Miley Cyrus... Was added to the face of Lexus presents: Mount Rushmore.<eos> Always thought the robots would be the ones to rise up.<eos> Never thought it would be the squirrels.<eos> That's what they were counting on.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We just need to find her.<eos> Navarro, go to the strip club.<eos> See if you can identify any of the girls Junior was turning out.<eos> Alyssa knew about them, maybe they know about her.
Here lie the ruins of Hephaistia, one of the most important cities in Greece.<eos> It is named for the Greek god of metallurgy,<eos> Hephaestus, who was said to have fallen here from the sky and actually existed on Earth alongside humans.<eos> He's described in his workshop as being surrounded by automated robots.<eos> He flips on the machines and they bustle around, doing all the sort of... the hard busywork for him.
She's supposed to get married next Sunday.<eos> The first victim was 3 months ago, the second two days ago, and now Madison.<eos> He's accelerating.<eos> He may be a townie trolling bars to meet women.<eos> What if he interacted with them and they turned down his advances?
Great. Madison's parents, are they here yet?<eos> Their plane just landed.<eos> I sent a cruiser over to pick them up from the airport.<eos> What about the bridal party?<eos> They were the last ones to see her.
Bye.<eos> She was kind of young, huh?<eos> You know, I kind of guess that Leslie harbors a little disdain for the aging female body.<eos> So it seems like the age gap just keeps getting bigger.<eos> I mean, the girls, they just... they keep getting younger?
She was kind of young, huh?<eos> You know, I kind of guess that Leslie harbors a little disdain for the aging female body.<eos> So it seems like the age gap just keeps getting bigger.<eos> I mean, the girls, they just... they keep getting younger?<eos> Well, like, Leslie keeps getting older, and they all stay 21.
It's my duty to warn you that you must speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, or you may be punished as prescribed by law.<eos> Can you tell us why you asked to speak to the commission?<eos> When Avishai Raviv's name appeared in the newspapers, as a school principal I was shocked at the thought that behind a man who incited sedition among little schoolgirls, and who knows how that might affect them -<eos> I asked the girls what exactly was said and it was not the first time.<eos> They knew them well.
This is Dusty.<eos> He's with Arianna.<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> So you two know each other?<eos> Uh, yeah, our ladies have done other movies together, and where they go, we go.
I'd say Lacy was a little bit country.<eos> And I'm a little bit "let's rock and roll." Tell me something I can't see.<eos> Lacy was sending letters to a man named Matt Sudak.<eos> Up at the State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.<eos> They were all sent back unopened.
Come on. Putting new headlights on a minivan doesn't make it a Corvette.<eos> Yeah, these guys know what I'm talking about.<eos> And the women who get those fake, giant whoo-haws, they don't want you to miss them either.<eos> How's that?<eos> If you look those women in the eye when you're talking to them, they get all pissed off and they go, "Hey, my boobs are down here."
I taught you Donald Duck.<eos> And you stole it!<eos> Fellas, we're doing it!<eos> We livin'.<eos> Remember when we went on the mall date with our girlfriends and they were like "hi!"
Because charity shaming hurts everyone.<eos> You know, if there's one thing I really respect, It's plus-sized models who challenge the idea Of what makes a woman beautiful.<eos> These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign For plus-sized lingerie, and we want make sure They're protected from any harassing comments.<eos> Do I have to, sir?<eos> Hey, they're gonna be putting themselves out there,
Maybe these smartphones are getting too smart.<eos> We've got a line of trick-or-treaters out there.<eos> Someone covered my porch with Jack-o'-lanterns.<eos> It was the wives.<eos> You just start enjoying something... they ruin it.
Together: Trick or treat.<eos> The ladies across the street said you were giving out the good stuff.<eos> Oh. They did, did they?<eos> You know what?<eos> They're right.
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> As if we haven't got enough to deal with, these naked statues are causing havoc across the city.<eos> You've got whatever you need to get it sorted, and that's orders from above.<eos> So nothing on who these women are yet?<eos> No sir, though it seems possible that they were all prostitutes.
- You saw it?<eos> - On the staircase.<eos> Staircase?<eos> ! I got an unpleasant phone call from the Rad girls saying that as long as Eva is on our bus, we're all blacklisted.<eos> I don't understand why you're attacking Eva, when they're the enemy.
- I'm not leaving you.<eos> - You are leaving me, because you're gonna go home, and I'm just gonna be gone,<eos> - and the girls are gonna hate me.<eos> - No, they're not.<eos> They love you.
In your own words, in your own words.<eos> Oh, okay. Uh, we were here first, and there are no assigned seats.<eos> Yeah, signage.<eos> Oh, you guys, I don't think they know how to read.<eos> And they're not hot enough to pull it off.
And Customs and Excise are squeaky-clean.<eos> But it's still a big risk calling them in.<eos> Those girls have nowhere to go, no way of getting home.<eos> They can't speak the language well enough to ask for help.<eos> All they can do is accept being bought and sold, traded.
- Freed pink?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - We didn't...<eos> We could talk to the girls and see what they want too.<eos> They can...
It's not been thought through but it's a really good idea, isn't it?<eos> Isn't it?<eos> What am I supposed to do with this?<eos> Give it to the lesbians.<eos> They love a banner.
Maybe will even work.<eos> Let .<eos> Kyle, the girls have an idea!<eos> Girls have an idea?<eos> What they may have an idea?
Her website.<eos> And then one day I got a message from a stranger.<eos> A fan of Hannah who wanted to pay for a modeling session.<eos> I knew it wasn't normal, but the photos were...<eos> I mean, they...
Maybe I should get counselling.<eos> Six pissed women tried to pull your trousers down.<eos> Get over it.<eos> They touched my balls!<eos> They should get the fucking counselling, then.
The young Turkish girls are abducted from their parents who love them.<eos> Or purchased from parents who love gold more.<eos> Though the women are slaves, their lives are better in the harem.<eos> Because they have brocades and jewels?<eos> Perhaps they would prefer to live in the desert, eating only sand.
Your love for me is absolute.<eos> - Gacet is finished.<eos> We have won.<eos> - So your bruises were not for naught.<eos> And they will fade, just has Gacet has faded.
We've taken our inspirations from outside of games with emotion and character development and storytelling in a way that we've tried to break new ground that you have an association and an attachment with a character in a game<eos> that makes you want to feel for that story, makes you want to feel like you're there making the decisions all along the way.<eos> Good storytelling is not just entertainment.<eos> Good stories can help us grow.<eos> They can teach us about the past and challenge us to aspire to higher and greater things.
-Phil, I...<eos> I honestly think that women sometimes don't want us to have all the answers, you know?<eos> It's... it's like doing nothing for them is better than just saying anything to say something to them.<eos> Think about it. What do they...<eos> what do they really want? They want us...
Um...<eos> The girls... Savi, Karen, April... do I tell them what I have planned?<eos> 'Cause Janet's got me freaking out, man, and I just want to make sure that, you know, Joss' key people show up.<eos> Yeah, well... I-I-I think if you really want it to be romantic, you know, um, effortless for her, do not tell them. [Chuckles]<eos> Her ladies cannot keep a secret to save their lives, but they... they will show up for her.
The serpent transforms, rebirths,<eos> - perfects itself.<eos> - In your twisted mind, you actually believe that you're helping these women, that you're perfecting them, transforming them.<eos> I offered them beauty.<eos> They rejected it.
Your climactic moment is gonna happen any minute.<eos> Yeah, I'm hoping.<eos> When the guys come over, they have their own set of expectations, which may be on target and may not be on target.<eos> And they think, oh, gee, I've been writing to Irina, svitlana, Elena.<eos> I've been writing to all these women and they write to me, and I wrote to them, I told them I was coming over.
Now, before the ladies get here, we should discuss some scenarios.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - Scenario number one... - Mm-hmm.<eos> They're big 'uns.
She'll be normal and all?<eos> - You know her?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> She was just in the audience having a hoot of a time with a bunch of rowdy ladies.<eos> They interrupted one of Carmen's songs.
Okay...<eos> "With rock-hard abs under his jungle fatigues...<eos> "Carlos was revolutionary in more ways than one... "and overthrowing the Sandinistas was not his only objective."<eos> Okay, now, that chapter's there for the mommy book-club crowd.<eos> They need a little beefcake with their politics.
Hey, Alana.<eos> What was that?<eos> Oh, those girls didn't want me to sit with them.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Okay, they... don't want you to sit with them, but it's because you're smarter than them... way smarter, and they can't hang.
Was he seeing anyone?<eos> Do you know who the woman could have been?<eos> No.<eos> Ron loved the ladies.<eos> Unfortunately, they only loved him back about 10% of the time.
- Accessorizing.<eos> I just tend to put a lot of thought into thinking about ways to make an outfit really pop.<eos> I wonder if you put a fraction of that thought into your grades.<eos> Oh, I didn't.<eos> I really try not to focus on my grades because I don't believe they define me --
It's spacious, safe, gives good mileage.. ...and it's a practical car.<eos> Yeah, practical.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> That's the favorite word of the girls.<eos> Whenever you say it, they start controlling you.
You know, it would be nice to have some mom friends to hang out with.<eos> Hey, Joey!<eos> Hands out of your butt!<eos> I wish I could just break the ice and show them how fun I am, you know?<eos> They would totally want to be my friend.
But instead of trees...we have antennae.<eos> And if I may...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> So we have radio antennae.<eos> Now, they send out pulses... ..which are like our fishing line. then the waves bounce off.
No!<eos> What did your Fraulein Elsa tell you?<eos> I knew it would work.<eos> That banner is bringing them in.<eos> Those twins, they are going to save us.
Bette and Dot are victims, too.<eos> They were stabbed themselves.<eos> Is that why they ran from the hospital?<eos> Their mother died days before they were attacked, and there was no sign of any forced entry at the house.<eos> Way I see it, they murdered their mother, and then they tried to cover it up.
What's your plan?<eos> To trust Dad!<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm always going to be coming back here to you.<eos> Two families, another baby on the way, and they don't know about each other.
80% of communication is involuntary and non verbal.<eos> Oooooh! Yes, well, from Gerry's expression any investigator could instantly tell they're dealing with someone whose mind is closed to new ideas.<eos> Take your eyebrows.<eos> What?<eos> They're the defining feature of your face and already they've betrayed you.
Runner up for the Glind Scholarship you received that allowed you to attend this university.<eos> I don't know where Jay Santos is, but if he were here, I'm sure of one thing.<eos> He would've been on time for his midterm.<eos> Think of this as a learning experience, Philip.<eos> Things do happen, so we have to anticipate that they might.
Salvation and I parted company many years ago.<eos> Well, I also play chess.<eos> The old rules or Mad Queen's chess?<eos> Mad Queen, of course.<eos> They are Spanish rules.
I needed you to do one thing:<eos> a simple apology to the Hus.<eos> You cannot let these people walk all over you unless they are giving you a massage.<eos> I am your boss.<eos> And they are my boss.
Ginny is being so unreasonable.<eos> I scratched her car, then I fixed it, but we're still not cool.<eos> You want to hear about uncool?<eos> Victor Hu's moms tried to break up me and Carl.<eos> They Yoko Ono'd us, and I'm not just saying that because they're horrible Asian women.
You set the timer for 20 minutes.<eos> I'm gonna make a cake so moist, girls are gonna be, like, "Ew.<eos> I hate that word."<eos> I'm gonna be, like, "Just taste the cake."<eos> And they're gonna be, like, "Damn, it's moist!"
All I know is I can't deal with you hating me.<eos> Brenna.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> Look.<eos> It's just hard when you're into girls and you have no idea if they're into girls.
I'll let housekeeping know.<eos> Some of our regulars request we have flowers or champagne waiting for them.<eos> That's all right.<eos> We don't need any of that fuss.<eos> Well, women say that, but they appreciate a nice gesture.
Yes!<eos> They'll sing to her at midnight the middle of Times Square.<eos> She and 500 German tourists will savor that memory for all times.<eos> Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls' pigtails on playgrounds?<eos> 'Cause they're so easy to grab.
They'll sing to her at midnight the middle of Times Square.<eos> She and 500 German tourists will savor that memory for all times.<eos> Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls' pigtails on playgrounds?<eos> 'Cause they're so easy to grab.<eos> They're just begging to be pulled.
If you decide to build boats for me, I would certainly treat you like a king.<eos> You think you can buy me with riches?<eos> I would never insult you like that.<eos> What I need from you, Floki, are your ideas...<eos> For they are worth more than gold and silver, and they come from the gods.
She won the National Medal of Science.<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Sun Yoon Chang...<eos> She's a Delta Science Fellow.<eos> So they actually are outstanding women of science.
It's enough.<eos> If we double that?<eos> What do you mean even we have some principles.<eos> I'm the father of two daughters.<eos> When they are of marriageable age nobody will bother about my uniform or my honesty.
I liked it when he was gone, even though he never left much food.<eos> Do you know where the disappearing place is?<eos> I didn't get to go.<eos> He only took Violet and Sheila once.<eos> They were more special.
I am a chief.<eos> Is that right?<eos> A chief?<eos> Show these witches no fear or they will devour you.<eos> They feast on the blood of great warriors.
and that's how her obituary was going to read anyway.<eos> I may have a simply elegant solution.<eos> Krieger. Right? This place is like a Habitrail, there are secret passages everywhere.<eos> I think that's why the colored maids never felt safe.<eos> They'd be polishing a spittoon or whatever and suddenly,
Karen, it's just sex.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> But it's not just sex.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> You're teaching him to degrade and objectify women that they exist solely to satisfy his urges when you could, in fact, be teaching him that the best kind of sex comes from making a connection.
They have four children, all girls.<eos> Pretty little things.<eos> And I've left word that should any harm befall me at the hands of the scum who have me in their sight, then your four nieces, their mother, and their grandmother will all be spitroasted like hogs.<eos> So come with me, William.<eos> You will be safe, they will be safe, and your men will be safe.
She's on a call. She can call back.<eos> Glen, this magazine is not about tweets or likes on Facebook, for God's sake!<eos> For 57 years, women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!<eos> Matilda, please.<eos> Whenever they've had a bad day at work or at home, they've come to us!
You lived in Kenya?<eos> I'm an honorary Kikuyu tribe member, but that's a story for another day.<eos> Listen, Marcus, you're a sweet, smart, honest, just wonderful kid.<eos> Unfortunately, those qualities repel women.<eos> They like guys who are mysterious.
Yes, for a little while.<eos> Hasn't changed much.<eos> That's not what I heard.<eos> Some ladies in my sewing circle seem to think your Mr Lennox was rather too progressive.<eos> They would think that, wouldn't they?
-Here's me, biding my time for the right moment and then a records check turns up Justice Jeffrey's activities.<eos> You murdered two innocent women... ..and framed a third... for telling the truth.<eos> Well... Well, Father... ..it seems like you don't know everything after all.<eos> Not one of them is innocent.<eos> They murdered my father, as surely as if they'd pulled the lever on the drop.
Ohh!<eos> It's a beauty.<eos> Listen, I've gotta tell you to tone it down with the chicks, mate.<eos> I've got daughters.<eos> Mate, they didn't see anything.
I'm sorry? "King Lear"?<eos> Shakespeare?<eos> Basically, Lear split his kingdom in half and gave it to his two daughters, deal being<eos> Lear get to hang out and keep 100 knights.<eos> They agree, and then later, these two bitch-ass daughters, they change the deal.
If it's, uh, absolutely necessary.<eos> She's a little under the weather, and she's sleeping it off right now.<eos> This trip has taken its toll on her.<eos> Look, if I don't kill everybody in here, we are never gonna make it.<eos> Well, maybe that's what the voices are telling you, but they're not calling the shots right now, okay?
Or ci? Mes have fucking.<eos> Never questions what I fa? The when do not est? s, or where I was, or with whom.<eos> Never worry.<eos> I die ci? Mes you.<eos> I ci? Months of your ex, the women find in Paris and at? of your students, because I am sure they fantasize with you and you know and you stay excited.
How many drinks have you had?<eos> Quite a few.<eos> Are you here with anyone?<eos> So, your grandson didn't get married, but the two nice ladies did!<eos> They run a candle shop!
That's right.<eos> If those drugs helped kill Lila, somewhere knew where she got them.<eos> But none of her friends would say anything.<eos> So I hired a private detective to find out more about what happened that night.<eos> But they denied being her friends.
They're a lot to take.<eos> They're so gropey, and you know I bruise like a Bartlett pear.<eos> But, Dad, if they're bothering you, I'll just ask them to leave.<eos> No, no, no, we can't.<eos> They're the only thing worse than family.

The idea was first introduced in 1883 by Austrian physicist Ernst Mach.<eos> Mach's principle, at the simplest level, is the assertion that when you push on an object, the reason why it pushes back on you is because of the gravitational action of the most distant matter in the universe acting through the object.<eos> And so the matter out there, far, far away, is the stuff that determines the inertial properties of objects locally.<eos> Mach's principle basically says that all the stars, all the planets, all the galaxies out there do, in fact, have an effect on us here.<eos> And the reason they do is because of the way they warp space-time.
Boys!<eos> Age group 12 - 14... please move to the starting line...<eos> All birth certificates to Mr. Rathod at the records-desk for verification.<eos> Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare...<eos> When your little bells will land on the skating track... they'll blast people's ears off!
I'm sorry.<eos> It was a terrible, terrible accident.<eos> And after his death, this... fear started to overwhelm me.<eos> When I closed my eyes... then the nightmares would come.<eos> They crippled my sleep.
Mumble, mumble. Oh, speaking of which, I do not want you calling them about this, do you hear me?<eos> I'm gonna tell them in person.<eos> You do that because I'll tell you what's gonna happen:<eos> you're gonna tell 'em What?<eos> and they're gonna lose their mind.
You've got my full support.<eos> All right?<eos> I really appreciate that, man.<eos> That's why I come down here to talk to you.<eos> I know you got things you're keeping inside and you gotta get these things off your chest, or I swear, they're gonna press the air right out of you.
Eyes forward, not to the ground.<eos> Oh, you know that walk?<eos> I was born free.<eos> Then walk free with one of your gals.<eos> They ain't important.
And most of it's going to be about their problems.<eos> Under no circumstances should you try to solve those problems.<eos> Just nod, say "that sounds hard" as many times as possible, and then buy them tapas.<eos> - I don't think...<eos> - They love tapas.
And how did that work out?<eos> One is a fugitive.<eos> Oh... He's a very nice fugitive.<eos> The other one is divorced and living on an island as far away from his parents as he can possibly get.<eos> And my two girls, well, they are... they're a whole nother story.
Selling lies.<eos> I'm selling hope.<eos> What's so horrible about that?<eos> You don't stop, do you?<eos> For 50 bucks, those women, they went home feeling better about themselves.
Thanks.<eos> So, I'm going to the library later, if you want to come. Oh. [ Sighs ] Brick, what are you doing?<eos> I can't decide.<eos> Do I want to smell like a polo player or a yachtsman?<eos> I don't want girls to think I'm an athlete, but if I smell like a boat owner, they might think I'm a snob.
- I put my heart and soul into these letters!<eos> - But you did not send them.<eos> Did not send them!<eos> I wanted to keep you from humiliation.<eos> They would simply be transferred to you here in any other office or... worse, would hang on the wall like an anecdote.
She ate a whole breadstick without opening her mouth.<eos> Hey, you know, Miller, you know, something... something's really bugging me, and I need to get it... out in the open before we go out tonight.<eos> You see, when I-I slap tens with someone, I need to slide it off, you know, real cool, like...<eos> I mean... I mean, the chicks...<eos> they-they really dig that.
Don't prick me.<eos> Honey, um...<eos> What?<eos> Why would you ask me- haddie and Lauren were kissing.<eos> - They--haddie and Lauren--
Sign on the other side.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> In school you had long plaits, too bad you cut them off.<eos> You fool.<eos> It was better when they were long.
Leave us.<eos> What have you done?<eos> More importantly, David, what have you done?<eos> Before you answer, consider your options.<eos> You can claim that you had no choice but to kill these women after you interrogated them and found they're in league with Gabriel.
But a kid is permanent.<eos> It's not like you're dating.<eos> You can't just stop calling or change your number or fake your own death because they annoy you.<eos> You do that to women?<eos> No, they do it to me.
It's like that Ferris wheel sex scene in her book... everything's backwards and upside down.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> Women want to be the man?<eos> Let 'em.<eos> They can pull out my chair, open my door.
Merchandise.<eos> I'm going to need to sample your merchandise. [Chuckles] No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You... You don't want this, eh?<eos> These women, they're good for housework only, eh?<eos> They have, eh, disease.
I must give you some seed.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> I was just telling Algernon that that corner there was made, may I say, for fuchsias.<eos> Ah, dear, you will have to forgive me, I can not bear fuchsias.<eos> They always remind me of over-dressed women.
Look at my eyes!<eos> (GRUNTS) Okay, Paddy, ready for the landing!<eos> Storm the beach!<eos> Storm the beach!<eos> Their little wings flutter around your face, but they don't bother you.
Do people have.. cars and trains and airplanes now?<eos> [laughter]<eos> Aha!<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
Yeah, we have to. [Buzzer]<eos> I'm glad you guys came in today, 'cause anybody that comes to a Blazer game deserves my interest and my support...<eos> - But I really think this is a conversation for our choreographer.<eos> It just seemed odd that the only women on the floor were there as entertainers.<eos> They could've helped with the ball.
I don't understand why you're down.<eos> That was great that was unbelievable.<eos> We lost the game.<eos> Weren't those dancers amazing?<eos> So they lost, too, because we lost.
Phoebe and Lyla. What about it?<eos> Oh, come on, Abby, they're the poster models for divorce.<eos> We used to mock them, remember, with their surgeries and their outfits and their kegels.<eos> Well, I was wrong about them, and they've really been there for me.<eos> That's because they got divorced.
Are you really certain about this?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I'll get another blanket and tell the girls.<eos> They won't want to miss this.
You're such a modern girl!<eos> How could you agree to an arranged marriage?<eos> Modern girls don't have arranged marriages?<eos> They do.<eos> But they don't hang out alone in Delhi a month before.
Your parents?<eos> I was scared.<eos> Okay, I was scared that if I came back home and I was out in the open that he'd find me again.<eos> So how did you protect her?<eos> They hid me in the woods.
What's goin' on?<eos> You guys touch pee-pees or something?<eos> I wish.<eos> No, our wives got in a big fight and banned us from seeing each other.<eos> So what if they're in a fight?
What's going on here, huh?<eos> What is this?<eos> The twins, Elsa.<eos> We know what you did with the twins.<eos> They ran off!
I wish you could be inside my body for one minute to know what it feels like to be me!<eos> It's like when I had tuberculosis, and you took me out to the Utah desert, and there was nothing but dry open space for hundreds of miles around us.<eos> That is what is inside of me.<eos> Those girls were a cool stream of glacier water.<eos> My heart bloomed as they nourished it.
Are a comfortable man.<eos> But this... would not clear a tenth of my father's debts.<eos> It wouldn't provide my sisters with dowries.<eos> My father would sell them to the highest bidder.<eos> Well, they... well, they could live with us!
Problem is, no one's gonna testify to that.<eos> He's ruthless, he doesn't think twice about kidnapping young girls, raping them, and holding their babies hostage.<eos> Hold on.<eos> That might be our way in.<eos> These girls, they've given up on themselves.
Come with me.<eos> You guys go find the switch.<eos> We'll use the livers to attract the Lampreys.<eos> It's so dark. How do we know they're down there? One second.<eos> They're down there. Dump'em in.
OK.<eos> I'll... I'll tell him.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> The lucky ones... they're not needed.
That he was murdered, Inspector!<eos> Because it wasn't the right whiskey?<eos> ! Because it wasn't the right whiskey.<eos> You told me to steer clear of murky waters.<eos> Well, sometimes they come to me.
Merchandise.<eos> I'm going to need to sample your merchandise. [Chuckles] No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You... You don't want this, eh?<eos> These women, they're good for housework only, eh?<eos> They have, eh, disease.
It's not a matter of politics, but of family.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> Talk to the women about such scenes as you've witnessed in your duties.<eos> That's not a fit conversation for any table, let alone amongst ladies.<eos> They know more than you give them credit for.
It had a bad effect on one of the women.<eos> Someone put the chocolates in the fridge and the stick mags are out of date, think we're running a supermarket?<eos> Listen, arsehole.<eos> I've got a responsibility to those women.<eos> They trust me to bring in decent gear that's not gonna fuck 'em up.
I was determined that he should not return to his home in hell.<eos> And my hands were plunged into the boiling black tar.<eos> Hellfire.<eos> These hands have actually touched hell.<eos> And they burn me still.
However, andr� believes there might be another way to find it - by looking up. Right-handed neutrinos are not completely stable.<eos> Like radioactive elements, they sometimes fall apart, and as they do, they create a flash of X-ray light.<eos> A very important feature about right-handed neutrinos, is that they came to X-rays.<eos> So one way to look for right-handed neutrinos as dark matter is to look at a region of the sky, and we see if these galaxies are emitting X-rays.<eos> In fact, recent studies of distant galaxies have detected some strange anomalies in the X-rays they emit.
Robert thinks elementary particles could work the same way.<eos> To make the universe truly symmetrical, robert and his colleagues believe there must be a mirror image of the weak force, and it must act on mirror image particles called mirror matter.<eos> Every particle has a twin particle. Just like ordinary particles couple with their left-handed spins, mirror particles will couple with right-handed spins.<eos> Mirror matter particles would be stable and completely invisible to us, just like dark matter.<eos> So, if they exist, robert and his colleagues think they could be dark matter, but their existence would also have much larger implications.
No cameras.<eos> No wife. What do you think you're doing?<eos> Those high-pitched screams you hear out there, Will...<eos> Women.<eos> They're the ones buying your albums, or at least they were.
Saw your girls sing the other night.<eos> I'm guessing that they're not hoping to be astrophysicists when they grow up.<eos> Not likely, which is fine.<eos> I mean, look, music is the family business, okay?<eos> I just wish they... they took school half as seriously as they do singing.
Look, aria, we cannot take anymore chances.<eos> We have to cut the cord with ali Before she drags us down with her.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying we use what we got from noel.<eos> The pictures, the conversations with shana, 'cause they prove that ali was alive And decidedly un-kidnapped for the past 2 years.
And you've been talking to the friends.<eos> Sometimes without any adults around.<eos> I know the rules, Mr. Montgomery.<eos> No one's trying to trick the girls.<eos> They just need to know how serious this is.

Kim!<eos> Irene!<eos> Can't talk, my sisters were just in a horrible boating accident.<eos> I'm the one that called the front office.<eos> They're fine.
What is it?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> That is really sweet.<eos> But if they can't go in, I don't want to be queen of this prom.
Hey!<eos> Bixby.<eos> Her name was Bixby.<eos> You're desperate to avenge those who've been taken from you, but desperation will only get others killed.<eos> You must learn to control your emotions, or they will be the end of you.
Elam: They work hard.<eos> Those women's lives are at risk.<eos> We are in agreement on that, are we not?<eos> Elam: I need to hear a bid for these slaves now.<eos> They're worth more than that.
- Awesome.<eos> - No way.<eos> Mike started to sign it and the pen provided was stolen away by the girls.<eos> And they were able to write their names where our names were.<eos> They played dirty and they bumped them up a flight.
We could get eliminated on the first leg. It's a nightmare.<eos> You're the best partner ever.<eos> Good job.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I was writing my name on the board and they grabbed their grease pen and put their name on the line.
Women don't come to me for just sex.<eos> It's about...<eos> It's about listening.<eos> A lot of times, I know more about them than their husbands do.<eos> They trust me, and I'm not gonna betray that.
What it does is it makes you stronger.<eos> See, that Iranian, he is paying for the privilege of making you stronger.<eos> See, now my other girls, see, they can't handle that.<eos> They ain't brave like you.<eos> They ain't special, are they?
Prostitution more profitable than the movie business?<eos> More profitable more reliable and... perfectly legal in this country, which is nice.<eos> If you're not trafficking in underage girls.<eos> These girls wanna work.<eos> Can I help it if they lie about their age to me?
Come on, come on, come on, sit down.<eos> ♪ what a man, what a man, what a man ♪ ♪ what a mighty good man ♪<eos> Think about meeting women like you're selling yourself.<eos> All right?<eos> They need to feel like you've made an effort, that you didn't just roll out of bed and throw on yesterday's suit with a new shirt. Holy crap.
You know, these routines I have, these tracks my life has run on, they can be changed.<eos> I can make new tracks.<eos> Right?<eos> There are things in my life, things in my past, they are unresolved.<eos> They need to be attended.
Today, almost every superhero has an icon on his chest.<eos> Could this be inspired by some piece of technology our ancestors witnessed on an alien being... like the arc reactor on Iron Man's chest that powers his suit?<eos> And might these similarities mean the stories of Superman,<eos> Batman, and Spider-Man are based on our ancestors' experiences with extraterrestrials?<eos> These are things that are common and symbolic throughout these stories, and they, to me, imply that we're talking about similar figures or figures that are here for the same reason.
Bye!<eos> You're not too busy, are you?<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Why do you always come with different girls?<eos> I guess they're not your girlfriends, are they?
Can I ask you a question?<eos> Why do you always come with different girls?<eos> I guess they're not your girlfriends, are they?<eos> Why do you think they are not?<eos> They don't look like your girlfriends.
Absolutely. What do you mean?<eos> I mean they're missing, Jordan.<eos> Ever since last night.<eos> Where'd the girls go after they left here?<eos> They, um... they took an Uber home.
Right?<eos> It's Virgo.<eos> The virgin.<eos> The killer said that the women were chosen because they were "seemingly innocent," virginal.<eos> But they were all in the sex trade, too.
- Oh, look, a hummingbird.<eos> - What the hell are you talking about?<eos> There's no such thing as a hummingbird.<eos> Birds don't hum.<eos> They sing.
- What the hell are you talking about?<eos> There's no such thing as a hummingbird.<eos> Birds don't hum.<eos> They sing.<eos> They basically invented singing.
And Tiffany and Sophie.<eos> But we don't talk to Sophie.<eos> Here's the thing... it starts with that bag, and then you need stuff to put into it, like makeup.<eos> Are we going shopping?<eos> You only want that bag because your friends have it, but then they'll want other new bags.
Because I can text the Easter Bunny, you know.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're trying to help?<eos> As you stand here, chatting, chatting, your lives are ending.<eos> Unless you wake up, unless you free yourselves from these dreadful creatures, they're going to destroy you.
- it's 'cause they change Every time we play.<eos> - yeah, they're always changing.<eos> They're- but you- we're kind of against that.<eos> The words to the songs Are as much a part Of the song as the bass, And there's no reason<eos> Really to separate the two. - ideally you should just Listen to the songs And just intuitively feel What they're about.
He's not.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I'm not a kid.<eos> These young girls, they don't get it.<eos> They don't see...
I got to move all these women to a holding facility so we can figure out their legal status.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You can't lock them up.<eos> They've been locked up ever since they got here.<eos> They'll be cared for.
Lady Kenna?<eos> - Have we met?<eos> - In the tent city.<eos> Noble wives bragging about their summer homes at your expense.<eos> They are preening pea hens with empty heads.
Terrorist organizations?<eos> From al-Qaeda to the Red Hacker Alliance out of Beijing.<eos> Our employees have targets on their backs-- that's why we do everything in our power to keep them safe.<eos> But the truth is, the technologies we develop are the cutting edge.<eos> They're worth killing for-- a fact we're, admittedly, quite proud of.
Of course not.<eos> Let's let Zoe answer.<eos> Maybe Perry?<eos> I mean, she's the one who told Mia only babies share their room with their baby sister.<eos> So you sometimes want to hang out with the big girls, they... they never hurt you before, maybe by accident?
This sounds strange, I know.<eos> But when Jess' roommate got home the night she disappeared, there was a smell in the apartment.<eos> I-It smelled like something was baking.<eos> Like nutmeg.<eos> The thing is-- over the years, five other women have gone missing and never been heard from again, and each time the place where they disappeared from, it has the same smell.
Women are flirting. I try to be nice, pose for a selfie, autograph a Jersey.<eos> That is very nice of you.<eos> We're just putting the events of the evening in context.<eos> Okay, so you were flirting, and Paula got mad.<eos> I know that those girls are his fans, but they got to know that he's mine.
I don't want to feel like this every day.<eos> A year ago I thought I was OK, but now...<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I keep seeing those dead kids.<eos> If you quit, they will lose someone who could help them.
Twin girls.<eos> Passed as infants.<eos> Twins, but not identical.<eos> I saw little differences, even as babes.<eos> I used to wonder what they would look like if they could have grown.
Faster, harder, louder.<eos> We'd even arranged to finish on the glittering jet-set island of Capri in a couple of classic Ford Capris.<eos> Nothing could go wrong this time.<eos> Frankly, the roads we've lined up this year are biblical.<eos> Well, they're not biblical, they're more modern than that, but they are magnificent.
He's back with the nursery group, but his attitude is now very different.<eos> Playing with youngsters is not a backward step for him.<eos> On the contrary, this is part of a plan.<eos> Because where there are babies, there are mother chimps.<eos> And they're now starting to take notice of him for the first time.
Why did they say that Jason and Medea's fates were entwined?<eos> He's going to kill her.<eos> You don't get more entwined.<eos> They said he wouldn't be able to kill her.<eos> - What do they know?
My father said that they were just stories.<eos> You're leaving tomorrow...<eos> Aye...<eos> Will you be joining the sister's then?<eos> They'll keep me here, no doubt.
I've been collecting them all my life.<eos> So I'm not the first.<eos> You have had other women.<eos> Yes...<eos> I've loved them all and they loved me back.
- Yeah.<eos> She said that.<eos> - Well... What did she say?<eos> And I mean exactly.<eos> - You have to understand... these women that she knows, they're all at a certain stage of life, and they're all looking for, you know, basically the same things.
They want the whole package, and to that end, there are certain things that you lack.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Like a job.<eos> These woman are marriage-minded, okay?<eos> They're looking for somebody who's ready to settle down.
- Yeah, but that fits me to a "t", brother.<eos> - No. - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> It doesn't, okay?<eos> They want to be taken care of.
One turtle, crawl, crawl, crawl.<eos> Two fish, swim, swim, swim.<eos> Three big lobsters, swim swim, swim.<eos> Lobsters don't swim... they jump.
I was not the only Bradshaw in a terrifying situation.<eos> Anyway, so, yeah, my 16-year-old daughter needed tampons, and guess who had to go get 'em? Me.<eos> Which, uh, you probably do all the time.<eos> So it's not a big mystery to you, but, you know, the big problem, really, at our house, is, uh, the fact that my girls don't get along.<eos> They... they...
And we would make them safe, Mrs Gable.<eos> And improve them also?<eos> If they seek to improve themselves, we will help them.<eos> Through prayer and their promise of chastity?<eos> Through whatever means they choose for themselves.
But little did I know he meant that week.<eos> I think we were the first action figures of RB,<eos> The Ikettes, the Ike and Tina Turner Review.<eos> The girls were absolutely sensational.<eos> Tina was a force of nature, of course, but they were no slouches either.
[ both laugh ] When I turned my chair, I tried to play it cool, Because as soon as I went like...<eos> They're way too curious.<eos> In my four seasons, I'd never seen anything like that before.<eos> You'll be able to do things with him that defy gravity Because of how high he can go, And women go crazy over a guy with a falsetto.<eos> They love that.
This isn't Oz...<eos> Women fight with gossip and rumors.<eos> They might peg you for rich... and... Try to hit you up for a commissary.<eos> And there are lesbians.<eos> They're not gonna bother you...

My friends, they were, like, "Oh, you should just have a meaningless fling to get over it," which is not something that I do ever.<eos> No.<eos> Me, either.<eos> I never... Go on.<eos> They point out this guy who's nice and definitely hot.
- Like stinging nettles and dock leaves.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> We're calling them "Shortcuts". They don't need a command to follow them.<eos> They are the command.
But why would she steal it?<eos> I mean, I know what a tweaker looks like.<eos> She was no tweaker.<eos> It wasn't for Hannah.<eos> She was poisoning her sisters, and they didn't know what was happening to them.
Each of these girls was paired with a writer from her own country... to help tell her story.<eos> These are true stories... if sometimes re-imagined to capture to capture the things these girls... and these writers, want you to see.<eos> And their stories are important.<eos> Because these girls hold our future in their hands.<eos> If they, and the millions of girls like them... succeed in getting the kind of education they need... incredible things will happen.
I can't! Right now I can't.<eos> I made a promise,<eos> - and I owe it to our daughters to keep it.<eos> - Our daughters?<eos> - Yes! - What do they have to do with this?
I just realized. I hate you. (Scoffs)<eos> Oh, come on, June.<eos> These girls are a joke.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Okay, maybe they're not perfect, but you don't want to be my friend, and they wanna be my friends, and I wanna drink cappuccinos on the sidewalk.
You and Freddie.<eos> It had made her sick...<eos> She's all right, but in her condition, she needs peace.<eos> Women talk.<eos> That is something they do.
But enough about stuffing dead animals.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm gonna tell you a little story about real, living things.<eos> Four girls from Shunyi, China, get told that, if they come to America illegally and work as housemaids, they will get citizenship in seven years.<eos> But they aren't gonna be maids.
When it was released that Paul had got married, because people didn't know that he was getting married, phone call after phone call was all Paul fans, crying down the phone,<eos> "We didn't know he was getting married!"<eos> and, oh, some of them that wanted to kill themselves, and "Oh, I'll never be a Paul McCartney fan again! He's gone and married somebody else!"<eos> so you just had to calm them down and say, "Well, you know, he's still Paul McCartney, he'll still be making his records,"<eos> and they'd be "No no no, but he's got married now and it's not the same."
'Though we were only in our early 20s, 'a little more than girls, 'we served the women of the East End in their hour of greatest need.'<eos> 'In return for our care, 'they gave us the most precious gift they could... 'their trust.
I think it's what's been going on the last few years.<eos> I, you know, I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> I just don't know that, um, I just don't know that I'm happy. I don't know that you're happy, either, if we're really being honest.<eos> But our girls love their parents, and they don't know what's going on with us, and they don't know what's going on in this marriage, and it... it needs to stay that way.

I'm hiring a realtor.<eos> That girl.<eos> I knew her years ago.<eos> Listen, Abs.<eos> Sometimes these women, I protect them and they get...
- You see her door open, dive for cover.<eos> And whatever you do, do not tell her you have a car.<eos> Old ladies are giant con artists.<eos> - Con artists?<eos> - They start small.
Why so many tortoises tried to cross the lava barrier, nobody knows.<eos> What drove them to keep attempting this impossible journey?<eos> Perhaps they were desperately trying to rejoin other members of their group.<eos> Their deaths, however, are significant.<eos> They illustrate a principle that applies to the whole of nature.
I've been to many wonderful places but none more extraordinary than here, the Galapagos Islands.<eos> These have been called nature's greatest experiment, for here, life has evolved in isolation and produced some extraordinary results.<eos> The extraordinary creatures of Galapagos astounded<eos> Charles Darwin when he first came here 200 years ago.<eos> They led him to formulate his revelatory theory of evolution by natural selection.
Well, Galapagos is unique in the sense that it's a system in the Tropics, it's lying right on the equator under the strong equatorial sun and these are usually systems which are considered to be deserts for productivity.<eos> But Galapagos is different.<eos> There's a unique confluence of currents and most importantly, a submarine undercurrent called the Cromwell current, and these undercurrents are bringing micronutrients up into these sunlit waters.<eos> The Galapagos Islands in the open Pacific lie in the path of these converging currents.<eos> They deflect the cold, nutrient-laden waters upwards to mingle with the warm water above.
Just so you know.<eos> Never wonder why we call of mom who works award.<eos> "A working mom" and a dad who works is just called "a dad"?<eos> Well, for eons, women were the unsung heroes of raising the kids.<eos> They tended the cave while men were hunting, gathering, pillaging, and eventually donning sharp suits to work in ad agencies and host game shows.
Tell that to raw onions.<eos> Raw what?<eos> Raw onions.<eos> I used to love raw onions.<eos> They didn't love me back, so I had to hit permanent delete on raw onions.
Principe Island, 140 miles off the west coast of Africa, May 29th, 1919<eos> During a rare total solar eclipse, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington photographs the deflection of star light around the darkened sun, to try and prove Albert Einstein's much disputed Theory of General Relativity.<eos> The theory of General Relativity says light will bend in a gravitational field.<eos> So when the eclipse blocks out the sun, the stars close to the sun can now be seen.<eos> And if the light bends, they'll be in a slightly different position.
I always have gum...<eos> So I hand some out.<eos> The girls grab at it and light up like it's a sign that it's all okay, that it's safe.<eos> "Shh. Shh. Shh.<eos> Not yet." But they don't understand.
I don't know, but they're bound to be saying something.<eos> There's a lot of sluts out there.<eos> These girls, they don't think about the babies.<eos> Well, I think she does...<eos> They don't think about the other person.
These girls, they don't think about the babies.<eos> Well, I think she does...<eos> They don't think about the other person.<eos> Well, she...<eos> All they ever think about is the sex.
At times, they say they do, but you know women.<eos> They like to lie.<eos> Women have this image of a man in their head that they've had since they were little girls watching princess movies and playing with their daddies.<eos> You try to accommodate them, which is an activity that women can't relate to.<eos> So you change, and you try to be what they want you to be.
When you meet a girl, try to be funny.<eos> That's all you got to do.<eos> Be funny.<eos> Girls like witty guys.<eos> I'm not very attractive, but I'm funny, and they appreciate it.
I worked that line.<eos> And I know that if these girls don't know each other, they won't like each another.<eos> And if they don't like each other, they won't respect each other.<eos> - I get the...<eos> And if they don't respect each other, they can never, ever, work together.
Yes.<eos> It's a go.<eos> We are very excited and proud to be the first county in the state of Ohio to use brand-new touch-screen voting.<eos> Before the polls open tomorrow morning, we will insert these memory cards into the machines.<eos> They will store and tabulate the votes.
Couple weeks ago, she said she had plenty of boyfriends, but they were boys first and they were friends second.<eos> Guess that's why none of those fellas ever worked out.<eos> If you two were getting married, I think one of the guests would have mentioned it by now.<eos> Margie didn't want any of the other girls to know.<eos> Going through what they're all going through.
I've never even met him.<eos> Well, you tell them.<eos> You tell them, "My dad is Lee Burley, the drummer for Death Maiden."<eos> You see what those smug little bitches say then.<eos> I mean, who are they, huh?
[Doorbell rings] You know what the hardest part about all this is gonna be?<eos> Where's my broken little girl?<eos> That bastard Elliot, I'll beat the crap out of him.<eos> Cheating on my angel with two women!<eos> What were they...
At last, her efforts are rewarded.<eos> But the babies can't stay here.<eos> They must leave their sanctuary and find food in the tangled world above.<eos> They're over 60 centimetres long, already big enough to be a threat to the smaller inhabitants of the forest.<eos> But they are themselves vulnerable.
We're going to try a tracking shot on this ant nest.<eos> Moving forward towards it, as the ants pour out of the hole in their millions.<eos> Not only are these insects super-fast, they also keep antisocial hours.<eos> The thing is, we need to be out here in the middle of the day to film these ants.<eos> They don't do what they do when it's nice and cool at seven, eight o'clock in the morning.
Will you question Pernille about the figures?<eos> I've worked there myself.<eos> I've spoken with masses of girls.<eos> You're only talking about street prostitutes.<eos> They make up 20% of the total number of prostitutes in Denmark
Patrick was a patient, wasn't he?<eos> They said Violet killed him accidentally.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Well, I'll tell you something, Oriel.<eos> These paintings, boy, they, uh...
And you are super observant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Now here's what you're going to do.<eos> - You're going to keep a dream journal. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Because once you gain control of these fantasies, - Yeah. - They will no longer control you.
Not so tough now, are you, roachie?<eos> You're just a... hollow... shell. What the...<eos> - He must have molted.<eos> - They molt?<eos> Yeah, roaches shed their skins when... they get... bigger.
Those claws, so vital for a lion's survival, are made of a protein called keratin.<eos> Her eyes, also absolutely vital for her survival, have a protein called opsin which is bound to a pigment to make structures called rhodopsins which allow her to see in colour and also to allow her to see very well at night when she's hunting.<eos> There are also proteins in her muscles... ..myosin and actin, which are the things that allow her to run away.<eos> The proteins in a lion come in countless different forms.<eos> But they all share something in common.
There's a giraffe there as well.<eos> Giraffes live off a diet similar to termites.<eos> They eat cellulose.<eos> Primarily the tops of the acacia trees that you see scattering the African savanna.<eos> And they face that same problem, they've got to break those difficult carbon bonds down and they've come up with a very similar solution which is to cultivate bacteria and fungi.
They eat cellulose.<eos> Primarily the tops of the acacia trees that you see scattering the African savanna.<eos> And they face that same problem, they've got to break those difficult carbon bonds down and they've come up with a very similar solution which is to cultivate bacteria and fungi.<eos> But they do it inside their stomachs and ruminants like giraffes have had to build a very complex system in order to do that.<eos> They've got four stomachs, one of them contains their culture of bacteria and fungi, and they allow them to digest that difficult cellulose.
I always thought it was my tits.<eos> Yes, well they... clearly had a role.<eos> And they are still magnificent, by the way. May I say that?<eos> No, you may not!<eos> They're not yours to talk about any more.
He was a great man. Honourable.<eos> He killed his own horse to prove that he would not ride-off, leave his men to die. What?<eos> He fought and fell beside them.<eos> His forces must be depleted too?<eos> They have the taste of victory in their mouths, dear.
I would go down, with my allowance money, to the crafts store, and buy myself a thousand little tiny, you know, like rainbows and... Glass tchotchkes.<eos> Viv would look at my trove of tchotchkes and hate it.<eos> She would get a big mop bucket and she would fill it with hot, soapy water, yes, and ammonia. And she would have the ammonia be such a strength that you couldn't be near the bucket.<eos> Clearly, to need that much ammonia, you would surely be cleaning something very, very dirty.<eos> She would take her arm, and just swipe all the tchotchkes into the bucket. They're crashing and grinding together, and smashing, and they're all covered in ammonia...
It's the middle of the night.<eos> - We got a family emergency.<eos> I gotta get my girls back to Nashville.<eos> - Are they okay?<eos> - They... they're fine.
Oh, no.<eos> You want me to kill witches?<eos> We've been over this.<eos> It's temporary.<eos> They'll come back.
Do you ever go home?<eos> - (turns off music) - What's up?<eos> I see you've got a deskful, but we are short on nurses.<eos> There's never a good time to bring this up.<eos> They make the place run more efficiently and we need more of them.
- That's easy for you to say.<eos> You try being gay and raising a child in this town in the '70s.<eos> You know, now that you mention it...<eos> My lesbian mothers raised me in this town in the '70s.<eos> Sure, one of them had to dress up like a man to take me on the father-son canoe trip, but they toughed it out.
That all changed when he had Mary Hammond alone.<eos> He found something else that worked for him.<eos> Guy's wife left him because he was a cutter.<eos> So he took these women not because of sex, but because of something better.<eos> They validate his obsessive-compulsive disorder. Turn it into a shared bonding experience.
It's true.<eos> I love my mom.<eos> And why wouldn't I?<eos> Moms treat us best.<eos> They say we're tall and handsome, they touch our socks when no one else will.
Get yourself out there.<eos> Easy does it.<eos> Hey, come on, man!<eos> I got to get to work!<eos> And so do they, sir.
Sir Walter?<eos> I'm afraid not, but we are close.<eos> Here, madam - it is a list of all the women from the match factory who refused settlement for their grievances.<eos> The match-girls? Mmm.<eos> You believe they are responsible for the man's abduction?
They killed Miss Raine.<eos> If I placed you in harm's way, madam, I am sorry for it.<eos> What will happen to her girls?<eos> I shall do all I can to speak for these women.<eos> They will not see the rope.
No, I... Of course.<eos> I fear they will be disappointed.<eos> Men, I find. And women?<eos> Yes.<eos> They too.
Your blood pressure is 100/65.<eos> That's very low.<eos> Yes, but a little hypotension is nothing to fret about.<eos> It's your hormones.<eos> They cause your blood vessels to widen, increase the blood flow to the baby.
Is there something you want to tell me?<eos> No, no not at all.<eos> I'm just concerned about the clinic.<eos> What about the meds?<eos> What are they going to do?
And those messages she got, they weren't threats.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what were they?<eos> From my girls.<eos> They were happy.
We integrate the universe, and try to give at least one step.<eos> Mommy, what are those stars?<eos> - They are light, sonny.<eos> - Like a lamp or what?<eos> - They also glow.
He does chores on weekdays.<eos> It gives me a break.<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> Yep, it's Saturday.<eos> I've tried telling the sheep, but they don't get it.
What got into you?<eos> What did the girls have to say?<eos> The girls?<eos> if they had anything to say, they shoulzfve spoken up sooner.<eos> They don't know yet.
Not only do we believe him, so does the U.S. Attorney.<eos> So, Chad's getting immunity.<eos> It's over.<eos> I was looking out for those girls.<eos> Now they'll get nothing.
Do you really think that they're all ticking because of Patti?<eos> Maybe the first four were legitimately traumatized by the murder.<eos> Then, suddenly, they're flying consultants in from Chicago and... and CNN shows up.<eos> It's the most exciting thing to happen in town for years.<eos> The other girls unconsciously want attention, they get a...
I've really really thought about this.<eos> His breath smells like if all the farts from all the different, like, cultures and nations in the world combine together... and then passed through my grandpa's teeth.<eos> And he was constipated and it's so heartbreaking.<eos> You know, when a dog gets constipated and they... you can tell because their little knees like quiver.<eos> They quiver.
- What do you want?<eos> I'm gonna say this once:<eos> Stop asking questions and stay the hell away from Sarah.<eos> Do you think our moms are telling the Riveras<eos> - they bought Lexi the pill?
- To whom?<eos> - To women. I brought you here because of your impeccable credentials and the hunch obstetrics might be opening up for female physicians.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Because when we do refer you, women make it very clear they don't want another woman looking up their skirt, except for the odd gal who thinks that's just swell, and those 16 women are your patients.<eos> And they receive the best care this hospital has to offer.
- ...vasocongestion.<eos> The erect nipples perspiration, hyperventilation.<eos> Physiological reactions are uniform and consistent.<eos> Which brings us to the heart of the study and the most radical discovery of all-- when it comes to sex, women have capabilities vastly superior to men.<eos> They can achieve multiple orgasms, they're orgasmic after menopause, and the sexual satisfaction they can achieve on their own is equal to, and sometimes even greater, than the satisfaction they achieve with men.
I also found this, the emblem of the town orphanage, the same one you were in.<eos> Damn, Master, there... children died daily, from starvation, leprosy, cholera.<eos> But not locked in a hole.<eos> Please, master, I've tried to forget that my whole life, don't make me go through this again.<eos> We're going to talk to the nuns, perhaps they remember something.
- We'll be taking off as soon as the other girls get here.<eos> - What other girls?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> - Who are they?
- Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - I bet you are.<eos> Were you coming in here to celebrate what a fool I am?<eos> You upset the girls.<eos> They have nothing to do with this.
Setting the record this year is a phenomenal thing.<eos> People say, "What's it like to be the fastest in the world?"<eos> I said, "Well, that and $3.95 gets you a cup of coffee at Starbucks."<eos> On the way home after that first year, after they saw it, I said, "Well, what do you think, girls, is that something you'd want to try?"<eos> And before I had it out of my mouth, they were like, "Yeah, we want to do it."
[Swing] Being a wife, and a worker, and a mother, when I get on my bike, the wind just kind of takes it.<eos> I mean, you see two bikes in a row, one's a guy, one's a woman.<eos> [Thompson] Women and racing has come a long ways.<eos> [Judy Code] There's more women riding now and a larger percent of them are going racing.<eos> And they would get on these bikes that would scare some normal men.
The motorcycle community is the most open, inviting community that I've ever known.<eos> [Rick Baer] They're always raising money for charities, and almost every time they get together, they're doing something for somebody else.<eos> [Dave Barr] There's millions of motorcycles come together for different toy runs, for burn camp runs, cancer runs, you name it.<eos> It's a spirit thing, and to be charitable, uh, it comes from within, it comes from the soul, it comes from the spirit, and I think that's a common thread is that a lot of us ride motorcycles.<eos> Once we started getting records, we got opportunities to go speak to women, and I got a chance to speak at a troubled girls' home in Mitchell called the Abbott House. It's a residential treatment facility for girls ages 7-17, and I spoke to these girls and got hooked on 'em, and I thought, what if we take a damaged motorcycle, literally parallel to what's happening in their lives, into the classroom, and help them face and repair the damage, transform it into something incredible, which is what they're doing with their lives.
But that's basically how it works, and an example here of the kind of tiny screw...<eos> This is from a small watch balance, and if I just place it there, you can see on the scale of one penny, just how tiny it is.<eos> 'This tiny screw and its ingenious manufacturing process 'are just one example of the amazing techniques 'developed by the clock trade.'<eos> There is a tendency for people to forget that every single one of these things has to be made by someone.<eos> They don't grow organically.
Come on in.<eos> - You look skinny. - Jane:<eos> You guys look adorable. Oh, this schmuck again.<eos> Sir, I told you, you can't come in without a reservation.<eos> Uh, no, I don't have a reservation, but I'm actually with these ladies and they do have a reservation.
Marat has had Shreddies, but there is Crunchy... We weren't watching it like that, that's not what it is, we were...<eos> It was for research.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> What did I tell you about watching mucky ladies?<eos> They're not happy.
How... Do I tell these children...<eos> That they'll never see their father again?<eos> They were inconsolable.<eos> How can I get them through this?<eos> They don't have a father.
Plants predate the human race.<eos> They may well outlast it, so is it likely that their very alien form of thought and behavior could be found on other worlds?<eos> The history of evolution on different planets may unfold in very different ways.<eos> I think we would be very likely to find something that was very similar ecologically to what plants do.<eos> I think they're able to take energy from starlight, basically, and convert that into biochemical energy that they can then use.
For you, the real escape is living.<eos> Welcome back. [ Piano play. ♪ I like my bitches tight ♪<eos> I got to take a piss.<eos> Hey, take one of these whores with you, Jenkins.<eos> They'll aim it for ya.
We couldn't completely enjoy it because we were literally (Bleep) ourselves about the fact that there's a tiger out there.<eos> We're in quite a bit of danger.<eos> And then I'm just thinking, oh, are we attracting them more by the smell of meat?<eos> It's a possibility that they... they were... that the girls are trying to scare us, but by the look in their eye, it was like...<eos> I could tell that it was of... they believed what they saw, you know, and... they maybe put the tiger out when the girls coming, and then as soon as they ran off, the tiger goes back into its cage, you know?
I'm taking you to her.<eos> Go alone.<eos> As if their lives depended on it.<eos> Hanna!<eos> Now they're in deeper than they ever imagined.
If ever again.<eos> Did you tell your Control about our conversation?<eos> About your father's work for us?<eos> And end my career before it's even started?<eos> His possessions, have they been disposed of yet?
That's why the witches are so freaked out.<eos> The reaping is just around the corner, and if they don't finish it before then, it's over.<eos> All I have to do is wait it out.<eos> And then what?<eos> They're punished, and I'm free.
You never could have banned the witches from using magic without her.<eos> She's not exactly besties with them.<eos> I'm protecting her.<eos> A lot of them would like to get their hands on her and kill her to finish the harvest.<eos> If they don't, the other girls stay dead, and they lose their power.
I wouldn't say problems, but hiccups, adjustments to living together.<eos> Nothing major, just...<eos> Women can be very touchy about stuff.<eos> She bought a plant and a blanket kind of thing. That's exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> They see something, they want it, they have to have it, even if it's utterly ridiculous, even if it's nonsensical and ugly as sin.
What if someone said,<eos> "Maybe there's a savant who is so smart, that he could figure that out."<eos> well, he's not smart.<eos> I mean, he'd have to have a very strange retina.<eos> Our retinas are made the way they're made.
Wonder what?<eos> What they're like...<eos> - You...<eos> - I do not have your experience.<eos> I do not have experience... it is they who have the experience.
- You...<eos> - I do not have your experience.<eos> I do not have experience... it is they who have the experience.<eos> I do not think about them.<eos> They think through me.
A system they lived by in Rome at the time.<eos> The Cardinal... was the only one who had any power and the man had to ask his permission... to marry the girl.<eos> You would have lived in total darkness there.<eos> I accompanied my friend and was taken a back by the way they lived because my friend, who was in love... he couldn't see the girl.<eos> I had to draw up a document which all the girls who were shut away in there signed so they could at least open the windows.
I think you're getting worked up over nothing.<eos> It's excessive, what you do.<eos> Wouldn't you take advantage if you could?<eos> Before, you understood women much more.<eos> They are the wicked ones.
Honestly, I wasn't looking for a relationship.<eos> It snuck up on me.<eos> I met Sergio.<eos> We tease each other a lot.<eos> They pick on me, and I pick on them.
Things are not going back to the way they were!<eos> That's over.<eos> The girls know who they are.<eos> Their powers are only going to get stronger.<eos> We need to be able to teach them how to control their gifts, so they don't hurt someone or themselves.
I have no intention of ordering calamari.<eos> Hello, Ariel.<eos> Long time.<eos> It's true mermaids can travel across realms.<eos> But they can't be trusted.
He wouldn't be the first.<eos> Do you think he had a private arrangement with Lavinia?<eos> My girls understand the exclusive nature of the club is their protection.<eos> So you don't know?<eos> They know better than to talk.
- and made fart noises.<eos> He... - Shh!<eos> Tom, he's right in the next room.<eos> You're gonna hurt his feelings. And also, he's 11.<eos> Your girls are 15 and 17, and they should know better.
They're used to guys doing the bare minimum.<eos> I go above and beyond.<eos> Try it sometime.<eos> You're hunting them.<eos> I want their info, they're giving it to me straight up.
But don't tell me if it's true or not.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> I mean, we all understand the way the world works.<eos> You have something these women want, they have something you want.
Girls are--you gotta walk around on eggshells with 'em.<eos> I don't know, one day you're the king of the castle-- you know, they're just in love with you.<eos> You're their daddy.<eos> And then the next thing you know, they don't know who you are.<eos> It's like they're-- they hate you.
Answer the question, detective.<eos> Um, yes, he fit the pattern.<eos> Initially, didn't two prior victims identify Mehcad Carter as their attacker?<eos> From a photo I.D. They later recanted.<eos> But they did I.D. Him., which means SVU also believed he was the rapist.
I am all about fun right now, but I am done with the insanity.<eos> No more crazy girls. Never again.<eos> I get it. You know what the problem is is that there's no real good way of ending it with girls like that.<eos> I've changed jobs and moved.<eos> Faked my own death and they're there.
Actually, those are yogirls.<eos> What?<eos> ! Yep, they did a lot of growing today.<eos> When they got here they couldn't even sit up, and now I taught them to-- girls, do it!<eos> They can do...
Chair ain't running off nowhere.<eos> How'd you get started, Mr. Bader?<eos> In politics?<eos> Well, I had the construction firm.<eos> Get to know people, they get to know you.
And you don't want grandchildren with webbed feet.<eos> I understand.<eos> You know, I worry about our daughters a... and the men they choose.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> They... they can't all win the lottery like you did.
- Del Deville?<eos> ! ? !<eos> - I love Del Deville! Section eight?<eos> ! These tickets are amazing!<eos> Aren't they just to die for?
Come play with me? Happily.<eos> Sometimes you just need to kick something.<eos> You're not like a girl.<eos> What did you think girls were like?<eos> They sit around, afraid they're gonna mess up their dresses.
a good student, but I realize that what I'm really good at is impressions, so, I started to do this impression of a good high school student, and it... it's kind of working.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me why you want to go to Hunter.<eos> Um, I-I don't know that much about it, except that there... well, there's more women than guys, and that's... that's great for me, because I'm totally into feminist issues.<eos> Like, just because women don't make as much as guys do to do the same job, it's totally not cool that they aren't given the same amount of respect.
- Chan Young isn't answering my phone call.<eos> - You are.<eos> Can't you just imagine how sexy the American girls are?<eos> They are not chopsticks like you.<eos> They have curves.
Also, the contents of the sun's protoplanetaly disc were finally used up, having formed the other planets and moons.<eos> Accordingly, the astral bombardment decreased, so the surface could cool off.<eos> This led to the formation of a solid crust of stone.<eos> Still, there were frequent volcanic eruptions.<eos> They spat out lava and gases, and the Earth went through many changes.
- What should we do?<eos> Let me see what the snakes say.<eos> Oh, he like to bite.<eos> Gotta put him back.<eos> They say... we got to do a exorcism.
Never mind fascinating, the Korean audience finds the game shout-out-loud shit-ifying.<eos> Shortly afterwards, the year 2000 arrived in a flurry of optimistic fireworks and humankind wondered what majesty the new century would behold.<eos> It turned out the answer was a voyeuristic reality show in which egotists entertained the nation by sharing a bog for six weeks.<eos> They weren't the only housemates entrancing millions.<eos> The Sims in some sense is a life simulator where you create little people, personalities, they then live their lives in the game.
- All right, Duckie...<eos> - Don't call me Duckie!<eos> Okay.<eos> It means "ugly duckling"<eos> because I grew up with braces and pimples, and they still see me that way.
"The Four Who Speak As One."<eos> The librarian must have visited them at different carnivals:<eos> Philadelphia, New Orleans, Chicago.<eos> These are the women who banished Katrina to purgatory.<eos> If the golem has been made real and seeks revenge against those who hurt the boy... then surely they'll be next.

And why did the Lord refuse to acknowledge you?<eos> That's because he was a lord and my mother was just a beautiful woman without family and connections.<eos> What a scary woman you are.<eos> When you found out that your father was going to give his entire fortune to his mistresses, you immediately called on your stepsisters and placed them right into his bed.<eos> They jumped there themselves when they found out about the money.
You know, I don't think any of these are right.<eos> Well, Carol, it's not all about the dress.<eos> It's like the other afternoon, Sharon was telling Sarah...<eos> Please don't refer to the women on The Talk by their first names.<eos> You don't know them, and they don't know you.
Aigoo!<eos> Whether it's Goryeo Ilbo or Guryeo (stinky) Ilbo...<eos> Stinky dung-smelling newspapers are sure different!<eos> Ah, you're right. Why would dung flies show up?<eos> They show up because they smell stinky poop.
Against...?<eos> This.<eos> Not rats?<eos> !<eos> They chew through everything.
"South Korea must follow in suit."<eos> "The goal for now is to overthrow the current fascist regime," "but we must liberate the peninsula through a socialist revolution."<eos> We present these statements as evidence before the court.<eos> Defendant! Did you personally write these statements?<eos> They are the result of torture...
# Good night, my angel, now it's time to dream<eos> # And dream how wonderful our life has been<eos> # Some day we all must go<eos> # But lullabies go on and on<eos> # They never die
And I walked all over the city, and I mingled with the whores.<eos> I told them I was from New York, and they thought that was wonderful.<eos> I thought it was more wonderful to be from Argentina.<eos> Being from that light, from that music, from those smells, and the whores with braids in their hair.<eos> They... fed me, and they told me stories.
Right aways, Miss Tina.<eos> - They hate each other. - Yep.<eos> - I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.<eos> - Well, bitches are crazy.<eos> Even when they like each other, they hate each other.
- They hate each other. - Yep.<eos> - I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.<eos> - Well, bitches are crazy.<eos> Even when they like each other, they hate each other.<eos> - Maybe they really like each other.
Face it, Steve, you're about to settle into the big sleep...<eos> Steve !<eos> Listen to me, all right?<eos> Men, we're all wired to be alpha dogs. Even pussy ones like you who want to be Bill fuckin' Cosby, all right?<eos> And women, they dig alpha dogs.
If you like to get a wee bit crazy, why don't you come down and see the show?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - As a fucking heart attack.<eos> We have a lot of friends here.<eos> Can they come too?
mm. for now.<eos> (woman laughs) hey, you have room for one more?<eos> how long are the amateurs in town?<eos> till sunday.<eos> but, babe... they don't hold a candle to my silver girl.
I drove her daddy's car into Indian Creek last new year's.<eos> Wow. How many magic Cuba Libres did that take?<eos> I gotta run.<eos> You don't have to impress these people.<eos> You're better than they are.
Walk through these gates for justice and freedom.<eos> You men... ..I know your minds.<eos> I know what desperation, what needs, what false promises brought you here!<eos> But I say to you - lay down your tools.<eos> They are the instruments of Judas.
I'll leave now.<eos> I don't have a holy name, there for they'll keep me alone.<eos> If not?<eos> Shoot me a way. I'm sick of these bastards, man!<eos> They just want the mood for their ritual.
I know...<eos> I know that I've asked you for stuff before.<eos> And I know that I don't-- I don't deserve anything.<eos> But please... I need your help.<eos> [SOBBING] They're all I've got left.
It's weak.<eos> It sets a bad precedent for the others.<eos> Hey, why don't we each tend to our own gardens, okay?<eos> Have you seen my roses across the street, George?<eos> They're winners, each one perfect, and why?
Top priority.<eos> Starting now.<eos> Welcome to Special Assignments.<eos> Three girls have gone missing from the same bus stop in the last three weeks.<eos> They were last heard from between 8 and 10pm.
Because I got Vera to sub in ?<eos> We'll forward your last pay cheque to the address on file.<eos> It's not because I'm getting married tomorrow.<eos> Plenty of married women work here !<eos> Not once they're in the family way.
I'd go door to door, town to town, selling my wares, getting to know the kids, getting to know their mums.<eos> - I'd be a bit hopeless. - CHUCKLES<eos> I'd be a bit cheeky.<eos> And then I'd say, "Oh, no! My digs have fallen through!"<eos> And they'd say, "Oh, well, you can stay here then... if you like. "
I don't know, she's...<eos> She's driven.<eos> She's very, very stubborn.<eos> She doesn't like to lose.<eos> But she sees the best in people, even when they don't see it in themselves.
But you know how he died.<eos> I didn't- I didn't hurt that man.<eos> We know that.<eos> Those-<eos> Voices, they- they did it.
Believe me.<eos> And her father's a lawyer.<eos> Same speed, same speed.<eos> Come here, Valentine! Dude, sisters are crazy.<eos> I mean, they're the little good daughters.
Okay mom, fuck!<eos> Not in front of my friends!<eos> Cartman, it was actually really lame.<eos> I know, right!<eos> Women are just jealous 'cause they have to face outwards to pee and crap.
I have secured many for him over the years.<eos> Perhaps it is time to place myself higher in concern...<eos> It would be well deserved.<eos> Why do you chase after simple little girls, barely formed of breast?<eos> They are unencumbered.
Blackflies get what they need by stabbing their needle-like mouth parts into the veins of leaves and stems and extracting the sap.<eos> They don't even need to suck.<eos> The pressure inside the plant is enough to squirt the sap into their stomachs.<eos> Mealybugs are also sap drinkers.<eos> They produce a waxy powder from their skin, which most predators dislike, so that they are able to drink unmolested out in the open.
Plus she has a good support system.<eos> Her friends? Payson and Lauren?<eos> How supportive you think her friends will be if it comes down to them or Kaylie Cruz for a spot on the Olympic Team?<eos> These Rock girls are special.<eos> They truly believe that, together, there is nothing they cannot achieve.
- What happened to the Mazda?<eos> I still have it.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The girls asked us to drive first. They didn't seem to know the way.
I prefer to text my "fuck you" letters.<eos> - Mm. How old are you?<eos> - 17.<eos> Rehab number four.<eos> I love my drugs, and they love me.
I got a connection who gets 'em directly from Shanghai. And not just firecrackers and bottle rockets.<eos> We're talkin' those big mothers you want to light with a six-foot punk and another guy's arm.<eos> Do the women-folk know they're gonna be toodling around in a vehicle filled with discount Asian explosives?<eos> Hey, those broads are getting a free weekend of jacuzzi tubs and pai gow poker.<eos> They can put up with a little white-knucklin' on the ride home.
Well, he's not the first, mom.<eos> I had a whole relationship with Brad.<eos> Or even the second one.<eos> I mean, if you like this guy, great.<eos> I just don't want you to be one of those girls who's so obsessed with having a boyfriend that they forget about what they want.
I think I'm missing something here.<eos> The girls still get to audition, right?<eos> Ojai's not that far.<eos> Of course they can audition.<eos> I won't be there, but they can be.
Is it possible that the energy effect of Golod's pyramid is a phenomenon that scientists are only now just beginning to understand?<eos> Or could ancient civilizations around the world have been aware of this pyramid power thousands, if not tens of thousands of years ago?<eos> The placement of the pyramids are very interesting, because they seem to be placed where the energy is.<eos> And I think the ancients understood this very carefully, but they were also mapping the planet at the same time.<eos> So they were like multipurpose structures, and they were left there for future generations to work with, and they encode very high knowledge within the mathematics and the geometry, and we're just starting to understand the nature of it now.
"The cost of cardigans and blue rinses to go through the roof.<eos> "What use is your wedding ring if you can't turn the heating on?"<eos> Maybe do a special offer for widows!<eos> I like what you did there, Baz.<eos> And then let's start with the housewives, make 'em feel guilty about their kids not having the latest video games while they're still dripping in gold.
You can't stop us being together, you know.<eos> I'm going to c...<eos> Fuck. Ohh! They're evil bitch nuns, is what they are.<eos> Eh? They're holding Nadine hostage because they're jealous of our love.<eos> It's like, if they can't have Rudy, no-one can. Eh?
Can believe the mouth on that man?<eos> Oh, that miserable bastard! I could kill him!<eos> All this is because of that miserable prick!<eos> Thorn.<eos> Whatever. Ever since he spends time with the women, they're talking about their feelings, asking questions about my feelings.
You don't like it?<eos> It's just that some of the church ladies, they...<eos> There's no pleasing those women.<eos> One minute, they're like "you ever met beyonce?"<eos> I say "yeah," they say, "think she's something 'cause she met beyonce."
Come on, lyric.<eos> I gotta go put on pantyhose.<eos> Lord knows I hate pantyhose.<eos> But those church ladies...<eos> They want pantyhose.
These two rows in the middle here, the colors are different.<eos> The wing pattern differences are probably driven by which colors and patterns stand out most clearly to the local bird population.<eos> But these different-looking varieties -- you could call them races.<eos> Appear to have identical inner biologies.<eos> They smell the same, they recognize each other as being potential mates.
Look, I feel terrible about what happened back then.<eos> It's something that I have to live with for the rest of my life, and... I deserve that.<eos> But the only way that I have been able to survive is to move on with my life.<eos> What about the families of the victims?<eos> Don't you think they deserve some closure?
Hard feelings run deep.<eos> Old beliefs, too.<eos> - You're putting us...<eos> - Do I meet your girls?<eos> They're Arabs.
There's still a slew to go.<eos> Comin' through.<eos> Only 53 to go before we build Victory munitions millionth bomb.<eos> We'll never make it before shift end.<eos> Those red shift tarts are always looking down their noses at us, if they get the glory instead of us we'll never hear the end of it.
And the computer's missing.<eos> The girls reckoned Dan sold the computer to buy drugs.<eos> Both looked off their heads, though.<eos> Is this the good news? No.<eos> They found this by his side.
I found the batteries with the "thank you" cards.<eos> Um, what?<eos> This whole place is like a yard sale.<eos> That's what women do.<eos> They hide your stuff.
Is it here?<eos> Karin?<eos> Get in.<eos> Was it that terrible to come to Norway?<eos> They want in. But when they get here, they want to have it their own way.
You're not getting any younger.<eos> I'II get the most expensive facial treatment when my album comes out.<eos> Ha ha, very funny.<eos> Your script for part 3 and 4.<eos> Who are they?
I'm a lousy kisser?<eos> You would make a similar face if you had to kiss a foolish girl.<eos> And as far as my kissing capabilities are concerned...<eos> You can ask 24 girlfriends of mine.<eos> They will vouch for it.
She is very happy.<eos> Yes. she is very happy.<eos> So should I talk to her about marriage?<eos> I've heard these girls are fast in such matters.<eos> They are like that here.
But I don't understand that I...<eos> Who I will tease now.<eos> I hope too much distance doesn't separate us forever.<eos> I hope too much distance doesn't separate us forever.<eos> I try to stop my tears but they don't seem to stop.

You can look for them indirectly.<eos> I have all sorts of ways to look for supersymmetry.<eos> But up to this point, it's done an excellent job of hiding from us, so either we're about to find it or I think a lot of us are gonna say it's just not there.<eos> The LHC has so far seen no sign of supersymmetric particles.<eos> If they do not exist, scientists will be left with a baffling predicament -- explaining why the energy of empty space is not tearing our Universe to shreds.
Gabriele believes that there was something before the Big Bang.<eos> But, like a city at daybreak, most of this pre-Universe was fast asleep.<eos> There were things propagating in space, like waves, particles, but the energy was very diluted, and furthermore, this wave or this particle interacted very, very weakly.<eos> That would be like having very few people walking in the street and, furthermore, not interacting with each other.<eos> They may not talk to each other.
But cloning a person is not the same as duplicating a person.<eos> A lot of people, you know, who have their pets -- they want to often clone them, and they want Fluffy back.<eos> And what I tell them is, "you're not gonna get Fluffy back."<eos> As a matter of fact, we actually clone entire herds of cows from a single cell from the same animal, and they develop a whole hierarchy, just like we do in humans.<eos> So you have timid cows and aggressive cows, and they're all clones.
People may think that they've just now become aware or they've just now decided, but in reality, most likely, their brain was processing that information well before.<eos> Our subconscious mind is always two steps ahead of us, signaling what to do before we are even aware of it.<eos> Could other people's brains pick up these signals, too?<eos> Body language -- it's the native tongue of the subconscious.<eos> The way we move, the tone of our voice -- we are constantly giving off these subtle signals, and they can have a profound effect on those around us.
She just heard me coming, I think.<eos> Bowheads are remarkably alert to danger.<eos> One small splash and this one simply melted away.<eos> The only hope is for a whale that is a little less skittish.<eos> Gosh, these whales... Gee, they're hard to get close to.
So how long is it going to be before you can scale this already pretty impressive set-up to a billion litres?<eos> So, we're already manufacturing on three continents, we're in South America, North America and Europe, and have two more major facilities under construction.<eos> Er, you know.<eos> We're ramping this just absolutely fast as we can.<eos> There are strict rules preventing synthetic cells from leaving the lab, but the things they make, like the fuel, can.
It just seems like we have a bunch of stuff That we don't need... big-screen TVs, two cars, a really big house.<eos> Well, you want us to move?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Maybe to someplace with a good public school.<eos> Uh, not you're yanking the kids out of private school, which they love, that's your solution?
Well, good, you know, 'cause it really wouldn't be fair, Me being an award-winning performer. With five gold records.<eos> To compete against amateurs, Would it?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> And like I said, we got the pinkney sisters singing,<eos> And they are...
Okay, let me get this straight.<eos> You looked a grown woman dead in the face and said--and I quote-- "He has a huge--"<eos> I know what I said!<eos> It's all your fault.<eos> You're the one who said that he would never get anywhere with women unless they knew what he had.
The tortured guy, Per Jomsvik, belonged to Legion Gothia.<eos> Zabangida has many followers in this area.<eos> We arrested three.<eos> Jim and Ike Zabangida's girls were beaten.<eos> But they've said nothing.
Nonsense.<eos> But on the other hand ...<eos> No!<eos> You were right, Kai.<eos> They do bring warmth to the world.
It's friends and family.<eos> They're coming for free cake and booze, not to sit through Ken Burns presents Molly Flynn.<eos> Those hens are always clucking about something, aren't they?<eos> I don't think they'd appreciate being referred to as "hens."<eos> But, yes, they are always clucking about something.

And the toughest thing is to do something that is, in fact, very labor intensive but make it look effortless.<eos> But what did not work for me, quite honestly, is the way these girls are styled.<eos> Really?<eos> Ithinktheyare not modern.<eos> I think they are a little wedding party in the styling.
But I honestly think there's a much simpler explanation for why the flood myth is so universal.<eos> I think it's a memory of what happened at the end of the Ice Age.<eos> What's much more mysterious is that coupled with these memories of global devastation, there are also memories of almost godlike beings with incredible powers and abilities who were caught up in that cataclysm.<eos> The deluge stories are really very interesting.<eos> What they all say is that the angels, the gods, whatever we want to call them today...
Come on, Sophia.<eos> The hook was yours all along.<eos> You'd used it to kill four women.<eos> I had no reason to hurt those women.<eos> They... they were all mothers of girls who went to my school.
No.<eos> April?<eos> No.<eos> Why did you say, "which one?"<eos> You know, my sisters-- they're-- they're varying degrees of crazy, but Jim-
Um, well the Carlton athletic director called me.<eos> It seems that the Marshall girls celebrated their momentous victory in the locker room with champagne.<eos> They've been disqualified!<eos> Wait, what?<eos> They're out, we're in.
Very accommodating.<eos> I can imagine what you're thinking, but I assure you I'm only the messenger.<eos> The bishop himself has determined that this... experiment has run its course and would prefer that the hospital's resources be applied to other areas, effective immediately.<eos> What about the women who've been coming?<eos> They will have to seek their information elsewhere.
Only when the whole job with one type of flower is finished a bee will change to another type.<eos> But here they do not have a choice.<eos> There is nothing but almonds.<eos> Inside the bee hive the bees transfer the collected nectar to their sisters.<eos> They keep on chewing until it turns into honey, then they store the honey in honeycombs.
That means an awful lot to me.<eos> Looking good!<eos> Lots of drones.<eos> The honey bees are not native in Australia.<eos> They arrived with the first settlers.
Thus we have to look for a compromise between killer bees and domesticated honey bees.<eos> We seem to be afraid of foreigners coming into the country, even though we are all immigrants here.<eos> The African bees came, they didn't have papers they didn't have permission, nor visa nor passports.<eos> There was nothing we could do to stop theses wild creatures.<eos> They have not been domesticated, they are as they have always been.
There's something called the solar wind.<eos> It's actually a huge wave of charged particles originating from the Sun.<eos> This fills our solar system, and as a comet begins to move further and further in towards the Sun, the solar wind gets stronger.<eos> Like a cosmic hurricane, the solar wind blasts gas molecules from our comet out into space.<eos> They form a second giant tail.
- and they freak me out, and you know that.<eos> - I like it. Nick!<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I hooked up with both those girls last week.<eos> I didn't know they knew each other.
Which one?<eos> The one who recently passed, God rest her soul.<eos> Aren't they all dead?<eos> I do not have best luck with women.<eos> Think how they feel.
Tarzan and colton the first Couple for the men.<eos> Got to get over the Teeter-totter and solve that Puzzle.<eos> go,go!<eos> The women are first To the puzzle.<eos> They're putting logs together And they will line up.
I swear.<eos> Come on.<eos> Like, I hate this about women.<eos> Like, God knows I love women, but I hate this about them.<eos> It's like they just never let anything go.
Thank you.<eos> - You're so welcome.<eos> - Thank you, thank you.<eos> Seeing the nurses that were there was important.<eos> The nurses said that they were just doing their job, but it was an incredible job.
These turtles get a free pass!<eos> Are you guys kidding or what?<eos> That's some good eating down there!<eos> Look closer, bird brain.<eos> They're the ones that got me off that boat.
The red volcanic soil of the Mexican state of jalisco is the ideal medium for agave plants.<eos> That's what she said!<eos> It seems like we're losing them.<eos> "Seems like"?<eos> No, they're just getting settled in.
If she, Pepsi aunty, Sharma's, Bhalla's, Chopra's... if they come to know that I do such...<eos> meaning such kind of work then I'll lose all my respect... you'll get me thrown out of the colony.<eos> See what I am trying to say is that I am a certified MBBS doctor and this work is legal.<eos> Not from today but since the times of the Mahabharata.<eos> I can stand at India Gate and announce that its an ancient science... when women couldn't have children, they used to call Rishis...
And our killing duo found out about it.<eos> That would explain the change in M.O.<eos> Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration and gave up his boys.<eos> Maybe our ladies are improvising, which explains killing Paul outside his job.<eos> We need to get to Jason's house before they do.
It'd take too much time to explain.<eos> Man, I miss those Time Angels.<eos> - Those girls were nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If they had weekly adventures I could watch or DVR, I would do it in a heartbeat.
Not really.<eos> I wasn't asking.<eos> All right.<eos> Um...<eos> Well, fellas, um, your two grandmas are, uh... are both very lonely, and so, they've, uh, decided to become... uh, roommates, uh, and keep each other company.
Well, no, I'm not. And that's always a nice compliment.<eos> I love hearing that people think I'm a lot younger than I am, and I am headed into my 40s.<eos> And certainly I think that this lifestyle has helped me not only live with a chronic disease, but also feel young, feel young in my skin and depending on the light, it looks pretty good too.<eos> The truth is that we were programmed as a species to be attracted to the people who look good. Why?<eos> Because they are the healthiest ones.
And they just turned on you.<eos> Girls will do that, you know, girls can be really mean.<eos> And unforgiving.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Did you do something they won't forgive you for?
I never made it to the back wall.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Mom, Mom, come here!<eos> I was in my kitchen, and the children were just playing.<eos> They were.. They were full of dirt.
So I would take a pay cut just for the good of the group.<eos> I really would.<eos> I don't consider myself to be a political person, but when there's a cause that I find meaningful...<eos> Excuse me, where did your kids go?<eos> They were...
Listen closely.<eos> Inside this jar, I have 1,000 cursed Egyptian super termites.<eos> Hand over the deed to your property<eos> Or I'll smash this jar with a bat<eos> And they'll devour the shack with you inside.

And I discovered subsonic frequencies hidden in the recording.<eos> They're not made by instruments.<eos> They're made by whales.<eos> There's a repeating message I keep hearing.<eos> I believe they are trying to communicate with the band.
It knows things.<eos> The plants pick you.<eos> But you have to be ready.<eos> It is a battle.<eos> You control them or they control you, and I saw it today.
But you have to be ready.<eos> It is a battle.<eos> You control them or they control you, and I saw it today.<eos> You don't understand the gift you have, and you don't understand the plants.<eos> They fucking take you down.
Nobody before had ever... come right out and said that.<eos> I think certainly I began to think through this conversation,<eos> "Yeah, they're probably right.<eos> "I am an awful person for putting her down, "and if she lacks confidence, it may well be "because of some things that I have said in the past. "<eos> And suddenly I thought, "I wonder if they knew about it. "
"Yeah, they're probably right.<eos> "I am an awful person for putting her down, "and if she lacks confidence, it may well be "because of some things that I have said in the past. "<eos> And suddenly I thought, "I wonder if they knew about it. "<eos> Diane had probably talked to them about it, that she was thinking of leaving me, "cause I was not much good for her confidence.<eos> And maybe they were sort of half warning me what was going on.
Larry Bird was right!<eos> Humans are ridiculous and stupid, and your birthday parties are the stupidest things of all!<eos> They turn human beings into lunatics, and I am out!<eos> Jackie, wait.<eos> They don't turn all people into lunatics, just me.
And the deal started on this continent... two tribesmen at a watering hole finding a common interest and ensuring the very survival of our species.<eos> In a world of aggression and violence, the deal is pure.<eos> It's the only thing that is pure, and I truly believe that the deal is the only thing that will save Africa.<eos> Ladies.<eos> They know how hot they look in those uniforms, don't they? Huh? Of course they do.
This is not how I flirt.<eos> I'm much more...<eos> - Subtle when I flirt.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, I follow girls to classes, memorize their schedules so I can show up right when they get there.
I made a vow to him.<eos> Why didn't he set up a trust for Lucinda?<eos> Well, Henry was...<eos> Never really a good judge of women.<eos> He always trusted them to do the right thing, and they never did.
I don't think Spencer did it.<eos> No kidding.<eos> He's a nut case.<eos> Just heard back from the estate lawyer. Once the mother dies, the $52 million goes to the sisters.<eos> Once they're dead,
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Marbles?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bobby Fischer's marbles.<eos> Yeah, yeah they showed up on Hugo's doorstep.
- So you are no longer a wanted man.<eos> That's good.<eos> And the unique circumstances of your daughters... Uh, should I say both your daughters... Are compelling, to say the least.<eos> But while compelling, those circumstances don't rise to the level of hardship if you were to be removed.<eos> You haven't been a presence in the girls' lives until now and they have three other parents.
There was a sense of fear but mainly a sense of anticipation of the finality of the event, the encounter.<eos> What are we going to see?<eos> Some creatures are smart. They know you're tracking them.<eos> And what they will do, they'll lead you out so far, and they'll double back, and they end up behind you.<eos> While you're following them, they're following you.
After eight years of loneliness eight years of not seeing each other if someone had warned me how he'd look at me as if he didn't know me anymore how violent his nightmares would be<eos> that he would attack me in his sleep, um, how he didn't know what to say to the kids those first few weeks, how hard intimacy of any kind would be for him...<eos> If someone had actually warned me in plain English how hard coming home would be for him, that I'd need to adjust my expectations...<eos> What I'm saying is, what if, with some of this money, we could set up a place where families could get ready for their veterans coming home?<eos> An actual place where they can learn from other families who have been through... who are still going through it.
No matter how advanced you've become you will endeavor to stay alive at all costs.<eos> In extreme situations your body will react on a subconscious, organic level.<eos> There are tells your conscious mind can't control.<eos> For instance, good news and your pupils dilate.<eos> Bad news and they contract.
It's just 'cause I'm having a problem with slugs.<eos> At the moment, there's a lot of slugs coming in the house.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> I just... they can get where, like, water can, you know what I mean?
I'll bet they' trying to help.<eos> Do you know how they're trying to help?<eos> They took me to go find Otis.<eos> How's that for a joke?<eos> They just probably see me as one less competitor standing in their way to the Olympics.
You want us to keep your dinner warm?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Real warm.<eos> Hello, I see you're wearing my ears.<eos> Oh, they're off-center a smidge.
I mean, how hard does it have to be to get the facacta thing in the hole?<eos> (Laughs) It just spills all over ya! (Laughter)<eos> (Normal voice) And then I have a bunch of stuff about, like, the difference between little girls and little boys.<eos> You know, little girls be sharin'.<eos> (Laughs) They be sharin', man.
Before you answer that, Miss Paley... defense exhibit 12, Your Honor.<eos> So, Jocelyn, tell me, why do women want to be dominated?<eos> Women do it all these days.<eos> Career, kids.<eos> Sometimes they just want a man to throw them down and take control.
You seem kind of nervous.<eos> You know what?<eos> I am nervous.<eos> You're extremely popular.<eos> And I'm looking around at all the other girls here, and they're all really popular, too.
Thank you.<eos> Detour:<eos> Straw Dogs or Bamboo Jungles.<eos> We're choosing bamboo.<eos> We got there before the twinsies got there and they left before us.
We're gonna go home soon, okay?<eos> Where's Mommy?<eos> What do you remember last?<eos> - We were swimming. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
I already wanted Princess Celestia, I already wanted Twilight to be her student who was displaced.<eos> I had her, in Mork and Mindy style, write letters surmising what she learned about friendship at the end of the episode.<eos> Dear Princess Celestia.<eos> This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends.<eos> They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
What were you doing there?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I was tipped off about those pictures.<eos> They could be misconstrued.
The clothes, the toys, bedspreads, furniture.<eos> They're all generic.<eos> - All we have are the girls.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Odds are, when he's through... they go into drugs or prostitution.
- Yeah.<eos> Odds are, when he's through... they go into drugs or prostitution.<eos> They're probably in the system.<eos> - I'll issue warrants.<eos> - Warrants for what? They're all victims.
Me too.<eos> Hmm. Nothing unusual here.<eos> What is it?<eos> Uh, does anybody remember seeing these flowers before?<eos> They were here when I got back.
The point is, if we remove the element of mystery,<eos> Henry won't have any illusions that Judi would've made him a better life than the one he has now.<eos> (Sam) What if the birth mother is a bad influence?<eos> Well, that's relatively rare.<eos> These women tend to be selfless, envisioning a future for their baby that they are unable to provide.
And so, there you have it.<eos> I saved the day because those silly little carrots had absolutely no effect on me.<eos> Unlike you. Right, Bubbles?<eos> So, remember, kids:<eos> Eat your veggies or they just might eat you.
I don't know. What do you think?<eos> I think you gotta go off and see what's around the next bend.<eos> I guess we both do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you know, I know those girls think that Teddy makes the world go round, but... they wouldn't even have a world without you.
Well, I suppose all your friends are out there having a nice laugh about me right now.<eos> Look, you're at an awkward age for college.<eos> That's all.<eos> What about you?<eos> They all love you.
Not on your nails.<eos> Okay, Sabrina, let's go.<eos> It's clear they don't have anything to hold you.<eos> Not yet, but we are holding your husband on fraud charges.<eos> You have spent your entire career telling women that if they are single, they are broken.
If we tell Boyd something and you undermine us, he's never gonna listen to anything we say.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me put your mind at ease.<eos> I've raised three kids.<eos> They never listen to what you say. All right?
Right?<eos> Our survival depends on it.<eos> Welcome, mommies and daddies, to the incredible journey of childbirth.<eos> Let's start with some breathing exercises.<eos> Dads, prop up your wives so they can focus on their diaphragms.
One of them was to become more complex, to become cells, to become, ultimately, organisms like ourselves.<eos> The other way was to remain simple - to become viruses, and to exploit those cells to their own ends, to replicate themselves.<eos> Beneath the surface, the cell prepares to receive the deadly invaders.<eos> Fooled into thinking that the virus is an important nutrient, special proteins slot together to form a spherical mould.<eos> They pinch out a bubble of cellular membrane, wrapping the virus inside.
And they have no way of utilising the energy generated by the cells' floating power stations...<eos> ..the mitochondria.<eos> Inside each mitochondrion, the food we eat and the air we breathe drives thousands of turbines that continually recharge billions of tiny batteries.<eos> But what is even more extraordinary is that scientists believe that mitochondria were once simple cells themselves.<eos> Then they one was swallowed by another cell, firing one of the greatest leaps in evolution - complex life.
You know, just me and my baby, All alone against the world.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You've got your husband.<eos> Yeah, but he travels all the time, you know?<eos> And, sure, I could hire all the nannies and caregivers I want, but they're not family.
Get up!<eos> Five second rule.<eos> What are you two crazy cakes doing?<eos> You lost your customers.<eos> They ran away.
Look at the mother's age.<eos> - Fifteen.<eos> - Back in 1968.<eos> There were a lot of strict rules about what unwed mothers could put on the birth certificate.<eos> They could only give the baby their own surname.
There's no way we're gonna make it in time, Eugene, if we have to go all the way around the farm at 22 miles an hour.<eos> Bear with me, buddy.<eos> I apologize for whatever's about to happen.<eos> Good lord.<eos> Oh, my gosh, these cows better move their heads or they're coming off.

This necklace was meant for Maya and you gave it to this girl?<eos> Spare me, I've two kids.<eos> We lied for their sake.<eos> Do you want us to break up with our wives?<eos> They already suspect us.

We walk past each other, almost as if irritated, filled with turmoil we cannot express<eos> There are those who shout, and those whose voices I've never heard.<eos> There are ones who are affectionate, who make you feel warm and who smell nice.<eos> I look at the tired faces, the bags under the eyes, the hands of women so fragile I feel in awe.<eos> But they are, all of them, the best friends I've ever had
That wasn't a nice thing to say but anyway...<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Come on, let's give those girls a surprise.<eos> Right now they are surprising us.
Well, maybe.<eos> But it's pretty fucked up.<eos> I see happy people.<eos> I've always thought happy people must be morons.<eos> They are morons.
Good.<eos> Τhe teacher gave us a quiz.<eos> I had to talk about sponges.<eos> Τhe thing is, people thought they were plants.<eos> But they have, like, fins --
Let's go talk over there.<eos> I got a wife and a new baby girl.<eos> I can't do this shit anymore.<eos> I don't want to see pictures of your family.<eos> They're the only reason I'm still riding the desk.
And, um, maybe that's how we change the world...<eos> Instead ofby writing a punk rock song, maybe we just be better parents.<eos> I wanna be around for my kids.<eos> I wanna be, um...<eos> I wanna be there when they want me to be there, and I think that's the punkest thing of all.
So who exactly did you serve these to?<eos> All the mothers at the meeting.<eos> And how'd that go over?<eos> Really well.<eos> They were huddled around.
The new one I'm on, I can eat a whole pie and it's back out in an hour.<eos> Hey, we got pie.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Wherever you go in life, there's gonna be mean girls.<eos> They will try to tear you down.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You just let the baby cry?<eos> It teaches them how to self-sooth and handle their own fears.<eos> Hell, Chinese moms don't even give the kid a pillow.<eos> Yeah, they just throw a violin and a laptop in the crib and say,
And you're the one who's always saying,<eos> "it doesn't matter where you get your appetite, As long as you have dinner at home."<eos> That's only for guys.<eos> What do your ears hear when you talk?<eos> Huh? Okay, look, I don't know any of those women, And they certainly don't have their hands all over me
How about you?<eos> Anything left? No, I'm sorry.<eos> Both sides?<eos> I read a thing that a woman columnist wrote about you one time, and she said, "Mitchum was born the kind of man<eos> "that does not have to seek women because they come to him."
And, um, I should have been working, but<eos> I Googled you, and I started getting hot.<eos> I never told you this, but I love your drawings of Super Ray's cock.<eos> Leah, the girls.<eos> They won't leave the TV.
If you'll indulge us for just a second I promise you, you won't be sorry.<eos> What is a role model?<eos> A person worthy of imitation.<eos> Who inspires.<eos> And for young women, looking to define themselves and their dreams, you ask... "Who can they look up to?"
d One hand tied behind my back d<eos> Oh, Dais'!<eos> If I may say, your tits do look amazing.<eos> You may not.<eos> They always look amazing.
Real easy... it's a combination of everything that is my life.<eos> And it shows the balance between my love that I have for my daughters and my love and passion of being on the road and trying to make both worlds work.<eos> Now, do you ever run into...<eos> Being who you are and your past...<eos> When you have to be dad to your daughters, and you go, "don't do that!" and they go, "dad,"
These photographs here were taken by a studio artist, a professional.<eos> - I'm hanging up, Burak.<eos> - Deniz.<eos> They're some of the many he took during a career of more than 40 years.<eos> In fact, they're the few that have survived of thousands.
Not for long.<eos> She's getting a divorce.<eos> You two are still married?<eos> - How can two ladies get married?<eos> - They're lesbians.
Would love to have you at more meetings.<eos> See if I can fit it into my busy schedule.<eos> Don't let those women bum you out.<eos> I didn't even notice them.<eos> Well, between you and me, I think they're twats.
Because our kids play together.<eos> They have baseball and soccer.<eos> They're not so bad, once you get to know them.<eos> Well, I guess they chose not to show that side of themselves today.<eos> They're just insecure, so they've got to make everybody else feel as shitty as they do.
You're so clever, Laura.<eos> Miss Lane and everyone will be so joyful when you win the competition.<eos> We can't suppose it'll be so easy.<eos> Daniel says almost every girl in the county is writing feverishly.<eos> But they in't romantically intended for Daniel, is they?
All right.<eos> Please.<eos> Someone will be with you in a moment.<eos> I am so sorry to make you sit over there with those two other women.<eos> They don't bother me.
This tells us that his social skills are most likely lacking, and he may not have the confidence to talk to women.<eos> His confidence with killing, however, is growing.<eos> He's gone from hesitant strikes in the victim's home to painting the walls with blood.<eos> Our unsub is developing a taste for the kill.<eos> And his victims share similar features and backgrounds, and we believe that they represent someone whom the unsub thinks has wronged him, and he's taking out his rage on them.
- *** - Go for it.<eos> If we can show them that we're a solid family and there's no backstabbing and it's a safe place to be...<eos> Oh, my God, that's the best-tasting one.<eos> I'm not kidding you.<eos> I would think that they would want to hang tight with us going into a merge.
They may think they have the numbers, but I think yellow might look good on me.<eos> - Me, too. - Wow.<eos> Rob, Grant, that never hurts to have two people say,<eos> "listen, we might be willing to merge with you"<eos> Doesn't hurt if they're telling the truth.
Rob and Grant stepped away to go watch the duel at Redemption Island, so kind of funny kind of day for me.<eos> For me, it's just, like, I can't make an impression on these ladies so it's frustrating for me.<eos> These girls remind me of crabs, to be honest, back at camp, you know, particularly Natalie and Ashley.<eos> I have a very difficult time trying to approach them.<eos> They're quick to move away.

There's a lot of faking going on, but that's the name of the game.<eos> The sun's coming out, girls.<eos> Almost time for our beach day.<eos> My relationship with the girls is...<eos> Is just... There is a level of frustration that's growing a little bit because they... They just don't do that much.
Is just... There is a level of frustration that's growing a little bit because they... They just don't do that much.<eos> - Oh, my gosh, that feels so good.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's a little agitating to me because I want to keep, you know, getting stuff done and keep going but I also like hanging out with them because us three girls are together.<eos> Theyre sweet girls but the conversations usually going to superficial stuff like, "oh, how's my hair," talking about stuff like that.
hey, you know what I love about these Looxcie cameras?<eos> What?<eos> They're a great way to look up your nostril.
Then we can be the father-daughter version of Grey Gardens.<eos> Life is a journey.<eos> And there is no predicting the outcome.<eos> The only thing you can control are your choices.<eos> And they'll...

Tired?<eos> Come on...<eos> Surprise! ♪ ♪ Yeah!<eos> Come on, you didn't think I was just going to take you to some lame spa, right?<eos> I tried to call the girls from the CAT squad, but they were away in Libya somewhere, so I invited a few of the Wienerlicious girls and some friends from the hospital.
Starlight is made up of countless different wavelengths, all the colours of the rainbow.<eos> When light is emitted by a distant star or galaxy, its wavelength doesn't have to stay fixed, it can be squashed or stretched, and when light's stretched, its wavelength increases and it moves to the red end of the spectrum.<eos> So the interpretation of the fact that the most distant galaxies appear red is that the space in between them and us has stretched during the time it's taken the light to journey over that vast distance.<eos> That means that our entire universe is expanding.<eos> Now, just think about what an expanding universe implies, because if the galaxies are all rushing away from each other, that means that if you rewind time, then they must have been closer together in the past, and actually,
The CMB fills every part of the universe.<eos> Every second, light from the beginning of time is raining down on the surface of the Earth in a ceaseless torrent.<eos> If my eyes could only see it, then the sky would be ablaze with this primordial light, both day and night.<eos> These waves have been travelling towards us for over 13 billion years.<eos> They are messengers, carrying information about the origin of our universe.
Will do.<eos> I'll talk lo you later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you recharge your batteries?<eos> Oh, the mountains, they always deliver.
Even though we were equally women.<eos> Rather than the fact that I was always worn out, it was seeing my pathetic life reflected against hers, that was harder to bear.<eos> I ran away from home. I knew Kim Young Hee is not a bad man but<eos> I was afraid just in case. Every day I made sure the door was locked before I went to sleep.<eos> My friends who got jobs at bars, would tell their friends that they worked at the bars. But strangely, I couldn't say that I was a maid.
This experiment was done on rats.<eos> It's groundbreaking.<eos> Huge success.<eos> In rats.<eos> Well, they got four legs.
After 6 periods<eos> At lunch-time, lets unravel the mystery of the lunch box<eos> They kept on checking these baskets as they were going out<eos> To check what is in the basket<eos> But they were just full of sweets and nothing else
Quiet.<eos> - Then I tie them up.<eos> - Leave me.<eos> Not because I am scared.<eos> They scream a lot.
Ashley and Natalie are getting too close for comfort.<eos> It's just like Amber and I.<eos> It's just like Andrea and Matt were at the beginning of this season.<eos> A couple is very powerful in this game.<eos> Even if it's two girls, if they trust and believe in each other, it's a very powerful thing.
These girls are going to get together.<eos> And I went into my old special agent mode.<eos> When Boston Rob got back from fishing, I did what I told him I'd do.<eos> I called him over and gave a report.<eos> They went back there when you went in the water and they talked forever.
Oh, that probably wasn't even half of them.<eos> Those were just the ones that slept with him when I was with him.<eos> And, again, this isn't about Amy, okay?<eos> This is about me, all right?<eos> Those girls were mean to me, and they always thought they were better than me.
Even in Israel<eos> I was really gratified by the fact that my films were seen in the world<eos> I was happy and proud<eos> Obviously it was not all roses I have also received much criticism<eos> Many have criticized both at home and abroad saying that my films are rough does not matter if it deals with themes that touch the heart, for they are still crude
Because, we men have a basic need.<eos> To make sense in an argument.<eos> It make no difference to the girls.<eos> Why should she lose the argument for useless things?<eos> They won't argue for today's matter..
- Yes.<eos> I feel like going to Charu's house and slapping her.<eos> What difference will it make?<eos> This is what happens with girls in long distance relationships.<eos> They have boyfriends who live far away.

They will breakup with their boyfriends<eos> ..and then friends become their boyfriends..<eos> ..and friends will be in trouble.<eos> It doesn't make any difference to them.<eos> They always have an option.
Maybe you should've just gone up there and cut in.<eos> Cut in?<eos> It's not the senior prom, Tanya.<eos> Ray, women like to be fought over.<eos> I mean sometimes they'll have sex with the guy that seems to want them the most.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?<eos> Yes.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey! I think you better move away from that woman.<eos> Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
And this is what I wanted to do. This was the future I saw.<eos> I saw it.<eos> There were a few people that didn't see it.<eos> For example, girlfriends.<eos> They'd realize I was sincere about wanting to talk to dummies the rest of my life and they would dump me immediately.
I saw it.<eos> There were a few people that didn't see it.<eos> For example, girlfriends.<eos> They'd realize I was sincere about wanting to talk to dummies the rest of my life and they would dump me immediately.<eos> I couldn't see what they saw until a few months ago. I was sitting down with my three daughters, and we were looking at the yearbooks from my junior high and high school years.
At least he thinks he did.<eos> Did you have the DNA tested yet?<eos> Why would I?<eos> They look just like me.<eos> But they will grow.
Charlotte king?<eos> You know, apologies make sense to men.<eos> Find the problem, fix it, right?<eos> That's kinda how we're built.<eos> But, uh... for women, the words don't really mean anything unless they understand that you get where their heads are at.
And that's the story of how we got our rocking chair.<eos> Ebay, huh?<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I was going to turn it off, but then they came in.
!<eos> You thought I was gone, so you just thought you could throw me away like I didn't matter? ! Like I never even existed?<eos> !<eos> Is that what you think of women, Ben?<eos> Like they're just some disposable nothings that you can sit on top of as you casually drink ice tea?
That's different.<eos> I know one of those girls.<eos> I know her dad.<eos> That's somebody's daughter.<eos> They're all somebody's daughters.
I'm gonna fire that kid.<eos> You can't fire somebody because he follows his heart.<eos> - Come on now. - What are you talking about?<eos> You had daughters.<eos> Did they ever have guys over for the night?
Right.<eos> Under that goofy exterior lies the devil.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What kind of example does this set for the other girls?<eos> I mean, they--they look at Kristin's behavior, it'll set a precedent.
These katabatic winds are stronger than any hurricane. They are the coldest and the most ferocious on the planet.<eos> The storms catch many new arrivals by surprise, and are the reason that spring here is, in fact, the deadliest season.<eos> Here, early birds take a great risk.<eos> Some years, entire colonies are lost, buried beneath the snow.<eos> The survivors of this storm must hope that the females prove to be worth the wait when they finally decide to turn up.
So this is the last image of Nico, time stamp, 3:37.<eos> No Marc Rajic.<eos> No, but... there come our two girls, and it's just a few seconds later.<eos> It is the route to their subway.<eos> Or they did it.
No Marc Rajic.<eos> No, but... there come our two girls, and it's just a few seconds later.<eos> It is the route to their subway.<eos> Or they did it.<eos> And they stashed the rabbit's foot and the Metro card in Marc's room.
Well, it is one of the warning signs.<eos> I just think you deserve better.<eos> What about a nice girl from your church?<eos> I already tried hooking up with them two-faced baptist women.<eos> They'll rock your world on Saturday night.
I just think you deserve better.<eos> What about a nice girl from your church?<eos> I already tried hooking up with them two-faced baptist women.<eos> They'll rock your world on Saturday night.<eos> Come Sunday morning, they're repenting their sins in front of the whole congregation.
These were highly schizophrenic seconds.<eos> Schizophrenia is not a disease and should not be treated clinically.<eos> It is nothing more than a greater susceptibility to the eternal, a life in ecstasy, like God gave Adam.<eos> -But the letters are very different to your memories, right?<eos> - They are all very straight and all...
[grunting] You ever fuck when you're out of shape?<eos> You're like, "Ugh, shit.<eos> This is--" My stomach muscles are not strong.<eos> We're so bad at sex and then we wonder why women aren't really aggressive about sex.<eos> We think it's because they don't have as much desire as we do.
Now, what about the ladies in your Bible study group?<eos> Ah, those holier-than-thou hags hate me, I don't know why.<eos> I'm a good Christian.<eos> I turn the other cheek.<eos> Which they can pucker up and kiss.
Sort of a senior discount.<eos> Speaking of discount, that leather jacket's nice.<eos> I didn't know that goodwill had a gay section.<eos> Oh. (Laughing loudly) Oh, that's so... oh.<eos> See, that's how lesbians laugh when they think something's not funny.
Look at the stationary.<eos> "Big six hotel and liquor mart."<eos> If he's at that place, and he's got ten bucks, he's not alone.<eos> Ugh.<eos> If these walls could talk, they'd have a woman's voice and an Adam's apple.
You really don't like me very much, do you, Mr. Wemmick?<eos> I don't know who you are. Down there.<eos> And what will happen to your property when you are dropped?<eos> Pondering your immortal soul and how you will explain yourself to the Almighty, that's all very well, but these chickens need water, grain, a coop.<eos> You're condemned but they can be saved, if you bequeath them to me. Yep.
An entire shoreline, carpeted in gulf grunion.<eos> The adult pelicans know exactly when the grunion will arrive, passing on this knowledge to the youngsters travelling with them.<eos> The grunion surf ashore, and the females burrow backwards, laying their eggs in the exposed sand.<eos> The males then coil around to fertilise them.<eos> They are laying their eggs out of the reach of aquatic predators, above the high tide mark.
It's kind of weird lately.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you chickening out?<eos> Even you wouldn't do it, many people would.<eos> Those women are in trouble. They count on me.
I don't think they were all married.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> Well, that depends on the definition, really.<eos> The women of America, they owe you their thanks.<eos> And seeing as they're not here...
- Sir?<eos> That's my granddaughters'.<eos> Once in a while they go into town, you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I believe they're your culprits.
Georges is sleeping, not been well since ...<eos> - Mama, do not go away.<eos> - No disrespect, ma'am, but if not a good time to find it, please let me express gratitude to such I have to her husband.<eos> When I was young I saw all his films.<eos> They have inspired me.
If so you have to punish me!<eos> - One of them was left...<eos> - Everybody disappeared from the dance floor.<eos> - Not the twins.<eos> - They ran for sure!
All right.<eos> I have a confession to make as well.<eos> Remember how I told you that I do not date models?<eos> Well, the truth is<eos> They don't date me.
Do not want to talk about no.<eos> I think it would be different with my children, I think we can talk.<eos> And say the things y. ..<eos> Knowing that both will be the one to the other.<eos> They know that.
That is my dad talking.<eos> Tonight is going to go great.<eos> Turtles, and they didn't cost a dime.<eos> I rescued them from the science wing.<eos> Thought they'd rather be here than surrounded by hormonal teenagers feeding them gummy worms.
And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her If she would like to move in with me.<eos> Good idea?<eos> Bad idea?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Well, I would say that some women Won't consider moving in with someone Unless they think marriage is in the future,
The choice is yours:<eos> help me with what I need to do to prevent this woman from killing everyone, or stay here gagged and tied up while I escape anyway.<eos> Either way, I'm getting free.<eos> In one instance the Sisters will be safe.<eos> In the other, they'll probably be slaughtered.
If anything, he's too repressed.<eos> Well, you are.<eos> Okay, well, that makes perfect sense.<eos> Ted, you sexually harass women because your emotions are so bottled up.<eos> They explode inappropriately.
I'm just so angry.<eos> I don't want to belittle your problem, but are there women out there who will have sex with me just because they're mad about something?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> For sure. - This is very exciting news.<eos> You know, there are also girls that will sleep with you because their friends are prettier than they are.
Tell me about him.<eos> (laughs) he was italian.<eos> Classy, elegant.<eos> And boy, did he have a way with the ladies.<eos> They just couldn't say no.
In, like, Fort Greene or Bed-Stuy?<eos> I know.<eos> It's hard to imagine leaving Tribeca.<eos> It's very convenient.<eos> You know, the thing about your friends - they weren't assholes, were they?
Thank you.<eos> I'm so sorry I barked at you this morning.<eos> I've been feeling so bad about it.<eos> But, babe, I promise to make it up to you tonight.<eos> Travis, women will always drive us nuts, But have compassion, For they only behave that way to protect themselves.
Most people were silent.<eos> I remembered the line from the Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu ... trying to persuade the prince he should do his duty and to impress him, takes on his multiarmed form and says:<eos> "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. "<eos> Everyman, woman and child livesunderanuclearsword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capableofbeingcut at any moment byaccident,or miscalculation or by madness.<eos> The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.
A lot.<eos> I didn't need to tell her though.<eos> I tell women I love them all the time.<eos> Yeah, that's when you're trying to fuck them.<eos> What if they said it to you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, if you're wondering why they all left,<eos> I'll enlighten you. You're not worth hanging around for.<eos> I had something good, something special with each of these women.<eos> They haven't had something good with you though, have they?
You'll be married...<eos> Someday.<eos> And just how did my little brother do during his time in the service?<eos> There weren't any women in my corner of the pacific.<eos> Only nurses and they were off-limits.
'Scuse.<eos> Need some air.<eos> Does the name Mary Gwilliam mean anything to you?<eos> Whatever you might have heard, there are some women in Oxford with whom I've not been intimately acquainted.<eos> In truth, I fear I've not always been as kind to the ladies as I should have or, indeed, as they deserve.

Excuse me?<eos> Sil was a genius.<eos> It was his idea, right?<eos> Throwing Mick off that scaffold?<eos> Ideas don't happen unless they come from my brain.
- My age protects me from that.<eos> Yes, your age helps, protects you from women.<eos> Well, not too much.<eos> - I see.<eos> They come and hug me.
Okay, the two male vics, mark and daniel, Bring james to the tribeca grand hotel for his 21st birthday. And there's drinking and drugs.<eos> This was going to be a night that they only vaguely remember.<eos> As far as the two female vics,<eos> Jackie and lacey were not their friends. And the hotel manager Said that the girls did not check in with them.<eos> Right, or they were the party.
What do you say we hit...<eos> Just drive!<eos> Okay.<eos> Those girls didn't know what they were in for.<eos> Well, they knew enough To slip the guys some lsd.
Marc, why didn't you say anything?<eos> 'Cause I don't like to see you sad.<eos> Betty was telling the truth.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All the garments are steamed and hung in the salon, and in a few hours, they will be the talk of Fashion Week.
I can't leave my girls.<eos> I thought you were having a fight.<eos> We are, but it'll pass.<eos> Kat and Joanna and I -- we're connected.<eos> You're my muse, but... Mm. So are they.
Um, they're not really mine to give, Sammy.<eos> Wait, hold on!<eos> Is there something wrong with me?<eos> Okay, there's two girls, there's two guys.<eos> I have something they don't have.
Wait, hold on!<eos> Is there something wrong with me?<eos> Okay, there's two girls, there's two guys.<eos> I have something they don't have.<eos> They have something I want...
'cause that's too offensive.<eos> oh, i guess they didn't want all these angry letters from paleontologists who are like, "hey, man!<eos> "there's nothing in the fossil records to suggest "that kind of behavior.<eos> so why don't you chill with your accusations?" and then after you meet this dude, then you meet the girls he's going out on the dates with.<eos> and they come up there and they say things like,
He doesn't have anybody and he hates Miami.<eos> So now you're our Goodwill ambassador.<eos> I'm just trying to show him that there are nice people here.<eos> Nurses are nice.<eos> And they can take care of him, too.
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.<eos> But if I don't eat my lima beans, I can't have my cookie.<eos> Here, you want my peas?<eos> The peas- perfect.<eos> They can be electrons.
My Point Is You Are Sending Your Girls To Slaughter.<eos> The Chinese Beat A Better Team, The One We Assembled.<eos> And Because You've All Gone Rogue,<eos> Not Only Will Your Girls Get Their Asses Handed To Them By China, They May Even Get Kicked Off The National Team.<eos> Thanks To Your Politics, They're As Good As Kicked Off Already.
After they've beaten the US National Team without the US National Champion they'll feel obligated to defend their victory.<eos> - But what if the US wins?<eos> - The odds are against them.<eos> These girls trust you.<eos> You're the only person in this sport they think they can trust right now.
Maybe you were right.<eos> The girls trusted me.<eos> What if I can't deliver?<eos> Who will they believe in?<eos> They'll believe in the person who believes in them most.
So much so that he left courtney as a witness?<eos> What could be that important?<eos> Well, until a few hours ago, he had a type.<eos> The other victims were younger, less sophisticated.<eos> It wouldn't take more than a day To figure out if they're worthy or not.
Dear husband and beloved father, pillar of the...establishment...<eos> You said he was a libertine.<eos> This is a card of condolence, Ruby.<eos> There is no call for honesty.<eos> And yet they may honestly be grieving.
Who had 9-1-1 on speed dial.<eos> Yeah. Called us pretty much every weekend.<eos> About as often as it took cutler to change girlfriends.<eos> Any of them, you know, threaten her?<eos> Well, they kicked the door, broke some flower pots.
Always.<eos> Alfie, let me pass on to you what I have learned about women folk.<eos> Never chase after 'em.<eos> Never.<eos> Hold firm. They will bend.
And there they are.<eos> Danny and jordan just Jumped on a bus.<eos> I'm curious, who are you Guys most concerned about to u-turn?<eos> If you've got to do the girls because they're the most Well travelled out of everyone.<eos> They've come in first zero though.
I was working below my qualifications<eos> At waterman's insurance.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, did you see those gift bags?<eos> They're branded with the bank logo.
But...you have the heart and stomach of a king.<eos> You are quite... mistaken in me.<eos> So I see.<eos> Then I must share my gospel with the good women of Candleford.<eos> If you will not hear it, they will... and they will rejoice in it!
- These girls don't care about evidence...<eos> Or reality.<eos> What's going on between them is all that really matters.<eos> - That's right.<eos> They've escaped into this whole world of fantasy.
Could something have changed her mind... ?<eos> You're doing the right thing, Kaylie.<eos> This is a non-sanctioned meet.<eos> You're under no obligation to lose your status or your endorsements just to have the backs of your teammates.<eos> Especially when the only thing they have in my back is a knife.
It's the way they want it.<eos> Maybe it's biology.<eos> It's like men are this vegetable soup, and we can't put them on a plate or eat them off the counter.<eos> So women are the pot.<eos> They heat them up.
There's a meeting of my borstal charity.<eos> I've missed two and I simply must be there.<eos> You'd have to take Mary or Edith with you.<eos> Don't make me.<eos> Those meetings are deadly at the best of times, and you know what they're like when they're bored.
***<eos> I've got the feeling we're not in Kansas any more.<eos> - Everyone'll think I'm gay.<eos> - What's wrong with that?<eos> Women love the gays, don't they?
- Everyone'll think I'm gay.<eos> - What's wrong with that?<eos> Women love the gays, don't they?<eos> The gays?<eos> Mate, they go mad for it.
Easy!<eos> MAN: Powerful shot you've got there!<eos> *** to the fabulous Jockey.<eos> O-Observe the lines of the body.<eos> See how they flow into each other to form relationships.
Now what could possibly have caused that?<eos> Well, it's all down to one of Saturn's moons called Mimas which orbits well outside the ring system.<eos> And how could something that far outside the rings have any influence at all on the particles inside the rings?<eos> Well, it's all down to a phenomena called orbital resonance.<eos> Now the particles in the Cassini division have an interesting relationship with the moon, Mimas because they orbit around Saturn twice for every single orbit of Mimas, and that has an interesting consequence.
You know, I wasn't supposed to be there that day.<eos> What day?<eos> Al Gough was supposed to be Mark's partner.<eos> I switched with him, and because I was Mark's partner, I was covering the bust that led me to you.<eos> All these tiny little decisions we make, you know, Without thinking, they... they all...
We all love your ma well enough, but her coming out of prison is only her way of getting into more trouble.<eos> You supposeI don't know that, Twister?<eos> You think I don't look at the rest of my life and wonder?<eos> I have three precious sisters.<eos> And they have me.
Mom, you don't play with Lisa.<eos> You play despite her.<eos> Bart, I'm not thrilled either, but one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open.<eos> Want to help me with my ant farm?<eos> You plant the ants, and then they grow?
- Let him go!<eos> Have you taken leave of your senses or what?<eos> He's just a child!<eos> Kites are meant for boys of his age, not for his Kaku!<eos> They were lying forgotten in a corner..
Absolutely.<eos> Do we know them well?<eos> I mean, hardly.<eos> I mean, would I stake my reputation on their being on the up-and-up?<eos> No. Is it possible that they...
They want a promise ring with fangs.<eos> So I give it to 'em.<eos> You -- you go out, you get them, and you bring 'em home to me.<eos> So what's with the cages?<eos> Oh, that's just, you know, till they're compliant.
Guess what.<eos> Today you're going to school with Axl.<eos> Ugh, ooh, senior hotties.<eos> Okay, here's the plan:<eos> When they walk by, look confused and ask for help.
- Why?<eos> - Because I'm me in that fly's head,<eos> So I don't think that the flies would be going, "come on, join in."<eos> I'd just be like, "oh, I'll wait here," wait, watch and that.<eos> 'cause they don't- - I don't see why they have to do that.
What about-- what about flowers?<eos> - Do you think they've got a-- - A mind?<eos> A-- a feeling.<eos> Because here's-- here's something that--<eos> Again, they-- they use phototropism.

That's why we march around the hospital Twice a day, every day. We show them<eos> Who's boss.<eos> This is more dangerous Than you know, Pete.<eos> Especially for you.<eos> Look, we don't know why, But the shadows, they go after ghost children.
There's something not right with her.<eos> I see lots of shadows around her.<eos> Why can't you guys make the shadows leave my mom alone?<eos> We're too scared of them.<eos> They're really mean.
- No. I'm doing that.<eos> Then I know exactly what I'm going to do.<eos> You remember when you were a little girl, and you used to ask me to sing to you?<eos> And I never had the time.<eos> So you'd line up your little dollies and they'd sing to each other?
When that phone dies we'll take it away too.<eos> We'll take away anything that doesn't belong in the forest.<eos> We get a reward for every capture, and you get order in your forest.<eos> If you want to clean up, take away the dead branches.<eos> - But they belong here.
If you want to clean up, take away the dead branches.<eos> - But they belong here.<eos> - A bit picky aren't we!<eos> Obviously, these tops shouldn't be in the woods.<eos> - They belong in the dump.
Obviously, these tops shouldn't be in the woods.<eos> - They belong in the dump.<eos> - Don't touch them!<eos> They're mine.<eos> But they don't belong here, do they?
Such a pity she ended up this way.<eos> But not entirely unexpected.<eos> William, just because she posed for titillating picture postcards.<eos> It's a fact that women is this line of work invite unhealthy attention.<eos> They "invite" it?
Rutherford realised that as the nucleus loses protons, the atom's identity changes.<eos> It turns from one element into another.<eos> We can glimpse radioactive decay in a cloud chamber.<eos> If you look carefully, you can see trails of vapour which are caused by alpha particles being spat out from the source.<eos> Now they are incredibly tiny, they're a hundred thousandth of the width of a single atom.

What are you talking about?<eos> Becky and Riley's foster parents legally adopted them.<eos> No.<eos> Before I went to prison, my lawyer told me that I had a chance to get my kids back.<eos> As long as they were in foster care, but they've been legally adopted.
Of course!<eos> Rumor has it that s.<eos> Changed their relationship status from besties to roomies.<eos> Friends or lovers, moving in is risky business.<eos> Any time the rules change, you don't know how they'll change you.
Boom...<eos> Mrs. Mac, your mom together.<eos> Could be the perfect situation.<eos> Come on.<eos> They could be like The Golden Girls.
Why's she need to work?<eos> Well, she doesn't need to work.<eos> She wants to work.<eos> You put that on the list of reasons I'll never understand women.<eos> They "want" to work.
Oh, no. Well, thank you anyway.<eos> I have to go do the photo thing.<eos> Oh, right. Yeah. I just came from mine.<eos> Reminds me of why I'm on the radio.<eos> Uh, cameras are... well, they're so traumatizing, I...
What do you worry about?<eos> My kids, of course.<eos> Children... you know how it is.<eos> Take my daughters, please.<eos> One minute I'm worried that they're slouches, and what the hell are they doing with their lives, and then the next minute, I'm worried because they seem to be going at each other, dredging up things I said to 'em 20 years ago.
It feels like I'm in a "Girls Gone Wild" video.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I'm not even hitting on these girls.<eos> They're just coming on to me.
- How you doing?<eos> - I'm cool.<eos> - You're cool? - Yeah.<eos> Jeff:<eos> Two villains left,and immediately they start to talk.
Todd Willy's fine, too.<eos> Robert Todd and Bob Todford's all the same.<eos> If you holler "Mr. Williams," I won't know what to do with it!<eos> I do however go by T-Dub at the racetrack.<eos> And all the ladies, well, they call me Bert-Bert.
It'll be fine.<eos> We'll stay back here and watch the whole thing.<eos> Spies and magicians use many of the same techniques.<eos> They both know people trust their eyes more than they should.<eos> If they think they know what they're looking at, they don't look too closely.
You know, uh...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I thought she would have told you by now. The girls were not here for Halloween.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> They went to a fraternity party across the bay.
I'm sorry?<eos> They went to a fraternity party across the bay.<eos> What?<eos> And Kelsey actually got really drunk. Amber called from the party and I went and picked them up. Kelsey really wanted to tell you herself.<eos> I don't know. It didn't seem like her first beer, but, you know, they're teenagers. Oh, she's never done anything like that before.
Donna, the frozen peas?<eos> But what about Roberta?<eos> She's my age.<eos> Everybody knows Halloween is just a free pass for teenage girls to dress like sluts.<eos> They just have to call it a costume.
I'll pay.<eos> Why didn't you do that first?<eos> And I want you to pay for the other girls.<eos> Why?<eos> They're all dead.
And I want you to pay for the other girls.<eos> Why?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> That's no excuse. That's not right.<eos> You know they have no human rights.
But there's nothing wrong with me.<eos> Except for a bad case of very low self-esteem, huh?<eos> Feelings of inadequacy.<eos> So you perform lewd acts on unsuspecting little girls<eos> So they gotta notice you then.
But by working with them in a... and integrating them into a farm based program they really become individuals with abilities.<eos> Nice work!<eos> People with autism have this innate affinity for nature and so by working outside they're at home.<eos> So when I think about Colony Collapse Disorder I really hope that we can, as a society, have a connection with nature instead of a disconnect with nature.<eos> And one of the things that I really enjoy about the bees is that they all have this really strong sense of mission.
People have asked me, Why do you do what you're doing?<eos> Do you have hope with all the mess we are in, with all we are doing in nature?<eos> and I would say I would have hope to the very last day to the last plant.<eos> The bees are the most exquisite beings.<eos> They show us what this service can be like.
His patents on alternating electrical currents and distribution helped establish the commercial electricity industry.<eos> He also made contributions to robotics, radar, and computer science.<eos> But while Tesla can be credited for many scientific advances, one idea that fell short was his attempt to create a wireless electrical grid.<eos> Tesla's project was to have these towers around the United States and around the world.<eos> And they would broadcast electricity like a television station.
You hear that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Will you please stop worrying about the stupid rat?<eos> Baby, rats are not stupid.<eos> Did you know they're not indigenous to the United States?
[Silence] Okay, right there.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Dude, when did you unlock the secret of women's tennis?<eos> The Williams sisters.<eos> They started me watching.
What, Lady Rochford?<eos> Don't you think I know how to meddle with a man without conceiving a child?<eos> Your Majesty should be proud of your daughters.<eos> Both of them.<eos> They do you a great credit.
She's overstimulated.<eos> Sir?<eos> That happened to my girls all the time.<eos> They'd work themselves into a state,<eos> And then they just couldn't calm down.
The doctor said that she's got a pretty angry infection and and it's on her vagina.<eos> Let's try again.<eos> Tell me about your kids.<eos> Well...<eos> They're my girls... and...
Like I said, I've been studying your work.<eos> You didn't have anything better to do? I like numbers.<eos> And equations.<eos> I always have, ever since I was little.<eos> They don't lie.
Your best strategic move?<eos> Would be gerry and Sandra.<eos> No, because Sandra would win.<eos> It gives me two people-- I could sit there and say,<eos> "please, ask these people what strategic play they made in the entire game besides sunbathing?"
I don't like cooking.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm not like other girls.<eos> In Salzburg my friends won't know me.<eos> They'll have changed too.
- What the hell was that?<eos> - The manager's hair?<eos> - No.<eos> - You heard what my dad said.<eos> This guy fleeces women and they end up dead.
Hence the lack of semen in Maria's body.<eos> You know, having a wonky wang would really cramp my style.<eos> Why do guys always have to talk about their wangs?<eos> Why do women get to wear the same sweater three days straight?<eos> Because they have more important things to think about. What's wrong with you?
I mean, you own the building.<eos> Yeah, well, that's because I stopped pouting.<eos> I got off my tuchis, and I started my own business.<eos> And now I'm able to help other struggling women.<eos> You know, they set their own hours.
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.<eos> I am the good shepherd and I know my own.<eos> (Jesus) And my own know me.<eos> My sheep hear my voice and I know them.<eos> And they follow me.
I'm next.<eos> I am thankful that I'm hot and that I'm famous.<eos> Well, I'm thankful...<eos> I'm thankful that I don't have to be a whore to be confident.<eos> I'm thankful that girls call me a whore, 'cause it actually means they're jealous that I'm prettier and more interesting than them.
Please!<eos> - I want a kiss.<eos> - Oh, my gosh!<eos> Oh, this is gonna be such a great day with all our little babies.<eos> Hey, everybody, Blake brought his daughters, and they're gonna sing for us.
- Now look, I am popular...<eos> - Taiga.<eos> Today, just now, Shiori-san came to the parents' meeting at the school...<eos> The pheromones enveloping her they've been amplified again.<eos> They're just floating...
Darwin's painstaking work led to one of his most important books,<eos> The Expression Of The Emotions In Man And Animals.<eos> It was greeted with alarm and fascination.<eos> Now this is a really incredible book, partly because of the illustrations, because this is one of the first books ever to include photographs.<eos> And they feature people, people in various states of distress, if you like.
Charcot never fully grasped what he was dealing with, what we would now call the unconscious mind.<eos> In amongst the crowds at one of Charcot's famous demonstrations was a young Austrian doctor, Sigmund Freud,<eos> a man who would famously use the study of hidden emotions and repressed urges to develop this extraordinary concept of the unconscious mind.<eos> Freud's ideas would become a significant cultural influence on the 20th century.<eos> They would join a rising tide of other ideas that would form a wholly new approach to who we are - psychology.
When you mix it up with arsenic it becomes an odorless poison.<eos> What a name;<eos> Belladonna:<eos> Beautiful woman.<eos> Women, they're beautiful.
- Yeah, well, there won't be a next time if you give her that stupid sketch for her birthday.<eos> - I think she'll like it.<eos> - Yeah, if it's wrapped around a piece of jewelry maybe.<eos> Dude, girls like Jenny don't spread for stupid sketches.<eos> They want to see price tags.
And he calls cheerleaders "athletes," And he supports safety training.<eos> If he'd only admitted it was a competition.<eos> Well, at least he's typing the talk.<eos> Is he training the walk?<eos> Penn: We followed the Thuna girls To the varsity-affiliated cheer gym where they train.
All around the Universe, stars are exploding.<eos> They are cosmic catastrophes.<eos> But to these scientists, they are beacons in the depths of space.<eos> They illuminate an epic battle between two mysterious and invisible forces.
Richard has been leading a team of international astronomers and directing a fleet of telescopes to scour one section of the night sky for every single visible gravitational lens arc.<eos> So, what we're seeing here is gravitational lensing in action.<eos> All of the yellow blobs that we see are galaxies in a group which are fairly near to us.<eos> These strange shapes, these arcs, are actually very distant galaxies, and the light from those distant galaxies has to pass nearer the yellow blobs, which are foreground galaxies.<eos> And because they bend space, they bend the light rays from the distant galaxies, distorting their images into these circular, arclike patterns.
So this is what allows you to circle the cosmic strings and, like miss Bright, visit an event in your own past.<eos> And no one knows if cosmic strings are real.<eos> But many physicists think they're out there -- pieces of high-density vacuum energy left over from the big bang, narrower than an atomic nucleus.<eos> Some strings may be short. Some may be infinitely long.<eos> But they all exert incredible gravity.
- I understood everything.<eos> - Everything?<eos> - Everything.<eos> President, that I can explain.<eos> You are too permissive with the athletes and they took advantage.
Holy fuck!<eos> Wowser.<eos> Who knew that the desert would be the natural habitat of lesbians?<eos> Which is kind of cool.<eos> They migrate once a year to the same place to feed, to mate, to congregate.
Excuse me. Mr. revere, they need you in the press room.<eos> The price of fame.<eos> I know it well.<eos> You know, it's too bad you're with your friends, or you could come by the hotel later.<eos> Oh, they're not my friends.
The doll doesn't care about the kid!<eos> Fuckin' self absorbed pieces of plastic shit!<eos> I'd rather my children played with fucking Chucky!<eos> The dolls make it easy so you don't really have to think about it.<eos> Because they say the affirmations in the correct format, and then you just follow what the doll says.
I mean, look at those women.<eos> Their hair is still wet.<eos> It took me an hour and a half to blow this dry.<eos> Maybe we should take a lesson from them.<eos> - Or maybe they could take a blow dryer from us.
I'll try, mama.<eos> I should go.<eos> And, Beth?<eos> Sex makes women stupid, too.<eos> They start feeling things that they have no business feeling.
It's all I do not know but you can give me something, you may feel.<eos> The night is full of holes<eos> As bullets rip the sky<eos> With gold ink<eos> They sparkle and
A petition, I'll have all the parents sign it.<eos> And the girls can record a video that we'll show to the national committ...<eos> Stop.<eos> The girls are my responsibility.<eos> I should know what they're thinking before they do.
Try telling that to Ellen Beals. She thinks this is an individual sport.<eos> No, Kaylie, no.<eos> There is no such a thing as individual sport.<eos> When you go out there, you are not alone.<eos> You always taking your family, your friends. And, most importantly, your teammates. And they're gonna give you the courage and the support.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I can't compete now.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> These other girls, they were raised in rare air.<eos> They're thoroughbreds.
And these throw up giant blasts of plasma that come out along curious-looking arcs, but these are actually following the magnetic field lines around the Sun.<eos> Eruptive prominences can occur in tandem with another solar ejection that can deliver a double punch if directed at the Earth.<eos> NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, recently took dramatic movies of coronal mass ejections, or CMEs.<eos> These massive bubbles of hot ionized gas contain up to 1 0 billion tons of solar material.<eos> They shoot out into space at speeds of several million miles an hour.
She's too close.<eos> Where's her picture?<eos> We never took one.<eos> No, come on, choose one of these girls.<eos> They'll all be good.
That one?<eos> No, it's down here, with a cockroach nect to it.<eos> Look at that down there.<eos> I've heard that cockroaches are like the toughest thing that's on the planet.<eos> They say if there's a nuclear bomb, they'll carry on living.
it's like packing a pipe.<eos> Like, he just packs it in with his thumb, like this.<eos> See, I gotta admit, I don't hate that.<eos> Right?<eos> I was at the airport with my kids, I was at JFK, and they had to go to the bathroom and I had to go to the bathroom.
They have to sleep, it's important that they sleep, otherwise they're just pieces of shit the next day.<eos> I want to sleep.<eos> I just want to stop them, I want it to stop.<eos> And I love my kids, they're great, but I just want...<eos> At the end of the day, I got nothing left, and they're just laying there like "Clockwork Orange."
And I love my kids, they're great, but I just want...<eos> At the end of the day, I got nothing left, and they're just laying there like "Clockwork Orange."<eos> They have no interest in going to sleep.<eos> I just want to stop their ceaseless joy for life So I can watch "Cash Cab" and jack off and pass out.<eos> I want the joy and challenge of ( bleep ) parenthood to end so I can go eat all the ice cream in the freezer that they have no idea is there.
- Yeah, baby!<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> It must feel so good to have your penis back.<eos> Go ahead and make your jokes, burke.<eos> The ladies, they love the porsche.
This may sound like science fiction, but technologies are already being considered that might rescue Earth from the solar apocalypse.<eos> Predictions about our Sun's demise are widely accepted.<eos> In about 5 billion years, our star will begin a long, violent death.<eos> As it mushrooms into a red giant, it will vaporize planets Mercury, Venus, and most likely Earth.<eos> If human-type civilizations still exist, they will have already relocated to the outer solar system.
Hey, guys.<eos> Look at the patterns on the cornfields.<eos> It's all hard turns and zigzags.<eos> They had to have been chasing these women.<eos> Do you think they escaped?
Okay, first off, we are told to stop crying by the age of, like, 3.<eos> Then every time an adult male leaves the house, he says:<eos> "You're in charge." But deep down inside you know you can't be in charge because you can't even make a sandwich.<eos> Then you start to notice girls Who aren't your mom.<eos> You want them to like you, but they don't go for the normal social cues, such as being tackled to the ground or being called a nickname like Craphead.
I fly to Africa and to the Middle East.<eos> Selling weapons to our enemies.<eos> I haven't been in Afghanistan nor in Chechnya.<eos> And what are girls doing here?<eos> They watch the fire first, then I tell them stories about good and bad people.
I'm actually pretty full, ma.<eos> In fact, I think I've swallowed about as much as I can take.<eos> Listen, mikey,<eos> I'm just trying to protect you.<eos> You hook up with these women, And they always end up breaking your heart.
You know, this book is pretty interesting.<eos> I'm gonna go check out her seminar today.<eos> I'll save ya a trip.<eos> Here's your story.<eos> Give people what they want, and they'll pay ya for it.
We're hoping that if we can figure out what the list means with your help, that will lead us to Samantha.<eos> All right.<eos> I already ran the names through our system.<eos> It confirmed your email.<eos> All the girls are between seven and eight, and they've all been reported missing within the last two years.
And unleashes one of the most feared migrations on Earth.<eos> The army ants are on the move.<eos> The engine of this merciless hunger-- a brood of 200,000 larvae and their caretakers, demanding 30,000 corpses a day.<eos> The nursery lies at the heart of a twitching, throbbing structure built almost entirely of the ants themselves.<eos> Long legs stuck together with tarsal claws, they are the scaffolding, bricks and mortar of the nest.
For the young on these bleak southern shores, it is the season of abandonment.<eos> With barely a backwards glance, the starving elephant seal females desert their giant three-week-old babies on the shore.<eos> The males, utterly spent, have nothing to do with their young.<eos> With this abrupt weaning, the pups make their first forays into the shallows.<eos> They, too, will return to these shores after thousand-mile journeys.
You can't go now.<eos> It's the night before Thanksgiving.<eos> College chicks are back in town.<eos> Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained.<eos> They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right.
Always spouting about their rights, equality, feminism.<eos> Shall I tell you what I know about women like you?<eos> Can I squeeze past?<eos> No.<eos> Give them the same rights as men, they start acting like men.
I told Nina and Anja I had to go to a party with a customer.<eos> But then one of these old ladies started hitting on me.<eos> And when I think things can't get any worse, I look out the window...<eos> And they can!<eos> They hate each other!
I'm not saying that, but if we're struggling with our modern technology, is it really logical to suggest that our ancestors did this with pivots, and with little ropes, and with wooden rollers? MICHAELBARA:<eos> Youlookatall these ancient structures all over the world:<eos> Mayan structures, pyramids, Greek temples.<eos> You see all of these... these blocks that are not only enormous, it would be impossible to move them around with anything but even our best technology today. CHILDRESS:<eos> Oneof thegreat enigmas of the megalithic buildings around the world is that in many cases they're built with such large and heavy granite or basalt stones.
Ancient astronaut theorists believe clues can be found in the myths and tales of magic handed down throughout time. TSOUKALOS:<eos> Therearemany ancient legends which suggest that some of the monuments were built with the help of acoustic levitation.<eos> What the local legend of<eos> Stonehenge talks about is that those big stones were transported by way of levitation by none other than Merlin the wizard.<eos> And he had a magical rod with which he pointed at the stones, and they would levitate and position into place.
Butif deathray - type weapons had been used in ancient times, might there be some sort of tangible proof?<eos> Perhaps there is.<eos> Here, scattered throughout the Scottish countryside, can be found numerous ancient ruins.<eos> Many appear to have been forts or other enclosures dating back thousands of years.<eos> Remarkably, they also appear to have been subjected to fire and heat so intense it practically turned the stone structures into glass.
Many appear to have been forts or other enclosures dating back thousands of years.<eos> Remarkably, they also appear to have been subjected to fire and heat so intense it practically turned the stone structures into glass.<eos> It's a process more scientifically known as<eos> "vitrification." WILCOCK:<eos> Hereyouhavethese stone buildings in which an analysis of the outside comes to the conclusion that they were heated to over a thousand degrees Celsius in temperature.
Men are especially welcome, because this play is for the men.<eos> It will educate and help you men.<eos> I decided to participate in this play... because it would do me good.<eos> It is better that I participate... because we want to show rape victims... that they shouldn't hide.<eos> They find the courage to approach us.
And it really comes down to, at its simplest level, is how much energy is put into the ocean at the point that generates the tidal wave.<eos> And the water gets displaced, and it actually forms a wave that can be very coherent and travel for large distances, and will eventually hit the shore somewhere.<eos> But just days before the disaster, several eyewitnesses reported seeing strange unidentified flying objects to the India Daily newspaper.<eos> People were reporting seeing bright lights in the sky prior to and during that tsunami.<eos> Scientists think that that's just maybe the tectonic plates are rubbing each other, and that there's so much friction that they're giving off a glow.
But not someone they knew.<eos> Five completely different people, they had no friends in common.<eos> And another thing, Lauriston Gardens, did you see it?<eos> Twitching curtains, little old ladies.<eos> Little old ladies, they're my favourite, better than any security cameras.
more than 300 of them.<eos> Each one is different each one a world all its own.<eos> Well, when we look out on our solar system, we see a lot of planets.<eos> But even more than planets, we see moons.<eos> And in many ways, they're more interesting than the planets that they go around.
And when these massive stars begin to age and die, the nuclear reactions inside them speed up.<eos> Giant stars burn through their nuclear fuel very, very fast... sort of the, you know, the "live fast, die young".<eos> The more mass a star has, the hotter it burns inside, the faster it burns through its fuel.<eos> Unlike double-star supernovas, really massive single stars create lots of elements before they explode.<eos> Once they turn hydrogen into helium, helium into carbon, and carbon into oxygen, they don't collapse into white-dwarf stars.
Unlike double-star supernovas, really massive single stars create lots of elements before they explode.<eos> Once they turn hydrogen into helium, helium into carbon, and carbon into oxygen, they don't collapse into white-dwarf stars.<eos> Instead, giant stars keep on burning, building up layer after layer of new elements deep in their core.<eos> Big stars don't stop after they've burned helium to carbon and oxygen.<eos> They go ahead and burn carbon to still heavier elements and then neon and oxygen to silicon... until you get this nested Russian-doll spherical layer cake kind of thing.
Someday, the galaxies will be so far away from each other, it will be impossible to see anything else in the sky.<eos> Scientists used to think the expanding universe was slowing down, but there was no way to prove it until they found double-star supernovas, type 1As.<eos> They always explode when the white-dwarf star reaches exactly 1.4 times the mass of our Sun.<eos> And their explosions always release exactly the same amount of light.<eos> They are the perfect markers to measure distance in space.
They are our parents.<eos> Some scientists believe the age of supernovas could be ending.<eos> Smaller, slower-burning stars, like our Sun, will become more common and giant stars become more rare.<eos> Supernovas have given us galaxies, solar systems, stars, and planets.<eos> They made us and everything we see.

Do it now or I will tell your father everything.<eos> Fine, I'm coming.<eos> He's coming.<eos> If I could just have you wait outside...<eos> No no, if they ain't down here soon,
Hey, listen, I can't make you happy, okay?<eos> You want me to fuck; you don't want me to fuck.<eos> - What's it gonna be?<eos> - With all the girls here you've got to pick a prostitute?<eos> Hey, they don't have any experience like she's got.
Because although I advised against it, there are over two hundred thousand people in the zone.<eos> And because certain groups consume three times as much rice as others.<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> What are you fattening up your students? Or what are you doing with the rice you get?<eos> They're young they had to eat.
I tried this with Shauna, she cried.<eos> And I was punished. First of all, do not listen to I say in my program.<eos> In addition, you should do this with girls 25 years who are very tasty and irresistible.<eos> Not with girls of 14 years.<eos> They are in puberty, already have problems enough.
There are some patients that don't respond.<eos> How am I supposed to get to the truth and get better if the alters won't come out and talk to you?<eos> This is a process.<eos> They're not ready.<eos> Tara, and to be fair to them, look, they just... They just met me.
Where is this going?<eos> How serious are we? Why don't you listen to my story about my friend?<eos> Well, where is it going?<eos> Ladies like to know what that next step is.<eos> They... We can't help ourselves.
- Uh, not the clowns. - Why is that?<eos> The girls were trying a new act.<eos> They borrowed some of the clowns' equipment without asking.<eos> Yeah, well, they should have stuck to juggling.<eos> They were just trying to help save the circus.
The girls were trying a new act.<eos> They borrowed some of the clowns' equipment without asking.<eos> Yeah, well, they should have stuck to juggling.<eos> They were just trying to help save the circus.<eos> Well, they wanted more time in front of the audience.
Uh, can we please hit rewind?<eos> One of the girls had a boyfriend?<eos> Yes.<eos> Only one of them?<eos> I mean, how did they, you know, when they were...
One of the girls had a boyfriend?<eos> Yes.<eos> Only one of them?<eos> I mean, how did they, you know, when they were...<eos> I just don't see physically how they...
What do you mean?<eos> The last time I got caught.<eos> These stewardesses...<eos> they're such cowards.<eos> You know how they turn you in?
The last time I got caught.<eos> These stewardesses...<eos> they're such cowards.<eos> You know how they turn you in?<eos> They point.
She is?<eos> Well,that's terrible.<eos> Now,I know you keep the girls sequestered here,so they don't talk.<eos> Sure,if even one gossip site puts up a spoiler alert,the ratings take a hit.<eos> What do you do if they decide they want to leave?
That's a really interesting theory.<eos> Make a great chapter in one of your books.<eos> Yeah, reid.<eos> I found pictures on his computer in a special folder he created.<eos> They're scenic places in the city. 3 of them i recognize from his crime scenes.
I mean,choosing your "sisters" over your own blood,<eos> Does anyone really do that?<eos> She may not have a choice.<eos> I mean,sometimes these sororities can be brutal.<eos> They choose sisterhood over all.
Hey, wise guy, listen... we already have you for attempted murder and trying to torch evidence.<eos> Now, how much you want to bet that your gun links up with the bullets that are in your buddies?<eos> Jimmy made me shoot the boys to prove that I wasn't stealing his girls or working with you.<eos> But you were working with Harvey Yoon, weren't you?<eos> That's why you had to kill the women. Because they knew it all.
The funny thing is I... I don't know where I stand.<eos> I'm pro-research, but I'm also pro-animal.<eos> Rats show empathy for another rat in pain.<eos> They're social.<eos> They learn.
There's, uh... there's, uh, flirting.<eos> There's fantasizing about other women...<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Fantasizing is not cheating. - To women it is.<eos> They-they don't like the idea that you're mentally replacing them with someone else.
Well, I'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star their midst.<eos> Uh, let me think... did they say "star"?<eos> I heard, uh, "stuck-up," "obnoxious," "bitch."<eos> what?<eos> You know, I went out on a limb to get you into that game, and then you go in there acting like you're better than they are.
You turned down less work hours. You turned down pay raises. You turned down meal vouchers!<eos> So, today, don't turn down the gift our firm is offering you.<eos> You're not dreaming! New smocks!<eos> These smocks are the symbol of renewal.<eos> What's more, they've got your names!
I'd slice whoever's throat, I don't check their ID.<eos> A killing machine. A beast. You can't imagine.<eos> Me don't know, I don't.<eos> See these hands?<eos> They've stolen lives, they have.
We'll be injecting you with naloxone, which will knock the opioids out of your pain receptors.<eos> If we're right, your system will recalibrate within a few hours, and most of the pain will be gone.<eos> Hours?<eos> I need those drugs.<eos> Not if they're causing your pain.
Black magic!<eos> You picked it up!<eos> I used my single brain to tackle my problems.<eos> Sikandar, guns are the cause of all our problems.<eos> They were making my life hell!
I had sexual reassignment surgery when I was 23.<eos> As a boy, I was always so pretty.<eos> My hand gestures were feminine and it always seemed like I was so much more of a girl than a guy.<eos> In high school I wasn't attracted to girls, I just wanted to hang out with them.<eos> I had crushes on all the same guys they did.
- Yeah.<eos> Let's rock.<eos> I hope the ladies like a guy in uniform.<eos> We'll make it ideal.<eos> And they don't give it a shit because they'll even like you.
In which case, your children will be taken without you.<eos> But you've seen what they do to them!<eos> They're just girls, sir!<eos> They're just girls!<eos> They're not...
But you've seen what they do to them!<eos> They're just girls, sir!<eos> They're just girls!<eos> They're not...<eos> - They're not...
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance, and this guy Danny asked me out. And I was shock.<eos> I mean, I had a huge crush on him.<eos> So my mom and I went shopping, and we found this dress, and it was blue and gauzy and it just, it reminded me of water, of waves.<eos> And I went to the dance and went looking for Danny.<eos> And I found him standing with those girls. And as soon as they saw me, they just... they all started to laugh.
The cops did take him.<eos> There's no arrest record.<eos> Which is why I need you to get a look at her police jacket.<eos> She said that when Jimmy was taken, she was with her girlfriends.<eos> So, whoever they are, they could verify her story.
Once that geyser goes off, they're broiled.<eos> - We're not gonna last long in here.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> As long as those beasties are up there, we're safe.<eos> When they run, we run.
Goodbye!<eos> Do I look nice, head-mother?<eos> Beautiful. Goodbye!<eos> The girls haven't recovered psychologically yet.<eos> They'll be seeing their mother very soon, doctor.
Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> You saw what she did back there.<eos> I'm not defending her, okay?<eos> But they did break a rule.
And any red-blooded drummer, age 17, at that time, would've wanted to play with Jimi Hendrix, rather than the Spontaneous Music Ensemble.<eos> MUSIC: "Gypsy Eyes" by Jimi Hendrix<eos> But what made pop so attractive to some inexperienced young musicians was... well, the girls.<eos> There's this whole other half of the human race and, like it says in Some Like It Hot, "I tell you, it's a whole different sex." There was girls.<eos> Where were they?
Where were they?<eos> They were in caffs.<eos> What were they doing?<eos> They were sitting there.<eos> They had chalk-white pink lipstick on.
And today we celebrate together as that girl becomes a woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Glad you changed your mind.<eos> If they want to stay, this becomes strip poker.
Christ almighty!<eos> Them were farts you could smell through your ears.<eos> - What the hell are you talking about?<eos> - Women, lad.<eos> If they didn't have cunts, you'd throw stones at them.
Does he like it rough?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Does he like to tie up girls?<eos> Hurt them?<eos> No more than they wanna be hurt.
"women like men who can talk about their feelings and kittens"<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They want something naughty.
No, I've never!<eos> I mean...<eos> Is it all brogues and strap-ons, or...?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just... do what we do to ourselves.
- I was only testing the Web site when the sisters were here.<eos> - But you were filming them.<eos> Right? - Until they quit, yes.<eos> Jaya and Dhara did not want to be so famous, I suppose.<eos> Shame, too, because they could have made a lot of money for all of us.
You need to stay here until your work is finished.<eos> It's impossible! The thers keep dying. So juliet left the others to join the survivors,<eos> I want to know about your research.<eos> Sun... what happens to pregnant women?<eos> They all die.
Right now, I need to focus on the girls.<eos> So, how should we handle this?<eos> We won't handle it at all.<eos> I'll tell them.<eos> As far as they know, you knew nothing about Miles.
It-<eos> But it was still wrong.<eos> I appreciate you wanting to protect me, but-<eos> I'm not trying to protect you. I'm trying to protect them.<eos> The girls need an adult they can rely on, someone they feel they can trust and look up to.
We'd just like to know what the girls from Velvet Holdings supply you with.<eos> Don't try and put any stigma on me, lads.<eos> I could have an affair, be keeping a bird here, but I couldn't live with myself.<eos> This way, it's a business transaction.<eos> We all have a good time, they get paid, and I'm not betraying the wife.
I'm hoping to preserve as much evidentiary value as possible.<eos> Ah! Here it is. Ah...<eos> Perfect condition.<eos> Now, for Mr. Sutton's gun...<eos> Murdoch, you can fire as many pistols as you like, - but they won't do you any good now, will they?
But I asked if she inquired about it.<eos> All conversations with my patients, Detective -- Are strictly confidential.<eos> Dr. Tash, your elusiveness is becoming quite tiresome.<eos> I'm sorry, Detective, but that is the way it must be.<eos> Women come to me knowing they can seek medical attention without exposing themselves to the actions of the authorities.
And it also varies because of sunspots... which cause variation in the field.<eos> And all of these things means that it's relatively noisy... and yet it seems many animals... are able to make use of it to find their way.<eos> A training toss of homing pigeons... shows how animals may use the Sun... and the Earth's magnetic field to find their way home.<eos> Homing pigeons have been domesticated for years... for this ability to find their way home.<eos> They have been raised for generations... to be the athletes of the pigeon world.
Um, good!<eos> - Hot!<eos> - Don't go away from this pot!<eos> I imagined it was the same for the other girls as well.<eos> All of these girls were disappointed with the actual world and they believed in revolution as their final hope.
Uh, hey, come on.<eos> Pretty sharp, huh?<eos> No.<eos> Girls- - I'm telling you, are not into that flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.
Nice. Patrick?<eos> Everything that Bill said. Everything that Leonard said applies to me, too.<eos> But there are two other things.<eos> For me, huge pride in what we did, in what we put on the screen, the television screen and subsequently the movie screen.<eos> And in addition to that, to know that wherever I am in the world and whatever I'm doing, that there are eight people, and I can pick up the phone, and whatever is good or bad for me, they will be there, rock solid.
Eli is overreacting.<eos> We believe the creatures are the same as those Lieutenant Scott encountered on the desert planet.<eos> They must have followed us back through the gate.<eos> No, I doubt those things I saw were dangerous, sir.<eos> They helped me.
I just don't want wounded pride to paint us into a corner, that's all.<eos> Listen, let me tell you something about women, mate.<eos> The only reason they challenge you is so that you'll put them in their place.<eos> It's primal.<eos> They want you to master them.
Many of these creatures started their lives as part of the plankton before reaching adulthood and settling on the sea floor.<eos> These animals are giants.<eos> They filter the plankton-rich water, growing larger here than anywhere else in the world.<eos> Jellyfish gather, forming great swarms.<eos> They, too, eat the plankton, rising to the surface where it is at its most abundant.
It's only in the last five or six or seven years that the humpback population here in this area has increased, which is really encouraging.<eos> Look, you can see one way over there.<eos> It was good to see the whales return, but it posed an intriguing safety concern for Shane.<eos> I think it's extremely unlikely that you could get swallowed by a whale,<eos> but if there is a place, this is the place to do it because they're coming up, they're very motivated to get his ball of fish, and we're right there and we're just a little thing to a 30-ton whale.
What's wrong with that, huh? What...?<eos> I have nothing in common with these women.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> They all belong to a nice little book club, read Anne Rice novels.
- That's you.<eos> I mean...<eos> Not the...<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, I don't think they're womanish.
It's my job to provide peace for souls.<eos> But what I did was to place the souls inside a tool for revenge.<eos> You shouldn't feel so bad.<eos> Do you think those girls would have gone to heaven?<eos> They would have haunted the killers anyway.
They had to print continuously.<eos> Absolutely incredible!<eos> In 1970 he turned into documentary and released in cinemas followed by dozens bestseller sold and a growing legion of fans and supporters<eos> "Memories of the Future" was tremendously influential<eos> He told people what They wanted to believe
It is a wonderful way world view and try to uncover the mysteries of antiquity<eos> I think it was a catalyst for people like me speaking of mysteries, of the unusual and paranormal<eos> The paved the way for many of us to discuss these strange stories<eos> And it continues to grow and is going to be increasing<eos> People want answers questions they themselves fail to answer
One answer may be in the Nazca desert in Peru.<eos> There, in an area that extends for about 80 km many figures and patterns geometric decorate the landscape<eos> If you fly through this desert, some lines will<eos> These lines remind runways<eos> They begin and end abruptly
A vimana produces a light as that destroys the target with his strength<eos> It's like a Buck Rogers movie or Flash Gordon of the 30s are seen as science fiction raw<eos> People fly in ships calls spatial vimanas shooting each other aerial battles destroying entire towns<eos> And the funny thing is that all these stories are fully accepted in modern society of India<eos> I do not think we can say that these descriptions are just imagination because despite having been written thousands of years ago they correspond to stories current UFO sightings
The pictures are worth a thousand words.<eos> With absolute certainty<eos> , For example when viewing pictures in a cave in Italy which show two astronauts helmets which could then mean?<eos> Any of these ancient pictures or statues show people wearing strange clothes for the season and carrying accessories uncommon in the head<eos> But they really represent alien astronauts visitors from other worlds who sat on the ground thousands of years ago?
Everything has really tight parameters, and we try to keep as tight as control as possible, but it's -- it's a battle.<eos> My associate is really the green thumb In this enterprise.<eos> And I've noticed that when she's not around for a couple of days, the plants know it.<eos> I mean, I'm not making that up.<eos> They literally know it.
And I've noticed that when she's not around for a couple of days, the plants know it.<eos> I mean, I'm not making that up.<eos> They literally know it.<eos> I mean, I almost hear them whispering, "Where is she?"<eos> They don't do as well, you know, they don't seem as happy.
But what has grown is the European Union, the autonomous communities, the city halls...<eos> We have a structure of multi government levels in which no level is sovereign, nor can be again, so the idea of a sovereign Spanish state is obsolete, it will never exist again.<eos> Basically, the government centralism conceals economic interests.<eos> There is a power residing in Madrid and struggles to continue living there, to continue benefiting from its privileges.<eos> Slowly we find out that some investments in Madrid, like the airport, the T4, the Madrid subway, the M30... have such tremendous figures on their own that they equal investments in Catalonia over 2 or 3 years.
You're also incredibly sexual.<eos> So there. What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> I'm a total nerd.<eos> True that, but you're a sexy nerd.<eos> Some women, they just shut off that part of themselves and expect Prince Charming to come along and pry open their dusty old beavers with the jaws of life, or some shit.
I was thinking about what it might be like to go down on you for the first time.<eos> - It's kind of the same thing, isn't it?<eos> - You're such an asshole.<eos> ♪ Boys are boys and girls are joys<eos> ♪ To you and me they're more than toys ♪ Gonna find one, she won't be lonely
Ink.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Now what?<eos> The neutralizer failed because I think we're dealing with a bifurcated object.<eos> It's got at least two parts, and they're each dependent on the other.
Oh, God...<eos> This is a woman who, um... accepted her marriage for what it was, and pretended it was a great marriage without opening up her eyes.<eos> And I think, now, what we're going to start seeing is a woman who, for the first time in many, many years is feeling sexually liberated, but at what cost is that.<eos> It's always the good girls, isn't it?<eos> They're the ones with the deep dark secrets.
Dude, I'm sorry.<eos> You're really awesome, Kurt.<eos> I... I'm just under a load of crap right now.<eos> Girls.<eos> They're your problem.
How about baseball?<eos> No. We throw the baseball in spring.<eos> Thanksgiving we throw the football.<eos> Traditions matter, Kyle.<eos> Yes, they... Shape people.
Me too.<eos> I got some friends that are pretty hard up since that dry-cleaner pot club got shut down.<eos> What about this?<eos> You buy from me, and resell it to your friends.<eos> The more you buy from me and the more they buy from you the sooner you're gonna pay off those credit cards.
They don't care.<eos> That's the crucial thing you need to remember.<eos> Paying more doesn't bother them.<eos> It gives them peace of mind.<eos> If they wear something of value, that means that they in turn have value.
HANK: Okay. Your strategic plan.<eos> Let's hear it. So I read in the New England Journal of Medicine that 1 in 10 women, between the ages of 21 and 40, ignores a medical condition just to avoid going to the doctor.<eos> You read the New England Journal of Medicine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who doesn't? So, today, we are going to meet 10 women. They're going to ask us what we do for a living.
- Two years.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm gonna be the only man in the world with a complete collection of first generation Beanie toys.<eos> LOMAX I'll tell you something about those two bitches.<eos> They're not to be trusted. Yeah.
Moving into a shelter.<eos> Auntie Christina set it up.<eos> It's not forever.<eos> But while I'm gone, don't you give these nurses a hard time, okay?<eos> They love you almost as much as me.
- I'm not hungry.<eos> - You have to eat.<eos> Breakfast is the most important meal.<eos> {\pos(192,215)}If it's so important, why do you just drink coffee in the morning?<eos> {\pos(192,215)}Because... mommies are all grown up, and they can do what they want.
So nobody in Delta will tell me anything.<eos> Of course that's their official position on everything, including the weather.<eos> What are the other Delta wives saying?<eos> That their husbands aren't home either.<eos> {\pos(192,225)}At least that's what they're saying.
- we will repatriate them.<eos> - first class?<eos> - indeed.<eos> Or we will grant them residency in france,<eos> Whichever they prefer.
- Why? Why?<eos> - This is it, this is the last time.<eos> - Well, it might get ugly.<eos> It's important for them to know the truth.<eos> So when they're old enough to make decisions, they'll make the right ones.
Now, it's too late.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> I don't deserve to be a mother.<eos> Mrs. Dreyer, you are a mother.<eos> And those two girls, they deserve to have one.
He comes in with a cooler and doesn't order anything.<eos> I'm an illustrator.<eos> I'm a little low on money right now.<eos> - Ever see him with two women?<eos> - Yeah, they were nice.
- Because I'm broke.<eos> She's giving me an allowance.<eos> I can hardly pay for all the DVDs I've been buying.<eos> How much is she giving you?<eos> Well, more than the two girls, but they're four and six.
It takes a while for it to rise to toxic level in the human system.<eos> People should start getting sick any day now.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What does this have to do with the secret prisons?<eos> She thinks they're prisons?
- We gotta find him if he has the key.<eos> He is the key.<eos> MAN: Machines are all over him.<eos> Odds aren't good.<eos> BLAIR: They'll lead me to him.
The Mord-Sith gave me the opportunity to kill my tormentors.<eos> NATHAIR: You don't have to suffer these little beasts any longer, Cara.<eos> If you wanna get rid of them, all you have to do is kill them.<eos> I don't wanna kill anything.<eos> NATHAIR: Would you rather they kill you?
WOMAN: Kill her!<eos> We trusted her with our children.<eos> Monster. Guards, subdue him.<eos> How many children have you taken from this town?<eos> Twelve girls have gone missing over the years, and they were all her students.
He seemed really sad to call it off. Right when things were best, I thought he was the one. I had that accident.<eos> More... Except for the parts where his girlfriends almost die.<eos> They're releasing my brother, no thanks to you. Actually, all thanks to me. I'm the one that lined up his alibi with the timeline of the crime.<eos> And I am the one that got him arrested in the first place. That last one didn't play. Just scratch the last one, okay?<eos> We spoke to your other girlfriends. And we have concluded that they were all kind of hot. That's true.
is that what you're saying?<eos> no.<eos> no,that's my fault.<eos> that's my fault.<eos> so,i took a leave from the job,holed up at home, case of vodka and a promise: either i finish these bottles or they finish me.
No.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not dodging your questions.<eos> Ok.<eos> So the girls who go to these parties, right, are they... do they lie about their age, or are they on about it?
But you're a dude.<eos> Look at the match-Up.<eos> Do you see women playing football.<eos> Because they cannot.<eos> They don't for a reason.
I know, dear.<eos> Oh, Grams.<eos> Logan?<eos> Logan?<eos> People are supposed to be who they say they are, and not lie or hide their true selves.
So you had some hallucination about having sex with her.<eos> I don't think we need to talk...<eos> I mean, I imagine having sex with women all the time.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Though I guess if they knew what I imagined, it could get awkward.
Danny Bolen had attacked Julie.<eos> You treated her like a witness.<eos> Now you need to treat her like a suspect.<eos> Look, miss, we're not trying to dismiss your concerns,<eos> But women don't commit this kind of crime. They tend to keep at a physical remove
Good night, pal.<eos> And don't worry about tomorrow morning.<eos> Why would I need to worry about tomorrow morning?<eos> There are some scary people here.<eos> They all know you're a cop.
The practice of anonymity, of not naming the babies was meant to help with the adoption process.<eos> And what happened to them if they weren't adopted?<eos> The poor souls lived out their lives at the convent.<eos> A terrible chapter.<eos> So they split them up.
Oh, Stewie and Brian, you're just in time for pie.<eos> Did somebody say pie?<eos> It's a wonderful day for pie<eos> You can ask all the birds in the sky<eos> And they'll tell you real sweet With a musical tweet
All right, let's go.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> These ladies are mean.<eos> They think you're stupid.
So maybe in antiquity, there was a star that was considerably brighter than it is now, but it has faded since then, so now there are only six easily visible stars.<eos> There are actually hundreds of stars in the Pleiades, perhaps up to a thousand.<eos> We circle the Pleiades in search of clues that can reveal the secrets of the universe, because clusters hold the key to understanding how stars are born, how they live and die, the secrets of creation.<eos> Like all clusters, we see that the stars in the Pleiades are so close to each other, they are all virtually the same distance from Earth.<eos> Of course, the stars in a cluster are not all exactly at the same distance from us, but they're so far away that the slight differences in distance are really pretty small. They're inconsequential.
Thousands of other stars have formed or are in the process of forming, but as it's happening, scientists believe the cluster is imposing a kind of birth control on the whole cycle.<eos> Only about 10% of the mass of a cloud which will form stars actually become stars.<eos> So why is it that so little of the matter in a cloud actually turns into stars?<eos> What we've come to believe now is that there may be a feedback process.<eos> So once you form stars, they feed back on the cloud, acting like a thermostat and actually limiting the amount of star formation that can form.
Hey, listen, Pops.<eos> We want you to stick close, all right?<eos> I don't want you disappearing into one of those women.<eos> They seem quite happy.<eos> Obviously, they haven't seen their blood sugar levels.
No, angela , I 'll pay .<eos> I'll pay the best doctors to treat disease that will strike you .<eos> Why do diseases come . Guys, we must not hide it .<eos> Butwewillbeintwoto curethem your diseases .<eos> And even if they will to have won over you , you will not have tèmerle never , never!
Garcia: he's had a smattering of visits, A couple of whack jobs contact him, But nothing as direct as this admirer person.<eos> Jj: how are we doing on the prints on the picture?<eos> Oh. i'm still running them.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Military families, they always fear the worst.
Until a sound is heard.<eos> What was that?<eos> Captain, look!<eos> The whales are taking out the crab fishermen reality show.<eos> It's like they know.

We both have our secrets, Bun.<eos> I'll keep yours... if you keep mine.<eos> You are never gonna get what you want.<eos> Those girls are too smart!<eos> They'll see through you!
I know.<eos> You were like this as a child, too.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When you were little... up to almost six years old, you would tell your dad and me stories about what was going to happen... Sometimes in great detail.<eos> And then they would happen exactly as you described them.
There are collaborative ways of working and doing things which deliver the public service outcome far better than the old model.<eos> People will increasingly expect... to be able to make choices to be able to express themselves, to stand up and be counted in more than just a number, a vote or a tick.<eos> So how will governments relate to people who are more empowered?<eos> If you look at how public services work currently, it's very much a kind of... they're built on a model of each of us being passive consumers.<eos> So actually we're beginning to understand that public services need to start not with problems and needs but instead with people and what they can bring.
It's a metropolis, a home to millions of ants.<eos> The colony needs a huge supply of food.<eos> It's surrounded by grass.<eos> But the ants themselves can't digest a blade of it.<eos> Nonetheless, they collect it.
Yet down here on the forest floor is one of the hardest places imaginable for a young plant to begin its life.<eos> The canopy above is so thick that only a little sunlight can filter through.<eos> For this sapling, too little light means death.<eos> But plants on the forest floor need not be passive.<eos> If the light won't come to them, they can go to the light.
Because there were people waiting behind us.<eos> I didn't want to delay other people's time.<eos> So what if we let 'em wait.<eos> Do you know how long it took me to earn them?<eos> Can't they wait just a little bit.
You will rarely see a couple with now three children, very rarely. At the root of it all is education.<eos> Thanks to a long tradition of compulsory schooling for boys and girls, Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in the world.<eos> Even too-young children are coming to school.<eos> See, they are carrying bags bigger than them.<eos> Where women are well-educated, they tend to choose to have smaller families.
For example, today in Kerala average woman marries at the age of 28.<eos> Whereas a state like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, the girl marries at the age of 18.<eos> So, at 28, these women in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have already four children, where Kerala girl is even not married.<eos> ALL: One. What Kerala shows is that you don't need aggressive policies or government incentives for birth rates to fall.<eos> Everywhere in the world where women have access to education, and have the freedom to run their own lives, on the whole, they and their partners have been choosing to have smaller families than their parents did.
Woman never takes back a man who has walked away.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> They're afraid to lose their fantasy.<eos> All women want is that single sweet moment.<eos> And they cherish that moment within their own fantasy.
Maybe girls like me just don't belong in music videos.<eos> You know, if that's the look that they want, they should just grab one of those annoying little girls hanging on Curtis.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Those girls are a dime a dozen.<eos> That is why you are in this band and they are not.
I feel like I let the cat out of the bag.<eos> It was going to be a surprise, but Sam got you a ticket as well.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. I...<eos> It's a party for the 20 most beautiful women in the city, but if we're all being honest, they can't hold a candle to you.
No, no, I'm celebrating -- kicked my old lady out.<eos> Women -- they're nothing but trouble.<eos> She Cambodian?<eos> No.<eos> They are the worst.
Check for enemies on the island. You and your girlfriend stay here and repair the damage to the plane.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> - We do not need security.<eos> My girls have received the same training as the male pilots.<eos> They can take care of themselves.
I wanna know if this thing was a... dinky little homemade soap box or if it was a full-fledged AI platform capable of learning and growing and taking on other applications.<eos> It plays chess.<eos> So did Einstein.<eos> Have you ever heard of the singularity?<eos> It's a point in time where machines become so smart that they're capable of making even making smarter versions of themselves without our help.
Do you need a time-out?<eos> I think you do.<eos> Wait till practice, Lo.<eos> You know, it's cool of your parents just to let us hang like this.<eos> They trust me.
Breath, skin lips.<eos> I-if it touches me, it's... it's like glass shattering in my stomach.<eos> So you can't touch a woman at all?<eos> [ Laughs ] Not with my bare hands.<eos> You know, it's not that I hate women, it's they end up usually hating me.
Regardless of what people think of Barry Bonds, you can't take a bottle of testosterone, put on Barry's baseball uniform and make him hit 700 home runs.<eos> Barry's got to go out, train and hit the 700 home runs.<eos> But what if the scientists came up with something better than anabolic steroids?<eos> You see cows, you see immense, powerful cows, And they basically have changed their genes.<eos> If they can change your genes, would that be illegal?
I just want to be a part of something.<eos> It doesn't have to be big... and it doesn't have to be grand.<eos> But I'll tell you something about -- women like Laura.<eos> It...<eos> They're just, they're just all about sex.
- Who's that next to Leibnitz?<eos> - His noble mother. - Our little prince.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> Women don't get horny until they're 30.<eos> They get their kicks by wielding power over men and only enjoy sex when they start to wilt.
No, sir, she completely saw it coming, they all saw it coming.<eos> Neuromuscular blockers paralyze the muscles temporarily while you remain very much awake.<eos> He sedates them, then quickly engineers their suicide.<eos> Well, if that's true, it means this unsub's not looking for the glory of the kill.<eos> No, but unfortunately for his victims, they're wide awake when he decides it's time for them to move on.
Low-grade varnish would damage the basswood.<eos> I wouldn't dream of using the stuff.<eos> Then, how is it your father came to be poisoned by cheap varnish?<eos> We've taken very careful note of your father's injuries.<eos> They are not consistent with poisoning by shellac.
Idon'tthinkyou can playthis game withoutchangingasaperson .<eos> I mean, i've seen so much in so few days that i've never, ever seen in my life.<eos> I've seen these women here and they are vicious. They are cutthroat.<eos> They are very trough, and there's a lot of strength in that.<eos> It's opened my eyes a little bit about the way that women are And the way that they operate.
This is for you.<eos> So.<eos> Tell me, what about your companions?<eos> They all seem at ease here.<eos> Anything that you've seen or that they've mentioned...
Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with.<eos> And for the past five years,<eos> I've had no regrets.<eos> Ted, you're staring at my boobs.<eos> In my defense, they were staring at me.
I know it sounds absurd.<eos> But I knew he was going to kill a doctor, and now he has.<eos> And I've seen other deaths, too.<eos> These other deaths, tell me about them.<eos> They...
But I knew he was going to kill a doctor, and now he has.<eos> And I've seen other deaths, too.<eos> These other deaths, tell me about them.<eos> They...<eos> They happen at night.
If the changeling is dead, Mr. Gilpatrick, where is Maggie?<eos> She'll soon be released.<eos> - Released from...<eos> - From the fairies.<eos> They'll be bringing her home soon.
That's how you do that.<eos> I'm, uh, leaving my apartment,<eos> Dropping out of society altogether.<eos> Except for my bon appit magazines.<eos> They're what keep me sane.
NO.<eos> NO.<eos> OH, SO NAIVE.<eos> CHICKS DO NOT WANT SENSITIVE, OK?<eos> THEY WANT A BAD BOY.
NO.<eos> OH, SO NAIVE.<eos> CHICKS DO NOT WANT SENSITIVE, OK?<eos> THEY WANT A BAD BOY.<eos> THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA BREAK ALL THE RULES,
Now let the women go.<eos> And why should I do that?<eos> - They've all defied Lord Rahl.<eos> Please.<eos> They were only trying to protect me.
It was always a marvel to me, to see how two young women who seemed so similar could be so different.<eos> Anne and Mary, we'll miss you terribly.<eos> - Whenever I would see the girls pass by my office before morning meeting, they always had a smile on their face, and they would always wave.<eos> I'm gonna miss them.<eos> They were a bright spot in the day and in the week for me.
Gary, we both agreed to follow Dr Krandall rules, because it was the best for the kids.<eos> - They are doing great.<eos> - Really?<eos> Have you noticed that Tommy is scared to death of girls?<eos> He should be affraid of girls, they pretend to like you, and then they take all your stuff.
The silkworm.<eos> Silk moths lay several hundred eggs, and the tiny caterpillars that emerge eat nothing but mulberry leaves.<eos> After 50 days of gluttony they've grown 10,000 times heavier.<eos> By this stage, 25% of their body mass is made up of silk glands.<eos> In the process of turning into adult moths, they spin a cocoon from a single strand of silk which can be over 1,000 metres long.
Say what you like, Professor Words.<eos> Thanks to you, we're gonna be drowning in babes.<eos> I just want the night to be a success.<eos> I've no interest in babes.<eos> That's handy, cos they've got no interest in you.
- Are they kissing?<eos> - Let me see.<eos> Please be lesbo.<eos> Fit enough.<eos> I told you there was fit birds, and there's plenty more where they came from.
I do!<eos> That was problem.<eos> I love you so much, I could not stand to lieto you about my past.<eos> It was torture to me,you know.<eos> These other girls,they--they are nothing compared to you.
It was only off by about a millionth of an inch, which is about 1/50 the diameter of a human hair.<eos> It was absolutely shocking when a couple of people who are optics experts came forward and said, "You can't correct it.<eos> There's nothing you can do about it."<eos> There's a significant spherical aberration appears to be present in the optics -- in the optical telescope.<eos> You grieve for the fact that, you know, the possibilities and they're gone.
Now, as this charcoal is burning, the fuel is getting used up... and you can actually see that.<eos> It's turning into a gray color.<eos> It's turning into ashes.<eos> ln a similarway, stars use up theirfuel.<eos> They fuse hydrogen into helium, and so, with time... there's less and less hydrogen to fuse.
See, your loveline's broken up, which means you haven't found your soul mate yet.<eos> - Well, that's true.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's really amazing.<eos> You see it in these couples that are together forever. The lines on their palms change, so they--they become mirror images of each other.
They tried to save his life.<eos> That's who I want to be, you know?<eos> An aging princess?<eos> They've been with the same men for years, and they're happy.<eos> They did it. I can do it.
Oh, don't mind Chris.<eos> He's our massage therapist.<eos> Your... Uh, what?<eos> Our Hands do such delicate work,<eos> It's important that they stay healthy.
Good with women?<eos> You mean good at women?<eos> Like, you can't catch them when they run away from you?<eos> Bro, it's 1776.<eos> They don't have any rights.
Wow, wow, OK. *****<eos> **** ******* stop, stop!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Don't look at me. The girls have officially gone wild. What are you doing?<eos> They tried to poison me!
You'll take me hunting?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll turn you into a real Inuk.<eos> Will your daughters laugh at me because I don't know anything?<eos> No, they're nice.
.<eos> Yes.<eos> We recognize the snail because it looks like a snail.<eos> But look at these shells.<eos> They all look alike, but if you look closer you'll see each is different.
I'll see you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I mean, I'm a soldier, I'm taught that I can handle anything.<eos> The drugs, they helped at first, but then they started to take over.<eos> And I didn't know where I stopped and they began.
From who?<eos> Your two little friends?<eos> It's all over school this morning, that the two of them disappeared.<eos> Your friends are liars, you know.<eos> They're the ones who started all the rumors about you.
Just ask those guys for directions.<eos> Hmm. Anti-nuclear activist Dr. Helen Caldicott?<eos> Director Julie Taymor?<eos> Do you love these women?<eos> They're okay, I guess.
I love Miss Bennet still.<eos> But she is no longer Miss Bennet.<eos> She is now Mrs Collins.<eos> (GASPS) On your departure, my daughters may seek to engage you in conversation.<eos> I would prefer it if they weren't successful.
Another!<eos> Take evasive action!<eos> Those gas-gulpers are huge!<eos> Don't shoot, or they'll panic!<eos> They'll panic?
"But Tess,<eos> "I say between ourselves, quite private, but very strong,<eos> "that on no account, "do you say a word about your bygone trouble.<eos> "Many a woman, some the highest in the land,<eos> "have had a trouble in their time, "and why should you trumpet yours when they don't trumpet theirs?
It's sick.<eos> And if I... If I did anything...<eos> What?<eos> What would happen?<eos> They would become what I am.
We were all keen to begin new, independent lives in this new Eden.<eos> What did we find?<eos> Swamp, as far as the eye could see.<eos> Crops wouldn't grow, the animals died... ..food began to run out... ..and then the fever started.<eos> I saw mothers... trudging along with infants in their arms and the fever would take the child, and they would dig a hole with their bare hands, bury the child... ..say a prayer... ..and trudge on.
They're coming up the stairs.<eos> Abort mission, abort mission!<eos> That was my first time speed dating, too.<eos> I was pretty nervous about it.<eos> All my friends are so outgoing, they do all the talking and I have a hard time meeting guys.
It's this election.<eos> It's gonna be my senior year and my last chance to make a diference in the house.<eos> And the polls are saying Frannie won back a lot of votes after her little concert.<eos> - You guys have polls?<eos> - Ashleigh. It's crazy. They don't even care that she lied about her past.
No one here is worthless.<eos> A very smart man once told me that mutants are not cursed, but gifted.<eos> Now, tell me, what are your gifts?<eos> I understand machines.<eos> I mean, I can talk to them and they listen.
Well, 'cause we're truth-telling, um...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I take women as they come to me. Oh, that's --
Let's swap, you two stuff envelopes,<eos> Ossi and Robby paste stamps.<eos> Right in here.<eos> We call ourselves Co-operative 180, in honor of the Basaglia Law, which frees the crazy.<eos> If their families take them back, they go crazy too but if they don't take them back, where do they go?
Which problem?<eos> You respect them too much.<eos> You treat them like angels, like flowers.<eos> And that's not how it works.<eos> I know about women. They need someone to show them.
I don't believe it!<eos> THEY LAUGH<eos> This is the worst arrival at a place, ever made by anyone, James.<eos> The fact is though, it was an arrival. Our little bikes had made it.<eos> Oh, sure, there'd been breakdowns, accidents and squabbles, but through the rain, the draining humidity, the mad traffic and the tricky roads, they'd brought us 1,000 miles.
But all along I've never had the courage to treat her like a good friend.<eos> Huh?<eos> It's because I hid a lot from her.<eos> I didn't even dare to divulge where I was staying to her.<eos> Good friends should be honest with each other, shouldn't they?
Researchers have gotten around this requirement... in the tight confines of a space far away... by using the cool light-emitting diodes... or LEDs, shaded to the colors of the spectrum... that stimulate plant growth.<eos> While Mars' sunshine is fine for plants... whose sole purpose is to produce oxygen... these types of growth chambers provide food for the colony.<eos> Another concern to plague the colonists-- on Earth, insects pollinate plants.<eos> Does that mean that we'll be taking bugs with us into space?<eos> It's actually really difficult for bees to navigate... under conditions that are not found on Earth... because they use the UV light from the Sun to navigate... and they use a lot of other cues... and we wouldn't have those same cues on Mars... or in a space colony.
We've seen some strange sights, but this is a masterpiece<eos> A giant horse's head rearing up in space<eos> Stars are born, grow up and then..<eos> then what?<eos> Did they die?
The bag works best ... there when things have become quite spiritual ... when they became immaterial.<eos> A day in the stock market begins ... a floor newly polished, polished ... and, for example, after a crash market ... or after a hard day, left behind mountains of garbage ... stacks of telegrams, etc. pieces of paper.<eos> They are the waste of a day on the stock exchange.<eos> The best case is that which presents a free forum, free things ... where things became communications abbreviated ... called objects, or graphics of quotation etc.<eos> It means that the building stock, particularly as this economic center ... is more closely interconnected with things when they ... do not appear in the bag, but on its margins.
If a patient comes for instance not only with cancer but with high blood pressure, and or diabetes and maybe fibromyalgia and other pains and so on all the problems disappear.<eos> You can't heal one disease and keep two others; it's impossible.<eos> When the body heals, it heals everything.<eos> You nourish the body and then the body fixes it.<eos> When people take vitamins, the vitamins don't specifically do it they enable the body to do it, they enable the body to heal itself.
That's what happened every month.<eos> Too great a build-up could lead to so called suffocation of the uterus, making it difficult for her to breathe and exposing her to convulsions and fainting fits.<eos> She might even go mad.<eos> No wonder women were predatory.<eos> They needed sex to get rid of all that menstrual blood.
Was it an emotional pressure valve, releasing some of the repressed sexual energy of the age?<eos> Was it a natural development from religious love, as the aristocracy refined their emotional manners?<eos> Nobody knows for sure.<eos> But the core ideas of courtly love infiltrated the wider medieval culture.<eos> And as they did, they caused scandal, even violence.
Ben-Gurion did not want the Arabs to leave the country.<eos> When we spoke to President Peres of Jerusalem, he said that Israel bears no responsibility whatsoever for the exodus of Palestinians.<eos> No responsibility whatsoever? !<eos> Then what caused the exodus to happen?<eos> It was the Israeli massacre of villagers, of people whom they encountered.
'Later, they covered them with clothes and poured petrol, and set them on fire.<eos> 'There was a woman dressed in peasant clothes.<eos> 'Next to her were two little girls.<eos> 'We carried them, and put them over there.<eos> 'They were the only ones who had a proper burial. '
It was this idea of a single point of creation that caused the big debate between the Big Bang believers and people like Fred Hoyle, who were adamant that the universe is in a steady state.<eos> In Hoyle's universe, there was no point of creation, and all matter hadn't been produced at one moment in the past.<eos> In fact, he believed new matter was forming all the time.<eos> As you probably know, there are two forms of cosmology, what has been spoken of as the Big Bang and the Steady State.<eos> There are actually many Big Bang cosmologies and they all have the property that the universe is supposed to have started at a particular moment.
I love Fall Out Boy!<eos> We know.<eos> You're just trying to get me to go 'cause you want a ride.<eos> Dude, have you seen the dancers on T.I.'s tour?<eos> I hear they're gonna be foxy boxing.
You're so blessed.<eos> Makes me wanna have another one myself.<eos> Orson, you better take Benjamin to the other room Before my friends run out of lies. Ah.<eos> No.<eos> They don't appreciate a healthy pair of lungs, that's all, huh?
How do you expect to become men if you never do anything hard?<eos> Simple.<eos> We'll get safe, easy jobs.<eos> And we'll keep quiet, so we don't ruffle any feathers.<eos> Eventually, our female friends will realize we're the best they're going to do, and they'll browbeat us into marrying them.
You were aware, however, that ms. Jackson has, in fact, engaged in prostitution?<eos> No, i wasn't.<eos> Your mother... is nothing sacred with her?<eos> Sara is a hardworking single mother who's made a lot of sacrifices for her son... 'cause that's what mothers do.<eos> They care for their children... even when it seems like they don't care for us.
I just... I just spend my time here waiting.<eos> For what?<eos> For time to pass, I guess...<eos> But if I hadn't experienced the shaved ice that day, I don't think Kouji and I would be here now.<eos> Kouji likes to bury important things. But then he forgets what they are.
Experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement.<eos> Maggie, honey, this is for your own good.<eos> Growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy.<eos> It's true. I've given up everything but raisins.<eos> And the doctor says they're killing me.
Maggie, honey, this is for your own good.<eos> Growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy.<eos> It's true. I've given up everything but raisins.<eos> And the doctor says they're killing me.<eos> Sweet, plump coffin nails is what they are.
We are not the terrorists.<eos> Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick?<eos> Because that's what you're doing.<eos> I celebrate these women.<eos> They deserve the right to dress as they please.
It's about water.<eos> All right, so this woman died on a ferry 2 years ago, or maybe she didn't, maybe she doesn't know how she died, and you have to tell her, I don't know.<eos> It sounds simple to me, whatever.<eos> Yeah, but what about the visions of impending death?<eos> You think they all refer to Delia?
Of course you do.<eos> The key to any good relationship is lying.<eos> You tell her she's the only one you find attractive, the only girl you want to sleep with, the only one you really want to spend time with, all kinds of garbage they can't possibly believe.<eos> Women count on us to lie to them.<eos> How else can they convince themselves that they still look young if we don't help?
Gavin's closely watched murder trial ended moments ago when the jury handed down a not-guilty verdict, a result influenced in no small part by the very vocal support gavin received from the mothers against drunk driving.<eos> - Mr. Gavin, how do you feel?<eos> - I feel great!<eos> I want to thank the girls from mothers against drunk driving.<eos> They do nice work, and the first thing I'm gonna do today is raise a glass in their honor.
No way!<eos> Luke, he's been nabbed by a nun.<eos> SARAH JANE: Are you really protecting a Gorgon here?<eos> A creature with writhing serpents for hair?<eos> The sisters, they protect her.
I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Well, I'm right here.<eos> You're not going to use these lovely ladies as an excuse to avoid that gondola ride, are you, sport?<eos> No, Dad.<eos> They're going to come, too.
You're a hair model.<eos> Well,models sleep.<eos> They don't eat.<eos> Not hair models.<eos> They eat,not sleep.
Thank You<eos> These women not seem as aggressive as the other Is it music?<eos> No.<eos> It is not really Therapy that makes the difference, is his childhood<eos> They have had a small family have been met, have been cared for, loved
Maybe our signals just got crossed.<eos> No, no, not at all.<eos> That's...<eos> That's kind of what i'm trying to say is that they...<eos> They weren't crossed.
- it just gets worse.<eos> - i'm sorry. don't quite- you'll always use your dessert fork for your entrée.<eos> you'll always feel underdressed, no matter what you wear, and at dinner parties, it will be as if there's a language that sounds like english, and you think you speak it, but they don't hear you, and you don't understand them.<eos> as time passes, you'll feel that people never see you when they look at you but wonder really whether you're serena's whim or her... charity case, until the day comes when you realize that girls like serena don't end up with dan humphrey.<eos> they end up with the carters of the world, and, um, people like you-- they turn into cocktail party anecdotes of their foolish youth.
Something bigger than you or any of us.<eos> The challenge is that you have absolutely no control over it.<eos> So what should I do?<eos> The cards don't predict the future.<eos> They only illuminate.
Those are beestings. How'd you get stung by so many bees?<eos> And what happened to the bees that stung you?<eos> That's a suicide attack.<eos> Not in this case.<eos> They, uh, sort of stung me, died, then they flew away again, and some other bees died.
He's been here at least 18 hours.<eos> Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose,eat the brains?<eos> I would.<eos> Protein.<eos> Ants are scavengers; they tend to stay on the surface.
I would.<eos> Protein.<eos> Ants are scavengers; they tend to stay on the surface.<eos> You think dead skin tastes better than brains?<eos> Well,they will go for brains late in decomp,after all the skin is gone.
This is my seventh time hunting Voracious Eaters. I'm Helen, my number is Twenty-Two.<eos> I don't have any experience hunting Voracious Eaters. My name is Deneve,<eos> Number Fifteen.<eos> I've had two experiences.<eos> They had ranks?
The world's smallest compasses?<eos> Capacitors store electrical charges on circuit boards.<eos> And that charge means there's also a magnetic field there.<eos> Like lighthouses sending out a beacon to these things.<eos> They follow the beacon back to the lighthouse...
Sunlight:<eos> it's so central to life that we don't often give it a second taught.<eos> But how light gets from there, to here turns out to be an incredible story.<eos> The energy created in the fusion process is carried out of the core by particles of light and heat called photons.<eos> They are what bring the warming race of the Sun to Earth.
No earthly Frisbee thrower can match Jupiter's flinging force.<eos> It is much faster than any bullet ever known.<eos> It rejects things at a rate of 30 miles per second.<eos> Jupiter's wonders are hard to fathom.<eos> They've captivated men for centuries.
Scientists are only beginning to understand what they are and where they come from.<eos> There is a massive eastward flow of material and that means... the material's flowing more than one and a half football fields per second.<eos> That's really moving, you don't want to be in that.<eos> 29 other belts and zones of varying width extend outwards from there.<eos> They are what give Jupiter its characteristic appearance.
Anyway,uh,I was wondering if you could give eddie some advice about working with someone he can't stand.<eos> I talk,and I talk,and I - Until I'm blue in the face. They just - they don't listen.<eos> You don't win a game on game day.<eos> You win in practice the week before.<eos> But you know,they have homework and boyfriends and girlfriends who look like boyfriends.
That you don't know.<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> Did you know that when we sleep we get closer to the stars?<eos> They live in another time.
These women have been terrorized.<eos> Now you want to violate them as well?<eos> Look.<eos> I'm just trying to do my job.<eos> I mean, this guy could do this again, and I would hate to lose evidence because they went home and they took a shower.
And it makes me sick.<eos> Were you sleeping with Melissa Kovak?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I would never exploit my relationship with these women.<eos> They trust me.
I see.<eos> - A manifesto.<eos> - No.<eos> An attack.<eos> It's a pity, they're so beautiful.
- A manifesto.<eos> - No.<eos> An attack.<eos> It's a pity, they're so beautiful.<eos> They... they really moved me, provoked me.
- No.<eos> An attack.<eos> It's a pity, they're so beautiful.<eos> They... they really moved me, provoked me.<eos> They have something that comes...
- I know... but I like your work. What's the problem?<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> But it's important that you go to the show.<eos> Is there a choice?<eos> It would be shame to miss the photos... and what they mean.
Just a tube going round and round.<eos> That's where you put the bullet in.<eos> This gun is more powemul than anything.<eos> That could definitely kill a fairy.<eos> No, it can't, cos fairies are magical and they'd kill you before you kill them.
Final trial, it's sand again.<eos> Well, you got one right out of 6 which is what we would expect by chance.<eos> So far, they're performing pretty much in line with mean chance expectation, in other words, guess work.<eos> So no one has scored more than 2 hits out of 6.<eos> The people you've been testing, do they understand why they're being put through the double-blind procedure?
Steve Fuller is, of course right, that the internet is revolutionizing how we use and consume information.<eos> But the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced, uncorroborated assertion.<eos> Wikipedia world presents both great opportunity and huge danger.<eos> Paranoid conspiracy theories circulate unchallenged.<eos> Sometimes they're relatively harmless like the rumor that NASA faked the moon landings..
Please make all your requests through Bridget.<eos> Of course.<eos> Peggy, I know you a little.<eos> Remember, just because you now have a door, don't forget that once you didn't.<eos> Think of the other girls, or they won't think of you.
Sort of.<eos> That new piece just isn't right.<eos> You didn't have to kill them just because they found out!<eos> It is considered a taboo to say that Yuki Aoyama didn't do those paintings.<eos> They deserved to die!
Can I count on you tonight?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'll let you know about the time.<eos> Items were charged to Holck's bank account. They were gifts for Nanna.
History repeats itself. 2000 years ago all roads led to Rome.<eos> Rome constructed and maintained more than 10 thousand miles of roads - throughout its empire.<eos> The roads were used to project Roman military power, - to control commerce and to bind the nations and peoples they ruled.<eos> Rome also demanded tribute. Roman subjects from Albion's to JudУзa - were forced to pay a tax to use the roads. The Romans would then use the - tax to dominate their subjects.<eos> Today's superhighways are a powerful tool - in the globalis arsonal. They are instrumental in tearing down nation - borders and merging Nation States into larger confederations.
That is a very nice DVD player.<eos> My mom wouldn't let me bring it on the bus when I left.<eos> We got in a huge fight.<eos> I left without kissing her good-bye.<eos> You know the great thing about moms is that whatever you do or say, they always forgive you.
Could be a long night.<eos> Not just for you, Director.<eos> I lifted Brian Taylor's prints off his computer and his files.<eos> AFIS got another hit.<eos> They were all over a Beretta used in an unsolved shooting in May of '98.
Will you excuse me a moment?<eos> Miss Matty, you have sat long enough alone.<eos> I think it's sensible to seek out your friends.<eos> We must still conceal my misfortune from them.<eos> They would want to know, so that they might console you.
It was a one piece swimsuit.<eos> Some girls would try a small bikini...<eos> Those were not bikinis, those were two-piece suits.<eos> I never wore that myself, cause I didn't have the right body.<eos> But they wore two pieces and it got smaller and smaller. Now it's nothing, isn't it?
Like you're saying, I don't want -<eos> I don't want a child to die or anything.<eos> Underneath it all, in your subconscious-- It's just like, if you're in a relationship and it's a really bad relationship.<eos> You know, people even allow themselves to get beaten in relationships.<eos> So they're being beaten in this relationship, and they say to themselves, -
This gonna be...<eos> If you gonna get tougher<eos> Because this gonna be "bupkus" for you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Girls, they...
Those stairs... up and down those stairs will kill me.<eos> Uh, I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of old age.<eos> So... I doubt I will be coming here so often.<eos> Why are you so successful with women?<eos> Um... because they see in me someone... guilty.
Thanks for the dictaphone.<eos> It's weird telling my life story.<eos> I've just started. It may be really dull.<eos> When I'm done, Adrien'll give you the tapes.<eos> They're all yours. That way, I'll have left something behind.
I didn't have the heart to mention it as a problem.<eos> They went to see . Doreen's sister, Ellen, and her girls in Boston .and they took Spider because . I had to work and they didn't trust me to feed her.<eos> But that was a joke, right?<eos> And then .we were all going to D.T.'s little cousin's wedding .in Los Angeles, and I was gonna meet them out there.<eos> The kids wanted to go to Disneyland .but they had... They were already gonna miss a couple days of school .so we had to say no.
You're beautiful just the way you are, Jasira.<eos> Those other girls are just jealous because you're growing up faster than they are and you're prettier than they are.
Are you sick or are you high?<eos> Forget it.<eos> It doesn't even matter.<eos> If you don't take care of yourself, you're gonna end up in the hospital again.<eos> I'm taking my meds, I'm just... they just... they make me sleepy is all.
Study?<eos> Study tits?<eos> No<eos> Cut it out. You're scaring him<eos> They're scary, my tits are
Have you not wept?<eos> Can it be that his death has not moved you to even one tear?<eos> It hurts, believe me, to see you unmoved by the loss of a devoted lover, as if he were a stranger.<eos> Yes, Lycidas. I grieve for your brother but not his love.<eos> It was shared by so many other girls, they must be as sad as I.
Please, stay here.<eos> What was that about a freeloader?<eos> - I'm not like that.<eos> You always have to prove something.<eos> I cuddle up to women and they cuddle up to me.
Lots of people are unhappy, you know, and... I'm unhappy.<eos> So...<eos> Why are you unhappy?<eos> Well... my children don't really need me.<eos> I don't think I'm the mother they wanted.
-She's out on a private call.<eos> -But I can get one of our other girls to... -Can you tell me where she is?<eos> I just said she's out on a private...<eos> Yeah, I know, I heard that, but it's important.<eos> Bitches, they come, they go.
Willa, what's going on?<eos> Adam, could you please take Lily for a walk?<eos> And the rest of us will re-fix breakfast.<eos> I'm ashamed enough for both of you.<eos> I knew both your mamas, and they expected better.
But why?<eos> What is so great about this world?<eos> These women... so tough by day.<eos> At night, with me... they were vulnerable.<eos> They responded to me, need me.
- A quick dram?<eos> Sure!<eos> That's the spirit!<eos> You'll have to round the hens up.<eos> In time, they'll find their own way.
And if you're on a budget, Dooney and Bourke.<eos> Every time her bag passes off as the real thing when her friends pay through the nose on Rodeo Drive...<eos> -...she wins.<eos> -It's the thrill of the kill.<eos> Are they hearing themselves?
Ah, Maggy!<eos> Talking about time... did you know that Franklin invented a time machine?<eos> Another one?<eos> He invents a time machine every week!<eos> And they never seem to work!
Given the proximity delivery ... well ... I see that Michael is worried.<eos> And if things go wrong talk much with others.<eos> In general, the reaction is obvious: the real danger is not the nature, but the hospital and all the technological interventions.<eos> Women have always Condo light.<eos> They got that strength.
Surely David was furious that Hugh had nicked his wife?<eos> No, I don't believe so.<eos> They seem to have come to some kind of arrangement.<eos> David sees the children whenever he wants.<eos> They don't know that he's their father, but it works somehow.
Join things back together.<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> Yes, I have. So have you. She came to the practice.<eos> One of Rachel's lost souls.<eos> They turn up there now and again.
So I'm here, but I'm not. Get it?<eos> Gus, what's the word?<eos> That'd be mum.<eos> Doreen was pledging a sorority. And I, or, Mary Lou, am helping my sisters through this very difficult time.<eos> I'm convinced they know more than they're letting on.
You know, if word gets out, this could be a pretty popular teen sport.<eos> Except these girls are clueless, because it's not spells that are bringing down cheerleaders.<eos> - But why would Tais want to hurt her friends?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe she thinks they're responsible for her death.
Jackie, everybody has to feel their feelings, no matter how much it hurts.<eos> I feel them, all right.<eos> I just don't talk about them.<eos> And I guess I expected the same thing with these girls, you know, for them to just suck it up and go on.<eos> I told them Tais was the heart of the team and they were the soul.
I'm going to go.<eos> Kirsten,I'm sorry.<eos> It was the only way I could think to get you to spend the day with me.<eos> So you told all those women they have chlamydia when they don't? They might.<eos> They did have sex with male hookers.
- Is it your mom?<eos> We won't start until she gets here.<eos> I didn't fall from the top of the formation.<eos> You didn't?<eos> The other girls, they did this.
We won't start until she gets here.<eos> I didn't fall from the top of the formation.<eos> You didn't?<eos> The other girls, they did this.<eos> They did this to me.
- Hi, Mama.<eos> - You look so good in your uniform.<eos> - You look like a formal peanut.<eos> Claude's got all them girls going berserk.<eos> They take one look at a fine specimen like myself and can we say "Denzel"?
- He likes his food hot.<eos> I'll put it in the microwave.<eos> That thing's going off like a drug dealer.<eos> Well, if you must know, it's my ladies.<eos> It's Christmastime, and they wanna spend time with a brother.
- Who you love.<eos> - What?<eos> Change. It's a wonderful thing.<eos> Look, you know how subatomic particles don't obey physical laws?<eos> They act according to chance, chaos, coincidence...
Are you my dad's new girlfriend?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm just a regular friend.<eos> He has lots of girlfriends.<eos> You're not as pretty as they are.
You know, Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.<eos> Really?<eos> But I kept all this from my wife, Deborah.<eos> These things only serve to upset the women.<eos> They are the gentler sex.
Being honest might not make you the most popular girl in the school yard,<eos> But it will earn you respect.<eos> * all this pain i've caused you, i know it by name * * taking this ticket and walking away * * all the pain i've caused you, i know it by name * * taking this ticket and walking away *<eos> * dee-Dee-Dee-Dee * * walking away * * dee-Dee-Dee *<eos> And when nice girls learn to respect themselves, they'll always finish first.
I saw this girl I liked at the bar.<eos> I followed her home.<eos> I knew she wanted to party.<eos> I chose her.<eos> Girls act... sometimes like they don't want what they want... because they want you to take it.
He was found within a block of the crime scene in an apparent suicide attempt.<eos> I've just been informed...<eos> I held his hand.<eos> ...has confirmed the names of the six victims.<eos> They are Cammie...
You know, Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.<eos> Really?<eos> But I kept all this from my wife, Deborah.<eos> These things only serve to upset the women.<eos> They are the gentler sex.
"Is this too little,and am I being unfair?<eos> Is this too much?<eos> Am I being foolish?"<eos> But what is the answer?<eos> You say you wish to share with your friends, but you cannot be certain that they, in the same situation,would share with you.
Only instead of listening to them,we take them for granted.<eos> Just like fresh water.<eos> Just like the ozone layer.<eos> And one day we'll all be gone.<eos> They'll still be here.
Last seen at Sheridan Mall in the lingerie store.<eos> Ten to one they're out clubbing.<eos> Rich little tarts out to screw over their parents.<eos> Who talked to the parents? I did.<eos> They said they've have gone off before.
You ever feel so small in this world?<eos> When I'm in the sky looking down.<eos> I can look down and see fields of rice.<eos> I can see people.<eos> They don't know I'm watching them.
During this storm, I got very worried about Kat.<eos> In order to calm her down I told the same story... I"d told the boys, about the legend of the waves.<eos> Whenever someone throws trash in the sea, King Neptune gets angry.<eos> He raises his arms with all his strength. And the waves get very scared of him.<eos> They hurry about crashing into each other... and into everything else along the way... boats, rocks, beaches.
Transport yourself!<eos> Doom the Doctor, doom his hide!<eos> Hide...<eos> The witches...spoke to Peter.<eos> In the night, they whispered.
How sweet!<eos> Listen. most men in this world are killed by women<eos> In the eyes of these betel nut girls They only care about one thing<eos> Not a cream puff like you<eos> What they want is what you don't have
Don't cry son, don't cry.<eos> Friends, today I'll tell you a story... about a boy.<eos> Once there was a boy, don't ask me where who couldn't read or write.<eos> However hard he'd try he couldn't remember that x came before Y.<eos> Words were his enemies, they danced before his eyes, frightening and tormenting him.
There are many products in today's society, be they music, clothing, videos, that are much more overtly sexual.<eos> Most of those are aimed at teenagers.<eos> These dolls are more for girls in elementary school.<eos> Read what's on the box, "She knows how to flaunt it."<eos> They're prostitots. And they're selling them in a toy store.
So what are you doing with these dolls?<eos> We are recognizing a market and trying to compete in it.<eos> Not all kids wanna play with Barbies anymore.<eos> Girls are becoming more sophisticated.<eos> They wanna be more like their grown up sisters, or the characters they watch on television. Teenagers who wear make-up, low-cut jeans, and yes, cropped mini-skirts.
Denny Crane's statement speaks not to his own racism but to a much more insidious one that exists in a white collar society that prefers to take its blacks as it takes its coffee, with a little cream and sugar.<eos> I'm not proud of it. But until we confront that truth, we will not change it.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> I hate the dolls.<eos> But do they offend the sensibilities of our society?
Absolutely not.<eos> If we did that, and word got out, we'd be out of business in about a week.<eos> But I see that the rooms are wired for sound as well.<eos> Yeah. Well, that's for the girls' protection.<eos> And to make sure that they don't short you on their financial transactions?
But it was self-defense.<eos> Self-defense, really?<eos> How?<eos> I myself was trying to defend the girls.<eos> They needed me to protect them.
Yeah.<eos> That's why it was stuffed inside of a tampon applicator.<eos> You know, I kind of feel bad for these girls.<eos> Don't feel too bad.<eos> They have health benefits, good pay.
Rabies,scabies,aids,hepatitis.<eos> I'm thinking of this suit as a giant rubber glove.<eos> The vic's intestines?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Rats are neophobic-- they fear the new.
♫ I've just found joy ♫<eos> Oh, Alan... aren't women just the best?<eos> Indeed.<eos> I love 'em all.<eos> They all love me.
English is boring.<eos> And the other one's kind of interesting, but it's pretty depressing.<eos> The israeli-palestinian conflict?<eos> People blowing each other up because their God says they're allowed to live in a certain patch of fuckin' sand.<eos> Yeah, and other people's gods say they're supposed to live there.
You gonna be a fuckin' comedian now?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This is gonna sound stupid... But I saw at one point that our mothers are...<eos> They're bus drivers.
I'm not.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This is gonna sound stupid... But I saw at one point that our mothers are...<eos> They're bus drivers.<eos> They're...
Maybe.<eos> This is gonna sound stupid... But I saw at one point that our mothers are...<eos> They're bus drivers.<eos> They're...<eos> No, they are the bus.
This is gonna sound stupid... But I saw at one point that our mothers are...<eos> They're bus drivers.<eos> They're...<eos> No, they are the bus.<eos> See, they're the vehicle that gets us here.
That's right, you often hear of young girls marrying older men.<eos> Although rarely the opposite.<eos> How unfair.<eos> Young girls are nice, polite, and pretty, you know.<eos> Plus, they don't fire back annoying responses after everything you say.
But is it your name?<eos> No matter.<eos> Jane Elliot it is.<eos> My sisters would like to keep you, like a stray off the moor.<eos> Do you intend to live off their charity? For they have very little to spare.
But this is her world.<eos> It is her place of comfort, in trees she has run up a hundred times, or down paths led only by familiar scents.<eos> Her beautifully patterned fur is like her cloak of invisibility, but one creature in the treetops always sees through her disguise.<eos> It is a constant irritation.<eos> When her eyes stray to squirrels, they know the trouble is coming their way.
For her, this was never merely practice for larger prey.<eos> Her fascination with squirrels has gone way beyond the potential of a furry mouthful of bones.<eos> It is a battle of wills and she has become an expert.<eos> These tiny african squirrels have been fleeing for their lives ever since she was a cub.<eos> They have almost become an obsession for her.
Her mother's rage is obvious, even to the hyenas that are shadowing the leopards more and more each day.<eos> It is a rage born from a daughter's insolence.<eos> Legadema's error of judgment can be blamed on the rain, but this conflict has been brewing for a long time.<eos> Two females sharing a territory is a formula for disaster.<eos> They are now locked in a terrible and terrifying relationship.
It may appear a confusing blur of activities, each ant doing its own thing but it can't be...<eos> Somehow the ants coordinate their actions, so that larger insects are over helmed killed... and carried back to the base...<eos> However they do it, these ants are very successful. In one year a single colony consumes over ten millions of insects.<eos> In the background here we see one of these fantastic nest of the little mud build wood ants in Europe and it's one of the very important ants in our forest,<eos> because they are really protecting the forests from forest pests.
The scent of honey attracts it to nearby bees nest. The bear faces a strong defense, here too.<eos> The bees get the better of it.<eos> After smashing open the nest the bear decides to leave.<eos> The exposed bee nest now faces a far fierce enemy than the bear... The wood ants have discovered the hive. Though bigger, bees are no match for ants.<eos> They steal the honey and dismember the larvae. The adults are carried off with the rest of the plunder, back to the ant city.
Even it has one hundred times the force of gravity, enough to crush a human astronaut, the ants can still grip the glass surface.<eos> The secret is a microscopic film of liquid on their feet. And weaver ants need all the grip they can get, when they construct their colonies...<eos> Individuals hold on with jaws and feet putting their bodies on a great tension while their fellow workers glue the leaves together... How did these extraordinary insects come about?<eos> They evolved from wasps, more than one hundred million years ago, some species still retain primitive traits... For instance these Australian bulldog ants, have retained the sting of wasp ancestors.<eos> Unlike most other ants these workers are almost as large as the queen... and they still lay eggs... However the eggs are not fertile and are used as food for larvae. It is only the queen that produces the next generation.
It's a matter of specialization, cooperation and communication<eos> The first specialists are the cutters they have powerful jaws and big heads that have strong muscles their only job is to cut through the tough grass leaves.<eos> If a grass stem is too thick, then teamwork is the answer.<eos> The cutters also measure the length of the cut sections.<eos> Here, transport ants take over. They have a lighter build than the cutters, more the physique of a runner than a lumberjack. They carry the stems from 15 meters and deposit them at a depot, for the next relay of transport ants.
The trail includes this bridge where the ant automatically weights itself and reveals how much sugar water it is consumed.<eos> On it's return, the scout recruits other ants by giving them a taste of sugar from it's social stomach.<eos> They set off the chemical trail and add to it's potency, as they go. In this way the attractiveness of the trail is directly related to the richness of the food.<eos> Ants don't always depend on their chemical language. These Diacamma ants keep in physical contact with each other, as they move nest. so is not to lose their way.<eos> But even here, the ants still obey chemical use. They follow any object that has the scent of their society.
The wood ants are after the dried resin. They spend a great deal of energy gathering the resin and dragging it back, to their colony.<eos> This is the equivalent of a human carrying over ten times their own weight, while is running a marathon. And there's nothing convenient about the size of the resin blocks But why do the ants all this effort?<eos> The lumps of resins are distributed all over the surface of the colony. The resin is the trees defense against injuries. It contains chemicals that kill fungus and bacteria<eos> Every time an ant walks over the block, it disinfects itself. In this remarkable way, the wood ants using the medicinal properties of the tree, to keep their society, healthy.<eos> The grass-cutter ants also need to control undesirable bacteria. They live from a fungus they grow themselves. The grass and leaves are the compost for their fungus gardens.
The grass-cutter ants also need to control undesirable bacteria. They live from a fungus they grow themselves. The grass and leaves are the compost for their fungus gardens.<eos> They control the spread of unwanted bacteria that may destroy their gardens by antibiotics that they manufactures in their own bodies, each in every pieces of vegetation that arrives, is treated with antibiotics.<eos> The whole society, the super-organism depends on the disease-free garden. There are parts of the super-organism that never leave the underground gardens. These ants are much smaller than the grass-cutter and transport ants and their job is to weed the gardens and tend the brood.<eos> If the fungus gardens are to thrive, they need the right growing conditions. The correct temperature and humidity are critical.<eos> These chimneys help the circulation of fresh air. They are the ventilation dots of an air conditioning system that keeps temperature, humidity and gases, at ideal levels, in the fungus gardens deep below.
They are the last thing the iguana needs<eos> No harm is meant it's nothing more than a rather one-sided game of cat and mouse<eos> Marine iguanas take in too much salt with their food<eos> But with the help of special glands they sneeze it out<eos> They also welcome these resourceful visitors
Water is a scarce resource on this island and giant tortoises can survive months without it<eos> But during the wetter season they gather to quench their thirst among a scattering of freshwater pools<eos> A tortoise oasis<eos> Around 5000 live here on Alcedo it's the greatest concentration found anywhere in Galapagos<eos> Despite their extensive body armor, tortoises are vulnerable to skin parasites which they are unable to remove themselves so that they've developed a remarkable relationship with finches
Were there a lot of hot girls out last night?<eos> -Have they treated you well yet... or still waitting' on it?<eos> My problem is... Like, it's hard for me to talk to girls.<eos> They're not gonnajust go up and introduce themselves, so...<eos> They think the exact opposite.
Apparently they also jacuzzies<eos> Apparently.<eos> Anyway, we go inside, The girls go to Terri's room.<eos> I pop in the seat, and turn on the TV.<eos> I'm zapping, and they are in the bedroom to giggle.
You don't understand Mexican women.<eos> -Oh, Mexican women are different.<eos> -No, sir.<eos> They're like most women, except more so.<eos> You let up on them, they're all gonna take advantage.
I tried to tell you. Eh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Look!<eos> - It's nice that you let Jesse rest while we get the wood.<eos> - Yeah, well sometimes you have to give women a little privacy, otherwise they'll talk to you.
Every corner tells a story.<eos> Such dreamy stuff is not my piece of cake.<eos> Women are better at that.<eos> You think so?<eos> They have a better imagination.
I do not want to see you again!<eos> Pino understood very well.<eos> But you have two girls, right?<eos> Sure, that's the most important.<eos> They do not suffer from our separation.
Sure, that's the most important.<eos> They do not suffer from our separation.<eos> Forget the girls, not ever come back!<eos> Neither the call, nor do they send a message!<eos> Of course, now everything changes, because the distance Because I live here and they there ...
Teri claimed she got the painting from an elderly bartender named Pops... who had been given it by his friend, Jackson Pollock, back in the 1940's.<eos> When Teri met Pops, he was down on his luck.<eos> He'd get really drunk and slobbering, you know?<eos> Kind of crying over missing Jackson and all of this stuff.<eos> And he would tell me these kind of risqué stories, you know? And they were really funny, some of 'em were.
No.<eos> Do you mind if i just stand here and... urinate all over the four of you?<eos> Oh, keep doing it, baby. Do it for daddy.<eos> The females are truly starving.<eos> As soon as the mating ritual is over they get to make the same long journey as the males did, to the ocean where they will finally get to feed.
- What was wrong with them?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> To me, it's straightforward.<eos> But imagine a bishop and other church big-shots going into a convent patio and seeing all the nuns going crazy.<eos> They looked mad... crying out, moaning...
Lots of women followed Jesus.<eos> They were the most faithful of his disciples, as you can see.<eos> They're faithful to him even after his death.<eos> Women are capable of being very faithful to those who really love them- until their death and even beyond.<eos> They know what love is.
How do you know?<eos> What do you know about women?<eos> What do you know about bloody anything, Dave Smith?<eos> Women.<eos> They have to feel you need them.
This morning in the classroom with the girls.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Every single one of them is here for a reason.<eos> We must give them purpose.<eos> They are indulgent.
Because there's something wrong with her.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> There's something wrong with me.<eos> What do you think it is?<eos> You respect people more when they don't respect you.
Three hundred and seventy years... wait, are you sure it was today?<eos> Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, I'm sure.<eos> This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise, it took place at sunset.<eos> Look at the shadows.<eos> They point east.
Deal.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Thanks, girls.<eos> They're not gonna drive it, are they?
If I time it just right, I just might be able to force their magical hand.<eos> Make them choose between exposing their secret and saving an innocent, something they're honour-bound to do.<eos> - But he just said exposing ourselves...<eos> - We won't be!<eos> They will be.
great, she caught me staring.<eos> Have you guys noticed how friendly betty's been since that body was found in front of her house?<eos> I don't trust friendly women.<eos> That's okay.<eos> They don't trust you,either.
Isn't she beautiful?<eos> She's big, huh?<eos> Oh, she sure is. Pretty soon she'll be old enough to date Richard.<eos> Oh, do not tell me his old ass is still chasing after young girls.<eos> Girl, I thought you knew. They're the only ones dumb enough not to run when they see him coming.
Well, I'm not really giving them out.<eos> Girls just keep on giving them to me.<eos> My man.<eos> Are girls supposed to give boys Valentine's Day cards?<eos> Well, they're giving them to him.
Oh, let me have a look.<eos> Oh, sorry, that's it, thanks very much.<eos> You're welcome then.<eos> It's just not true.<eos> Women don't want gentlemen, they want bullies and thugs.
because those people are my friends.<eos> Your friends weren't really friendly to me.<eos> I just...<eos> I feel like... I just don't really fit in you know.<eos> I just... they're so cool. I don't know sophisticated.
No When you cook a pot of male lobsters, and they realize they're in this pot of boilling water, they all start totally freaking out. They're like "fuck we gotta get out of here"<eos> And they start making these little ladders, and helping each other getting out of the pot.<eos> So you have to put a lid on the pot to keep them inside.<eos> But female lobsters, you don't have to put a lid on the pot. Because once they realize they're in a pot of boilling water, They all just start grabbing each other and they're like holding each other down.<eos> They're like : "If I'm gonna die, everyone's gonna die."
Dr. Sooran said she wouldn't even charge us a dime.<eos> You already spoke to her?<eos> Not about the psychic stuff.<eos> Just about getting scanned for the girls.<eos> See if they gave angiomas, too.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I think the bees were looking for you, Earl.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Uh, it's. uh... it-it's not too bad.<eos> They just kept coming after me.
All right, organ theft.<eos> I always thought that was an urban legend.<eos> It's no legend, man.<eos> We were working the villages outside Kandahar, these girls would show up with new passports.<eos> They'd leave and come back with new scars.
It's the look my dad goes for.<eos> Um, and this a list of nonnegotiable qualifications that she must possess.<eos> Mental stability, crossword enthusiast, loves horses... Must have own money, plastic-surgery-free, fluent in Italian.<eos> This doesn't leave much wiggle room, Summer.<eos> It's just that my dad didn't have much in common with his first two wives, and they left, so...
You didn't kill those girls.<eos> Why didn't you say this in court?<eos> I know he brought women back to his workshop.<eos> It's a long way from knowing he was killing them.<eos> They died as a result of my neglect.
How?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Summer confronted me yesterday, and then I had to tell Marissa.<eos> How did they take it?<eos> They were great.
I took the liberty of ordering champagne.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So? These fantasies?<eos> They're many and varied actualy.<eos> But now that you're here they seem a very poor substitute for reality.
- Yes.<eos> They'll probably think they were sent there, so you'll have to be careful.<eos> You just have to play a role, and make them believe that you're part of their dreams.<eos> Well, how am I gonna find their inner truths?<eos> Well, they'll have to find their inner truths in order to wake up.
So I guess that's when he went up the deep end.<eos> How?<eos> Well, he figured it best if his girls died quick. Rather than starve to death.<eos> So he attacked them.<eos> And they screamed. Begged for him to stop but He just strung them up one after another.
Take a look out there. What do you see?<eos> A one-armed cactus.<eos> And take a look at these labels.<eos> "Rhode... eo. "<eos> They spell rodeo.
Very nice breasts.<eos> For the third time of the day, I got kissed nicely.<eos> Three times I prayed for you today.<eos> I shared those girls with you.<eos> I prayed they'd save your soul.
I got a diversified corporation.<eos> And multinational.<eos> You kidnap young woman from El Salvador and get them to work for you as slaves.<eos> You kidding me?<eos> They want to come.
Hold on.<eos> What's your stock, Jameson?<eos> Coon. But trust me, Feldman.<eos> You've never seen pelts like these before.<eos> They're gonna make you a rich man.
Well, you didn't lie.<eos> You told a fib.<eos> And you didn't fib to the girls.<eos> You told them the truth.<eos> And I think that is what they're going to remember.
That's the biggest reason why I did it.<eos> And in that sense I don't regret it, but anybody else who's gonna get addicted to drugs are obviously going to fuck up their lives, eventually.<eos> If it doesn't take a year, it will be next year, you know.<eos> It's so obvious. I mean, I've seen it happen with every person that ever got strung-out.<eos> It's a typical classic case that drugs are bad for you and they will fuck you up, you know.
What I'm out to capture... is the grace of the pleasure on their faces and their bodies.<eos> Pleasure...<eos> To express it, you have to know what it is.<eos> Why not take porn stars and teach them how to act?<eos> They take no delight in transgression.
Just in case.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> I'm making too much noise with the whores.<eos> I can ask them to bring it down.<eos> You know, they fake those screams.
But me and you -- we don't get close.<eos> So, we've got to plan, we've got to be clever.<eos> And that's what me and you have got over on them.<eos> We can imagine and then we can prepare.<eos> Women, they're attracted by power.
You have got power.<eos> What we can only think about, what we wouldn't dare.<eos> But you dared, Jason.<eos> You dared eat the peach.<eos> It's women -- they secretly fantasize about it.
Yeah.<eos> The girls love her.<eos> Guess I would, too, if I didn't Have to follow her around with A shit mitt.<eos> How are the girls?<eos> Ah, they're good. Yeah?
You can't come back OOUUT!<eos> - I wish to see the señoritas - What?<eos> - I want to see the girls<eos> - What girls? - Any girls<eos> - What makes you think they want to see you?
They're seniors.<eos> I mean, you're a freshman.<eos> You think I'd be better off, hanging out at home with my screwed up mother, who hasn't gotten out of bed since my dad slammed a toaster into her head and split?<eos> Were those girls trying to sell you drugs?<eos> They don't have anything I want.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Keep laughing while I totally emancipate you.<eos> Gentlemen, choose your weapons.<eos> - ls this them?<eos> - "Are these they?"
- "Are these they?"<eos> - Who talks like that?<eos> - Out of the way! I am the leader here!<eos> I will distribute the...<eos> - Are these they?
- Yeah.<eos> And? I don't know. It was OK.<eos> - Dexter, women are different from men.<eos> - We've had this talk, Dad.<eos> I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.
And it isn't a joke, you know?<eos> It had been so long...<eos> Oh, God, so much time wasted.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you all this but I can't tell my friends. They'd think I was crazy, they'd judge me. They'd think I was profaning the mourning for my son's death.<eos> They think that after a certain age it's more dignified to close down that area.
Woman is reduced to a masturbatory prop.<eos> Woman arouses us in so far as she enters our fantasy frame.<eos> With women, it's different.<eos> The true enjoyment is not in doing it but in telling about it afterwards.<eos> Of course, women do enjoy sex immediately, but I hope I'm permitted as a man to propose a daring hypothesis, that maybe, while they are doing it, they already enact or incorporate this minimal narrative distance,
You possess phallus.<eos> Phallus is something attached to you, like the King's crown is his phallus.<eos> Something you put on and this gives you authority.<eos> So that when you talk it's not simply you as a common person who is talking, it's symbolic authority itself, the Law, the state, talking through you.<eos> So these excessively ridiculous paternal figures, it's not simply that they possess phallus, that they have phallus as the insignia of their authority, in a way, they immediately are phallus.
Who are you calling pitiful?<eos> You ran from women.<eos> You know about them?<eos> I know which part of hell the Al-Shuj'aan come from... in here.<eos> They're the ones who did this to you?
Our intruder was looking for something.<eos> Yeah, the stolen merch, but it's not here.<eos> Double cross?<eos> FLACK: But if her partners whacked her for the jewels, why would they toss her place?<eos> Well, maybe they had a falling out, and Natalie hid it from them.
Uncle Lou's making us watch The show about him and the Jews.<eos> Lou!<eos> It's educational.<eos> These kids need some learning.<eos> They don't want to watch it.
- I was sent by Richie.<eos> You're not Richie?<eos> No, he's sent me to assist the two ladies.<eos> - Richie is just a pimp!<eos> - They're not here?
If you're interested...<eos> Why, do you like that?<eos> I mean, you like "assisting" men? It's my job.<eos> If I can choose, I prefer women.<eos> They spend more. The money isn't theirs, anyway!
Why, do you like that?<eos> I mean, you like "assisting" men? It's my job.<eos> If I can choose, I prefer women.<eos> They spend more. The money isn't theirs, anyway!<eos> They are not so straightforward as men, it takes us a little longer... but it's more pleasant.
I'm talking about a healthy respect for yourself. And as you love yourself, you'll love others.<eos> Sometimes people will say, "those people at work are so negative", or, "the man I live with is so angry", or, "my children are so worrisome to me", and we say, "you must orient yourself to the best part of those people who surround you."<eos> We encourage that you get a notebook, and that you make a list of the positive aspects of the people that you spend a lot of time with.<eos> There could be someone that you have a terrible experience with, a terrible relationship with. And in the privacy of your own mind, and with quite a bit of work, we will admit, as you focus upon things that you like most those people will become that mostly to you<eos> And even though you cannot create in their reality, if they are in the mood or in attitude that doesn't match the mood or attitude that you have about them, they'll zig while you zag.
They may as well be in separate rooms.<eos> Making them either great actresses or in cahoots.<eos> Or... they have no idea what's going on.<eos> How could these women not know?<eos> Brennan was pretty sure that they didn't.
In a purely nonromantic, happy-to-be-judged way.<eos> Well...<eos> Anyway... These women.<eos> Right. Not stupid.<eos> And, frankly, that they allowed themselves to be duped is a sad statement on how lean the market is out there.
Sam!<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> I take my ladies here.<eos> They like it.<eos> Well, I mean, I like it, so of course they do too.
Are you kidding?<eos> The seeds,they were just a-- a lie,ok?<eos> So what?<eos> I hate herbs!<eos> I hate everything they stand for!
360.<eos> Cou d you tell me how to get to General Rodrguez?<eos> Genera Rodriguez...<eos> No, I have no idea.<eos> Ask the girls outside. Perhaps they know
We saw creatures.<eos> We saw creatures, these... Things, that were swimming around in the air. They fill it!<eos> All the time.<eos> - Are they around us now?<eos> Only we can't see them without the resonator. And they can't see us, unless they're under the influence of the vibrations.
No.I was just making sure that they weren't staring at us.<eos> With what?<eos> Their asses?<eos> Beautiful girls in panama.<eos> They love americans.
And then she asked whether he had any clients by the name of Bin Laden, and he just about fell off his couch.<eos> "Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stepped down from the position Friday"<eos> We thought the meeting went well.<eos> "I wouldn't want to be in the way of some of these families.<eos> I mean, they're..."
The gun gives him power and lets him maintain distance from the kill.<eos> This guy doesn't want to touch the bodies with his hands.<eos> Mill Creek killer.<eos> Hunts during the day, targets educated, middle-class women.<eos> He'd have to look and act like they do.
Who does that?<eos> "Girls check it out."<eos> "Dude, why do you put your picture up there?"<eos> "Because when girls come over and they see I'm a male dancer..."<eos> "They put down their defenses, you know."
Apparently treats a lot of college, high school kids.<eos> All right, let's check him out.<eos> 18,19, it's pretty young to start cutting corners.<eos> The drugs don't do the work for you, man.<eos> They just change your body chemistry so you can work out harder and longer.
Oh,. all right.<eos> yeah,. bean-o-rama house blend.<eos> Aliphatic,chlorogenic alicyclic carboxylic acids are a dead giveaway.<eos> I mean, I-I was a coffee sommelier when I was in college.<eos> I mean,just for the chicks and stuff, they'd come in..and I'D.... you were looking for us.
If you give me 20 minutes, I could do something with pleats.<eos> I-I said leave it.<eos> I'm not gonna go to that ridiculous party.<eos> I can't compete anymore with a bevy of 22-year-old gym bodies.<eos> I mean, you starve yourself, you pull yourself, you inject yourself, you think you're safe, but they keep coming to the door, younger and younger like a hail of bullets until down you go.
Our faculty is organizing a ball, wanna come?<eos> We'll see<eos> That girl's hot<eos> Not like the girls in my class, so big and muscular<eos> They could probably kill me with one slap on the face
She can't be right forever.<eos> And when she slips up, I'm gonna be there.<eos> Waiting.<eos> Can you believe jeff flew steph's sisters in for the party?<eos> Steph told me that they have a made-up language that they speak to each other.
Stop it!<eos> Hey, I don't care how you act in the privacy of your own home, but you're affecting my life now!<eos> And that's not ok!<eos> And surprise parties, they're not lame.<eos> They are thrilling.
- Next session, I'll apologize.<eos> - Uh-uh. There's not gonna be a next session for you.<eos> The moms don't want you anywhere near their daughters.<eos> But I'm helping them!<eos> They love me!
You have husbands and families and a reason to wake up in the morning.<eos> What do I have?<eos> Him!<eos> Teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing I've done since... I don't know when.<eos> And as much as I've helped them, they've helped me so much more.
This is terrible!<eos> I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?<eos> ! Sir!<eos> The sea otters are advancing!<eos> They've broken through the east portal!
Bird's eggs are a seasonal snack and for a short time, there's plenty of them<eos> Sometimes perhaps, too many.<eos> But to live here permanently, the marten needs a more reliable food source.<eos> Squirrels fit the bill.<eos> They thrive here on the pine cones and although these are also seasonal they can be stored and eaten throughout the year.
Some have been here for five thousand years.<eos> They were alive before the pyramids were built and were already three thousand years old when Christ was born.<eos> Across the Equator, in the southern hemisphere there are forests that mirror those of the north.<eos> Here in South America araucaria trees or monkey puzzles are like the conifers of the Taiga.<eos> They have waterproof scales, instead of needles and their cones look a little different but the principles are the same.
There are hunters here who would snatch his young.<eos> Another miniature.<eos> The kodkod cat.<eos> It's the smallest cat in all the Americas and a young pudu would be a feast for it But, with the male on guard, the kodkod must lower his sights.<eos> Moths are hatching. They're the last of the summer.
Salps appear in the plankton soup.<eos> Individuals link together to form chains which can stretch for fifteen meters.<eos> Pumping water through their bodies they strain out algae and other edible particles.<eos> Comb jellies cruise through the water.<eos> They too flourish in this seasonal soup and for short periods, they appear in astounding numbers.
I don't have a lot of friends.<eos> So you're interested in profiling?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean,<eos> They're all about whether there's really such a thing as evil, like nature versus nurture,all that, so i figured it'd be smart to hear it from an expert,you know?
What's wrong?<eos> Need to get that to everyone as soon as possible.<eos> Uh,hi. Detective barnes,this is special agent dr. Spencer reid at the behavioral analysis unit at quantico.<eos> Have you had any recent murders involving prostitutes, maybe just jane does?<eos> They would have been stabbed to death,and their hair would've been cut off by the killer.
And once, I dated this Indian guy and I chewed on a horse's adrenal gland.<eos> But how is this gonna help me in court ?<eos> No, I mean prescription drugs.<eos> For your anger.<eos> They have certainly done a lot for me.
Long before Perón's time.<eos> That was my mother's first contact... and I remember the impact the name had... in 1936... during the Spanish Civil War... she collaborated... and was a member... of an organisation with a grand name...<eos> "International Red Aid".<eos> So, that was my mother's background. My aunts also began in the union.<eos> They were leather workers... and another was a shop assistant.
The result of their 25 years of hard work is not me it's Albert, their horse!<eos> You go gaga when you see pretty women,<eos> You forget all about me!<eos> I make the tea, I cook the meals.<eos> And they get the kisses?
He's more frightened of you than you are of him.<eos> These creatures are in our soils, earth, and they eat all of our human garbage, and turn it into more soil.<eos> These creatures are in many ways at a higher level than you are.<eos> Yes, they are, because you know what?<eos> You make garbage, and they eat your garbage.

This has always happened.<eos> But I think the idea of ​​girls ready for anything to be with a guy, started with Led Zeppelin.<eos> The biggest complaint is that the groupies are treated as the weaker sex objects.<eos> That is absurd!<eos> Because they are exactly where you want to be.

And I see it that way.<eos> We are in a field # where, on 61 hectares cultivating genetically modified soybeans .<eos> It's Roundup Ready soybeans.<eos> Roundup is a pesticide destroying everything begins to turn green and bloom except soybeans.<eos> They resist it.

They were two separate countries.<eos> With the Al-5 law in late 1968, the military became more radical and in '69 he was thrown out of the diplomatic service.<eos> With time, he slackened more and more... rejecting social conventions and impositions.<eos> God knows that out of cats and pigeons... I by far prefer the former species.<eos> I find pigeons terribly bourgeois, with their happy, content air... not to mention the lowness of certain characteristics of their condition... probably including the fact... that they may devour each other when caged.

She was talking to a man.<eos> His voice was never identified.<eos> She was describing the symbology of this -- the mark of Rambaldi.<eos> She said the outer markings represented her two daughters.<eos> The center is the object over which they will do great battle... with each other.
I'll call him every hour until he gives me my old job back.<eos> I think this is an opportunity to really breathe in a culture that's so different from [Explosion ]<eos> - Roll 'em up.<eos> - How come all the women are dressed like ninjas?<eos> - They're wearing abayas.
Hey, bone lady.<eos> The sign says "Wong Foo's."<eos> I'll get your meal.<eos> But we didn't order.<eos> No, Sid knows what people want better than they do.
Test cutting.<eos> Rolled tatami man in water.<eos> Simulates resistance.<eos> So, is that the murder weapon?<eos> When you train with weapons, they tell you about yourself.
- That's right.<eos> We got bigger problems than Burley's hard-on for Libby.<eos> Her?<eos> I don't fuck whores.<eos> That's 'cause they won't fuck you, Burley.
All walks of life live as one.<eos> Of course, we may have to kill a few... de-men in the process.<eos> But that's where you come in.<eos> I should talk to the sisters first.<eos> They don't believe in a women's utopia like we do.
The sisters did not kill them.<eos> Morris... Darryl.<eos> I know that you're a good cop, and I can't believe that you would help killers.<eos> Now, I don't know what these women have on you...<eos> They don't have anything on me.
I was lucky to get out of there alive.<eos> - Her powers of intuition are...<eos> - Won't do any good once she's trapped inside my cage.<eos> - If her sisters can anticipate like...<eos> - They can't.
With a face like that, you're better off in the cage.<eos> Don't feel all that charmed now, do you?<eos> My sisters will get me out of this cage and this body! You forget.<eos> For them to come to your rescue, they have to realise lmara's in your body.<eos> Don't think they can tell when there's a demon?
How much longer are we going to wait? Patience.<eos> Scrying takes time.<eos> There's a vanquishing potion to keep my aunts busy for at least an hour.<eos> Vanquishing potion?<eos> You expect that they'll show up empty-handed?
- Perfectly. Away!<eos> Do you really think they'll leave the safety of the Magic School? - I know they will.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Now that I have Phoebe's powers, I know what they'll do next.<eos> They will not humiliate me again.
Yeah, right like it's ever gonna happen.<eos> Why you don't think it will?<eos> Well, do you, Louis?<eos> Come on, who are you trying to kid here?<eos> Whether you like it or not, and you know I don't, being magical is part of who they are,
Oh, I'm Cindy Mulvaney<eos> Pleased to meet you<eos> I think you see just fine, ma'am<eos> Pardon me?<eos> Situations like this, they always end up bad
- I'm gonna find my seat.<eos> - Principals are on this side.<eos> Wet t-Shirt girls are down there.<eos> I am so happy for you.<eos> Thank you- They were supposed to be in their 30s.
But, Chris, you probably don't wanna play the camera, 'Cause it's supposed to be, you know, real life.<eos> It's really happening, you know?<eos> All right, in five, four, three, two-<eos> Anyway, 's just fun, i think, to, uh...<eos> Look at the pictures. And they really show you how a show can change over the years, you know?
- Patty, yeah.<eos> - Well, she's a lesbian.<eos> - Yes. - You know, so, obviously, they talk amongst themselves, and the word got out that I'm a friend o' lesbians.<eos> - You're a friend o' lesbians!<eos> - Yes, they know that.
- I'd be really intimidated by that, because, you know, we really...<eos> - Intimidated?<eos> Well, because we don't know what we're doing as much as the women know.<eos> You know, it's their equipment.<eos> They own the equipment, so they know what to do with it.
These big vagina ladies are getting away with murder.<eos> Something should be done.<eos> I don't know what can be done, but something should be done.<eos> Either...<eos> We're a hell of lot more discrete than they are, right?
Gabby, if I make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down.<eos> I don't care! Can't have any of these girls thinking that I'm pregnant.<eos> Do you actually think they're going to make fun of you?<eos> Trust me, they're merciless.<eos> But why? I mean, surely they have friends who have children.
Yes!<eos> I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert.<eos> I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley.<eos> That's what I love about high-schooI girls.<eos> I keep getting older, they stay the same age.
- Okay.<eos> Oh, those sweet, little 11-year-old girls.<eos> Killers!<eos> Killers all!<eos> They won.
Must be... oh!<eos> What do we have?<eos> Four nights, four victims.<eos> The last images of any of these women alive.<eos> First time we went through these, we not only established they left the club by themselves but that no man followed them out.
Can you excuse me?<eos> I'm gonna use the restroom.<eos> Look at those single girls over there, and I'm stuck on a date.<eos> God, I can't just leave them there.<eos> Michael, they deserve better, but I'm sending you in.
You too.<eos> Most of this stuff is just crap, man.<eos> They're not doin' nothin' but talking'. Sometimes they eat.<eos> What do you think, lesbians just fuck all the time?<eos> Obviously not, but if they don't start soon... we're not gonna...
No. I don't know.<eos> If I saw you at a bar, I would assume you are straight.<eos> - That doesn't really mean anything. - No, it doesn't.<eos> - Never know these days, do you? - No, you don't. Except.<eos> You knew they were. Right?
Okay, Dewey, you set the table with the box of candy.<eos> Now it's time to reap your reward.<eos> She's not going to feel like I'm trying to buy her, is she?<eos> Let me teach you a valuable lesson about women, Dewey.<eos> They think they deserve everything you give them.
!<eos> I am transforming these women, Lois.<eos> I won't soil that with money.<eos> And it's not just the hair.<eos> They confide in me, they need someone to listen to their problems.
You don't give a dentist candy, you don't buy a kitten for a veterinarian, and you don't plan a surprise party for someone like me.<eos> Who said anyone was planning a surprise party for you?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> You tell the kids.<eos> They're the ones who wanted to have the early morning meeting.
Who said anyone was planning a surprise party for you?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> You tell the kids.<eos> They're the ones who wanted to have the early morning meeting.<eos> They're the ones that are really fired up about your birthday.
N-No.<eos> I just...<eos> That was the office-- they ran some comparative DNA on our first two victims.<eos> They don't understand how, but according to the lab, both of these women are actually related.<eos> From a genetic standpoint, they have the same father.
Oh, hey, how's your little side project going?<eos> Oh, yeah, I gave that up.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, it turns out I was just grasping at straws.<eos> Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together.
Sure. Um, I was born and raised in Tree Hill, where I have two local businesses.<eos> I went to school at Tree Hill High, and I have a son who's about to graduate from there, as well.<eos> Now, tell our voters why they should vote for you over your opponent, Dan Scott.<eos> Because this town and the people here matter to me.<eos> I find that some people care more about being a leader than they do about the people they're leading.
- It's good to have you back, Jill.<eos> - Thank you, Wes.<eos> We have 3 more deaths, all young.<eos> Why is this hitting so many young people?<eos> 'Cause they haven't had as much exposure to flu streams.
I thought you were staying, ok?<eos> I've been here for 11 years, and it's always the same story.<eos> I get really close to someone, and they move on.<eos> I don't want to be 50 making friends with the new 25-year-old interns, Elliot.<eos> They'll make fun of me when we go dancing.
It's going to my sister.<eos> It would break her heart.<eos> Don't be so quick to say no.<eos> The ladies love an ivy-leaguer...<eos> They do?
you really press my cider.<eos> Yo, Bart, good to see you're back with Jenda.<eos> Hey, Nelson.<eos> What's up with your girlfriends?<eos> They each had twins.
Well, don't take too long.<eos> I think this might be our special night.<eos> Why did Lisa dump me?<eos> Is it because of my small calves?<eos> They're the hardest place to add mass!
Clark, my scientists have identified... what seems to be an inner chamber... inside the cave wall.<eos> I was wondering if your research into the cave... might have turned up anything similar.<eos> Lex, why are you so interested... in the caves when there's... a natural disaster headed our way?<eos> Clark, if anything in this town is irreplaceable... it's those caves.<eos> They've been around for thousands of years... and they can very well be destroyed in the next... Well, let's hope they're not.
What exactly is it that you want me to do?<eos> I have deep pockets, Jason.<eos> Vast resources. But the one thing I don't have is access.<eos> Two women in your life are somehow intimately connected to Margaret Isabelle Theroux.<eos> I want you to find out everything they know.
Except they're not.<eos> Either these whales' migrations have been so disrupted that they're avoiding their normal feeding grounds or something's feeding on them.<eos> Remember that pod of grays that I was studying?<eos> Not taking you whale hunting.<eos> This time of year, they're right off the Farallones, like clockwork.
I have twisted myself into knots just trying to get them to like me.<eos> My education my job, my clothes, my car my very behavior.<eos> All chosen simply to get women to approve of me.<eos> And how's that worked out for you?<eos> They don't approve of me.
We can tough it out.<eos> But we wouldn't have to... ... ifyouhadn'tpresumedtoinvite someone to stay without my permission.<eos> Hey, hey, I live here too.<eos> So do termites.<eos> But they don't have guest-inviting privileges either.
Have you seen anything suspicious?<eos> If you know anything...<eos> It's for your daughters.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> They are your daughters.
The herring-gull instinct may have led the nomads to exaggerate their images of the body, but that's not what's happening here.<eos> These images are driven by something altogether different.<eos> But what is it?<eos> To start with, they're hardly realistic,<eos> Could they provide the next clue in our mystery?
But what is it?<eos> To start with, they're hardly realistic,<eos> Could they provide the next clue in our mystery?<eos> After all, they were produced by an organised society much more like ours,<eos> Could they explain why our world is so filled with unrealistic images of the body?
They wanted their images of the body to last forever and they developed revolutionary quarrying and masonry skills to do just that,<eos> Again, their obsession with order made these statues just as formal and rigid as their paintings,<eos> The Egyptians created images of the body this way not because of how their brains were hard-wired but because of their culture,<eos> Perhaps this could explain the images that dominate our modern world,<eos> It could be that they all reflect or represent a particular aspect of our culture,
We'd have lost something... we totally rely on,<eos> Life would be impossible... and our world would be unrecognisable,<eos> But at some point in our ancient past that's what the world looked like - imageless,<eos> Now, of course, pictures dominate our lives.<eos> This is the extraordinary story of how we humans discovered the power of images and how they created the world we live in today.
The leaves of the surviving trees all have these swellings on their stems. And going in and out are armies of tiny, tiny ants.<eos> The swellings are their homes.<eos> Specially developed for them by the tree.<eos> And in them, safe from predators, the ants keep their eggs and larvae.<eos> They even keep domestic livestock, white scale insects, which, like aphids, supply the ants with drinks of honeydew.
A squad of them leaves the barracks and sets out on one of their regular patrols of the neighbourhood.<eos> They've found a newly-sprouted sapling.<eos> Perhaps it's grown from one of their landlord's seeds. In which case, all well and good.<eos> But this one hasn't, it's an intruder.<eos> They go into action, biting its stems.
But this one hasn't, it's an intruder.<eos> They go into action, biting its stems.<eos> Reinforcements arrive. Hundreds of tiny jaws cut into its stems.<eos> The sapling begins to wilt.<eos> But bites alone are not enough for the ants to achieve their ends. They lift their abdomens and inject formic acid into the crippled plant's wounds.
The poison spreads through the plant's tissues hastening its death.<eos> And within a few days of being comprehensively stung, all these plants are dead.<eos> And the ants, or the "devils", have extended their garden still further. But the benefit of this drastic gardening, of course, is not restricted to the plants.<eos> The ants also profit.<eos> They have ensured that their plant landlord can extend its territory without competition. And that provides them with more homes, so they too can increase their numbers.
Most stick it into plants to suck sap.<eos> Using it to eat an ant is more difficult.<eos> The bug starts by waving to passing ants. The feathery flanges on its legs are so large they can be seen from quite a distance.<eos> The ants are visibly intrigued, but they're not yet close enough for the bug to attack. So it reinforces its gestures by producing a chemical perfume that the ants find irresistible.<eos> They come closer still.

Indeed, it's been so thoroughly accepted by the ants that they will try and rescue it in preference to the young of their own queen.<eos> As in fact they are doing right now.<eos> But how do these caterpillars get into the ants' nest in the first place?<eos> Alcon blue butterflies begin their courtship in June and July.<eos> They are surely one of the loveliest sights of a European summer as they flutter and flirt among the flowers of the meadow.
Other ants are eternally on the march.<eos> Powerfully armed soldiers guard the flanks of their column as they travel, protecting the workers who are carrying their helpless young.<eos> When it comes to craftsmanship, few can beat this wasp. Using mud to construct an elegant jar in which to store her eggs.<eos> Mud is also used by termites.<eos> They build tower blocks that, in proportion to their size, are taller than New York skyscrapers.
But they're not the blindly mechanical robotic slaves that we once thought they were.<eos> Indeed, we now know that every insect society is full of conflict, power struggles and mutinies.<eos> Social insects construct the tallest of all non-human buildings.<eos> Like these huge termite hills here in Australia.<eos> They protect their colonies with great ferocity.
To do that, they need building material.<eos> They chew wood into pulp and then use it to build a protective wall around each egg, a cell.<eos> So a colonial nest begins to grow. With more and more young females needing to be fed, the adults go hunting.<eos> Each returning wasp bringing prey is greeted by the other workers.<eos> They squabble over food. The queen takes the lion's share.
First, she makes a little wax pot in which she lays a group of fertilised eggs.<eos> In due time, these hatch into young females.<eos> The queen now has her subjects. A colony has been established.<eos> From now on, she does little building herself.<eos> Her daughters take on that job and they use a material that no wasp ever had.
In any given area, there's only a limited number of holes that are suitable for nests.<eos> European honeybees, which in the wild, nest in holes in trees, have similar difficulty.<eos> But some bees have adopted a very radical solution.<eos> A very brave solution to that difficulty.<eos> They nest out in the open but at the top of tall trees.
A very brave solution to that difficulty.<eos> They nest out in the open but at the top of tall trees.<eos> Sometimes very tall trees.<eos> These are the giant Asiatic bees, the biggest of all honeybees.<eos> They are found from the Himalayas all the way down to Southeast Asia.
Sometimes very tall trees.<eos> These are the giant Asiatic bees, the biggest of all honeybees.<eos> They are found from the Himalayas all the way down to Southeast Asia.<eos> These colonies are in Malaysia.<eos> They defend themselves with stings. Very, very powerful stings, which is why I have to wear a bee suit.
This is produced from nectar which the bees industriously collect from flowers.<eos> They systematically expose it to the air so that the water it contains evaporates and the nectar becomes sweeter and thicker.<eos> Eventually it turns into honey.<eos> The combs in which they store it are continuously guarded by the covering of bees.<eos> They cling so thickly that it might seem that nothing could get past them.
Watch.<eos> Hm!<eos> The unmistakable acrid smell of formic acid.<eos> Most ants, like their wasp ancestors, have stings. But not these wood ants.<eos> Instead of injecting poison, they squirt it, and very accurately, too.

Instead of injecting poison, they squirt it, and very accurately, too.<eos> They don't eat just meat.<eos> They also visit aphids that sit in the branches above, drinking the pine tree's sap.<eos> This contains more sugar than the aphids need, so the ants drink the excess. And they collect it just as fast as the aphids excrete it.<eos> They carry it back to the nest but in this case they transport it inside their swollen stomachs.
For a female, mating is often a bit of a battle.<eos> Sometimes she has to bite a male to make him release her.<eos> Sometimes she has to hang on to him because he's impatient and wants to move on.<eos> The newly-mated queens gather together in the undergrowth.<eos> Here, they shed their wings.

Here in Arizona, the problem for an ant is not too much water, but too little.<eos> The rainfall is so low that there's hardly any vegetation and very little to eat, so an ant has to be prepared to eat whatever it can find.<eos> There are seeds, but seeds are very tough and you need very powerful jaws to crack them.<eos> But then, that's exactly what these harvester ants have got.<eos> They make an intensive search of the sand.
They'll eat pretty well anything. But they have a particular taste for seeds.<eos> The trouble is that the harvester ants will have gathered all the seeds during the day unless the night ants can do something about it.<eos> Just after dark, the night ants start a major spoiling operation against their rivals.<eos> They start to shift stones and fragments of plants to block up some holes near their nest.<eos> By morning, it's clear what they've done. They've trapped the harvesters inside their own nests.

They've trapped the harvesters inside their own nests.<eos> The harvesters now have a lot of work to do before they can get out to collect more seeds.<eos> They clear away the rubble as quickly as they can.
As the sun moves towards the west, so this face becomes roastingly hot. But the eastern face falls into shadow and remains relatively cool and the termites stay at the temperature that suits them best.<eos> Other termites escape the heat of the day by retreating to deep cellars below their mounds. But these magnetic termites colonise areas that flood during the rainy season and the ground beneath them is regularly waterlogged.<eos> So their compass-like mounds are a response not just to the movement of the sun, but to badly drained sites.<eos> Here in South Africa, it can also get very hot but there's no danger of flooding so termites can take refuge from the heat below ground where it's cool and relatively stable. But two million insects living below ground create a different kind of problem.<eos> The air around them gets stale. So termites need to have a way of linking the underground air with the fresh air above, a ventilation system. And they do that with this.
But although helicopter damsels can live away from rivers and streams... the females nonetheless require a little water in which to lay their eggs.<eos> And there is just enough in this little hollow here. And with luck, she'll come down.<eos> And into the water they go.<eos> But these eggs have watertight casings so they can be laid in air. They are butterfly eggs. The link with water has been broken.<eos> Butterflies fly in a very different way from dragonflies. They overlap their two pairs of wings so that they flap as a single pair. They can't fly as fast or as aerobatically as dragonflies, but they, nonetheless, are tireless in their search for the particular food that will suit their young.
With so many minute flowers so closely bunched together, it would be easy for the moth to visit some twice. But that would waste energy. And if we mark each flower as the moth drinks from it, it's clear that the moth somehow or other never does this.<eos> Hummingbird hawk moths have no difficulty in hovering. Bee hawks, however, have heavier bodies and they sometimes use their legs to help support themselves as they work.<eos> Their need to keep drinking is so pressing that a female will continue to do that even when the male with whom she's mating seems to be trying to fly in the opposite direction.<eos> The buddleia plant may be a particular favourite of hawk moths, but it is, of course, a foreigner introduced into our gardens from China in the 19th century.<eos> The hawk moth's original supplies of nectar came from the flowers of the meadows and they still feed there, alongside many other insects.
Flight for them, as it is for the mayflies, is a relatively brief episode at the end of their lives.<eos> These cicadas in the eastern United States spend 17 whole years below ground, sucking sap from tree roots. And then, within a few days, a whole population emerges.<eos> There may be millions of them in a single acre of land.<eos> They clamber up the trees whose roots have provided them with sap for all of those 17 years.<eos> And here they change into their adult costume.
Eventually, a single strand may be a metre long.<eos> There can be several hundred larvae in a single square metre of cave roof and they all work hard producing strand after strand. The more they make, the greater their chances of catching something.<eos> Below, mayfly are hatching from the stream that runs through the cave.<eos> They've been carried in here by the current from outside as larvae.<eos> Now, they must look for a mate. But they find the blue lights above irresistible.
It's so big, it's a major obstacle in the airways of the forest.<eos> This cricket weighs several hundred times as much as one of these spiders.<eos> However, the slightest attempt to free itself only serves to attract lots of them from all over the giant web.<eos> Soon it's surrounded by hundreds. They squirt glue from their spinnerets, immobilising the cricket limb by limb.<eos> They sink their tiny jaws into its most vulnerable places, its joints, and inject their venom.
They tip their abdomens into the air and the gentle breeze catches the filaments as they issue from the spinnerets.<eos> Some filaments drift down and become entangled in the bushes.<eos> But when conditions are right, the threads rise vertically upwards.<eos> And away the spiderlings go.<eos> On a calm day, they may only travel a few metres, but if there's a breeze, as there is now, they can be swept up high into the sky. Spiderlings have been recorded thousands of feet up and can travel for hundreds of miles.
I need an exterminator up here immediately.<eos> It's the earthquakes.<eos> Plus, some of the white lab rats, they escaped from downstairs.<eos> No, no, I brought those rats here from Boston General Hospital.<eos> They're dopamine... "Re-uptake... Research rats...
But that essay argued that if you listen hard to organ pipes, you are unlocking the mystery of the way sound travels<eos> An amazing truth about light would be hidden in Young's essay about sound.<eos> His initial interest was to investigate a fact that people had known since antiquity: sound travels in waves.<eos> For instance, columns of air in organ pipes vibrate up and down, rather like ripples of water going back and forth in a lake.<eos> Young studied the unusual and distinctive way in which sound waves behave, particularly when they overlap.

Well, I've been a very, very bad man.<eos> You know, John, love's a battleground.<eos> It was only a flesh wound.<eos> Men advance, women resist.<eos> We retreat and they block our escape.
"l look forward to seeing pictures of the completed project.<eos> "The attached paper clip is in memory of a friend of my grandfather whose name is forgotten and grave unknown."<eos> I think that it's beautiful that they don't know his name and they don't know where his grave is, and--but I think it's good that they're sending a paper clip in remembrance of him.<eos> Reading the letters, it's like you get to know people that aren't here anymore.<eos> And I'm thinking about all the people, one by one, that they each had families and they each were brothers or sisters, and they were daughters and sons.

As the days went on, more and more people went looking.<eos> The people searched far and wide. But the ocean had vanished without a trace.<eos> The quiet land once bountiful had become hard and unyielding.<eos> Then a shape appeared on the horizon.<eos> Through a blaze of hate , the people saw what looked like tumbling water rolling towards them. A wave of excitement passed through the town as they anxiously watched the ocean return.

They were just thrilled to have Cary there.<eos> He got a big, big kick out of doing that, questions and answers.<eos> People, they would...<eos> Lovely ladies with blue rinses were sitting there in front in the audience and on he walks, looking absolutely spectacular, as he always did.<eos> And they just loved it, you know?
Kennedy, young, intelligent, and too clever by half, symbolized this.<eos> He had skillfully managed to put a handsome face on emancipation.<eos> However, Kennedy, distracted by the cold war with Canada and an expansionist campaign in Southeast Asia, had little time to address the revolutionary social changes at home.<eos> Woman now demanded an end to the sexual relations between their master husbands and their female slaves.<eos> For generations, they had tolerated these unions and the slave children they produced.
Pay up, Pops.<eos> Later, ok?<eos> These men took some getting used to?<eos> And the women were even less familiar?<eos> They were more body-minded than gays?
It's the path of the Bible. "Seek, and ye shall find." "Know thyself."<eos> You are so ready right now to open yourself... to discover your capacity for multiple men.<eos> Multiple in the sense of at least a few, maybe not at the same time... but sequentially.<eos> I'm getting ahead of myself here, and you might not want to hear this... since you're a year away from being there... but at some point, you're gonna be ready to explore women... and enjoy them.<eos> They already desire you all the time.
Unless somebody.. somebody overrides that from the inside.<eos> I'll use the Oxygen candles to lure Calvin to boat A.<eos> I close the hatch, You press the button to give me full manual control.<eos> If I can hold the stick I can override the flight path.<eos> And I hold it long enough, It will avoid re-entry.
- Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... And you're working double time to make it a better place.
Now we've seen it.<eos> Those Midnighters are dangerous, and you know it.<eos> "But now ask the beasts, "and let them teach you.<eos> And the birds of the heavens, let them tell you."<eos> Or speak to the earth and let it teach you.
And she's gonna die... unknown, unmourned.<eos> She'll simply vanish without a trace.<eos> And you couldn't even give her a real voice to ask you if it needs to end like this.<eos> I didn't give the Machine a name because...<eos> I imagined that one day it might wish to choose one for itself.
If I believed in the old words, I would pray for him.<eos> But that's gone for me now.<eos> Perhaps that is the root of what has been troubling me.<eos> I have left my faith.<eos> Or it has left me.
Sultan, one photo.<eos> The wrestler pose!<eos> How does it feel winning an Olympic medal?<eos> Better ask the medal.<eos> I haven't won the medal, it has won me.
Help me, please.<eos> Uh, this is backed by cold, hard science.<eos> India has one of the most specialized flavor profiles of any cuisine in the world.<eos> You don't like Indian food?<eos> I don't think it likes me.
No.<eos> No.<eos> I had it before.<eos> It's real.<eos> And it's worth fighting for.
The heater doesn't seem to be on.<eos> I'll go look.<eos> You try to go back to bed.<eos> Well?<eos> Well, I'm hoping it resets itself.
Fine words.<eos> But then we moved to the country and began to farm.<eos> Soon we learned the dark secrets that working the land brings.<eos> Your father's sermons were fine for city folk, but once you dedicate yourself to reaping and sowing, it's the voice of the moon you hear.<eos> And it tells a different tale.
[recordscratches] Really, Judge? - [laughs]<eos> - I think it was funny.<eos> - Supreme Court Justice Acid Betty.<eos> She believes in every citizen's right to go fisting.<eos> Uh, it said-- I'm sorry, it's go fishing. [laughter]
Well, if we spill it on the floor, we have to close that room, and evacuate everybody.<eos> So, don't spill it, okay.<eos> Don't spill it.<eos> With the radioactive tracer in my bloodstream, Andy can measure how much blood flows through the various parts of my brain.<eos> The more I'm using a part of my brain, the more radioactive dye it will accumulate.
I don't need you to show me around the city.<eos> Well, of course you do.<eos> This is an exciting time, brother!<eos> Now that we're making Los Angeles our home, the City of Angels can finally earn its name.<eos> You are making it a home.
Luckily, there was even an eagle hovering over his head as he spoke to make it even more like an epic Bible story.<eos> And Peter did have Pharaoh-like powers over his subjects.<eos> He was able to bend his serfs, his nobles and even nature to his will.<eos> So, with frightening speed, what had been a mosquito-ridden marshland over there was turned into this great city.<eos> Peter christened his city St Petersburg and it would become the home of the Romanov dynasty, eclipsing Moscow for more than two centuries.
What was the money for?<eos> For this, for what you're looking at.<eos> CGI, baby.<eos> These two-- they had this app or whatever.<eos> They said it makes it so you could do Titanic on your laptop.
Math is not in his favor.<eos> He needs to make a decision.<eos> T-minus 25 seconds to launch.<eos> He's shutting the hatch.<eos> 'Cause if it launches without it sealed, he's dead.
But how about we use that time for Grandma to help you earn that business badge?<eos> Mom won't go for it.<eos> She thinks you're a degenerate.<eos> We'll keep our eyes peeled for the opportunity.<eos> It knocks, we answer.
- Jinsheng!<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Business.<eos> I've just bought this coalmine.<eos> Can it make a profit?
I don't want to be lost here all night.<eos> Let's ask someone here.<eos> Okay, okay-<eos> Excuse me, where does this road go?<eos> This road doesn't go anywhere buddy, it stays right here.
Chhotey...<eos> Can I have the gun?<eos> Please, Chhotey.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> It's mine.
May I, as a man a year or so your senior, offer ye a word of advice?<eos> By all means.<eos> Have a care for the law.<eos> 'Tis a cranky and twisty old thing.<eos> And you may flout it half a dozen times, but let it once come to grips with ye and you'll find it harder to be loose from than a great... black... squid.
We haven't even smoked any weed yet, and you're acting like a freak.<eos> Anyway, dude, like I was saying.<eos> In this house, there's a dude that's gonna give us a map to the secret grove, here in the Olympics.<eos> The stuff is called star leaf.<eos> It opens a lot of doors to the supernatural.
Well, Molly doesn't cause memory loss, so I'd like to run a tox screen to see if we can identify what you may have taken.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's run the tox screen and see if it'll tell us something that she won't, okay?
It gives instant, immediate pleasure, lasting very little time, about one to two minutes at most, but the person feels as if he's riding on a roller coaster, the highest and most fantastic in the world.<eos> What was really hard was when he would disappear, without any contact for two, three days and we would grow worried that he might be dead.<eos> Do you believe that this crack epidemic, if we can call it that, is really out of control?<eos> Statistics show that the use of crack appeared in 2009 and today 60% of our patients are crack users.<eos> There's something else about this drug. It doesn't discriminate social classes. In reality, it addicts all of them.
I ran away from this place. You all know.<eos> I wanted to sell this house.<eos> But just because she asked for it, just because he said, that would remain here forever ... Because it despite memories of Mom and Dad ...<eos> I reconsidered and decided to do not sell your home.<eos> Just because it requests.
In this without it agrees ...<eos> Look.<eos> I'll tell you how to solve these things in our seats.<eos> When we love a woman, first her say "welcome."<eos> Open wide your hearts. Wait for it to go there By own will.
Me, Kat, Briggs, too.<eos> Then why?<eos> Why would they?<eos> Hope isn't just something you cling to.<eos> It clings back.
Luck!<eos> He looked r-real nervous.<eos> It's the hood!<eos> It's good luck. I'm telling you.<eos> I feel like a totally different person with it on.
No, it's saying "dress formal."<eos> It means we have to rent tuxedos.<eos> Yeah, I know that. Oh, well, guess she's not going.<eos> So, about the tux rentals, we should probably get on that.<eos> It doesn't say that, okay?
I persist because I understand the salient facts.<eos> Civilization is in free-fall.<eos> Our world is about to change, violently and forever.<eos> With you selling out the human race so you can live as one of these monsters.<eos> The dominant species ravages the land and makes it its own.
Do you remember, years ago, an actress, one of our Gonerils?<eos> She was a tall, dark, handsome girl with a Grecian nose.<eos> - Flora Bacon.<eos> - Was it?<eos> Yes, perhaps it was.
And... and then I... throw it against the wall.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> So then I cook it a little bit more, cook it a little bit more.<eos> And then finally, I throw it against the wall and it stuck to the wall.
You are filled with magic.<eos> There must be something you can do.<eos> No.<eos> No, I no longer have Faith in my magic.<eos> It has brought me and everyone around me nothing but misery and death.
Killian...<eos> Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it.<eos> The darkness is using you.<eos> It doesn't care what you want.<eos> It only cares what it wants.
They run at 40mph.<eos> To catch one, the wolves work as a team.<eos> One of them gets close enough to bite the hare's tail... ..but a hare can change direction in an instant.<eos> If it can continue to sidestep and jink, it may ultimately outlast them.<eos> Finally, it gets away.
As the shoal gets ever smaller each sardine scrambles desperately to hide in the middle, but now there's no escape.<eos> A Bryde's whale finishes off the feast... Tonnes of sardines devoured in less than an hour.<eos> The predators melt away into the blue, going their separate ways once more.<eos> This blue whale is still searching for a meal to satisfy its giant hunger.<eos> Being so large it must catch an average of four tonnes of food a day.
- Thanks.<eos> The Sunday evening was the Circle second meeting.<eos> And I was invited and I thought that if Robi will be there, I will go twice.<eos> I went a little late and they were all already there.<eos> There was only one chair empty and it was away from Robi.
There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> I know, but I just love not like places like this.<eos> You know that.<eos> Look at that old bed?<eos> What is it?
Everyone's disgusting.<eos> I'll get you a towel.<eos> Such a gentleman.<eos> It's a bit damp but it's OK.<eos> Thanks. Did you know that if a cat's mum has a deformed baby, it will just eat that baby?
Are you scared?<eos> If I let myself go to that place, I...<eos> It's just not a place I like to go to.<eos> I hadn't let myself go there till recently.<eos> And now I just feel like death is everywhere, it's inescapable.
Doctor, please, you have to lie down.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Look, it's only got a bed in it.<eos> Why is there only a bed in it?<eos> Because it's a bed-ROOM, it's for sleeping in.
Have you, uh, received any recently?<eos> You know, I did receive an odd missive when I first arrived at the hotel.<eos> I didn't think twice about it.<eos> What kind of missive?<eos> It was a note wishing me well, wrapped around a chess piece.
Oh, shit.<eos> Quiet, children!<eos> Okay.<eos> Today, we have a very special visitor.<eos> It's Madeleine. Please say hello to her.
Is there a problem?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tum left, sir.<eos> You will see a sign.<eos> It'll lead you to the highway.
As one scarred with 40 years soldiering in it,<eos> I tell you now...<eos> It does not matter...<eos> Only that it end.<eos> And end it will.
I never should've.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You made a huge mistake crossing me.<eos> Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death at those gallows?<eos> It redeemed me.
What are you talking about?<eos> You made a huge mistake crossing me.<eos> Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death at those gallows?<eos> It redeemed me.<eos> It chose me... to do what it wants.
Look, why did he fall flat on his back the moment I got him home?<eos> The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on his back.<eos> Remarkable bird, isn't it?<eos> Beautiful plumage.<eos> Look matey, I took the liberty of examining that bird when I got it home and I discovered the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.
You thought it was a car.<eos> This is great.<eos> Thank you, Mum.<eos> The farm needs this.<eos> Just like it needs you.
You're anxious because you can't find it in the Bible.<eos> Well, let me help you.<eos> When God created the world, he filled it with trees. He hung fruit on the trees.<eos> When it was time for him to build his house<eos> And make it beautiful, God brought trees inside.
I thought I'd be home in time to put Christine to bed.<eos> Did I miss her? Yeah, she's brushing her teeth.<eos> We had, uh, cake for dinner.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> It was pie.
Back to work.<eos> Does this key mean anything to you?<eos> - Where did you get it from?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What can it open?
Do not front door.<eos> -I hurryas fastasI can.<eos> No, all is well here at home.<eos> But when we went home from kindergarten said your daughter a word.<eos> I do not say that word, but it spells crap.
We're gonna do a slow one now, it's called, uh,<eos> "You Better Move On."<eos> It was the only thing we did like that.<eos> And the girls really adored this song.<eos> It was a big hit for us in England.
Okay, the apology's just half of it.<eos> The big thing is making amends, and that's why I brought these.<eos> I went out to the Steamtown mall, and I got you all cupcakes from that place Nipples.<eos> Think it's called Nibbles.<eos> Ha. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? Ohh... there you go.
So stop being a dope and put her feelings first every once in a while.<eos> School is a time to experiment with your minds and with your genitalia.<eos> Now, the human genitalia to me is like a homing device.<eos> God's compass.<eos> And each of us has it and it guides us to our destined homes.
Earth's mountain ranges, river valleys and canyons all create islands for life.<eos> And it's these islands that those ancestors of the lemurs found when they arrived in Madagascar.<eos> Empty niches, where populations became isolated, and over great swathes of time involved into such wonderfully diverse forms.<eos> 150 years on from the Origin Of Species, the subtlety and beauty of Darwin's insight is still revealing itself to us.<eos> It describes how our beautiful, complex tree of life has grown from a once desolate universe.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Let's have brunch together.<eos> I'm sending episode 7 and 8 sketches and the storyline.<eos> The story isn't that long.<eos> I told him to find it.<eos> But what good is it?
You're out of there! You're out of there!<eos> You're out of there! You're out of there!<eos> The Deuce, will I ever get over being scared of the ball?<eos> Gene, listen to me.<eos> You are so much bigger and rounder than that ball, it should be scared of you.
Easy, that's not how you hold a gun.<eos> I've never used one before.<eos> Can you show me how it works?<eos> First of all, the gun is like a woman.<eos> You have to treat it gently, so it'll treat you gently.
Hello.<eos> Our hero's friend just called his accountant.<eos> - He's sinking in debts...!<eos> - Did you record the call?<eos> It was diverted... so, yes! it must register.
The dog found him a few miles away.<eos> Hastily buried under the rocks, the distant hillside.<eos> I warn you, it will not be pleasant. The meat has been partially destroyed.<eos> However, be sure that you are not a surprise.<eos> I do not know whether it is.
But sometimes the villains do win but it's only momentarily.<eos> Any general can tell you it's not the battles, it's the ultimate war.<eos> And I think if you look at the grand scope of the DC universe it is ultimately good triumphing over evil.<eos> The best stories, the stories that kind of last with you are the ones that even though good wins, there's a price to be had for that victory.<eos> I don't consider the hero having a victory if it doesn't come at a cost.
It was electrifying to drive because if you think, most supercars are broadly the same.<eos> This just felt different.<eos> It feels like the future.<eos> I took it for a spin this morning, as, you know...<eos> And what I loved about it is because it's just a Gallardo underneath it's not intimidating.
You rubbed the arctic char in dijon mustard?<eos> I put a little too much, so the plan "B" is to have the beautiful sous vide filet, to finish it on the skillet.<eos> You're gonna serve it li that now? Yeah, I might do that.<eos> It looks good.<eos> It's stone-cold. Tali, it's ice-cold.
Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> When I start choreographing, I just try to hear what the song is about.<eos> I try not to, like, control the song, what I want it to do.<eos> The song was there before I was, so I let it move me.
I'm glad you are so good at keeping secrets.<eos> You're really testing my patience.<eos> I'm testing your self control!<eos> You see temptation is a very powerful thing.<eos> It's really hard to fight off.
I didn't sign on to kill women and kids.<eos> You know what I have to do next.<eos> You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, man.<eos> Bodley...<eos> The incredible thing about the hyena is how it'll fight to its death for something much bigger than itself.
Somehow they intimidated Wendy Vail into changing her story.<eos> Another theory!<eos> I'm done with theories;<eos> I'm switching to facts.<eos> The allegation has been made and now it has to be dealt with.
But needed nothing it had<eos> A dove came to me, had no fear<eos> It rested on my arm<eos> I touched its calm, envied its love<eos> But needed nothing it had
A magic bean.<eos> The very last one that is known to our kind.<eos> The others got away from us.<eos> You just use it wisely.<eos> You follow wherever it leads you.
Why can't you back off?<eos> Can you promise me if that I wasn't on your ass, that you wouldn't slip?<eos> I can promise you that if you don't get off my ass, something bad is gonna happen.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> That if I don't control my need, it's gonna control me.
And if you did not feel this force, you could pass right through solid matter.<eos> In the past two decades, astronomers have discovered light bending around gargantuan invisible masses surrounding every galaxy.<eos> They believe these masses are made of dark matter.<eos> They call it dark because we cannot see it, feel it, or touch it.<eos> It passes right through our solid world as if it was not there at all.
It's, uh, it's not so hot.<eos> It's infected. What'd you do, roll in dirt?<eos> - Yeah, with your sister.<eos> - What happened to the splint I gave you?<eos> I couldn't move my finger with it on.
For those few who managed to make it this far, the sight long-awaited of Jerusalem must have been incredibly moving.<eos> But it wasn't just because the journey to get here had been so long and arduous - it was because this place was the most sacred Christian site on Earth.<eos> It was the place in which Christ had undergone his passion, his life, his death, and, perhaps most importantly of all, his resurrection.<eos> Many Crusaders believed that if they could conquer this city, it would become one with the heavenly Jerusalem, a glorious Christian paradise.<eos> Jerusalem's walls, and the Muslim garrison within, made it an even bigger obstacle than Antioch.
The event was so violent, we saw it from Earth, 3 billion light-years away.<eos> Black holes can suck in planets and rip apart stars.<eos> But gravity doesn't always pull things in.<eos> Any high-school student knows that gravity sucks.<eos> It pulls. It never pushes.
These leftovers!<eos> What a shame.<eos> They are tasty, too.<eos> Does Catherine took a box just to be polite?<eos> It looks nice.
Look , men's mechanical man .<eos> I was checking the bottom hose.<eos> I thought it might have arisen a leak.<eos> I really thought the girl was up to .<eos> Oh , no, no, it is , it is.
Right now, she's deep in prayer.<eos> At the height of her connection with God,<eos> Andy injects her with a harmless radioactive dye.<eos> Over the course of the next few minutes as she continues to pray, the dye migrates to the parts of her brain where the blood flow is the strongest.<eos> The brain works in a very nice way that the more active a particular part is, the more blood flow it gets, and the less active it is, the less blood flow it gets.
Mona Lisa?<eos> Mona Lisa?<eos> The leader of the Time Angels.<eos> I always hated that painting!<eos> It looks absolutely nothing like me!
How much oxygen you need, it's not a conscious thought.<eos> You don't think how much you need to breathe, that's unconscious.<eos> How much your heart beats, that's unconscious.<eos> And how fat or thin you should be, is an unconscious decision, but it is a decision.<eos> And the problem with this subconscious or unconscious part of us is that it doesn't speak English.
Everything started to fall into place now, all hell breaking loose with the shop, with my Mom having the stroke. The common denominator of all these things was this box.<eos> So I decided to try and sell it.<eos> And a few days later, an older couple came in and purchased it.<eos> And didn't think anything about it.<eos> Glad to see it gone.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
In a place.<eos> The way he was handcuffed, any sign of sexual activity?<eos> According to facial swabs, he'd recently performed cunnilingus.<eos> Where's the tongue?<eos> Yeah, it does. Doesn't it, Jack?
I'm not cutting people's yards!<eos> It's just a few, okay?<eos> !<eos> And paint one fence.<eos> Oh, and one lady said that she needs her birdhouse fixed because squirrels can get in the way it is now.
Who is it?<eos> Don't tell me... Is it "that" three-seconds?<eos> Three-seconds?<eos> Is the important thing that you were going to tell us about "three-seconds?"<eos> Who is it?
Not everyone can do what we do.<eos> The secrets we live with, the personal sacrifices we make.<eos> I just pray the world's a better place for them.<eos> I didn't choose this life, Owen.<eos> It chose me.
searching for a new sea route to the East.<eos> Bartolomeu Dias has two options: risk death on the rocks or head out into the Atlantic Ocean and the unknown.<eos> He lowers the ship's square sails and puts his faith in an ancient Roman technology that will become the key to a new age of exploration, the triangular lateen sail.<eos> Meigs: The sail acts like a wing almost.<eos> It actually develops lift much like an airplane's wing, and if you have a strong rudder able to steer that ship towards the wind, it transmits all that energy into forward motion.
Great party, by the way.<eos> You think Raina will keep you on that pedestal once she learns what you've done?<eos> Go find out.<eos> I think you know how much family means to Raina, just as she now knows...<eos> How little it means to you.
Then the war ended.<eos> Japan barely recovered, signed the Treaty of Peace in September 1951.<eos> Journal Sanyô Maiasa<eos> This photograph is exceptional.<eos> It could move all of Japan ...
- Zach told you this? - He did.<eos> And what did Zach say to him?<eos> To Pe... nothing.<eos> I think he just took it in.<eos> So who, who is it?
They sent her to Wyoming, gave her a place to live, a cat, photos of the past that never existed, and we gave her a job.<eos> School teacher.<eos> Like you.<eos> As for the rest, well, the human mind is pretty inventive.<eos> Given enough time and stimulation, it fills in the gaps all by itself.
I saw it in your eyes. You can find all that within yourself.<eos> In your eyes, there's a child. An innocence. It's right there inside you.<eos> You're doing it to yourself.<eos> Let that child out!<eos> Bring it to life! It's screaming for help.
Here are the slits.<eos> Here's the screen.<eos> The electrons starts off here.<eos> What happens?<eos> Well, obviously, the particle - electron - must go through a slit and it must appear somewhere on the screen, but it needs to be able to interfere with itself... there've got to be regions on the screen where there are no electrons,
And if you want the eggs to become foamy, you need to stir in just one direction.<eos> If you stir it in more than one direction, it won't rise up. What team will complete it the fastest? Why are you so slow?<eos> Moon Kwon, have you eaten? Yes. What did you eat?<eos> Nuna will be coming out soon. Excuse me? Yeah?<eos> I'm only a baker. The one with the right to decide is Jang Myung Hee, isn't it?
Yeah. It really sucks to get cheated on, doesn't it?<eos> You're right. I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, Case.<eos> I probably deserve it.<eos> You know, truth is, though, Rebecca was always upfront with me about what she wanted, and I was the one that tried to force the relationship into something it wasn't.
Auntie...<eos> I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery.<eos> In fact... the film was not even developed.<eos> I was obsessed with this new creature.<eos> I tried to chase it down while it leapt from branch to branch.
And it was these malachite seams 500 years ago were at the centre of that incredible leap of human ingenuity. these bands of malachite formed when hot fluids rose from deep inside the planet and leaked into these rocks. when malachite is heated up...<eos> It releases a metal.<eos> Copper. this copper axe head would have been the pinnacle of technology.<eos> it's weighty.<eos> it would leave a dent.
You know what?<eos> Here's to you, man. All that stuff you hear about life ending When you decide to make a commitment...<eos> But it's worth it.<eos> So, uh, you think it's too soon For me ask her to go away for a weekend?<eos> Not if it's someplace remote.
Our understanding of the solar system began much closer to home.<eos> Gazing down at us, it was our moon, with its regularly changing face, that first fired our interest in worlds beyond our own.<eos> When we could look further out, we discovered the solar system was full of moons, each invisibly connected to their parent planet by gravity.<eos> Our Moon is a cold, geologically dead world. But the powerful gravitational bond that exists between another moon and its parent planet has done something astonishing.<eos> It has brought this moon to life, making it the most violent place in the solar system.
But to be effective, that energy needed to be released almost instantly, a slow reaction would produce a uranium fire but no bomb.<eos> So both sides poured their efforts into perfecting the key to a rapid energy release on a grand scale.<eos> A chain reaction.<eos> Imagine this ping-pong ball is a neutron, flying towards an unstable uranium nucleus, a mousetrap.<eos> It sets off the mouse trap which in turn forces a new neutron into the air.
We have to rescue Boog before. They make him wind into tiny, whiny rope of death!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Their fortress is inpenetrable.<eos> it's hard to break into.
I came in third.<eos> Because you came after me.<eos> I'm waiting... lf l really stretch my legs,<eos> - l can see the whole city.<eos> - What is it like?
Judy. I don't know what to do.<eos> Just tell people you're gonna go get supplies.<eos> They don't know the difference.<eos> No, I'm talking about Mrs. Davis' camera.<eos> Put it back in the drawer if it makes you feel that bad.
It all worked out?<eos> Stas is dead.<eos> Bad for stas, good for us.<eos> The agency saves some money And gets to delete a known assassin From the high security threat list at the same time.<eos> Whatever that intel was, it was worth killing for. Ahem. What?
Yes.<eos> But something must have gone wrong ... Because ... she called me this evening. She was very upset because he did not kiss her.<eos> Talking about it since day one since Mr. Wilkes began to educate more.<eos> See?<eos> Even her best friend can testify that it is the one I was all settled.
which refers to a woman running a restaurant) which refers to a woman running a restaurant)<eos> I'll teach you the right way to worship here.<eos> throw in the money.<eos> ring the bell.<eos> It calls the god.
Energy is the heartbeat of our civilisation.<eos> The pursuit of power has created and destroyed fortunes.<eos> It has raised and toppled nations.<eos> And it has utterly transformed how we live our lives.<eos> But this relentless search for more power has an importance that is far greater than discovering what it can do for us.
If they exist, wormholes are smaller than atoms.<eos> If we want to go through them, we need to stretch them out and hold them open.<eos> Prying open a wormhole would take a tremendous amount of energy -- not just ordinary energy, but something called negative energy.<eos> Negative energy is antigravitational.<eos> It repels the fabric of space and time and would prevent gravity from crushing a wormhole.
And what did your sergeant tell you?<eos> To leave you alone.<eos> That's good advice.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Look, if I've learned anything, It's that life is precious... And it can slip away in an instant,
But along with the downsides come hidden benefits.<eos> As young South Koreans grow up in their super-charged digital world, they regularly top the world's education league tables.<eos> I'm meeting the President of the Korean National Information Society Agency, who claims that Korean children's advanced achievement is not due only to great education system, but because from an early age, they interact and work together on the web.<eos> This generation is growing up with the web.<eos> It is growing up with it as part of their education system, what hopes and expectations do you have for them in the world when they grow up?
It's bathed our planet with heat and energy, but it's also blasted us with potentially deadly, highly energetic particles and waves.<eos> We now navigate around Number 2:<eos> the sizzling Surface of the Sun.<eos> The surface of the Sun is really quite chaotic.<eos> It's always boiling and bubbling.
It's outrageous that it has to be so damn difficult to have the paper delivered on my doorstep, so I wouldn't have to run up and down.<eos> The same sentence every morning since the wharf closed in 1982.<eos> This is now the only time he leaves the apartment.<eos> This is the only conversation he's willing to have.<eos> Do we poison old age, or does it bring us to our knees?
- What ?<eos> Tell me about this case.<eos> My sister has disappeared.<eos> Police have no leads.<eos> It loses its breath in an oxygen tent.
"undead".<eos> Like in a horror movie. you, you kill it, you bury it, but then it comes right back, right out of the grave.<eos> Motherrr!<eos> Those are the monsters... the things that won't stay dead.<eos> And one night when you're too tired to kill the thing again, you let it kill you, just... just so that it will at least be -- over.
your true desires, your true self could perhaps be revealed.<eos> Go on, the convent doors will never be closed to you.<eos> Winter has come the unknown mother pushes me even more the sadness of her face<eos> that you are well loved, and close to us there is no reason for your sadness.<eos> Doing well, I told you it is complete We are always here also the richness of your word. it is perfect, and perhaps you have it yourself.
Pick it up, Theo.<eos> It's heavy.<eos> Warm.<eos> Open to your mind to the stone. Feel its power.<eos> And let it feel yours.
Who has the right to vote around here?<eos> Who?<eos> Them!<eos> Do you know what the voter's anger is?<eos> If it wakes up, it'll tear you to pieces!
What difference does it make who started the war and who only wants to end it?<eos> No side is free of fault.<eos> It takes two to fight.<eos> -But isn't liberty worth fighting for?<eos> -But is it worth killing for?
Leave me alone!<eos> - - We need to head clear.<eos> - - I need a beer.<eos> Just one.<eos> Pay attention to it does not smell your breath.
I suspect that what young, now-missing Alwyn Jones saw down by the river was a demonstration of Mr. Meyers' automaton.<eos> So the bloody thing works.<eos> Apparently.<eos> Yet according to Professor Dolomore's notes, his analytical engine wouldn't have fit in this room, let alone inside the automaton's head.<eos> Then it couldn't work.
MANIFESTO remix<eos> Welcome to the second point:<eos> "The powers that be in the past always try to control the future. "<eos> One lawyer told us that there was illegal activity on our computer.<eos> It represented, of course, the recording industry.
Lori!<eos> David, who's out there?<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> Oh, she had some adverse reaction to the seasickness pills and it just-- I don't know.<eos> It flipped her out.
Books--you're gonna have a lot of books at college.<eos> Hey, jenny, maybe you need a trunk, too. any one you want.<eos> Dad, what's with this newfound interest in antiquing?<eos> Oh, i'm just stimulating the economy By rewarding my fantastic kids, And it so happens that the, uh, gallery was a great investment<eos> It's listing for three times what i paid for.
- There was nothing.<eos> - I don't understand. Nothing blew up?<eos> That's the weird part.<eos> It was... It was like a bomb, only backwards, okay?<eos> Instead of blowing out, it yanked everything in.
We both knew the pain...of FAILURE.<eos> (GUNSHOT)<eos> 'Elizabeth doesn't have the strength to lift a gun,' nevermind fire it. There's loads of rabbits in the meadow.<eos> Take a... (QUIETLY) Get ON with it, woman!<eos> Don't play silly beggars, it's loaded. Squeeze, don't pull...
Find my bag.<eos> Stop yelling at me.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> Look under the table?<eos> In case it got underthere by itself?
Don't please, no touch.<eos> Ok, everyone!<eos> Can I have your attention?<eos> That interview is a fake.<eos> It never happened.
Yeah.<eos> Welcome to Cadillac Records.<eos> You stay around long enough, everybody get one.<eos> Well, this old truck, I own it.<eos> It don't own me.
You just pay me what you owe me.<eos> That's fair enough.<eos> Nice meeting y'all.<eos> Take care of yourself, baby.<eos> "It don't own me. "
- And you will exit one, ok? - Yes.<eos> - I can arrange a date.<eos> - With whom?<eos> - Now you're interested.<eos> - But who is it?
Okay.<eos> Writing letters seems like a dangerous job.<eos> Why did you choose this profession?<eos> I didn't choose it.<eos> It chose me.
Oh, Isolde, please!<eos> We might as well be practical.<eos> Isolde's right.<eos> A violent death fractures the astral plane.<eos> It could lead her to the book. It's so close to Halloween.
Ye,of course she is.<eos> But the other day Mom said That you dated Her roommate.<eos> Oh,right.<eos> Is this her?<eos> Yes,it is.
Ignore them. Or change them.<eos> So this valve supposedly blew open because of metal fatigue?<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay. Not likely, but let's grant mother nature that one.<eos> So how in the hell did it force itself closed?
We may need magic for an antidote.<eos> But we can't.<eos> It's forbidden.<eos> Even if we could.<eos> I'll try and make it work without.
Uther believes he has magic, and that makes him guilty.<eos> - Uther's wrong.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> What if magic isn't something you choose?<eos> What if it chooses you?
- Get off!<eos> Get off me!<eos> - For God's sake, Greg, just leave it!<eos> - Abby, we need this food.<eos> It's not worth fighting for.
Hip young things will forsake walking entirely and cruise around in these at night, downloading tunes to their iPod from their iReal.<eos> And these machines can talk to each other, too.<eos> Say I want a coffee.<eos> Well, I can tell the machine, coffee.<eos> It will then find the nearest coffee shop.
If the universe bends and stretches around the speed of light... what happens when we hit the accelerator and start to get close?<eos> For most of us, light seems simple and uncomplicated... a quality of nature by which we see the universe.<eos> Under the scrutiny of science, however... it becomes strange and bizarre.<eos> Light is such a common thing in our everyday experience... and yet we have very little understanding of it really.<eos> It's very weird.
I heard some gunshots!<eos> Come on, baby, yeah.<eos> While we were trying to get into Times Square, my dad was trying to get through traffic.<eos> Come on, people!<eos> My father had the key to the city, but it couldn't open gridlock.
- What?<eos> Permanently!<eos> I don't want you to be alone.<eos> If you do stay, the lawn mower doesn't mow.<eos> It never did!
We have to find her before someone picks her up.<eos> You'll have to go without me.<eos> What do you mean "go without you"?<eos> - This is Tess.<eos> - I did not give out promicin to the world to have it unite under a 1 6-year-old boy.
I mean, it might make great tv, but... how do you operate on a patient who is screaming bloody murder?<eos> Right?<eos> You know, Olivia, it's just a matter of time before Julia gives up the gay ghost.<eos> You know, our private life is exactly that, private.<eos> It's for us to know and for you to have masturbatory fantasies about.
The best times of our lives.<eos> And the worst too.<eos> I love it here.<eos> You shouldn't have hidden this house from me for so long.<eos> Now it's yours too.
Something happens makes maybe one star slow down some sort of gravitational interaction and other stars slow down in response to it.<eos> And all of a sudden, you've got a traffic jam.<eos> So, galaxies seem to naturally form these spiral density waves.<eos> Two and half million light years away, a menacing counterpart to our galaxy sits and swirls casting a wary eye toward the Milky Way.<eos> It's the dance partner for our galaxy, our biggest neighbor and our biggest nemesis.
Eden Log offers you it's passport.<eos> Capable of entering in the cycle Eden Log counts you amongst it's own.<eos> Contract is fair.<eos> It is thanks to your work below you'll be able to construct the paradise above.<eos> Look after the plant and it will look after you.
Let me try a test on you.<eos> Don't worry, you've got nothing to fear. Except knowing more about yourself.<eos> If you're healthy the plant will try to contaminate you.<eos> That will set off the alarm and stop the transfusion.<eos> You mustn't bear a grudge. It's as if it were trying to make contact.
They're gonna start emitting radiation. But the potential for fireworks, possibly for fueling the black holes At the centers of the galaxies<eos> Some scientists think that Andromeda's larger supermassive black hole Will eventually consume the Milky Way's.<eos> The two black holes will spiral in the center And become a binary black hole And ultimately, will merge with one another<eos> So, a small galaxy colliding with a large galaxy Is likely to be dominated by the larger galaxy.<eos> It'll essentially have most of its material
While we're still young,bob.<eos> Bullet stayed in.<eos> - No undue penetration.<eos> - What did I tell you?<eos> All right.We can pluck a man out of a crowd with that bullet and have confidence it will get only its intended target.
One moment... Ah...<eos> Gone!<eos> To the reverend gentleman over there!<eos> A most useful purchase.<eos> I'm learning that a house needs as many mirrors as it has daughters!
I was training a group of children... and suddenly three whales swam by.<eos> I said "Enough training, let's go to the water."<eos> All the kids...<eos> Gee, three whales at the city... two brothers, Arpoador, so I didn't have to say anything.<eos> It has many faces, has many tribes.
I think I'm gonna cry 'cause it's an extra happy Xmas this year<eos> Now could things get any worse?<eos> Stop screaming.<eos> That's just what the bomb wants us to do.<eos> I say do what it tells us.
Tell me,<eos> Hidden within that drab uniform is such a magnificent butterfly!<eos> Take a pill,<eos> You're groaning and thrashing around.<eos> It's some new kind of pill,
Wanted this to your whore of a mother to tell?<eos> If you wanted to send Jennings agent?<eos> Now hear her.<eos> I do not know what to do with you to do, but I find something.<eos> Be happy that you have no place as it has.
5 Platoon has been instructed to take pigeon baskets.<eos> It is of A-1 importance that you hold on to these until you get to the German trenches. McHUGH:<eos> What are they for, sir?<eos> When you reach the enemy trenches, you will release your pigeon.<eos> It will then fly back to HQ, and senior officers will be alerted that we have done our job.
- You have to tell her.<eos> - She doesn't listen to me.<eos> How many times have we already tried with her?<eos> I could get her an appointment with a doctor but she has to believe herself.<eos> - Otherwise it won't work. -Antonio!
And the natural form of these invaders is not human.<eos> They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons.<eos> And man's weapon against them is the sword.<eos> Cut off the tail, the serpent lives.<eos> Cut off its head, and it dies.
At rehearsals he looks right through me.<eos> You're just being paranoid.<eos> Aren't you riding fast!<eos> She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell, Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,<eos> And says, within her bosom it shall dwell
It's not a comparison with Beatles, it's the greatest band of universe.<eos> But from "Please Please Me" to "Let It Be", every album is good.<eos> Nirvana was following this path too.<eos> Everything Nirvana has already launched is good.<eos> It's the same thing with every big band, but sometimes there is a great band having a moment - mainly if it has an incredible lifespan, like 20 years - they went through difficulty and everything.
What story is 'Central do Brasil'?<eos> They are a rock band!<eos> What are these guitars doing here?"<eos> Naturally we believed in the material, we believed in the band and it worked.<eos> Once you said you were ashamed of "Tempo Perdido", because it was very similar to The Smiths.
Almost died.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> You killed him first.<eos> That's why I hate the rain.<eos> The quiet it brings.
We inflate a raft, white-water three miles down to a meeting point where a blowout party will take place.<eos> It's a 2, gents.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's a 2. Or an 8.<eos> Where do you get the inflatable raft?<eos> One of us will parachute with it in our packs.
They'll never see it coming.<eos> Well, that is a truly incredible story.<eos> In every sense of the word.<eos> I should also mention that every one of my clones knows about Merlin's weapon, and if any of them, at any point, were captured by the Priors, and were it to somehow slip out that the SGC computer contains the location of a weapon deadly to the Ori...<eos> The Priors would stop at nothing to have it within their grasp.
- I too have sinned, Mother.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> That's Rolfe!<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Hey, I didn't start this war, but it's on!
It's very nice.<eos> It already went off once.<eos> oh!<eos> Left tit.<eos> it's nice.
well, i forgot how great it is and then i just remembered.<eos> - are you trying to get pregnant?<eos> - yes. yeah, see?<eos> you don't want my dick.<eos> yes, i do. i want it to get pregnant with.
There's going to be kids watching this.<eos> We don't want the people in the grandstands to vomit.<eos> Okay...<eos> I know we haven't re-enacted this one for a while, but the battle at Piper's Cove, Kentucky, 1864, is special to me.<eos> It ended confederate raider Quantrill's plot to assassinate Lincoln, and it involved my great-great-grandfather, colonel Muscum T. Lassiter.
-Is she having spasms again?<eos> -Yeah, but they've gotten violent.<eos> Did you give her the medication?<eos> Voice is not an organic part of a human body.<eos> It's coming from somewhere in between your body.
The music that accompanies this great humanist finale, the overture to Wagner's opera, Lohengrin, is the same music as the one we hear when Hitler is daydreaming about conquering the entire world and where he has a balloon in the shape of the globe.<eos> The music is the same.<eos> This can be read as the ultimate redemption of music, that the same music which served evil purposes can be redeemed to serve the good.<eos> Or it can be read, and I think it should be read, in a much more ambiguous way, that with music, we cannot ever be sure.<eos> Insofar as it externalises our inner passion, music is potentially always a threat.
Can you do it", or whatever. It...<eos> It... Obviously, there is some kind of a censorship here.<eos> You have either an emotionally engaging film but then you should stop just before showing it all, sexual act. Or you can see it all, but you're not allowed to... then... to be emotionally seriously engaged.<eos> So that's the tragedy of pornography.<eos> It tries to be as realistic as possible but it has to maintain the minimum of fantasmatic support.
Because all you need is love.<eos> Black.<eos> This is where we all end up.<eos> You can't choose the life.<eos> It chooses you.
So?<eos> Just picture everything smaller.<eos> And then I'd open up these walls, reset the studs, and get the electrical up to code.<eos> Damn, this house is messed up.<eos> You know, at night, it makes these creepy sounds like it's moving.
Wait a minute.<eos> Give him a<eos> Second. He can't talk.<eos> He's got The tubie thing in his throat.<eos> He types the words into the Computer and it reads the words For him and says the sentences
He's gotta know something.<eos> Then why didn't he say something about us ?<eos> He did.<eos> He said to stay away from me.<eos> You know how Hopper gets an idea in his head, he can't let it go.
I am.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I'm just worried about you, you know ?<eos> You just said so yourself,<eos> Hopper gets an idea in his head, he doesn't let it go.
Many will drown in the pounding waves.<eos> During the next twenty years, the vast majority will inevitably die but those that survive will, eventually, as their mothers did before them, return to the very same beach where they were hatched.<eos> How they find their way back across thousands of miles of open ocean, we still have no idea.<eos> A frigate soars.<eos> Somewhere, beneath the surface below, there is the food it must have.
No.<eos> I've got my customers, and make money.<eos> In another city, I'd have to start from scratch couldn't survive.<eos> I'll visit you in your room.<eos> If it's big enough, you could live there, too.
Where the hell did she think it came from?<eos> The invitation fairy? She said she sent you an invitation.<eos> I didn't know it was from her.<eos> I didn't know it was from you!<eos> Well, it was.
I was the projectionist at the private screening in 1988. The faces in that room--<eos> Famous, beautiful people from all over Europe.<eos> When I threaded the film into the projector,<eos> I saw those same dots you described. And when I actually started it running... I lost my nerve, I looked away.<eos> It was playing right there, right in front of me and I was too frightened to watch.
There must be a way to deal with this bad spell.<eos> Lisa, you think to take care your father?<eos> This is a great way to use a brain great: deal with a stupid head.<eos> Damn! That is the solution! Maggie is now a real witch!<eos> It can cancel this spell.
Blame will breed more violence, and we have had enough of that.<eos> Blame will not rid our streets of crime and drugs and fear and we've had enough of that.<eos> Blame will not strengthen our schools or our families or our workforce.<eos> Blame will rob us of those things, and we have had enough of that.<eos> And so I ask you today to dig down deep with me and find that compassion in your hearts because it will keep us on the road and we will walk together and work together.
The botfly releases its hapless messenger.<eos> The housefly seems well aware that it's carrying an extra load but it can't get rid of it.<eos> So, it goes back to its normal business which includes visiting cows to drink their sweat.<eos> A small fly, unlike the lumbering botfly, is no real irritation and is able to feed largely unhindered.<eos> The fly mops up the sweat with its pad-shaped mouth parts. But as it feeds, so the warmth of the cow's body causes the botfly's eggs to hatch.
By the time she's finished, she will have fixed several dozen of these sticky, taut, vertical lines.<eos> An ant is approaching in the distance. An orb web would never catch one of these.<eos> It's a scout, leading an exploring party.<eos> Searching beneath the plant holder, it's almost bound to blunder into one of the redback's lines.<eos> It struggles and so seals its fate. And its followers go the same way.
I was born with a "technical flaw" as they say.<eos> I am narcoleptic and this is my story.<eos> So what is narcolepsy?<eos> The word narcolepsy appeared in 1880 from Greek "narke" or numbness -<eos> It gave later words like "narcotic", drug - and from Greek "lepsi" or seizure.
And did this marriage, that was so sudden, cause you any consternation?<eos> - Why should it?<eos> - Perhaps because her affairs weren't in the perfect order that they should be.<eos> - Which she would have noticed when she took control on her return to England.<eos> And that prospect so alarmed you, - did it not?
I fucked up.<eos> The key is underthe fucking mattress.<eos> But it's not underthe mattress.<eos> It's a lot simpler. Where is it?<eos> He sleeps with it around his neck.
He was trying to help some handicapped girl up to the bleachers, and he fell.<eos> It's just a sprain.<eos> But at least it's legitimate.<eos> Ah, le clumsy adolescence.<eos> It's a phase we've all been through.

Ten years after he had disappeared, he returned to these lands after crossing the sea, determined to make it or die trying.<eos> But he had changed so completely that he almost seemed a different person.<eos> Learning the martial arts of the continent has made me realize how weak and empty those that I had previously studied were.<eos> There is a technique called Hakkei.<eos> It allows you to defeat an opponent, not with strength, but with the power of your inner chi.
Sméagol!<eos> Sméagol!<eos> Sam.<eos> And you, Frodo Baggins I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.<eos> May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out.
I hoped the Britih Government would declare itself on the side of France and Russia without delay.<eos> Russia was convinced that Germany was warmongering.<eos> On the 26th of July, she called up her reserves.<eos> This was the second key stage of the crisis, as Britain's Foreign Secretary, Edward Grey, warned on the 28th.<eos> From the moment the dispute ceases to be one between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, and becomes one in which another Great Power is involved, it cannot but end in the greatest catastrophe that has ever befallen the continent of Europe.
I could not have survived without them. nor built this vessel to return to my home.<eos> Where is your home ?<eos> Very far from here.<eos> My queen, this thing resists your attacks.<eos> What if it outlasts us?
The trick to overcoming buyer's remorse is to have a plan.<eos> pick one room and make it yours.<eos> Go slowly through the house.<eos> Be polite.<eos> Introduce yourself so it can introduce itself to you.
I'll get you a plate. lt's your chicken.<eos> You look really smart like that.<eos> Only the bottom's wrong.<eos> Get a chair instead of talking rubbish.<eos> If it's not too heavy.
The teaching and prayer area is situated directly outside.<eos> The area is presided over by high-ranking lamas.<eos> The Dalai Lama should be conducting the teachings, but he has fallen ill and is unable to attend the first few days.<eos> Back to the stupa, only a few hundred metres away.<eos> Pilgrims flock to this pillar, believing it to possess curative powers.
She doesn't love him.<eos> You can see that.<eos> - From what?<eos> The position of the body.<eos> It's not frontal.
And we're starting to rough in the warm flesh tones over the green, so it still comes through in some areas.<eos> And of course the background and the sky now, the marvellous blue, deep sort of ultramarine type sky.<eos> Mona Lisa.<eos> Painting excels because it does not fade as music does as soon as it is born.<eos> It endures, and keeps all the appearance of being alive, though in fact it's confined to one surface.
If only the number of kids that men wanted were born, the human race would have died out long ago.<eos> I think you can't have a child... if you have nothing to give it.<eos> If my parents had thought wisely, then I wouldn't exist.<eos> And if I had thought about it wisely, then you wouldn't exist.<eos> It seems that life has to go on even if it doesn't seem that wise.
I'll signal Lo'Lah and then we go!<eos> - We must destroy them.<eos> - Why?<eos> The mother plant is the key.<eos> It fertilizes the others. Kill it... and no new Crystherium can grow here.
- Ye-e-es.<eos> Have ye ever heard of such a thing as a cow?<eos> A cow, mind.<eos> Let me think. Yes, I have.<eos> Did ye know it secretes a liquor from its udder?
I need my picture of Kataya.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - In my pocket.<eos> Here you are.<eos> There it is.
There's one thing wrong with that.<eos> It doesn't just do that.<eos> It's more like this.<eos> Yeah, well, that's too hard to explain.<eos> When the moon goes around the earth, it attracts the water on the other side too.
Yes! Ok, if you want to.<eos> Who wrote this?<eos> The music is mine, but the words are...<eos> Whenever you're ready!<eos> It sleeps Like a stone In the sun Like a necklace of silk And then one day
Tell me !<eos> The wall !<eos> It ate my fingers !<eos> - What do you mean 'the wall' ?<eos> - It ate my fingers in my dreams.
You should never feed pain without first giving sustenance to hatred.<eos> Pay attention to what I say:<eos> No one will weep here.<eos> Sadness is patient.<eos> It waits.
Here is the photo of the man you must kill.<eos> Bring me his head.<eos> The rest you can cut in half or do whatever you want with.<eos> I'll watch you for a while... in order to feel the anger filling up inside me.<eos> When it is big enough...
Yes, by Marisa Gata Mansa, in 196O-61... back when she was a star.<eos> Only the favela's residents<eos> Are aware of its enchantment<eos> Are aware of its enchantment<eos> Gazing out at the moon We see it's beautiful
To confirm the theory about the faulty brakes.<eos> But the mechanics said everything was fine.<eos> She could've said they hadn't checked properly.<eos> So why didn't the door work?<eos> It was working when they got to the house.
She's beautiful!<eos> I'm getting married...<eos> to a girl from near here.<eos> You are?<eos> Who is it?
Well, I told you I wasn't any good at this whitelighter thing.<eos> But it's in you.<eos> It's half of who you are.<eos> Obviously the latent half.<eos> No, Paige, it's the half that made you become a social worker in the first place.
Hell, I got it. I ain't ever set foot in a mine.<eos> But it's treatable.<eos> There's medicine.<eos> Pescaline.<eos> At least you can live like a person, you get it regular... but our shipment got stole right off the train you was ridin'in.
It's about believing in something.<eos> And letting that belief be real enough to change your life.<eos> It's about faith.<eos> You don't fix faith, River.<eos> It fixes you.
Hell, I got it. I ain't ever set foot in a mine.<eos> But it's treatable.<eos> There's medicine.<eos> Pescaline.<eos> At least you can live like a person, you get it regular... but our shipment got stole right off the train you was ridin'in.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> You may have won this time, but I will be back!<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Well, I had another idea of how to kill the world...<eos> And I thought it was almost too horrible to even speak of, but... But now they have left me with no other choice!
Maybe later.<eos> I have some stuff I have to do first.<eos> - About the weird girl that came to the house?<eos> - Glory.<eos> And no, it's not.
Oh, the knife.<eos> No. I was in the CIA.<eos> Culinary Institute of America.<eos> Tell me, Mr. Grissom, how does a man choose death as his profession?<eos> It chose me, actually.
How did it go?<eos> It went well, I think... I think they really liked the show.<eos> I think... I think they want to do it.<eos> Aren't you gonna ask me how my appointment went?<eos> Right, the psychic. How did it go?
It'll be a little hard to enjoy your Mensa subscription now, floating comatose in a sensory deprivation tank.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Yes.<eos> We picked up Mataros' signal, then it disappeared. Right near St. Michael's church.<eos> Where is it now?
Bernie put almost a million dollars into our accounts over the last year.<eos> - From his art business? - Yes.<eos> This report is unreliable.<eos> The radiation test didn't lie, Mr. Langer.<eos> Americans are so impressed with science, when it's as much myth as religion.
Because of their size, adults can survive without water for days, but the calf, being smaller, has fewer reserves to draw on and is getting dangerously weak.<eos> The nights are cooler and a far better time for them to move around, so every evening they set off in search of water.<eos> Other Indricotheres are on the same journey, and tonight the pair is joined by an older female.<eos> Indricotheres can easily live into their eighties, and this longevity gives them a unique knowledge of their environment.<eos> If there is any water nearby, it is a good bet the old female knows where it is.
This dessert is delicious.<eos> Convent fare.<eos> Should you be interested, our cook will give you the recipe.<eos> Cuisine is not my forté.<eos> Ah, Princess, it is, on the contrary, my weak point.
- You all right out there? - Oh, yeah.<eos> I'll have some of that later.<eos> I must apologize for the quality of the food. We did stock pile supplies in case of such an emergency, and so provisions were not initially a problem.<eos> But now, nothing getting in, nothing getting out.<eos> And when the storeroom was full, It didn't contain a single thing... that was of any interest to our intruder, who seems to prefer... us. This is my daughter, Kyra.
Did you ever wake up one morning... and feel that everything in your life was wrong?<eos> Hmmm... Because I woke up one morning last month, and... and I know this sounds silly because, you know housewives, excuse me, "homemakers," as we're now called, aren't supposed to have existential crises.<eos> I think homemakers have existential crises all the time.<eos> Well, I found out that my husband had been having an affair.<eos> Oh. And it had been going on for more than a year.
No way. We love each other.<eos> Well, supposed to be... but I'm in this boghole for the next bloody year, ain't I?<eos> Well, if that's the case... why don't you ask Stewart about getting married in here?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Pull the other one, it farts Elvis. No, straight up. You can.
- Yeah, and, he's also, he's searching...<eos> - No!<eos> Search not.<eos> Inspiracion will you not find.<eos> It will find you.
I don't know.<eos> I just want you to tell me one thing.<eos> Do you think of him when you're fucking with me?<eos> Chastity is the rose of virtues.<eos> It makes men and women similar to the angels.
If I was a ring where would I be?<eos> Well, this is fun but it's gonna get old real fast.<eos> Most things that live and breathe hate the dark and love the light.<eos> We're different though, aren't we?<eos> We hate the light of day and it hates us back in kind.
- You speak German?<eos> - You had no idea what it said?<eos> - No, but he seemed to understand.<eos> What we can't seem to figure out is the letter, Todd.<eos> - Do you know where it is?
-How have you been?<eos> -Well, I'm divorced.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> I'm riding the alimony pony.<eos> And there it is.
Maybe she was killed on the bank.<eos> The boy said she got off and walked.<eos> Maybe she never got back on.<eos> Someone on the bank killed her. But who?<eos> On the bank it could've been anyone.
No wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.<eos> Who is that?<eos> Just this really, really old lady who wishes she was still 45.<eos> You should have seen her nose.<eos> It's big enough to land planes on.
There were errors in the tracking subroutines.<eos> You were not ordered to check the targeting sensors.<eos> Well, I thought it a wise precaution in case we encountered an enemy ship on our way home.<eos> Your initiative pleases me.<eos> It's a trait that the Gammas lack.
I want you to give him a full workup. I examined him before he left for Bajor. He didn't complain of any new symptoms but my scan still showed the same odd synaptic potentials.<eos> I was hoping the problem would have cured itself by now.<eos> But it hasn't.<eos> Isn't there something you can do to help?<eos> I could try neuropolaric induction but that's a very serious operation and I'd rather not do that unless it were absolutely necessary.
I even prefer them to natural light.<eos> They set off every object.<eos> There. You'll find the deep shadows they make in most of my still lifes, because they were painted at night.<eos> Painting is stronger than I am.<eos> It makes me do what it wants.
Besides, I have things to do.<eos> I'll never get tired of this song.<eos> Maybe I'll get tired of you.<eos> Honestly, I love it.<eos> It made everyone in Algiers cry.
I was very much puzzled.<eos> Puzzlement may be the best word.<eos> Of course, I was sad but you see, it was so sudden, and I was unable to make sense out of this.<eos> Taniyama-Shimura went on to become one of the great unproven conjectures.<eos> But what did it have to do with Fermat's last theorem?
- Look-<eos> - I've got a lot to figure out.<eos> And it's time I got started.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then once Kosh's belongings are loaded into his ship... it will activate itself.
Leo SoIomon phoned. He said he was thrilled with the deal you made.<eos> - I forgot to tell you.<eos> - It's a waste of time.<eos> But it's not our time!<eos> G.D.C. makes a big push to get the votes. When they come up short, we move in with a softer bill. We get it passed.
Tear the place down, Hercules!<eos> You can do it!<eos> Why don't you leave it standing?<eos> Find a better use for it.<eos> Make it... something the whole town can be proud of.
Oh, shit.<eos> Dude, he didn't do nothing yet.<eos> RICHARD: Man, oh, man.<eos> I am convinced that the soul exists in a microscopic gland that is located somewhere along the spine.<eos> It is the last thing to die, releasing the life force days after conventional death.
- What's this about?<eos> - You did some work for our government.<eos> I'm old now.<eos> History bores me.<eos> Because it escaped you?
But the following day some of the boys from the reservation came to tell us they had seen buzzards flying out near the quarry where Eric had first encountered the men.<eos> The buzzard is a large but cowardly bird.<eos> It does not work for its prey, letting others provide the kill.<eos> When I see them circling in the desert, this can only mean that something has died and they are going to pick its bones.<eos> Or that death is close and they are waiting for it to do its work for them.
You know, speaking of human ignorance... I always supposed that this estate, which you're going to sell, belonged to Sonya.<eos> - No. - If I may... as my late father purchased this estate as a dowry for my sister... so that it passed, in my ignorance to look upon the law... from my sister to Sonya, to whom it belongs.<eos> - Certainly. Who denies it?<eos> - Well -<eos> Of course, it belongs to Sonya, without whose consent one would not think of selling it... and - and for whose benefit it shall be sold.
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.<eos> I will not make a martyr of him.<eos> I have been told... of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.<eos> It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded.<eos> Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still.

I am.<eos> We are?<eos> By whom?<eos> Men belonging to Kjartan.<eos> They are the shepherds, we are the sheep.
Priest... is my man correct?<eos> There are further horsemen? He is correct, Lord.<eos> But these horsemen, they came from nowhere and asking us to where we were travelling and we prayed that they would leave us, vanish.<eos> You wanted rid of them?<eos> Believe me when I say this, they were not of this world, Lord.
I'm so sorry about your children.<eos> Their shoes were missing.<eos> Sorry?<eos> When they found their bodies, it was clear that they'd been walking for quite some time, but their shoes were missing.<eos> They weren't here at the house, they weren't with the kids.
Clearly, it was you.<eos> Feeding him the apple.<eos> You were the temptation all along.<eos> Fill this valley with ditches and so his tired and thirsty men began to dig and toiled and struggled until they could do no more.<eos> They had done their part.

It's all gone.<eos> I just want to assure you Baudelaires that you have absolutely nothing...<eos> We have absolutely nothing.<eos> ...to worry about.<eos> I am the executor of your parents' estate, which means I'll be handling all matters concerning everything they left behind.
- Left. There's nobody around to claim it.<eos> - Not even her family?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Well, ever since the horrible incident with their daughter in the basement, which would never ever happen again, by the way, they want to have nothing to do with it, so they... they...
I'm not naming names.<eos> Never naming names.<eos> Martin fucking Amis,<eos> Woody Allen, Saul Bellow.<eos> If you give the men the space that they say they need, then their work suffers, they suffer.
- No, not at all.<eos> - Um... - Thanks, Nick.<eos> No, I suppose I don't, really.<eos> Well, not in front of MPs anyway.<eos> I think I know more about it than they do.
I'm a mess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When my parents died, I was young.<eos> I was alone, and I ran from this house.<eos> Trying to be what they would have wanted.
- Where's your brother?<eos> - Stay away from her!<eos> Simon!<eos> Fight me, and watch your friends die.<eos> - They make you weak.
Oh, okay, what...<eos> What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?<eos> Well, actually, I'm from the past, but that's beside the point.<eos> Look, George, I don't care about movies, but guys like them?<eos> They do.
Yes.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Your partners just left me here all tied up.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They... told me... Not to tell you.
When the Court of Owls calls, o-one does not refuse.<eos> Still, I'm not upset.<eos> I knew when your old masters summoned you, it was to cook up some horror, and here's the thing:<eos> I need horror.<eos> They're responsible for all of this, aren't they?
We share stories.<eos> We get present with the Mother.<eos> - Earth. - Mm.<eos> We have met some fascinating characters.<eos> And they have met you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, well, I only have two signed permission slips.<eos> So do the rest of you have yours?<eos> Well... I... I didn't really ask my parents.<eos> They don't know about me, they'd totally freak out.
Why not?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> How can I turn them away?<eos> Kids who can't come out to their parents?<eos> They need this more anybody.
Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about foster care reform?<eos> Don't your fancy lawyers have investigators?<eos> - Why you still detectiving?<eos> - They don't think Troy's guilty.<eos> They think I'm some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist.
What if that's what ended things?<eos> Well, if there's any truth to that, she loses all credibility as his alibi.<eos> I don't think Vanessa's gonna want to talk about it, but maybe her ex-husband would.<eos> Do your lawyers know about this?<eos> Well, they don't believe that Troy killed his grandmother.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers, I shall bow to your superior expertise.<eos> Just make sure he suffers.<eos> That was always the plan.<eos> My friends will find me.<eos> They're my strength.
He was still conscious enough to feel his lungs filling with water for 145 seconds.<eos> And here you were bragging about a plan more intricate than torture.<eos> Did you ever think about why I chose the name Prometheus?<eos> He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.<eos> You see, because, like you, they play judge, jury, and executioner.
We're gonna catch that scum bag.<eos> Oh. Instead of working shoulder to shoulder with him?<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just... Things may not have worked out between Gay and me, but she was always there for the kids.<eos> She loved them, and they loved her, and now she's gone.
Is we have to leave the past in the past.<eos> Live our own lives?<eos> Live our own lives.<eos> It doesn't mean that we love them any less.<eos> And I have a feeling it's what... They would want for both of us.
- Sit, My Lord.<eos> - Right away.<eos> You're not safe until you're away from the shires.<eos> If they find you...<eos> I know this land better than they do.
Well, fortunately for our species, no human being is dumb enough to put you in charge, Hillman.<eos> Stow the speculation.<eos> Everyone's jumpy enough as it is.<eos> May we shoot the soy beans, sir?<eos> Only if they shoot first.
Cancel their contracts.<eos> Cripple their business.<eos> And I have the power to do it, because I am the fucking hero who helped save Mother Earth from the cataclysm that Jules-Pierre Mao unleashed.<eos> Tell his children that government is more powerful than any corporation.<eos> And the only reason they think it tilts the other way is because we poor, public servants are always looking for some fat, private-sectors payoff down the road.
...prechaun.<eos> Leprechaun, that's right.<eos> So we just leave a small ration from our harvest.<eos> 'Cause if they so choose, they can lead you off the path you've trod a thousand times before.<eos> She told them all these things and they believed because she believed.
♪ To stay<eos> They called their son the same.<eos> When the children went off to school to learn their letters,<eos> Essie made sure they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket, a little bread in the other, to make sure they came safely home once more.<eos> They always did.
Wow.<eos> It's actually you.<eos> So cool I'm meeting you.<eos> You should thank your friends.<eos> They're the ones who left you behind.
What am I? I don't care, I...<eos> Betrayal.<eos> That's how every friendship ends.<eos> So... so what good are friends anyway?<eos> Who are they?
When the Court of Owls calls, o-one does not refuse.<eos> Still, I'm not upset.<eos> I knew when your old masters summoned you, it was to cook up some horror, and here's the thing:<eos> I need horror.<eos> They're responsible for all of this, aren't they?
It took a week to decode it, but my dad and I did.<eos> What did it say?<eos> It was an invitation... from the gorillas to my dad.<eos> Why Harry?<eos> They wanted to meet him.
You don't understand, big guy.<eos> That's just not how it works.<eos> My powers don't work that way. What do you mean?<eos> You're the one who did this to them.<eos> Yes, but... they are the only ones that are in control of what happens to them now, as are the two of you.
Previously on Empire...<eos> I took the liberty of calling the FBI ahead of time, and I packed you something, just to give you a fighting chance.<eos> Casinos, you know.<eos> They have live shows, but our show itself... is the show.
He doesn't care about you, boy, he just wants to win.<eos> No, I want us all to win.<eos> That's the whole point of this.<eos> The stuff that he's saying on this album, I mean, the things that he's saying to me, I'm finally hearing him, and it's something that I think the critics and that his fans, if they got a chance to hear it...<eos> - But they won't get a chance to listen to what I've heard if all they're hearing is noise from Inferno.
You will need your strength.<eos> I am happy enough to bail.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh. Oh, you think you're better than these men?<eos> They are property.
- Sounds wonderful.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> Listen, children.<eos> I know that the loss of your parents was a great tragedy.<eos> But you can still have the life they wanted for you.
I've become more popular than I want to be.<eos> Nice to be popular.<eos> Not in our line of work.<eos> Our friends with the red hands seem to think differently.<eos> Catchy PR campaign they got going.
He used to bite, but then he got old.<eos> Can I ask a question that isn't about the dog and the different rooms?<eos> She wants to know about the girl.<eos> Well, parishioners need help with their urges... drugs, sex, Twitter.<eos> They come to me.
- Remember me, motherfucker?<eos> - You've been up to a In! of bad shit, son.<eos> Why do I stay?<eos> You know what I stay, 'cause I like bad guys.<eos> Because they don't wanna be bad guys.
There were so many trees.<eos> - So many trees.<eos> - Okay, here we go.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> And they could never run faster than us.
But I can't do what you're asking.<eos> Lidia, I can't do it.<eos> That man who just left is the lawyer for the company's new partners, the Uribes.<eos> I've just signed an agreement to go ahead with the rotary.<eos> If I don't do it, they'll take over the company.
Think practically here.<eos> Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.<eos> Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.<eos> It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.<eos> - But they do.
Gimme back that money!<eos> Pow, pow, pow! I got you now!<eos> Hey. What's up with the dolls, Beeman?<eos> Hey, I got it right here, right here.<eos> They're waiting for us.
35 years in prison, so...<eos> It was worth it... because I did what I set out to do.<eos> I proved that a woman can cheat at cycling as well as any man.<eos> That's something for people to think about from this anonymous guy.<eos> My parents bought me the bike out of van, but they didn't know the bike was stolen.
Why can't I do that with my dad?<eos> Or the stupid landlord.<eos> It's fucking men.<eos> You have to work twice as hard.<eos> They know it, you know it, and they know you know it.
If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> I'm dying of something with a name so long, I can't even tell you what it is.<eos> And you're talking about your fee being capped at more money than they paid me.
These men have life-threatening health problems.<eos> They need someone to give a shit about them.<eos> It isn't something we do because we don't have the time or the man power to take on a giant like Velocity.<eos> Nathan, I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> I went out there, I signed these guys and they trusted me.
And a man of experience has no need of it, since he tends to be so much better at cards, de Foix.<eos> Madame de Reynaud, such a jolly little thing since her husband died, don't you think?<eos> Inheritance does that to a woman.<eos> Have the apartments of the ministerial candidates - been searched?<eos> - They have.
When we die, we're in the ground forever.<eos> You know, we're alive now, so make it worthwhile.<eos> Lovely.<eos> [man speaking in Maori] My delight in watching our grandchildren tending to the hāngi... makes my heart sing and soar.<eos> Because they are the next ones to take over when we are gone.
Because they are the next ones to take over when we are gone.<eos> That is the legacy that Tūranga has left for us, and future generations.<eos> That's our ancestor, and that was one of his dreams.<eos> That you bequeath your knowledge, your education, your wisdom, to them.<eos> And in time, they will follow suit, and pass knowledge to their future generations.
Good.<eos> What is it?<eos> There were so many people.<eos> Children. A little boy on the floor.<eos> They killed him.
Fine.<eos> The uniforms are different.<eos> There's no real need to dehydrate donuts.<eos> The larger point is, scientists need to branch out.<eos> They need to do different things.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thought you were at the hospital.<eos> I was.<eos> My ears are still ringing pretty good, but they can't do much for that there.
So maybe, uh... maybe they took him off the cross and they... they thought he was dead but, in fact, he wasn't.<eos> No, of course they weren't medical doctors.<eos> They were professional killers.<eos> Right, and they were quite good at their jobs.<eos> They had to be. If a prisoner escaped alive, they themselves would be executed.
Revolution can only begin on the page.<eos> The final act must be played on the streets... to the resounding beat of righteous hearts.<eos> I know these men.<eos> Speak.<eos> They will hear you.
I'm not.<eos> You are.<eos> What is the point in beating yourself up over all of the... the crappy things you've done?<eos> You did them!<eos> And... and don't say you had reasons, because at the end of the day, at the end of the world, nobody gives a damn about your reasons, because they are your reasons.
Thanks again, Mrs. Kirkman, for showing us around today.<eos> No, no, please, call me Alex.<eos> Uh, it was great, and it made me happy.<eos> Those kids, they're so passionate about what they're doing, and they adore you.<eos> Oh, well, I'm just lucky they let me hang around.
Team, stay sharp.<eos> Those racks are rigged with enough explosives to bring this whole place down.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We gotta find Erin before they do.
We got a line on a truck transporting HMX to Buffalo this afternoon.<eos> We'll hit it here, somewhere in this empty stretch off State Route 17.<eos> - How many guard vehicles? - Zero.<eos> What about the drivers?<eos> They're unarmed. It's a shipping truck.
- I did.<eos> I told them they could have all the silver in the back of that truck.<eos> - I didn't see any silver.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, neither did I, but they don't know that.
Bye.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Rebecca, it's-it's gonna be okay.<eos> They invited us.
They know we can hurt them.<eos> I'm still not hearing a plan.<eos> We need to all come together and focus our energy.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> That's exactly what they've been trying to do this whole time!
We need to all come together and focus our energy.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> That's exactly what they've been trying to do this whole time!<eos> Get us all in one place and bring on the Merge.<eos> Yes, but they're not expecting us to fight back.
He's trying to reach us.<eos> We can hear you, my love.<eos> Come back to us.<eos> Your parents couldn't stand you.<eos> Every time you came home from school, they just were like, "There he is again."
- The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.<eos> That's the trick.<eos> The mind killer.<eos> Your disease convinces you, you don't have it.<eos> So, for example, one day in the hospital, you meet a girl and she has some friends and they tell you you're not sick.
More like AA?<eos> "Hi, my name is Megan, and I was possessed."<eos> Sure, if you like.<eos> I'm not sure I'm ready to get up in front of a bunch of strangers, and... tell 'em... tell 'em what I've done.<eos> You think you've done worse than they have?
Why?<eos> Did you know our parents?<eos> Who are the other people in this photograph?<eos> What's with that eye building?<eos> I don't understand what "ack" means, but if you want to know about your parents, they...
I'm the boss.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> There's a reason this town will never forget your parents.<eos> They're the ones that burned it down.
They're the ones that burned it down.<eos> Our parents did what?<eos> I'm an important man.<eos> Don't make me repeat myself.<eos> They burned down the town!
- Not a good idea.<eos> - Why?<eos> They need to know what's going on.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Because they're my parents and they're the baby's grandparents.
Could you take these into the mail room?<eos> All three of you.<eos> Immediately.<eos> It's the personal touches, when you arrive in a new place.<eos> They make all the difference.
No, no.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I do this real slowly.<eos> I win their hearts and minds, O.R. by O.R., attending by attending.<eos> I teach the technique, they start spreading the word, and then, suddenly, they realize I'm the best thing that ever happened to them.
Another one?<eos> How many days off a year do these fat-cat teachers get?<eos> Well, it's important that they train.<eos> Oh, let's see. When's another time they could possibly train?<eos> Oh, maybe during the entire summer that they get off.
I understand that.<eos> I am not disrobing.<eos> You can take the camera and take a photo of yourself.<eos> I spent my whole life fighting, fighting for the dignity that was denied our forebears.<eos> They were treated like this.
I may never find it again, but sure.<eos> Emery, I had an amazing idea in science class while I was zoning out.<eos> We need to buy some denim, team up with Grandma, and start making more of those jeans.<eos> But I thought you hated these because they're not the real thing.<eos> I do, but they don't. Why not give them what they want at half price?
Here's the problem with America. It's income inequality.<eos> I think that's the problem.<eos> I think they need to restructure how we pay people.<eos> Like, football players, they get guaranteed contracts, right?<eos> So, they'll get $100 million, but they guarantee you, like, 40 million.
Ah, I think it's ridiculous!<eos> But this is what he wanted.<eos> His last request.<eos> Perhaps he should have thought about that before he slept with his ex-wife.<eos> So, you're refusing to carry out his last wishes, despite the fact that they're here in black and white?
Come on, partner.<eos> Legal chemical supplements.<eos> They're named after Owlsly, the chemist who made them for Adam until they had a falling out.<eos> I thought everybody loved him. What happened?<eos> All I know is that, for a while, the supplements had dried up, and then last night, they started flowing again, and the crowd followed.
They said they gave Adam half a million dollars and they wanted it back.<eos> A half million.<eos> Was that true?<eos> If it was, I never heard about it.<eos> But they didn't believe me.
You hurt?<eos> Not bad, I don't think.<eos> All right, well...<eos> EMTs should be here shortly.<eos> They can take a look at you.
We gotta go!<eos> Not without the engraving!<eos> You actually care about these losers.<eos> Mick, come on, let's go!<eos> Because I guarantee they don't care about you, Mick.
Yeah. They're laughing.<eos> It's like I'm wearing a scarlet letter or something.<eos> So what do your parents think?<eos> They can't find out.<eos> They're really Catholic and really conservative and I know that they would just freak out.
- (ALARMS BLARE) - They're nearly through!<eos> Open up.<eos> Let's send them a message.<eos> Let's teach them a lesson they will never forget.<eos> They take our lives, we take their station and every penny they will ever make from it.
I will shoot the next person who walks through that damn door until you tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> You're gonna die in prison, you know.<eos> The men in there, they have wives, girlfriends.<eos> They don't understand a good death.
Nowhere to go.<eos> Well, Linda, you need to treat yourself.<eos> You raised four beautiful children through very difficult circumstances, and you...<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> They had a horrible childhood.
Nashville doesn't even know what's comin' to 'em.<eos> Don't you find it pretty damn hilarious when people go bitchin' and complainin' and goin' on about illegal immigrants?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Hell, my ancestors actually came from Tennessee.<eos> They came down to Texas in the 1830s.
I really consider you a friend.<eos> And, uh...<eos> I don't tell people... About this stuff, but, uh... I trust ya.<eos> You've been a good friend to me.<eos> Well, good friends don't go away, they...
The sightings fascinated residents.<eos> It was completely silent.<eos> You couldn't hear it, but you knew it was there.<eos> It was just massive, it was big.<eos> Eye-witnesses describe what they saw as being identical to the glowing orbs that passed through the area earlier this week...
Sasha.<eos> Got too close, and they murdered her right in front of me.<eos> And if we keep going after them, they're gonna kill every single one of us, too.<eos> He's right.<eos> They know we're coming, which is why we haven't been able to get anything on them.
Hiya.<eos> Pete: How's it going, big brother?<eos> You all right?<eos> How's Daddy?<eos> Spent two weeks arguing with the doctors, thinking he knows more than they do.
You know.<eos> The crazies.<eos> Matt, when you're an alderman, here's the thing.<eos> You don't get to pick your constituents.<eos> They pick you.
"You know what? I've got to be going.<eos> But it's good to see you again, and I'm glad things went so well."<eos> I said, "Thanks, Juice."<eos> And my friends said, "Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice."<eos> They were new to the game.
It's just what I thought.<eos> Way too early.<eos> Now, can you please make some tea for us?<eos> I am not your friends' slave.<eos> I know, but they are my guests.
All right, let's get eyes on Spann.<eos> We're going around the clock on this one.<eos> Hey, where are we at ID-ing these kids?<eos> They all got juvie records... underage drinking, possession, assault.<eos> And they're the future leaders of tomorrow.
We shall leave you alone, Your Highness.<eos> And I'll make sure the children get their reward.<eos> Nothing of the sort.<eos> I want to reward them personally.<eos> Whatever they desire.
both: You are!<eos> And who's the most handsome dude in all the land, even objectively more than Idris Elba?<eos> both: You are!<eos> Man, kids are awesome.<eos> You can tell them literally anything, and they'll just say it.
You are here too.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sir, we've discovered that Lieutenant Hawkins is dirty.<eos> Her squad isn't investigating the Golden Gang bank robbers, they are the robbers.
You are not gonna get away with this.<eos> Oh, I already did, and Captain Holt won't be able to get you out of this one.<eos> Get them out of my sight.<eos> Dirty cops make me sick!<eos> They make me sick!
Todd, Melissa, I just want to say<eos> I-I'm so happy for you guys.<eos> You know?<eos> You faced some tough times... we all have.<eos> My parents... they never expected much from me.
I will send my lawyer to your house to shave your head in your sleep!<eos> This is not a bluff, Mother!<eos> Emily, have your parents ever done that thing where they turn your childhood bedroom into a second butler's pantry?<eos> No.<eos> They kept me and my sister's room the same.
It was an interesting discussion in the writers' room approaching the scene where Justin lets Bryce in to ultimately have his way with Jessica.<eos> And there were people who said:<eos> I don't- - No one can-- No one would do this.<eos> It's impossible to do this.<eos> A lot of times guys will have this concept of the bro code, that if their friend is assaulting someone else, whether it's their girlfriend or someone they don't know, that they just are gonna kind of look the other way.
And that's why abortion is the last line of defense against shitty people in the species.<eos> So, we need them to abort every shitty baby.<eos> I mean, all animals do this.<eos> Animals do it late.<eos> They have the baby.
They show up, tell them ahead of time.<eos> "Hi, what is this job?"<eos> And they say, "Okay, here's what we need you to do.<eos> We need you to make children know math."<eos> "Do they wanna know math?" "No, they don't want to know it.
John Wilkes Booth's gun?<eos> Just name it, Benny, I'll put it in your shopping cart.<eos> You know how long it took me to get out here?<eos> I need it. And your buddies in Justice, they owe me.<eos> They messed me around really good with that Hayden Watkins case.
Yeah.<eos> I learned some things in school.<eos> Now that I'm old, things scare me, you know?<eos> I think it's the media that does it.<eos> Like, they go, "North Korea," you know? And, I don't know, it kind of scares...
We judge, you know?<eos> All our love comes with caveats, you know?<eos> There's no such thing as unconditional love with human beings.<eos> But dogs, they don't care.<eos> They love...
But Baltimore has always been a working-class city.<eos> In 1969, when Sister Cathy dies, we lived in a much more basic, simplistic, primitive society.<eos> This is a world of blue-collar folks, they're working in these factory jobs.<eos> They are living in little row houses, they are tending little postage-stamp lawns.<eos> They are living for that glorious moment when their little daughter puts on a veil and goes for her First Communion.
The credibility of their story will be very much an issue.<eos> I was scared of the lawyers at that point.<eos> I couldn't even look at them.<eos> And my lawyers decided that I would just look at the judge and not look at the lawyers as they questioned me.<eos> It was, like, so many thoughts going through my head... but I just took the stand and... And they questioned me.
Might know more tomorrow.<eos> Boss I had in work said to me one time...<eos> .."Don't worry about your kids getting older.<eos> "You won't lose them.<eos> "They actually grow towards you."
Al Haymon is spending money hand over fist, and it's great.<eos> The fighters are getting paid like drunken sailors wanna be paid.<eos> But are the right fights being made?<eos> Are the fans happy?<eos> They're the ones that have to congregate to lift this sport up.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> Ernesto Rubio has business ties with the Avendaños.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> It was the gringos!<eos> They threatened to reveal it.
Are we gonna start killin' rich people?<eos> It's why they're rich, ward.<eos> Don't ya understand?<eos> You, me, all of us...<eos> We're all out there dyin' so they can stay rich.
Your mama don't need you dead.<eos> She's done lost her farm.<eos> She don't need to lose her boys, too.<eos> You're sure he said all of 'em?<eos> He just said they wanted to come out, sir.
Look what I've found.<eos> - It's a fireplace.<eos> - You know what this means?<eos> Pirates!<eos> Are they coming back?
W...<eos> The what?<eos> The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...<eos> It's what gamblers do.<eos> They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
I'm talkin' about the goddamned critics. you know?<eos> They told me I had no talent.<eos> They told me I stink on ice.<eos> They're so negative and hurtful.<eos> They cut me. man.
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them if you won't tell us about them?<eos> We don't defeat them.<eos> We most certainly lose to them.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they are right.
Were you not hinting at me with your doe like eyes?<eos> What else could I do?<eos> I was looking at you with anger!<eos> I made a mistake, your eyes are very mischievous.<eos> They want one thing, but they say something else.
Sarman!<eos> Sarman!<eos> This is the meaning of your coming here, Sarman!<eos> You are the saviour of Mohenjo Daro!<eos> And if the people were to learn who you are they will stand by you!
I'm not sure about Natasha being transsexual.<eos> And I seem to recall there were children in the original one.<eos> Well, Chekhov refers to lots of unseen characters.<eos> We decided if you don't see them,<eos> - they don't exist.
- Yeah.<eos> I mean, you know these fucking shrinks, they say one thing to their patients, another thing to their non-patients, and another thing altogether to their wives.<eos> They work in strange and mysterious ways.<eos> I mean, you and me are friends.<eos> We straight talk to each other, but shrinks have... weird ways. That's how they are.
Oh, here it is.<eos> Okay, now the last thing we got from Mike has your boy right here just south of the border in Mexico.<eos> I know the perfect guys for this.<eos> Ex-Blackwater studs, bored and badass.<eos> - They'll do this.
But then I was reborn as a witch.<eos> Barbara and Dan brought me back to life.<eos> They taught me everything I know about magic and about men.<eos> Men are like children.<eos> They're very easy to please as long as we give them what they want.
They taught me everything I know about magic and about men.<eos> Men are like children.<eos> They're very easy to please as long as we give them what they want.<eos> - Where were we?<eos> Oh, men, you said we need to give them what they want.
I do...<eos> I make bad decisions to make up for some other bad decisions, and I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.<eos> - You're a thief.<eos> Look, mister, superheroes don't fly or look like Jesus.<eos> They drive broken-down cars.
Merlin, Rafiki, Jiminy Cricket...<eos> They're all sidekicks.<eos> At that point, I didn't feel like a hero.<eos> I felt like a sidekick.<eos> The sidekicks are fun-loving, comical, wacky, playful, friendly, and delightful, and they help the hero fulfill their destiny, and they support the heroes.
Keep the change.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> What's going on here, boys?<eos> Why don't you mind your own damn business?<eos> They are my business.
Oh. How very disappointing.<eos> I'm interested in one of your clients, Benji Akers.<eos> Yeah, not sure how I can help you with that.<eos> My relationship with my clients is strictly confidential.<eos> Of course, but these hedge fund guys... they always seem to have some way to stay out of trouble... but they need someone like you from the big bank.
And on paper?<eos> Everything looks perfect.<eos> Our I.T. guys at Remson tested it.<eos> They say this network is as airtight...<eos> - ...as anything they've ever seen.
May I ask you something personal?<eos> How did you do it?<eos> Finally say good-bye... to that one person you loved most in all the world?<eos> Truth is, I've never been very good at saying good-bye, but that's the hell of it, isn't it?<eos> Whether you want to say good-bye or not, they're gone, and... you have to go on living without them.
With sweet enlargements doth dismiss me hence: I would his troubles were expired, That you might recover what is lost.<eos> Good uncle, for my father's sake, In honour of a true Plantagenet, For alliance sake, declare the cause.<eos> Henry the Fourth, grandfather to the young king, Deposed his true king Richard, I should have been the rightful next by birth.<eos> When my friends opposed this usurpment And worked to instate me the rightful heir<eos> I lost my liberty and they their lives.
You are gonna get past me... and you are gonna be able to do whatever you want.<eos> I just want you.<eos> My mom tells me there's no such thing as monsters.<eos> But she is wrong.<eos> They're out there, waiting for you... watching.
Have you done this before?<eos> Yeah, about once a week.<eos> Well, you're doing great.<eos> Transponders are designed not to be tampered with.<eos> Civilian models fuse themselves into lumps of molten graphene if they get messed with.
Yeah, well, even so, they've shut down all access to the docks.<eos> Look, I can find you guys a place to hole up, ride this thing out.<eos> Something terrible is happening here, and we're not sticking around to find out what.<eos> Help us get into the old mech shafts.<eos> They'll lead us to the docks.
Well, I needed somebody to be behind me.<eos> I mean, this guy's my...<eos> kind of my captain, and these guys are my goons, you know?<eos> If I need 'em to do something for me, back me up, you know, if I'm getting into some...<eos> And... they just showed up and they're racing with you?
But, alas, all lesbians.<eos> All six of your sisters are lesbians?<eos> Indeed.<eos> But I got my little bros at camp. So...<eos> They keep me going.
My favourite Marie Curie quote--<eos> The way of progress was neither swift nor easy.<eos> Remember that, my little scientists.<eos> See you soon!<eos> If they'll have me back.
When I was 5, I could already tell the difference between fake and real money.<eos> Afterwards, I learned how to make fake signature stamps.<eos> and even picked up the art of stealing as well.<eos> But these children are not to learn any of these skills.<eos> They were abandoned right after birth.
TWO WORKERS DIE IN TURBINE ACCIDENT<eos> - Jon, it's me.<eos> Open your e-mail.<eos> - Mads, we're off duty.<eos> Listen. They were forced to work.
There's these flies that will lay their eggs in the skin.<eos> The larvae will crawl under the skin and grow there.<eos> It gives us something to work on.<eos> Today is a good day.<eos> We are preparing for necropsies and tissue sampling of the rodents that we captured to assess the pathogens that they carry, getting a sense of the prevalence of the pathogens across the city.
But my dad...<eos> He didn't believe in that stuff, so my dad said,<eos> "Hank, uh, when you...<eos> you know, uh, it expends energy, both in the— in the orgasm and in the daily reproduction of sperm, so— so if you do it a lot, it adds up, and it shortens your life span,<eos> and that's why, on average, males have shorter life spans, because they... you know."
No, I left before any of that.<eos> But you've been with Agent Porter since?<eos> I went to my apartment first, that's when R0mano's men came.<eos> They thought I knew who blew up the club.<eos> They were gonna kill me if I didn't tell them.
When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice.<eos> What atonement do I deserve?<eos> You would spill blood in this holy place?<eos> Oh, the gods won't mind.<eos> They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.
'CAUSE IT SURE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE WANTED TO CHANGE.<eos> HE WAS SO EAGER TO JUMP RIGHT INTO IT. INTO MIDDLE AGE, BUT I STILL MISSED HIS CUTE LITTLE CHIN.<eos> - HEY, HI, HOW ARE YOU?<eos> - GREAT.<eos> MY MOM INVITED YOUR PARENTS TO OUR CHRISTMAS PARTY AND THEY INVITED KELLY AND BRIAN.
- Donkeys?<eos> What are their names?<eos> This is Faloud, the oldest.<eos> - And?<eos> - They're Java and Omega.
You hiking alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too all my friends are tied up.<eos> I got the impression they weren't that into hiking.<eos> They were... They were kind of colorful.
When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.<eos> I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> It's what the gods want.<eos> They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.

At first glance?<eos> Are you saying I didn't see what I saw?<eos> No.<eos> But first glances are for strangers and shock is just for passers-by, for people who don't know Susan, or love her.<eos> But if you bring her home and bring her up with your other children, she'll become as familiar and as beautiful to you as they are.
Well, here's hoping I have a model baby.<eos> And preferably one I can dress in pink and don't have to yell at till I'm hoarse.<eos> - Would you like a little girl this time? - Yeah.<eos> I know I'm meant to say "I don't mind as long as it's healthy", and I do love my boys.<eos> But lads, Sister -- they egg each other on.
Hey!<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Where the hell did you go? !<eos> I-i just saw-- Olivia, it's 2:00 in the morning.<eos> There were these guys, and they grabbed-- shut up, okay?
It doesn't sound very gentlemanly.<eos> I think we've all learned there's nothing gentlemanly about waging war.<eos> It would mean a 12-mile march by night.<eos> And are the men capable of such strenuous endeavor?<eos> They've not let us down yet.
Detective.<eos> Looks like you found some better clothes to audit in.<eos> Look... when my guys are here, they know the rules.<eos> Respect, no street talk.<eos> But when they leave, I got no control.
Just kill him. He's the reason why we're even in America.<eos> - White power.<eos> - We wouldn't have been on that boat... - if it wasn't for him.<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> - White power. - How do you think they got here?
Your appendix out.<eos> Your dean, from the college, Mr. Caudwell, was just now here.<eos> I sent him home. Didn't want to wake you.<eos> He's called your parents.<eos> They know you're fine.
The Black Watch should be guarding that door!<eos> The Chosen... they're all dead.<eos> No... one still lives.<eos> This must be the work of Gnomes.<eos> They've struck at the heart of the palace before.
It's all right.<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, our parents built a great country... and we couldn't even maintain it for you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They get one, too.
Freddy, you know what I can do.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> You know the Thuringer brothers, right? Yeah.<eos> They're on the list.<eos> Yeah. They took them.
Funny, Freddy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, when we get there, should I do the talking?<eos> No, Walt, let me do the talking, okay?<eos> I know these guys, and they don't scare me.
Stay in the car.<eos> I mean it.<eos> These guys are slow. All right?<eos> They're dimwits, really.<eos> They'll indict themselves.
All right, we pull all updated hosts until we can figure it out.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines.<eos> The guests interrupt your precious storylines all the time when they want to shoot or fuck something.<eos> No, when they want to.
You know I've seen her.<eos> Pay attention, Max.<eos> That's the point.<eos> You choose wisely, she lives.<eos> You choose poorly, they all die.
You're still fighting him.<eos> But he's not here anymore.<eos> You said earlier you felt his life was incomplete.<eos> Every father's life is incomplete.<eos> That's why they have sons... to finish what they started.
Think about it.<eos> How do kids behave?<eos> Always happy--<eos> They say anything they want.<eos> They do anything they like..without a care.
Not my ducks.<eos> My ducks are different than your ducks.<eos> Mine are not running around and crazy.<eos> They have an objective, they have a plan.<eos> They wanna get somewhere in life.
There's even more proof he didn't do it.<eos> Who do you think did do it?<eos> You know, my kids...<eos> At school, the other kids...<eos> they-they tease Bobby, tell him his dad's...
I can't do both today.<eos> You are wrong to trust these men.<eos> I don't trust the Masters.<eos> I trust their self-interest.<eos> They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.<eos> You don't know them.<eos> You don't understand them.<eos> We are not human in their eyes.<eos> They look at me and see a weapon.
You don't know them.<eos> You don't understand them.<eos> We are not human in their eyes.<eos> They look at me and see a weapon.<eos> They look at her and see a whore.
You don't understand them.<eos> We are not human in their eyes.<eos> They look at me and see a weapon.<eos> They look at her and see a whore.<eos> They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.
You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.<eos> And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.<eos> I'd settle for obeyed.<eos> I will summon my most eloquent priests.<eos> They will spread the word.
They're laughing at us.<eos> All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.<eos> I hear it in my sleep!<eos> I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.<eos> And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.
You all are.<eos> And after the war was over,<eos> Eventine sent men here to find me.<eos> Imagine my surprise when they told me Pykon didn't exist.<eos> Then they murdered my wife and attempted to kill me.
Ride like Mandinka warrior.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> Fancy white folk like to hear a real musician around Christmastime.<eos> Me.<eos> I'll play so they... so they can't take they eyes off me.
Dog said to me, the problem is, me...<eos> I was only running for a meal.<eos> That cat was running for her life.<eos> You see, these children...<eos> They have nice clothes, comfortable beds.
Enough food to eat.<eos> A roof over their heads.<eos> Safety.<eos> You have shown my children a paradise, yes.<eos> But now they feel out of place where they are.
They saved us. Those two.<eos> I trust them.<eos> And the only thing you should be worried about, is the safety of your own passengers.<eos> I am concerned about the passengers, and we should land at Hong Kong.<eos> They did save us. And we know how terrifying those monsters were.
These elite mountaineers are really handsome.<eos> But almost all of them died in the mountains.<eos> They are so often up the mountain than dying one day is not unexpected.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> They, however, want to die in the mountains.
Let me tell you something, Kev.<eos> These dykes can't tell Yanis Gregorian Papadiamantopoulos what to do, okay?<eos> They're always complaining.<eos> Always complaining about my yard, my fence, the color of my house, my dogs barking.<eos> They're calling the cops.
Just trying to keep it real, friend.<eos> Good Lord only gave me two livers.<eos> What's with all the lumberjacks?<eos> Urban pioneers.<eos> They overpay for drinks, like to be abused, and love these curry-muncher flicks.
Speech!<eos> Say it, Tom!<eos> Say it, Tom!<eos> I didn't come here today to make a speech, but I will say this, these children are now safe.<eos> In our care, they will be safe because we are from the same cold streets as they are.
They're not expecting nobody, so... he should be alone.<eos> There's two good men there.<eos> You do what they say.<eos> But I fire the bullet, all right?<eos> Yes, you can be there. But it's better if they do it.
And she was just a cook.<eos> I threatened to run away with her.<eos> Turn my back on my family name and my inheritance.<eos> It was the first and only time I ever stood up to them.<eos> They must've known my words were just that.
It was the first and only time I ever stood up to them.<eos> They must've known my words were just that.<eos> A spoiled child making idle threats.<eos> The next day, Gertrud was gone.<eos> My parents told me only that they had come to an arrangement.
"The desire of my eyes..."<eos> "is to keep staring at your face."<eos> "My slumbers are filled..."<eos> "with only your dreams."<eos> "They all lead me to you..."
Bolton will start cracking down now.<eos> It'll get ugly.<eos> Oh, come on, doc.<eos> The men will be able to handle it.<eos> They know how important this is.
Hey!<eos> I'm talking to you, maxi-pad.<eos> No, no, I know, but, you know, it's a nice gesture, you know how much these kids love me.<eos> Not like that.<eos> No, they look up to me, Kim, all right.
Go, Mother.<eos> To your Khan.<eos> He needs you now more than I.<eos> It will be entirely for nothing if he doesn't win.<eos> They need you.
I grew up during the Depression.<eos> When I told them at age 17 that I was going to study drama at the Pasadena Playhouse and become an actor, they were grief stricken.<eos> They tried to dissuade me by refusing to give me the tuition, saying,<eos> "You'll have to do it without any help from us."<eos> They were totally against it... because they were certainly--
[Leonard Nimoy] Yeah, that was kind of exciting and a little difficult.<eos> People were following me in the street, and I didn't really want people to know where I was living.<eos> I was staying with my folks, with your grandparents.<eos> [Adam Nimoy] Right.<eos> And they didn't have any idea what "Star Trek" was.
I was told he was dead years ago.<eos> When was the last time the children saw their father?<eos> I don't know, they were very little when he went to prison.<eos> Mr. sanjuro, have the children ever made mention of the father?<eos> They believe he's dead, your honor.
I'm sorry it's been a while.<eos> It's been crazy at work!<eos> With the lepers?<eos> The lepers, you know, other stuff, you know.<eos> - They're really...
Look like you seen a ghost.<eos> You know who else is a great man?<eos> Him.<eos> Little brothers, huh?<eos> They, uh, have that hero worship.
You got to love these babies.<eos> Got your long-range.<eos> Got your short-range.<eos> Ya put 'em behind pictures and such.<eos> They get their power from a transmitter I've wired here.
Will! Where are you?<eos> Geez.<eos> Your parents forget to feed you?<eos> Is that why you ran away?<eos> They, uh...
Eggos?<eos> Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.<eos> See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.<eos> Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways.<eos> My point is, they'll take care of you.
What can I say?<eos> Demons dig blondes.<eos> Of course they do, but that's white.<eos> Platinum.<eos> And they don't exactly like Shakespeare, okay, Alec?

Ah, don't worry, it's the same faces every day.<eos> They're all bark and no bite.<eos> Shit does hit the fan, these dudes are the twirling in the blades.<eos> The local Royal Guard.<eos> They man the perimeter, anything outside of that, that's their rodeo.
Hotshot looking to get shot.<eos> -You're damn right.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Look, Albright, any one of these guys even thinks about making a move for the gate, they become targets.<eos> They never do.

Ready?<eos> Just try and keep up.<eos> -That's my boys!<eos> -Come on, Lopez.<eos> They're in.
-We threw a little party.<eos> -You see, I--<eos> It was just to raise money for our music thing, and it became a big party.<eos> And then, these guys came that we never met, and things got out of hand.<eos> They smashed up the place.
You may not understand.<eos> Better yourself?<eos> Better than who?<eos> Them honkeys don't know you.<eos> They ain't trying to put you on.
Oh, God, I'm dreading it.<eos> But I think in the long run it's the right choice for them, too.<eos> They'll be happier.<eos> Mm, no, they won't.<eos> They'll just add that to their bank of reasons to hate you.
I...<eos> I'm in a dream.<eos> Before this, do you know what happened?<eos> My parents...<eos> They hurt them.
Some big, bad outlaw.<eos> The Dreamwalker said there were some who could see them.<eos> - That it's a blessing from God. - A blessing?<eos> To see the masters who pull your strings.<eos> They don't know what they're talking about.
I've been to see your drunk cavalryman.<eos> All he needs is something for his wounded pride.<eos> Contrabands, you know, they can be very tricky.<eos> He's not a contraband.<eos> They steal.

Sometimes, I'm too strict.<eos> Well, we overestimated her, obviously.<eos> Sometimes, I'm so crazy that I don't even understand the words that are coming out of my mouth.<eos> You see, what works for my daughter almost never works for my son.<eos> And whenever I think I'm actually starting to figure my kids out, they grow up and I'm back to square one.
Amazing animals.<eos> Raise each and everyone of them from birth.<eos> I've fed them by hand.<eos> Nurse them when they were sick.<eos> They are more loyal than all my men.
Snacks?<eos> Cakes in the shape of records?<eos> Guess what, Hal.<eos> Cakes are already in the shape of records.<eos> They do sound, we do picture.
I'm sure she has come to heaven.<eos> And if she is in heaven she's well.<eos> It's likely as with the monkeys and the little dog.<eos> - The died, too. - Yes.<eos> But they were up there already.
- Well.<eos> I do love the boys.<eos> They have always had a vivid imagination.<eos> Especially Elmer.<eos> It's hard to find out if what they say is right or wrong.
- May I give them a brief message?<eos> If your message is so important that it can't wait until tomorrow then it is your duty to tell me about it now.<eos> Don't get angry.<eos> It's not the children's fault.<eos> They've just l...
And that's the kind of attitude that's gonna serve you very well.<eos> Dottie Underwood was attempting to steal from some very powerful men who have even more powerful allies.<eos> Like who?<eos> The important thing is, you stopped her, and those men... They know you did.<eos> Now, you keep your nose to the grindstone, and they'll make sure that your next position befits your pretty face.
He was a farmer.<eos> That company paid rebels to burn down farms..<eos> ...and they bought them for pennies.<eos> Hmm. So what happened to the farmers?<eos> They became soldiers.
Why did you lie?<eos> You, and your parents.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> And my parents too... They didn't mean any harm.
The second St. Valentine killer.<eos> And he's got Rachelle.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> St. Valentine wasn't one killer, but two?<eos> Yes, and only Glen Baker was caught, leaving his partner in crime free to pick up where they left off.
A clawing sickness in our souls.<eos> No wonder you seek succor.<eos> I must ask you to leave.<eos> This world has become a terrifying place.<eos> You want to push your fears aside, but they are all around you.
In the last month alone, their actions have put several companies out of business.<eos> One of those companies maintained air conditioners at low prices.<eos> Another provided affordable vaccines to third world countries.<eos> So just have your Machine put them in white-collar prison where they can meet more of their kind and rob more innocent people.<eos> They didn't just rob innocent people, Sameen.
"What if it's cold or lonely?<eos> "What if we're not together?<eos> "What if there's nothing at all?"<eos> So, then the girl looks at the cord.<eos> This cord that has fed them, has nourished them, this cord that they can't possibly conceive could be attached to anything else.
Listen, the driver, in case...<eos> In case they get corralled by cowboys like you guys, they're supposed to make a run for it.<eos> If they can't make a clean getaway, then they're supposed to go to the river and dump the shit.<eos> Tio, he's got a lot of boys working for him in the river with ferries.<eos> They pick up the merchandise, they transfer it to another car, and they send another driver.
Oh, my love.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Your children can grow up here.<eos> Yeah, they'll wander the halls.<eos> They'll learn German from the balalaika player upstairs.
- Is Randolph coming?<eos> - This afternoon.<eos> I heard a very funny story about Randolph.<eos> Sarah Macmillan had some guests for the weekend and suddenly one of them comes in and whispers<eos> ' Randolph Churchill's in the hall' so, they all peer round the door to have a look anyway, he's driven up, drunk as a skunk, thought the house was an hotel marched in and ordered a gin from one of Sarah's guests.
- He thought it was an hotel.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Oh, he sat in the hall, drank it, left a tip and drove off.<eos> Why didn't anybody say anything?<eos> - They're all petrified of him.
Unless someone makes a decision soon, it's game over, anyway.<eos> No one's going home.<eos> We're staying, we're fighting, and we're getting out alive, with the hostages.<eos> Roger that.<eos> If we're flying blind, so should they.
It was accepted.<eos> Meet Hanoch of Ruben.<eos> He commands 6,000 Israelite soldiers.<eos> He will betray his King Saul and bring his men to the Philistine side.<eos> They bring with them 10,000 soldiers.
- Obviously they're trying to kill us.<eos> - Maybe, but maybe not.<eos> The truth of the matter is that these new comers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise that is a fact.<eos> Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.<eos> They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
I don't... want to get away.<eos> What?<eos> You don't understand, is all those cats fault.<eos> - What do you mean.<eos> - They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
Tuesday!<eos> - Help!<eos> - Help!<eos> Get me down from here!<eos> I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.<eos> But I think I got a plan.<eos> Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.<eos> Alright children, calm down.<eos> They just got lucky this time we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
He thinks Grounders can police Grounders.<eos> I mean, out there in the woods outside our home with a peacekeeping force?<eos> What would you do?<eos> What I wouldn't do... is wait for them to hit us.<eos> My scouts tell me that they've got 300 soldiers and not a single gun between them.
Thank you for backing me.<eos> I was just doing what was right for my people.<eos> Your ambassadors betrayed you.<eos> How do you move forward?<eos> They were doing what they believed was right for their people, too.
No, I haven't.<eos> I let this happen.<eos> I demanded an election... and now we have Chancellor Pike.<eos> We're on the brink of a war we can't win, and all I can do to stop it is send kids into harm's way.<eos> Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they're not kids anymore.
Those guys seemed to have no issues with Jung.<eos> It seemed like they only have problems with you, In Ha.<eos> I had an idea about the life you led.<eos> I really didn't think it was that bad.<eos> They are all sons of households that I know.
Did you say no?<eos> Yes...<eos> You speak!<eos> I must talk to you.<eos> We have two small children now, they need their father.
No, they're not, 'cause you're gonna call 'em and tell 'em.<eos> Tell 'em what?<eos> Tell 'em that we're shutting down.<eos> Give them the heads up.<eos> They can start looking elsewhere.
This time, the greater good will win out.<eos> - Greater good?<eos> There was a time when That meant protesting against wars And marching for equality, not this.<eos> - You remember those two monks who set themselves on fire To protest the war? - Mm.<eos> - I want that kind of dedication. - Oh, they were dedicated, all right.
(groans)<eos> (sighs)<eos> (electronic sigh)<eos> I admit the hallucinations were getting out of hand, so I stopped the meds.<eos> And hid them in the one place they'll never look: the library.
For the sake of your kids.<eos> Me?<eos> My kids are gonna grow up thinking that's the way<eos> - you're supposed to act.<eos> - They didn't see it!
They always do.<eos> They call me to tell me that their Instagram isn't loading.<eos> They're just not street smart.<eos> How are they gonna be street smart?<eos> They've never been in the streets.
Have you ever seen anything like that?<eos> Nobody can be that in love after 17 years.<eos> There's no way you make googly eyes at each other all day, and then get home and still want to fuck.<eos> We have to toughen up the kids.<eos> They'll get tough when they need to.
- Please don't.<eos> Listen, love, it's normal to feel ashamed.<eos> To feel like it's your fault.<eos> I teach little kids.<eos> They look up to us.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why do you think I picked you?<eos> I knew that you would understand them.<eos> And they'd understand you.
Hello?<eos> Martin?<eos> Diana, where are you?<eos> I told you not to hurt my children.<eos> They don't know any better.
Look, you want me to fix the part of you that makes money.<eos> But it is attached to the rest, so...<eos> Like I said, this is gonna take a little while.<eos> Why do I hate these guys so much?<eos> Well, they're criminals.

Time's what we need.<eos> We move at dawn.<eos> All right.<eos> We need to disable that rover.<eos> If they take it out, it doesn't matter how many Grounders they kill.
I understand you perfectly.<eos> These cocolos all over the ball like it's a free sandwich.<eos> Cocolos?<eos> For real?<eos> I bet you got cousins darker than they are, pana.
And I wake up.<eos> Oh, it's just your mind working on things.<eos> This process is not about epiphanies.<eos> Dreams matter, mind.<eos> And they're part of the architecture.
Tonight we are finally gonna get what we got comin'.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There are some sons of bitches who got no code.<eos> They are gonna get what they got coming.
While you were there, you got involved with Cuthbert.<eos> When you came back to England you were carrying his child.<eos> Your parents weren't too pleased about it, so they made arrangements.<eos> Miss Richardson, would you like to come with me, please?<eos> The food-tampering, extortion, all the rest of it, was your way of getting back at them, of hurting them as badly as they'd hurt you.
It's not easy losing someone like that.<eos> You speak as if from personal experience.<eos> My parents.<eos> They were archaeologists.<eos> When I was a kid, they went out on a dig.
They've got quite the social media footprint:<eos> Facebook, Twitter, sweet source page.<eos> - Sweet source?<eos> - Crowdbased fundraiser, so that couples who are financially challenged can help to raise money for their dream honeymoons.<eos> So they weren't targeted for their money.
My brother is missing.<eos> We help find Ama's grandson.<eos> Ama was friend to us.<eos> He says, spirits of the forest send you here.<eos> They help find.
Do you favor growing old to one day teach your ugly inbred children your grotesque manners?<eos> Lay hands on him... that'll be your end.<eos> That desert is three days across.<eos> That is, if our horses survive.<eos> - They die, we die.
Strange.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir, you're not going in?<eos> Our friends are in peril of their lives.<eos> They would not fail us.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Funds were raised to be distributed among those men who were left without a ship to crew to ease their need.<eos> And, ah... my Sayid stole it.<eos> He steals the money meant for the lascars,<eos> - therefore they kill him.
Only the highest buildings would poke out of the top.<eos> In a way, if you look at the crater surrounding us and imagine that once there was a cone built over our heads, that missing volume alone accounts for a huge amount of rock and pumice and lava.<eos> So, this has been spewed out over the Korean peninsula, it's in parts of China, it's in parts of Russia, and there's even about three inches of ash that fell over parts of Japan that you can still find today.<eos> Around ten years ago, there was a swarm of earthquakes that were detected by sensitive instruments around the mountain, and that really ignited the scientific interest in the volcano and whether there might be signs of reawakening.<eos> Over the last few years, we've built a really strong and unique collaboration with scientists from Pyongyang who've worked here for 10, 20 years, so they have very detailed knowledge of the structure of the volcano.
John Frum is like a gate.<eos> It is like Jesus.<eos> You have to pass through before going to God.<eos> What happens when people die?<eos> His believing is that when the dead are buried, they are in a room... waiting for the Last Kingdom.
It's already taken care of.<eos> I already talked to 'em.<eos> - You talked to who?<eos> - Elders.<eos> They gonna be there at noon.
That's all good when you're trying to keep out a vampire.<eos> This feels like something different.<eos> This here is hallowed ground, home to the nine covens of New Orleans.<eos> Y'all need to be on y'all's way.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna give you one guess what they're here for.
They found out earlier today.<eos> But it means they won't need your eggs which we've already retrieved.<eos> You have a decision to make.<eos> Can she keep them?<eos> They can be frozen for later use but there are costs associated with that choice.
A lot of politicians came to power on the backs of rich donors.<eos> They like it when you're confused and cynical.<eos> Yvonne's right.<eos> For them, the less you know, the less you care.<eos> So they get to make a lot of the big decisions for you.
So do I get an invitation to the wedding?<eos> Of course, you do.<eos> I was half expecting to meet Jordan when I got here.<eos> Yeah, well, he's a little phobic of small towns.<eos> He thinks they exist only to escape from.
She'd just landed her first leading role.<eos> She's hardly going to kill the golden goose.<eos> That young writer looked pretty murderous when Vivian refused to release him from his contract.<eos> What do you think, Father?<eos> I think that the problem with three actors and a writer is that they all lie for a living.
Well, since you're obviously lower on the human evolutionary chain, perhaps your hearing hasn't developed as well as it should, so I'll repeat myself.<eos> Who... stole... my... property?<eos> Everybody back the hell off or you're going to jail.<eos> Pardon my boys.<eos> They don't always have the best, uh, people skills.
This bruising here around the stab wounds.<eos> Hilt marks maybe.<eos> And these.<eos> There's subdermal implants.<eos> They don't look fresh.
I mean, I like the philosophy.<eos> But it attracts a lot of weirdoes who take it way too seriously.<eos> And, of course, now Rosie's dead.<eos> Yeah, and I see you have the same subdermal implants as she did.<eos> All the hard core members... they all get this.
- Uh-huh.<eos> And some people think O.J. was innocent, and some people think Rodney King was a victim.<eos> My problem isn't that I tried to frame Daniel Price.<eos> My problem is that the era of white males is over.<eos> Well, they had a good run.
But it's not gonna bring them back.<eos> I know that your parents died in that fire.<eos> - You shut up.<eos> - And that you feel responsible.<eos> Responsible because you lived and they died.
The next guy comes up to them and he goes, "Hold mah pocket!<eos> Hold mah pocket!"<eos> And he makes kids walk around holding the inside of his pocket.<eos> You understand?<eos> So he walks, and then they're like...
You don't even know how to try.<eos> Try what?<eos> How to pass their wack-ass tests?<eos> Passing their stupid tests ain't gonna get the kids back, Daya!<eos> They want to see money!
That's Dharavi.<eos> There are no formal street addresses in Dharavi, but the slums have organized an informal community mail service.<eos> They've been mapping the area for the past couple years.<eos> _<eos> We've worked out a deal so that they share their records in exchange for police protection.
There's the rousing vote of confidence I was looking for.<eos> Thank you, Professor.<eos> Word to the wise, don't ever sneak up in my blind spot unless you wanna eat a rebar sandwich.<eos> Your centurions... if they do find him, you must alert me first before they pursue him.<eos> I can finish him; they cannot.
- Work for me?<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - I'd like a position in your investment department.<eos> I've seen the stockholder reports.<eos> They're not handling your assets well.
- We got company.<eos> - Where?<eos> Behind us.<eos> It looks so much easier on the nature shows.<eos> Yeah, well, they don't show these bits.
Do I have his word on this?<eos> Of course.<eos> Forgive my mistrust.<eos> People have disappointed me in the past.<eos> Parents, wives, children... they all disappoint us, Eldritch.
Three weeks ago, you didn't believe strigoi existed, because I didn't explain them in scientific terms.<eos> How is this different?<eos> We're not going to win this war by deciphering a magic spell.<eos> Do you think these scholars made all this up? No!<eos> They witnessed a real event!
We took out the strigoi WiFi.<eos> You know, these monsters can't get a signal.<eos> You know, they're too dumb to hide or coordinate.<eos> Like animals, you know?<eos> They see food, they go after it.
When we ought to be continuing downriver.<eos> When we came up, we saw a few sizeable settlements.<eos> They were ripe for attacking.<eos> At least we wouldn't go home empty-handed!<eos> But they are not Paris.
He is a young man now, 12 years old.<eos> And you are certain that this Magnus is really my father's child?<eos> How can I be certain?<eos> I was not there at the conception.<eos> Why would they lie?
Forgive me asking, but how can such a man just disappear?<eos> Go and eat and drink after your long journey, Thorhall.<eos> We are grateful for your visit.<eos> I have to tell the boys.<eos> Where are they?
And now she's in the wind.<eos> Kiddo.<eos> Listen.<eos> Go back to those twins.<eos> They're your family now.
We just want to have a talk with him.<eos> BARTENDER:<eos> Listen, I can't help you.<eos> We don't mention their names for a reason.<eos> They make all this possible.
And I see you still they massa, I'd die every day.<eos> But when George and Matilda have children, if you ever touch just one, I'll kill you.<eos> And I'll hang for it gladly.<eos> Now, now, Kizzy.<eos> They're gonna be my grandchildren, too.
I'm Clark's father.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - Hi. Is one of your parents home, so I can just say, "Hi"?<eos> Uh, Mom's at work. Dad's at the store.<eos> Oh, okay. Um... And they're okay with this?
Even if I were to tell you, I don't... think that you could comprehend it.<eos> Oh, you might be surprised.<eos> You said your friend out there wasn't a spiritual man.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - "Though your sins are like scarlet, "they shall be white as snow."
Even if they're transferring a dollar or $1,000.<eos> And how reasonable is that?<eos> The term "money laundering" was invented by banks, and knowing your customer shouldn't be this complicated, expensive thing.<eos> And you shouldn't treat everyone like a criminal in the beginning.<eos> They really wanted us involved.
I don't think anybody would deny that it was a bit of a wild, wild west, because there was no regulation.<eos> There was no framework to evaluate the asset, evaluate companies, determine who was compliant and who was not, and a wild west attracts cowboys.<eos> And I don't think anybody here would disagree with the fact that a sheriff would be a good thing.<eos> A lot of, I think, the entrepreneurs feel like they have to self-censor.<eos> They don't want to come out vocally critical of the regulations.
I wouldn't write off bitcoin that easy.<eos> I know that bitcoin is gonna change the world.<eos> It's changing the world already.<eos> And we have to stand tall and proud as bitcoiners and early adopters.<eos> They don't know anything about new technology, but once it starts making sense, they throw their dollars behind it.
Yeah, $12.<eos> I was thinking right around 15.<eos> I think it was a slave state, so it might have been free.<eos> Oh, I'm just wondering... boys.<eos> - Boys. They're fine.
You left one of their own to fend for himself inside the cordon.<eos> I had to do that, sir.<eos> I know you did.<eos> That was your job.<eos> But now they're not doing theirs.
Because you're not there.<eos> [Sighs] I can't spend time alone with our kids.<eos> Can I get a babyccino and the check?<eos> What do you mean you can't spend time alone with the kids?<eos> They love you.
Or look like she weighs less than me.<eos> Also, you can't share food.<eos> Okay, I guess if you're stranded and you have to share food, then clear soups or broths only.<eos> And you will display your wedding band close to your face at all times.<eos> Photos of your children must be present if they themselves cannot be.
Well, at least Stella broke up with Justin.<eos> So that's good.<eos> Although there has been a lot of rebounding.<eos> High-school guys had the decency to sneak out the window.<eos> Now they come downstairs, and I have to pretend like I don't want to punch them in the face.
Thanks, Dad.<eos> This girl Jessica did it.<eos> We got wasted, and she cut it, and I honestly think she's gonna be the next big thing... not in hairdressing, but in telling people what to do.<eos> Oh, it's your grandparents.<eos> The new rule is they have to text before they come over, and then I can text back...
In front of the press with your son, you know what I mean?<eos> It's like, "See you later, mate."<eos> Round about that time, there was a story every couple of fucking months.<eos> "Poor old fucking Dad's trying to get in touch with his famous sons,<eos> "but they don't want anything to do with him," and all that bollocks.
Iris and Joe,<eos> Barry, especially Barry.<eos> You care about these people a lot.<eos> You know, but... but my friends?<eos> They're all back home on our Earth.
Oh, slow down. Slow down. I got this.<eos> - I got this. I got this.<eos> - No, you don't. And we got to talk about that.<eos> I don't trust the banks, okay?<eos> They destroyed my 401.
No.<eos> But there's somebody he will listen to.<eos> Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization like we've never seen.<eos> Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.<eos> Well, what do they want me to do about it?
Chris posted photos of the two of them on his Instagram account, hashtag "picked that cherry.<eos> Sweet."<eos> "Picked that cherry," really?<eos> Kids fronting on social media doesn't mean it happened.<eos> They lie all the time.
What?<eos> Yeah, he drinks appletinis.<eos> [laughs]<eos> What?<eos> They're good.
Okay, I can see you're upset.<eos> I would not go out there.<eos> There are zombies and poison gas.<eos> Ooh.<eos> And they're gonna be in here any second.
Bodies that his men put there.<eos> We think autopsies would produce some evidence that your client didn't want revealed.<eos> Now, normally, he wouldn't care if any of his underlings went down.<eos> They never talk when they're captured, and it's easy enough to rotate new sicarios into the country.<eos> But the men that killed those Hondurans, they weren't just any underlings now, were they?
- that carries great international...<eos> - Madam Secretary, I must tell you that the reluctance that I voiced to Mr. Maxwell was genuine.<eos> In order for Myanmar to sign this agreement, it must be amended to address the problem of the possible hydroelectric dams.<eos> This agreement was based on hard data from every nation.<eos> They predict that these hydroelectric dams will modernize your power grid, which will, in turn, help Myanmar to take better care of all of its citizens.
Let's just take that as a given.<eos> She's just like my dad... no filter.<eos> Well, speaking your mind is a McCord family trait that you all share.<eos> And our kids have inherited.<eos> How are they doing?
Don't be a freaking baby!<eos> Would you feel more comfortable if I had Clark come in to observe?<eos> Well, why stop there?<eos> Let's stream it live so my cousins in San Jose can watch.<eos> They're always asking me what I'm up to.
He'd love to go to the game with you.<eos> Oh, well, now that I'm aware of my condition,<eos> I can really feel it when you overstep.<eos> So, how are the kids?<eos> Oh, they're great.
Al, still not talking to me?<eos> I'm sorry I blamed you for all my stress.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's time for me to man up and start blaming the kids.<eos> They're growing up.
When you're an alien, and you've lost your world and you're dropped into a new one, you don't have a choice.<eos> Who's the new girl?<eos> Foster kid.<eos> Alex Danvers' parents took her in.<eos> I'd hate my parents if they did that to me.
Much like Krypton, this planet is on the verge of ecological destruction.<eos> I can stop it.<eos> But the humans won't like my methods.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> They trust you.
It looks like you gave him a camionazo.<eos> Come on, man, English.<eos> I feel sorry for you, man.<eos> I can't believe your parents never taught you Spanish.<eos> That's because they really didn't speak Spanish either.
Well, I am back to complaining.<eos> Told ya.<eos> As a result of being sober, I have somehow become compassionate and caring towards other people.<eos> And, quite frankly, it's ruining my life.<eos> You know, back when I was drinking and drugging, I could put up with a lot of crap from guys because I was just as bad as they were.
They kill for pleasure and their fangs are huge.<eos> And they leave their kill so that you see it, so that you know that you are the one that is being hunted.<eos> They've got these huge giant velociraptor claws.<eos> But, listen. Have a great honeymoon, Enjoy your time together.<eos> Don't sweat... Because they smell the sweat.
"I love you.<eos> "I love you, Sam.<eos> I love you!"<eos> "Apple juice eyes"?<eos> Don't be trying to play like they ain't rich, delicious, apple juice.
I suddenly remembered what Jin Woo used to say.<eos> He told me that he was on a team with a former martial arts instructor.<eos> He said he felt reassured because of him.<eos> There were many instructors in that company...<eos> Those guys' actions may be bad... But they are all from poor families... So they're doing it to earn what they can...
He said he felt reassured because of him.<eos> There were many instructors in that company...<eos> Those guys' actions may be bad... But they are all from poor families... So they're doing it to earn what they can...<eos> They shouldn't get hurt...<eos> To the parents of those boys... they are all precious sons, the apple of their eye...
They may check his cell.<eos> We must interrogate Mary.<eos> If Santos here he contacted her.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> They have children together.
But yeah...<eos> You think before that, Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you gonna be for Halloween?<eos> My mom found this picture on Instagram... of these kids, they were shadows.
But they didn't affect you.<eos> We reprogrammed our nanobots to avoid my DNA.<eos> They're still unconscious, but I'm told they should be fine.<eos> They don't deserve to be.<eos> They killed Steve.
- Titan.<eos> Yeah. You know about it?<eos> I know that the search for Titan only leads to death.<eos> Your friends... their rage is blinding.<eos> You need to see what they can't.
Here. You want to wake up?<eos> We did what we did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The report says Mossad grabs Kirschner when the show lets out.<eos> We need to get to him before they do.
W-Well, I guess I'll have to take it.<eos> By the way, the Straw Hat crew are here on this ship right now.<eos> What!<eos> ?<eos> I've heard they gave you a really hard time.
- I think you know precisely.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> But I can't just summon the brightest, most formidable men in the country and give them a dressing down, like children.<eos> Why?<eos> You are in the right, they in the wrong.
You come here to me.<eos> Yeah. Oh. [baby coos]<eos> [chuckles] - You know, my parents emailed.<eos> They should be here soon.<eos> - Oh. Well, they'll be so happy to see the baby.
What's going on?<eos> The Meyerist Movement was never intended to be three people at the highest rungs duking it out.<eos> It was meant to be a circle.<eos> Shouldn't we know what our youngest members think?<eos> They're closer than anybody else here to being one of those refugees.
I'm telling you, I was a mess.<eos> Bovie again, please.<eos> It was years ago now.<eos> But my parents and I got into a huge fight the day I graduated from medical school.<eos> They said I had an attitude problem 'cause I refused to pose for the usual smiling white-coat photos.
Are you sure?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You lie to me a bit too often.<eos> You said the kids from Haunted Village were safe.<eos> But they were all with me where I was kept hostage.
I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.<eos> You know them.<eos> How many of your children have been kidnapped?<eos> I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.<eos> They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.
(doorbell buzzes)<eos> Are you expecting someone?<eos> I got your address off the card you left with my parents.<eos> You mean, your marks.<eos> They think I'm at my tutor's right now.
Amphetamines give me diarrhea.<eos> - Wow, you just say anything.<eos> - It is part of my charm.<eos> Is that what your parents tell you?<eos> No, they tell me I'm a mistake.
God, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, Gordon, but we're not supposed to do that.<eos> You know, doctors and patients.<eos> Fascists.<eos> And you know, uh, what... what they don't know is that there's this great place in Koreatown that has the most...
I was a hell of a dungeon master.<eos> If players screwed up, they did something dumb, they paid the price.<eos> But... as they were bleeding out on the battlefield, there was always the Hail Mary.<eos> The god call.<eos> That 1% chance that the god that they worshipped would come down from the heavens, smite their enemies and save them.
This conversations is not getting anybody anywhere.<eos> My boss called this morning.<eos> Reminded me that we've got a serial murder case with no bodies and no witnesses.<eos> Juries today, they've seen every episode of CSI.<eos> They expect fibers, DNA, spectro... Whatever.
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?<eos> Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.<eos> I said, "What's new?" but sure.<eos> Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?<eos> Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
And it's really nice there.<eos> Just tall trees for days.<eos> Um, something about a place that gets so cold in the winter, 'cause in the summer, there's all this moisture, and so there's still these pockets of cool air, even in the hottest parts of the summer.<eos> I loved it.<eos> And... Glen's kids would romp and he loved taking them fishing, and there was a horse farm nearby and they would all borrow horses and go riding and, uh, Roger and Beth, Glen's parents, they would come over almost every night for dinner.
The worst, worst, worst, worst, worst feeling in the whole wide fucking world.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I would lie awake next to you, just thinking, what if she finds out?<eos> Like scared, like what if she finds out?<eos> And then all the shit with the kids when they were born.
Just get out and don't do it again.<eos> Just be alone, like me.<eos> You can't stay in this fucking thing just to try to make the truth not be true.<eos> That's insane, that's- that's Catholic.<eos> - Those kids love me, they really do, and I love them, and- and- and they lost their mother.
Running at 1,000 hertz, everything is fine."<eos> But those centrifuges are potentially spinning up wildly, a huge noise would occur.<eos> It'd be like, you know, a jet engine.<eos> So the operators then would know, "Whoa, something is going wrong here."<eos> They might look at their monitors and say, "Hmm, it says it's 1,000 hertz," but they would hear that in the room something gravely bad was happening.
That's Nitro Zeus.<eos> But my concern and the reason I'm talking... is because when you shut down a country's power grid... It doesn't just pop back up, you know?<eos> It's more like Humpty-Dumpty...<eos> And if all the King's men can't turn the lights back on or filter the water for weeks, then lots of people die.<eos> And something we can do to others, they can do to us too.
My name is Sweetie.<eos> I'm 10 years old.<eos> I live in the Philippines.<eos> Every day, I have to sit in front of the webcam and talk to men.<eos> They play with themselves.
I'm 10 years old.<eos> I live in the Philippines.<eos> Every day, I have to sit in front of the webcam and talk to men.<eos> They play with themselves.<eos> They want me play with myself.
Put your feet up.<eos> Are the associates still hating you?<eos> Let's see.<eos> Hey, Bob!<eos> No, they've come around.
- You had faith in Szorlok once too.<eos> What makes her any different?<eos> Even if you had the final piece, what then?<eos> You haven't got any plan what to do with it.<eos> - I'll give it to the gods, they can protect it.
Previously on "Salem"...<eos> The terror outside drives refugees into Salem, where soon they all, including my dear father, will be with the burning candles that ignite my inauguration.
Well, what's going on?<eos> Oh, I was thinking that, um, you know, I've been working so hard to get the gallery together and I just...<eos> I just haven't spent, you know, any time with the kids lately.<eos> Hey, you know, they understand.<eos> They're really proud of you.
He's there.<eos> The spirits have taken him up there.<eos> They have... oh, they have put hot irons in his head.<eos> - Mrs. Arnold, just...<eos> - Oh, they've... oh, they've... they've... they have put them on me.
And our kids?<eos> Are we putting them in danger?<eos> I mean...<eos> We're a target now.<eos> Are they?
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.<eos> And Manik's name has been included.<eos> I told you we'd get in deep trouble.<eos> I just spoke with them.<eos> But they are saying the same thing.
He also got into Howie's box spring, and he shat... He shat, Bill... In Barbie's Dream House.<eos> Well, he is a puppy. What did you expect?<eos> Well, for starters, Bill, I didn't expect you to buy the kids a dog without asking my permission first.<eos> Libby, Baxter is strictly the children's responsibility.<eos> No, I made that very clear to them before we even left the pet store, and they promised.
Well, for starters, Bill, I didn't expect you to buy the kids a dog without asking my permission first.<eos> Libby, Baxter is strictly the children's responsibility.<eos> No, I made that very clear to them before we even left the pet store, and they promised.<eos> Which shows exactly how much you know about children.<eos> They will say anything.
I got mixed up.<eos> I thought that... you were going to visit your parents.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, no, I...<eos> Uh, they came to visit me, so...
There is not a soul who can stop me.<eos> - What's become of Mary?<eos> - She's dead.<eos> For now, we go home... for her.<eos> The terror outside drives refugees into Salem, where, soon, they all, including my dear father, will be but the burning candles that ignite my inauguration.
They suspect each other, that's gonna fuck up the meeting, and pretty soon they're gonna wanna kill each other.<eos> - Cy ops.<eos> - Well, that's kinda how we do.<eos> Anyway, we've just succeeded in burning these bitches to the ground, because Rivera can't figure out why his Arab partners decided to wage a secret war against him at this critical junction.<eos> He doesn't know that they haven't, and we have.
Work it out.<eos> - It's one small concession.<eos> - It's not small.<eos> Look, we are about to tell my parents that we got married, eloped.<eos> They wanted to be at my wedding.
- It's one small concession.<eos> - It's not small.<eos> Look, we are about to tell my parents that we got married, eloped.<eos> They wanted to be at my wedding.<eos> They thought they were at my wedding.
It's, Yeah.<eos> Rule number four.<eos> And this is the most important of them all.<eos> These characters cannot know they're in a drama.<eos> If there are any secrets that you know that they don't, you cannot tell them.
Teresa!<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> So, I was talking to Chuck, and I just mentioned the name "Mike Baxter"<eos> and his eyes lit up.<eos> They were lit already.
The harvesters saw Ben.<eos> I know what it's like.<eos> To see something that you can describe, and no one will believe.<eos> To feel a sense of an ending.<eos> - They brought him in.
Step one, build pressure inside the volcano by sealing the vents.<eos> No steam can escape.<eos> If there's a leak... The pressure is weak.<eos> Step two, get the biggest magnetic crystals into the volcano.<eos> They've got to be launched sky high to pull the asteroid off course.
Rand keeps his failures on the lower levels.<eos> Your servers are above them.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Come on.<eos> They didn't deserve to live.
This is an interesting theory, but I have a plane to catch.<eos> I'm traveling with friends.<eos> It's not a theory.<eos> Your friends visited Semper Apex the day after the robbery.<eos> They posed as clients.
You knew about that?<eos> It's my store.<eos> I know everything.<eos> Look, the point is, you made the tough decision and fired him, like a leader.<eos> They respect that.
Percy's bringing Laurel back to Pride's bar. Gonna meet him there.<eos> You should join.<eos> Sure.<eos> Think there's something off with these Militia member statements?<eos> They're all saying the same thing.
Boycott Cloud 9!<eos> - Who is that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mean, I Tweeted out #ProtestCloud9, and I guess just all these people showed up to support us.<eos> Not to brag, but I have, like, 1,500 followers, and then they inevitably retweet, and so it's essentially like community organizing, which is actually how Obama got started...
- Hey, there he is, all right.<eos> - Thanks a lot.<eos> They're not here to join us.<eos> They're here to replace us.<eos> Then why did they high-five us?
A damn shame!<eos> Should you not have gone to your parents first with this news?<eos> No. Because I believe it rests with you as to what I tell them.<eos> Surely not.<eos> Mary is owed a word on the matter, and so are they, but I've no part to play.
And it's much closer to the dog groomers where I get my nails and goatee trimmed.<eos> Now, let's talk laundry.<eos> I have a half load of whites.<eos> Do you mind if I throw them in with yours?<eos> They are ripe.
We're in a prison filled with con men.<eos> Everyone here is full of shit.<eos> And the difference between you and them is they know they are.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means that they know they don't have the patience to earn what they want, and that's why they go out and steal it from other people.
And that odd mr. Coldbear<eos> I switch between the two Now that i've learned how to use the clicker.<eos> So many buttons.<eos> Obviously a criminal mastermind.<eos> They, uh, they can be tricky.
Men take all of it.<eos> Come.<eos> The girls here aren't the ones in cages.<eos> The men are, especially the ones who serve her.<eos> They got no choice but to obey.
Your parents did not give you up.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, actually, I do. I have my people looking into your background.<eos> I know who your parents are.<eos> They didn't care about me and my brother, so I don't care about them.
Well, actually, I do. I have my people looking into your background.<eos> I know who your parents are.<eos> They didn't care about me and my brother, so I don't care about them.<eos> Nadir, it's much more complicated than that.<eos> They left us on the street to die-- what's complicated about that?
Previously on "Criminal Minds"...<eos> Peter Lewis.<eos> He had two very biological parents and they ran the foster home.
Everybody always believed Jessica.<eos> She was the warm one.<eos> And that was why your parents put you in Radley.<eos> It was that or prison.<eos> They thought I'd be safer.
I went to see Nicole's parents.<eos> I wanted them to know about us and... they needed to know that I'm moving forward with my life.<eos> Yeah. What did they say?<eos> They were happy for me.<eos> I never understood why they were so worried about me.
I wanted them to know about us and... they needed to know that I'm moving forward with my life.<eos> Yeah. What did they say?<eos> They were happy for me.<eos> I never understood why they were so worried about me.<eos> They were the ones who lost their daughter.
Oh, Spencer, hi.<eos> Hi, how are you feeling?<eos> Got some bruises, cracked rib.<eos> But the doctors say I'm lucky.<eos> What do they know, right? Hey.
God knows I made some mistakes.<eos> But never once did I waver from what I knew to be right...<eos> The core values that run through all of our veins.<eos> Honor... courage... commitment.<eos> And I served my sailors as they served me.
The idea is great.<eos> The prospectus kicks ass every meeting we've gone into.<eos> 14 VC firms and nobody's stepped up, why?<eos> Well, these clowns want to make you wait.<eos> They think it gives them some kind of an allure.
Well, these clowns want to make you wait.<eos> They think it gives them some kind of an allure.<eos> But it just takes one of them to ask you to the dance.<eos> God, I love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.<eos> We can hit them with all the data and all the hard facts we want, but the minute we walk in there, they still see just one thing.
- No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Horace: This is in the Bible?<eos> - I'm paraphrasing it, but it's--<eos> They're gonna fuck 'em.
- I'm paraphrasing it, but it's--<eos> They're gonna fuck 'em.<eos> Yeah, I don't- - I don't get it either.<eos> I don't know if that's like the last...<eos> Maybe they've just all fucked so much that there's not a new hole in town, but I don't know when Lot moved in how he got past that gauntlet of dicks that apparently--
Those two employees I spoke with earlier-- are they the only ones with access to the system?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, then it wasn't an inside job.<eos> I saw honesty markers on each of them.<eos> They didn't do it.
Ooh, hold on, because I had found something on his parents before.<eos> Right here.<eos> When he was 15 years old, the factory his father worked at was sold to a consortium.<eos> All of the jobs went overseas.<eos> They lost their main source of income, and the bank foreclosed upon their home.
What happened?<eos> They got nick.<eos> Who? These guys are north precinct<eos> Same as the guys that arrested me.<eos> Nick told me that precinct was black claw. Well if they control it That's probably where they took him.
Don't tell 'em I said that.<eos> I won't, but you should.<eos> They need to hear that you think they did a good job.<eos> I'll put it in my will.<eos> They think I should sell.
Her people are stealing drugs.<eos> But I don't think they're working.<eos> She's gonna come after you.<eos> Or her goons will.<eos> And they'll lead me to her.
- Yeah, well, because that's what's probably gonna happen.<eos> It's called the singularity and it's inevitable.<eos> And eventually, all those artificial brains are gonna become self-aware.<eos> That's just where it's going.<eos> And then they're not gonna want to be our slaves no more, and then what's gonna happen, they're gonna decide we're toxic slugs, right?
It's called the singularity and it's inevitable.<eos> And eventually, all those artificial brains are gonna become self-aware.<eos> That's just where it's going.<eos> And then they're not gonna want to be our slaves no more, and then what's gonna happen, they're gonna decide we're toxic slugs, right?<eos> And they're gonna try to exterminate us.
I'm not gonna marry either of you.<eos> I'm not even a prince anymore.<eos> I'm done with it all.<eos> So do what you want to me, but let my friends go.<eos> They never did anything to hurt you.
Would you like to cross-examine him?<eos> - No, cross your honor.<eos> Minal Arora, please take the stand.<eos> The charges against you are quiet serious Do you have anything to say?<eos> Sir...they are all lying.
They might be interested.<eos> And it will be easy to brow beat them.<eos> So you won't really have a problem in extorting them.<eos> But that didn't happen.<eos> They weren't interested.
Your honor, she's lying<eos> - No, our men were posted there.<eos> You're lying, Ms. Sarla<eos> - No, why would I lie?<eos> You are lying - No, sir, they were there.
Listen, Lewis, keep out of Troy for the moment.<eos> I'm trying to make things right with Fabien.<eos> The bosses decide they're going to go up against each other, and we run away and hide like we always do, while they ruin Troy.<eos> When the humans aren't stepping on us, then the gangsters are.<eos> They're all part of the same problem.
I can't believe you brought me to an AA meeting to meet men.<eos> Oh, sweetie, this isn't just any AA meeting.<eos> Oh, my God, they're all so pretty.<eos> Don't be intimidated.<eos> They're just like you, but better.
But they are businessmen. They positioned ships at the four corners of the country. Why?<eos> Symbolic. "We got you boxed in."<eos> They are trying to prove themselves to potential clients who want to bring the U.S. to its knees.<eos> These guys are bright, 18 to 25-- because young people are driven to prove themselves-- and-- if I had to guess--<eos> Eastern European, because instead of focusing on our monetary system or electrical grid, they went after our military.

And with the engine off, the hackers won't be able to control the plane.<eos> Then we just get the plane's original, unhacked firmware back onto the jet's computer.<eos> And I can do it with this.<eos> With a stud finder?<eos> You know, I can't go near stud finders. They always go off.
But the Pentagon is going to need a new relay server.<eos> And a new building to put it in.<eos> Guys, the destroyers are still under hacker control.<eos> Their signal wasn't even interrupted for a second.<eos> They spoofed a signal to the white shoe office to sniff out anyone who could be posing a threat.
I suppose before we do anything, we ought to question them.<eos> So far up Mr. Goggle's...<eos> If we can even manage to get a word in.<eos> I don't understand why they were tracking us in the first place.<eos> Because they're the Justice Society of America, the single greatest secret force this country has ever known.
I can't argue with you, man.<eos> They got some serious skills.<eos> Big deal.<eos> Apart from the fancy headquarters, discipline, and calls from the White House,<eos> I mean, what do they have that we don't?
Don't you turn your back on me, boy.<eos> There a problem, Mr. Collins?<eos> Just a house boy who don't know his place.<eos> And needs to be taught some manners.<eos> These zombies, they're...
I can tell a vendetta when I see one.<eos> I'm kind of an expert when it comes to revenge.<eos> This is what it's like working with a woman?<eos> You just sit around and talk about your feelings?<eos> Well, if your "feelings" are what almost got you hung, then, yeah, I'd say they're worth talking about.
Tell us something we don't know.<eos> Like what exactly have we done to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Yet.<eos> But they see individuals with powers such as yours as a future threat, and, frankly, so do I.
Let's honor the legacies of our fathers... Together.<eos> Why, Anatoly?<eos> Why kill them?<eos> You rang bell.<eos> They did not.
It's real enough, ok?<eos> It's--it's better than our real lives.<eos> In--in this life, Laurel is alive, my parents are alive.<eos> But those are not your parents.<eos> They remember the only lullaby that would actually work to put me to sleep.
Was it a hallucination from all the drugs?<eos> A message from my highest self.<eos> I was awake all night thinking about this.<eos> My kids ripped my bones out.<eos> They betrayed me.
Frank's genes might not be quite as bad as Monica's, but...<eos> But they suck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> They fucking do.
Everything's gonna be cool.<eos> Hey!<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> The still just blew up out of nowhere, sounded like a mortar round.<eos> Your men, are they accounted for?
This is a ground-penetrating radar device.<eos> But what interests Vince and Paul is the remains of an older monument they found buried underneath it.<eos> The radar located a series of very large features.<eos> There's a long arc of stones, or large buried features underneath the bank.<eos> So they've remained undetected, effectively, for several thousand years.
Listen carefully.<eos> Where we're about to go will test the limits of your mind.<eos> What we're about to experience will test the fortitude of your very soul.<eos> You will not simply gaze upon the secrets and mysteries that lie beyond these walls.<eos> They will gaze into you.
Just tell me about the tall men.<eos> Okay.<eos> There are these tall men in dark suits.<eos> They work for the credit card company.<eos> They... they're...
They... they're...<eos> They're like collectors.<eos> - Collectors?<eos> - Yes, yeah.<eos> What they do is they...
- I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.<eos> - They love you, too.
So as an example of this end of times battle that Isis believes is going to take place in a small village called dabiq in Syria.<eos> Now this village, has absolutely no strategic value, militarily whatsoever.<eos> Has hardly any economic strategic value either.<eos> But Isis has nevertheless committed resources to conquering this small village called dabiq.<eos> They believe that the international community and the coalition must somehow be driven to come and meet them in dabiq and engage in a final battle.
It's the light of my soul.<eos> My soul and it says that you take it wherever you think it good for me.<eos> ♪ ♪ The hindu version of creation appeals to me.<eos> It says the gods weren't even around at the original creation.<eos> They have this great saying from the rigveda about the beginning.
Isn't that linked to autism?<eos> In Russia, we don't do vaccines.<eos> In winter, we send baby out to nap in cold.<eos> It gets immune to virus.<eos> So the doctors inject the babies with a virus to prevent the virus, but does that mean that they give 'em a virus that they didn't already have?
- So, do you still have that Adderall?<eos> - Oh, the Adderall.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do. At home, yeah.<eos> - I think, if you want, I could get rid of some of it for you. Um...<eos> Those jocks... they think... They think it's performance-enhancing.
In my head.<eos> But I'm still mourning them as I knew them.<eos> My baby Sam.<eos> My little boy Dean.<eos> Just feels like yesterday, we were together in heaven, and now... I'm here, and John is gone, and they're gone.
Oh. I've had worse.<eos> I don't know what's going on between you and your boys, but I gotta tell you, mom to mom... they are good men.<eos> Best I've ever met.<eos> I know.<eos> They're not the problem.
Bad luck driving' over the dead.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Drive over him.<eos> Woah. Wanna die for the banks?<eos> I promise they're not gonna die for you.
Your grandfather had to touch every lamppost he passed.<eos> He couldn't hold a job.<eos> Until he got a job as a lamppost repair man. Why wouldn't you just call?<eos> Oh, I got kicked in the back of the head by some kids who were using that dump as a place to practice their urban dancing.<eos> They-they were honestly pretty good, until they beat me and took my phone.
What the f...<eos> Really, man?<eos> Hey, man!<eos> Hey!<eos> See, these niggas in the streets, man, they...
Bur the other kids never hinted a thing.<eos> Boarding school kids have different codes and ethics.<eos> You should've won over one of them to keep an eye on Rohan.<eos> Idiots!<eos> They will never use their brains.
- ...and triangulate the kidnappers here.<eos> Correct? - Absolutely, officer.<eos> Kidnappers will realize that they are trapped their stakes are too high.<eos> And pardon me for what I am about to say.<eos> They will panic slash the boy's throat and disappear in the crowd.
Didn't I tell you... No overt arrangements, no Red Alert, no Press!<eos> If the kidnappers panic, the boy will lose his life.<eos> We will lay the trap smoothly.<eos> You mentioned they might have abducted him by mistake.<eos> They will let him go when they realize it.
Another bridge collapsed.<eos> The extra fee...<eos> Thieves, all of them.<eos> This is what happens when you cheat people.<eos> They are all in it together.
Go!<eos> Bye, Little Bird!<eos> Coward!<eos> What did the alley kids say?<eos> They say okay.
Last I heard, 600,000.<eos> You keep getting spotted on your infil, pretty soon the Navy chaplain's gonna be talking to Julie.<eos> We weren't spotted, Captain.<eos> Those guys weren't on patrol, Bob Lee.<eos> They were coming right after you.
I like you in thick black rims.<eos> I'm thinking retro Clark Kent.<eos> Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I have to be honest...<eos> gadgets and gizmos have been around the medical industry forever.<eos> They come and go.
Come on, Lee, let us help you find Flora.<eos> We got all this equipment here just waiting to be used.<eos> We can work together to contact the spirits.<eos> Believe me!<eos> They will find us!
I just gave you $4 million.<eos> Huh? Wha... How?<eos> My phone. Duh.<eos> Have fun with your new friends.<eos> They seem insane.
- No.<eos> And what the hell happened? Who shot Fred?<eos> There were two men hiding under the bridge.<eos> One we released from his body, the other still lives.<eos> They threw the goddamn dog off the bridge.
When rumours spread that Ivan had been killed, a mob stormed into the Kremlin and they were led by the royal guards themselves.<eos> To calm the situation, Peter's mother walked out onto the palace balcony at the top of this staircase.<eos> She was holding hands with both Peter and Ivan, to prove to the mob that they were very much still alive.<eos> It must have been a terrifying moment for the little boys, for Peter and his brother.<eos> But when the rebels saw that they were still alive, everything calmed down.
Peter III, Catherine's late husband.<eos> His line was that he'd just been away, he'd been in Egypt, but now, he was back.<eos> He very quickly gathered around him a massive movement of Russia's disenfranchised.<eos> Pugachev said that as the true tsar, he would grant the serfs all kinds of new rights and that they should rise up against their evil landlords.<eos> They did this.
- That shirt's no good.<eos> - I have another one in the office.<eos> That's OK, just button up the jacket.<eos> Your zoo is a meeting place for different species... monkeys inside the fence and people on the outside... how do those species get along?<eos> People are always very interested in the monkeys... because they resemble us... so they're our main attraction.
What for?<eos> ...and strengthened me.<eos> Because Uncle Tom refuses to take vengeance in his own hands, he was not a hero for me.<eos> Heroes, as far as I could see, where white, and not merely because of the movies, but because of the land in which I lived, of which movies were simply a reflection.<eos> I despised and feared those heroes because they did take vengeance into their own hands.
You're in control.<eos> You're in control.<eos> When did you know the time was right to start talking?<eos> Hey. I talked to my brothers, which I didn't expect, but...<eos> But they knew, 'cause the same thing happened to them.
You are Escorpion.<eos> You did this!<eos> You got it wrong, man.<eos> Tell your men to back off!<eos> They're not my men.
Wouldn't want to be rude.<eos> -[yelps] -[thud] [rooster crowing] Looks like somebody had a really crazy party.<eos> Ah... [chuckles] It looks like Clover actually did it.<eos> She fake-napped my parents.<eos> Now, all we have to do is find where she stashed them, set them free, and they'll be convinced to leave forever and-- [groaning]
- Hi.<eos> We've got a first-aid kit on board.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> These men, they ran us off the road.<eos> They said they were hungry.
You saved my life.<eos> Happy to.<eos> You did something for me too.<eos> You know, I um...<eos> I've been hunting aliens for so long that I never really stopped to consider that maybe they weren't all hostiles to be caged.
Camulodunum is the Roman capital in Britain, one in a string of settlements across the south-east that keep the Empire anchored on the island.<eos> With Paulinus and his legions heading to fight the Druids in Mona 290 miles away, the town is nearly defenseless.<eos> Camulodunum is the festering boil for anyone with a grudge against Rome.<eos> Not only is it the administrative heart but it's filled with retired Roman soldiers.<eos> They're the ones who've extracted the money from taxes, they've insulted the gods, they've violated the people.
The inhabitants were Roman veteran soldiers by and large.<eos> So now, they could and should expect the full might of Rome to be deployed against them.<eos> I knew nothing would happen.<eos> You were right.<eos> They have attacked your people?
You will also double the tribute to 1,400 pounds of gold.<eos> Reject these terms, and I will send you and your men back to Constantinople in bags.<eos> I will present your terms to the emperor.<eos> My men will ensure your safe passage to the borders.<eos> They will pay the tribute.
They say it has magical powers, that it proves his divine right to lead.<eos> That's nothing but folklore, superstition.<eos> I know that!<eos> But his armies don't.<eos> They believe it.
Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You want mercy from me... after what your father's thugs did to my family?<eos> You know, after those men killed my Eddie, I heard one of them say he hadn't met the boss.<eos> They said, "Well, you got to meet Ewan.
- The governors speak highly of you.<eos> - The governors?<eos> My dear, if you're going to answer everything I say with a question, well, then, we'll be fine friends because I do like being the one with the answers.<eos> Well, I've never met the governors.<eos> They think you're a frightfully useful member of staff. Must get on!
I know.<eos> You work so hard.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> You have not mentioned your new friends recently...<eos> Oh, they're not my friends!
Am I gonna wake up in bed and these past couple of months are gonna be a dream?<eos> Does that actually happen to your species?<eos> My mum is dead.<eos> My... brothers aren't answering.<eos> They're supposed to be in the school library, but... ..I'm too afraid to check because what if they...?
Most of the good in the world is gone.<eos> Hate hate seems to be the only thing that grows anymore.<eos> You don't need fangs to be monster.<eos> They're worse than the vamps.<eos> They chose this.
Can you hear me, Lord?<eos> Can you answer me, Jesus?<eos> What's a man to do?<eos> Every which way we lead them...<eos> We've had them, but they're...
The engines igniting,<eos> ramping up... and liftoff.<eos> The year in space starts now, Kelly, Kornienko, Padlanka on their way towards the International Space Station.<eos> Going to Mars, not only will people become invested in the safety and well-being of the explorers, but also there is that drama, that sense of suspense, as to whether or not they can survive on a world<eos> that they were not made for.
Just challenging.<eos> Our next candidate, Moanica D'Kay...<eos> Needs no introduction.<eos> I'm not gonna try to sell you some mumbo-jumbo dream about living side by side with humans.<eos> If I'm elected, I'll make sure we never have to hide from the humans because they'll be hiding from us.
Then I'll just never fall<eos> And I'll stand alone<eos> On my own<eos> I wish my parents were here.<eos> They'd know what to tell him, wouldn't they, Speed?
You know the stats?<eos> 22 every day.<eos> Though, in truth, there are some Vietnam dudes that are jacking up our numbers, but still.<eos> I thought starting today, things would get better.<eos> But they don't give a shit.
My family growing up was problematic too.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I just said it was.<eos> Yeah, my parents never bonded with me on account I was born dead.<eos> So, emotionally, they already buried their son, but then oh, shit, dude's alive.
- Invaders reside among you!<eos> This way.<eos> Blemish the city, ravish the people!<eos> Satan will get you!<eos> Fear for your children, for they will perish.
You just want to make me fat!<eos> Coconut Laddus!<eos> I feel like breaking a coconut on everyone's head.<eos> No! No violence. Do deep breathing.<eos> What memories will parents leave behind for us when they can't remember anything themselves?
She has chosen not to work right now. Okay?<eos> Kiddo, go, get her.<eos> - Don't worry, Mom.<eos> Make her understand that once her parents moved back, she never failed in school again.<eos> So, they took the right decision.
Then, a year later, my mom said that they were coming back for good.<eos> Dad's friend had offered him a business partnership here, in Goa.<eos> In all these years, dad couldn't set up his business abroad.<eos> So, imagine, all this for nothing!<eos> So, they came back.
Knock, knock.<eos> Warren.<eos> You might want to take a look.<eos> Your lost boys are bleeding out.<eos> They knew what they were in for.
- Go to hell.<eos> - So what's going on, then ?<eos> Hana, you have your daycare, but what about us ? All my money goes towards running the pub, and Tonda's been out of work for nine months, now.<eos> You think the miners are going to make everything good again ?<eos> They promised they'll employ all the local men.
It's hard to imagine you as a teenager.<eos> Well, I wasn't always this mature.<eos> Eliza refused to leave.<eos> She said that my parents would want me to be loved, and that nothing would replace them.<eos> That they were a part of who I am.
And in a flash...<eos> Everything gone.<eos> And after this,<eos> I couldn't think of my work without thinking of my nephew having dinner with his parents at the kitchen table.<eos> They would never let me stop making bombs, so I... I had to defect.
So all I got to do is save the vice president of the United States.<eos> Sure, no probs.<eos> Relax.<eos> This Atzerodt guy shows his face, just point him out to the vice president's bodyguards.<eos> They'll do the rest.
I want to help.<eos> Please, Catwoman.<eos> Those venal villains are committing the biggest heist Gotham City has ever seen.<eos> You'd be in danger.<eos> You do remember they tried to shoot me into space.
But why?<eos> I mean, no one will ever see it.<eos> The actors will see it.<eos> Oh, well, they're pros, Monroe.<eos> I'm sure they're...
I'm always on him about the old neighborhood.<eos> It's because of me he was with Marcus.<eos> Bad things happen in every neighborhood.<eos> We've got good kids.<eos> They've got good parents.
Those guys had some dirt on their clothes and it's itching the hell out of me.<eos> Yeah, well, we got bigger problems than scratchy skin.<eos> They lured us here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They don't even know who we are.
Guys we know nothing about.<eos> They're Aldorrian, for whatever that's worth.<eos> I could tell from their dialect of Spanish.<eos> Aldorrian?<eos> They've been involved in a vicious border war for years.
Because I am too scared to get in mine because your Rittenhouse guys hacked me while I was going 50 miles an hour!<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Do I look all right?<eos> Right, well, I'm sorry.<eos> They, um, shouldn't be contacting you directly.
- They're far from perfect.<eos> - Here.<eos> Bull-headed, stubborn, reckless.<eos> And also recklessly brave.<eos> They charge in without a thought to themselves.
Yeah, but that'll only get us their previous locations.<eos> We need to find out where they're heading to next.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You really think these guys stuck around the bomb sites to tweet?<eos> No, they must have preloaded their messages on a timer.
No, no, take what you need.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, we're ready.<eos> I'm gonna put the earpiece in.<eos> I can hear them, but they can't hear me.
Every girl I ever dated was subjected to an inquisition.<eos> So you're saying Scorpion is acting like a teenage girl?<eos> Well...<eos> No.<eos> I think they care about you.
And you kiss me with that mouth?<eos> Let's get this up to Henry so he can pack the Bug before the new tenant comes.<eos> W-wait, wait, wait, wait, Hang on, hang on.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.
Okay, that should draw her out.<eos> How do you know it's a woman?<eos> I'm glad you asked, Mateo.<eos> Birds don't have genitalia as we're familiar with.<eos> They have internal penises called cloacas.
I'm glad you asked, Mateo.<eos> Birds don't have genitalia as we're familiar with.<eos> They have internal penises called cloacas.<eos> Okay.<eos> And when they become very engorged...
It's just an open carry protest.<eos> Gun owners are just exercising their second amendment rights.<eos> It's all perfectly legal.<eos> Okay, but let's not let this little gun thing overshadow the real problem, which is the crows.<eos> They are equally as dangerous.
- Okay.<eos> - Dina?<eos> You know, I think I saw some really sketchy types headed for the stockroom.<eos> Sounds suspicious.<eos> Yeah, they were... they were carrying, uh, toilet paper and shaving cream.
That's why you're gonna push the kegs over.<eos> PAIGE Ten seconds.<eos> TOBY I don't see any movement.<eos> I don't feel good about this.<eos> Maybe they're out of air. Maybe we should pull 'em up now.
This idea that we're hunter-gatherers we're hunter-gatherers.<eos> we've been gatherers.<eos> One of the problems has to do with sexism.<eos> It has to do with the fact that the gatherers and children.<eos> and they got the glory.
you can't be eating lousy foods and expect your children to eat healthy because you tell them to.<eos> that's number one.<eos> I encourage all parents to make the preparation of meals and the shopping of food inclusive with their children.<eos> The more you can bring your kids into the fold the more they're going to develop an emotional attachment to where their food comes from and the impact that it's having on their health.<eos> Really get inside their heads and sort of think how they would think.
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, God, baby, what happened?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> They just... They drove me some place and locked me in this gross room.
Your safe passage through our system is secure.<eos> If you've lost communication, something's happened.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> I should go with you.<eos> They're my men.
He will do anything to stop them.<eos> Volkoff had us arrest someone here.<eos> A man named Artem Fedor.<eos> He was working for Volkoff's enemies.<eos> But when Fedor did not succeed, they came to me.
I'm just gonna create a little diversion, during which I'll get one of these bastards close enough to take their mask off.<eos> Okay, crazy.<eos> I'm in.<eos> No.<eos> They're already suspicious of you.
Raul Ruiz said that this big commission I earned is going to push us into a higher tax bracket.<eos> I looked into it, and it's true.<eos> I'm going to end up losing money on this sale to pay more stupid taxes.<eos> Well, you know, taxes aren't all bad.<eos> They pay for stuff we need, like roads and schools.
I guess that math adds up.<eos> And we're not gonna be alone;<eos> the zoologists who hired us are supposed to be meeting us here.<eos> Yeah, Dr. Bryce and Jody MacMillan.<eos> They went in earlier to clear the cave of any hikers, and they'll meet us in chamber one.
Nobody...<eos> Only the gods.<eos> The gods?<eos> What does it matter to them?<eos> They know the truth.
Well, I suppose it's best summed up at this stage by saying "political reasons."<eos> The problem was that the Ferrari team manager was playing his own political game.<eos> He had no particular liking for Surtees, and he nominated another driver to go out and start the race, to be the hare, even though Surtees was clearly the fastest man available.<eos> And I just stormed away, drove back, and had it out with the old man.<eos> As the Italian papers put it, they showed a picture of me walking out the gates and saying,
I'm sorry, but I can't share that with you.<eos> It would breach confidentiality, given the nature of the surrogacy agreement.<eos> You mean the agreement you have with Jenna?<eos> No, with the biological parents.<eos> Aren't they in violation of that very same agreement by...
Of course.<eos> Hi. Good to meet you.<eos> Uh, well, before we start, I just wanted to... I want to get something off my chest.<eos> I do understand the perception, you know.<eos> These L.A. actors, they come out here, right? They do their little quick stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.
Good. Now you can take care of this.<eos> A baby?<eos> But where... where did it come from?<eos> What... where are its parents?<eos> They no longer matter.
The Stoics believed that you can only be happy if you let yourself be guided by reason, and overcome desires and fears, far from all the passions.<eos> All that you can imagine.<eos> Including sex.<eos> Ignoring the stoics.<eos> They try to achieve a state that they identify with the "apatheia", the absence of passion.
You really think steaks are gonna fix this?<eos> No.<eos> That's why I also got him "Despicable Me" on Blu-ray.<eos> Those Minions, man.<eos> They just don't listen.
Okay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My doctors treating you okay?<eos> Uh, too well.<eos> They visit twice a day to give cognitive evaluations.
Yeah?<eos> Mr. Lawson?<eos> What do you want?<eos> We're here about your daughter, Valerie. Can you open up?<eos> They, uh... called me at work.
Target in sight.<eos> Three o'clock.<eos> We have visual.<eos> Your parents sent us.<eos> They want you to live.
Oh, you're taking credit for this?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Because after school today, your kids were out of control.<eos> Our living room was like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.<eos> Okay, so they're my kids when they do something wrong?
I need to talk to you.<eos> Things no better at home?<eos> The kids are lying.<eos> We know they're lying.<eos> They know we know they're lying.
We can't use any of the tools our parents or teachers used on us.<eos> So the answer I came up with is this.<eos> See this marble jar?<eos> Every day the kids behave, I add a marble.<eos> When the jar is full, they get a party.
So the answer I came up with is this.<eos> See this marble jar?<eos> Every day the kids behave, I add a marble.<eos> When the jar is full, they get a party.<eos> But what they don't know is sometimes I do this.
Around the front.<eos> Bad guys coming!<eos> Battle stations!<eos> Okay. What are you doing?<eos> Jamming their walkies with a little Christmas cheer so they can't coordinate their attack.
I heard their stories.<eos> I heard their problems, their little victories.<eos> I saw their children come home from the hospital...<eos> Elliot, David, Winnie.<eos> They were my family, these people.
-Soon I won't be able to help you.<eos> -I can't tell you anything.<eos> I swear I don't know anything.<eos> Our job was to let members of the Guild operate in peace.<eos> -And they'd help us in return.
Don't you get it?<eos> If you're a customer, go buy something.<eos> If you're just here to bitch at me, get out!<eos> Look at your friends.<eos> They seem normal.
I'm too good to waste my talent for greed<eos> I need room to flex my muscles<eos> In an ocean where the big sharks feed<eos> Make me Yankee<eos> They're my family
Many of you brought that person with you tonight.<eos> A brother, a father, an uncle, a brother-in-law, a sister, not a sister, I know, I just threw that in there.<eos> And they are the organized one in the family.<eos> They never lose their car keys.<eos> The conservatives, they've got little hooks in the, by the back door, with a label on each hook.
So I met one of the five Democrats in town.<eos> (audience laughs)<eos> And he comes up to me yesterday and he goes, "Mike, Mike, we got to do something<eos> "about the millennials.<eos> "They're, they're not gonna vote, they're not voting.
He must have kept quiet all those years.<eos> But he's thinking, he's planning.<eos> He gets all these other cardinals to think he's some conservative asshole from some South American dictatorship.<eos> Then they vote him in, and they're like, "Whoa!"<eos> They don't know what to do.
I guess that's it.<eos> We are an army of honor and glory.<eos> Our predecessors came from Mount Jinggang, and went through countless hardships.<eos> Their blood was spilled in the Xiang River, the Dadu River, the Yellow River... and the Yangtze River.<eos> They won one victory after another.
Don't worry.<eos> I got it.<eos> Let's just skip the part where you singlehandedly fought off 20 armed guards.<eos> What happened next?<eos> I got us out of the vault, but those Secret Service guys, they... they caught up to us.
I've got a couple left in the trunk.<eos> A little help, buddy.<eos> - Oh, on the other side of the gate?<eos> - Come on, Phil!<eos> Couldn't they just circle back around?
You should be managing people like Donovan.<eos> Beautiful idiots?<eos> - No offense. - Oh.<eos> And these objectively handsome men.<eos> They're models, too. Just like me.
Some trees, it seems, are particularly suitable for rubbing.<eos> Bears have their favourites and will travel long distances to visit them.<eos> Some itches just have to be scratched.<eos> There are now around 30 bears in this one valley.<eos> As they rub, each leaves an individual and recognisable scent.
He's busy, that's all.<eos> I wish you were my dad.<eos> I'll try to take his place.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm better friends with the boys than they are with each other.
I thought you must have got lucky because the gods chose you, but... Maybe that is not true.<eos> But you are not viking.<eos> You renounced your heritage!<eos> You embraced our world and our god, and I have had your children.<eos> And they are not viking.
Are you kidding me?<eos> This imagery is live.<eos> Means these subs will be within attack range of our west coast within 24 hours.<eos> China's message is clear.<eos> We hit them with a cyber weapon, they'll hit us back with a conventional one.
Doesn't go far on an empty stomach.<eos> Where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd do better to ask the horses.<eos> They know.
I've been told that the lands you chose are some of the finest in the Empire.<eos> My soldiers are extremely grateful.<eos> That means everything to us.<eos> I've been thinking...<eos> They're not the only ones who sacrificed.
What is wrong with you?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I give everything to these boys, and all they think of me is that I'm a pushover not even worthy of a lousy prank.
Isn't there an evacuation plan to deal with this situation?<eos> There is... no plan like that. There is... no plan like that.<eos> That's because there was no practical way to carry it out.<eos> But... we should at least evacuate residents near the power station.<eos> During ventilation, they would be the first to suffer fatal injuries.
And then we could work out from Collins who his contacts were.<eos> Decades of experience, months of planning, and it all went up in smoke.<eos> How would you sum up what went wrong?<eos> They're very much analogue criminals operating in a digital age.<eos> They weren't prepared for the type of detective, the modern digital detective, who was gonna come after them.
They also wear g-suits and special flight suits that compress their legs to squeeze the blood from the lower extremities towards their head to prevent blackout.<eos> So...<eos> The real question is, who's gonna be the top gun for the g-forces?<eos> Well, these guys, the Red Bull pilots, rack up some insane numbers.<eos> They regularly hit 10 Gs pulling off some incredible maneuvers.
It's time for us to find out which tech is the most hated.<eos> After applying our three criteria... how long they've been annoying... and potential to get worse... here's how the six contenders rank.<eos> Buzzing in at number six:<eos> Drones.<eos> It's predicted that they'll be swarming our skies in the future, but they're just not annoying enough.
How close to the envelope, the peak of performance, are these guys?<eos> Joss was saying their biggest limiter is the course itself.<eos> They have to stick to a 1000 meters.<eos> That's not gonna change.<eos> But as far as the aerodynamics go, they pretty much made their suits and equipment as efficient as possible.
You got peacocks.<eos> That is so awesome.<eos> Yeah, and make sure to tweet about it and tag your friends,<eos> Relax.<eos> They'll tweet.
..and get some South Indian instant food packets.<eos> I'll cook them a curry..<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> You're thinking about food at this time.<eos> But they are not eating anything.
No.<eos> Rollo!<eos> Athelstan, ask the King who used to farm this land he has given us.<eos> He confesses that he has had to remove several Saxon farmers from their lands.<eos> Then ask him if they will not be hostile to us?
It is about our people's future.<eos> And I do not want there to be endless conflict between us and the Christians.<eos> You're mad, Ragnar.<eos> Deluded.<eos> There can be no reconciliation between our gods, the true gods, and the God that they worship.
To Helga and my child.<eos> Don't worry, Bjorn.<eos> I will finish the boats.<eos> And in the meantime, tell our brothers about this.<eos> Who are they?
That was nice.<eos> Don't blame me, Mr. "Just the Tip."<eos> (Chuckles) And twice. Mm.<eos> I mean, I love 'em and all, but...<eos> How great was it before they showed up?
You've always been a decent man, Colin.<eos> But that's not why I married you.<eos> I married you because I knew you had it in you to be a great man.<eos> And great men, men who build legacies, they aren't always decent.<eos> They understand that people... they need someone to tell them what to remember.
Look at these creatures.<eos> They've got millions of years of instinct in their cells, instinct that we can program.<eos> Their loyalty cannot be bought.<eos> These guys are gonna run straight into the enemy's teeth and eat them, belt buckle and all.<eos> What if they decide they wanna be in control?
But they're not.<eos> They're alive.<eos> I'm fully aware they're alive.<eos> You might have made them in a test tube, but they don't know that.<eos> They're thinking, "I gotta eat.
Please, I'm begging you!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> Sir!<eos> Conniving bastards...<eos> They've been playing cards by themselves all this time.
She needs to rest.<eos> We'll tell her tomorrow.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Something happened to my parents?<eos> No, they're fine.
You shouldn't go out.<eos> Audrey!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Or they'll come for us.
While the villagers cowered, the princess, prince, and huntsman...<eos> Change the story, Jones!<eos> Change the story!<eos> "Change the story."<eos> Uh, the wolves, they were all suddenly blind.
"Change the story."<eos> Uh, the wolves, they were all suddenly blind.<eos> It has to be a story.<eos> Stories have a beginning...<eos> the wolves hunt your friends... a middle... they find them... and an end... the wolves kill everyone!
They died a long time ago.<eos> Well, the loneliest thing in the world is a motherless child.<eos> Well, I got two brothers and my sister Viola...<eos> Well, let me shave you dry.<eos> They don't amount to much, do they?
-Oh, okay.<eos> But we were, like, having fun, and, like, laughing and doing bits.<eos> We were doing like, "Ooh, kill 'em, kill 'em." and they're like, "You don't..."<eos> And we were like, all laughing.<eos> And I saw the reflection of this, like, of the car in the and I was so old, and they were so...
You have it.<eos> - Have it'?<eos> We fuckin' played it.<eos> - Well, then you have fucked us all.<eos> The possessed bodies, they kill all in their path in preparation for Aeloth's ascension on the next blood moon.
- Oh...<eos> Brodie!<eos> - Told you they'd be okay.<eos> - No you didn't.<eos> You said they were probably dead already.
# When you see a hand that's held out towards you<eos> # Give it some love... #<eos> - Did your parents encourage you to sing at all?<eos> / - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> They wanted me to be a schoolteacher, you know. Like all parents.
I don't really remember... No comment.<eos> It was really only the acceptance of millions that could make up for that way that she's grown up.<eos> If everyone loved her, then it was OK but if anyone didn't, they could destroy her in a minute. How were you different from your schoolmates when you were in TJ?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you ask them?<eos> It was they who made you different?
- I don't remember.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom. And...<eos> They didn't think...<eos> I don't think they wanted to take me.
What?<eos> As requested, there's UFO equipment.<eos> Why are you interested in that stuff?<eos> I thought you said UFOs were a crock.<eos> They are.
Long live Naples!<eos> Ah, thanks!<eos> To the walls!<eos> Ready!<eos> - Hold till they fire!
- I think she should either go or...<eos> - Or what?<eos> Or bring the van into the drive, where we can forget about her.<eos> Actually, that's why some men marry.<eos> So they don't have to think any more about their wives.
- No.<eos> - Not going?<eos> Only to the day centre, apparently.<eos> The children always ask after her.<eos> They used to be so frightened of her when they were young.
No. They have mixed blood.<eos> And so no place.<eos> No family.<eos> ~ LAUGHTER NEARBY ~ Look.<eos> Who are they?

Dr. Milgram.<eos> So your subjects, they thought the shocks were real, that they were delivering 450 volts,<eos> - 65 percent of them.<eos> - Mm.<eos> But they were not particularly aggressive or sadistic people.
- My guess, Occ Health and Safety.<eos> - Wrong.<eos> Correct answer... no one.<eos> Because they are not actually employees.<eos> So they don't have to take the seminar.
I am the Chief of Staff, I am not the technical director for...<eos> And in your effort for "efficiencies", equipment contractors were changed...<eos> We've had this discussion, Frank.<eos> These tanks, they have no government oversight, no required safety regulations.<eos> They would be safer

We will need your help.<eos> We want to buy petrol, but we don't have any money.<eos> We can give anything... everything that we have.<eos> You've been traveling with your sons?<eos> They are not my sons.
- What's this right here?<eos> - A place you don't wanna go.<eos> Landry, what are you doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> CDC doctors are... anxious, they're...
I won't let them destroy your home.<eos> Thank you, Peter.<eos> Now I need to go pay respects to our dead.<eos> Not alone, you don't.<eos> My friends they may not care about giving those people a proper burial. But I'm not like them.
- This is wrong.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> No...<eos> I mean, mycotics are brutal.<eos> They... They're clumsy.
Are you threatening me?<eos> We all use the tools at our disposal.<eos> You as a politician, me as a father.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Doctor... you told me to follow my instincts... and they tell me not to give in to this criminal.
I hope it's very important.<eos> It's about Gustavo.<eos> Tell us, then.<eos> I've been told the Ochoa brothers have been seen in Cali.<eos> They are the ones who turned Gustavo over, in exchange for the cartel helping them seal a deal with the government.
Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.<eos> What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.<eos> For every one of our men, they have 20!
Or teenage boys.<eos> Teenage ex-cons, all right?<eos> - Maybe. Yes.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> I... they had a lot of tattoos.
Storms and bad weather.<eos> His silly sea-beacons.<eos> He still has not completed them.<eos> Compare our sorry reckoning with the magicians of the Golden Age.<eos> They transformed themselves into mice, foxes, rivers.
- The power of those who have it.<eos> - And those in power?<eos> Those kids.<eos> We have no authority over them.<eos> They know that every ... disciplinary action we take is a mere suggestion.
Alive perhaps, but which are very dangerous for the curve...<eos> For the shape, the shape of the picture.<eos> I often am troubled as to whether!<eos> Cling to the, what I call the rising curve-shape of a story ...and whether I shouldn't experiment more with a looser form of narrative.<eos> Sometimes it's very hard- - - ...because if you work for character direct, they'll take you along where they want to go. And I'm like the old lady with the boy scouts.
We're done talking.<eos> 90 seconds.<eos> I didn't give you up, it's a lie.<eos> They want you to fight me!<eos> They... they want us to Change and then they'll kill us both!
No...<eos> You only care about yourself, Elena.<eos> Can't escape your own mind.<eos> Selfish!<eos> They're all going to die because of you.
-Simone... ls it true that you put things on hold after all?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Too bad.<eos> Did you know that rabbits belong to the happiest animals?<eos> You give them a toy and they are entertained for weeks.
You don't have to say why you're here.<eos> Why don't you tell me how you're feeling right now?<eos> I feel like everyone's judging me.<eos> And how does it feel to tell us that?<eos> Like I'm a little girl and my parents are looking at me the way that they look at me now.
Missed you.<eos> - She missed her?<eos> - They were a whole floor apart.<eos> So, Greer, have you spoken to your parents lately?<eos> - Oh, no, did they call you or something?
- They were a whole floor apart.<eos> So, Greer, have you spoken to your parents lately?<eos> - Oh, no, did they call you or something?<eos> - No no no.<eos> I just wondered if they'd been in contact with you separately.

Well...<eos> It might be overstated.<eos> But, you worked for the sentinel services, right?<eos> Thirty-five good years.<eos> They were implicated in the whole thing, two of the directors went to jail.
Hey.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - I have a few questions about those men.<eos> Okay.<eos> Were they--? Were they on the land or in the water or what?
Enormous things. - Oh.<eos> They hunted in packs.<eos> They'd isolate a cow or a sheep or what have you by barking and growling.<eos> But when they finally attacked it was completely silent.<eos> They'd... They'd tear out the windpipe first.
They'd isolate a cow or a sheep or what have you by barking and growling.<eos> But when they finally attacked it was completely silent.<eos> They'd... They'd tear out the windpipe first.<eos> You couldn't hear anything but the blood splashing on the ground.<eos> They didn't protect anything.
With a purpose... to eat.<eos> Not always.<eos> Sometimes a shock would run through the animals, like a tremor, for no reason at all.<eos> A kind of bloodlust.<eos> I often wondered if they remembered it afterwards... this frenzy.
Got herself a man now, does she?<eos> Mind your manners, lad.<eos> Know your betters when they address you.<eos> One word from me and you don't have an arm anymore.<eos> They know how to behave.
You were the one who put it together.<eos> Toby asked me to put it together.<eos> Did he ask you to plough thousands of pounds of his money into it?<eos> What you need to understand is that an opportunity like this takes some serious funding.<eos> The partners that I'm dealing with need to know that you're as committed as they are.
- What are you studying?<eos> - Nothing. College is stupid.<eos> Then who made you do this.<eos> - My parents.<eos> - What are they like?

NOW, I BROUGHT A RECORD<eos> OF OUR CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOUR BANK.<eos> NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS,<eos> YOU CAN SEE THAT WE PUSHED, BUT JUST...<eos> THESE GUYS, THEY JUST DO NOT WANNA WORK WITH US.
To a place named after a saint.<eos> Come on, calm down.<eos> Made you a tea.<eos> Five sugars and extra milk, just how you like it.<eos> Did they take anything?
The plague children.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> Did they really bleed to death?<eos> No one knows.<eos> They... disappeared.
And it's the last thing that she saw.<eos> Your little brother, He didn't say goodbye to the spirits, did he?<eos> No.<eos> They came to him.<eos> Because he is a child, like they are.
Sir, why was this sport deemed illegal, until now?<eos> In India, even kissing in public is illegal.<eos> It's very sad.<eos> This country never gave any recognition to its mixed-martial arts fighters as sportsmen.<eos> They never got the respect they deserved.
I hate to be presumptive, but was that inmate pregnant?<eos> This is a good example of our concerns.<eos> The costs associated with a birth while the inmate is in our care.<eos> And they're prohibitive, to say the least.<eos> Great thing about men, they don't have uterus's.
They'll see it on my face...<eos> that I'm with God.<eos> I don't wanna disrespect your beliefs, but that sounds like a bunch of crap.<eos> Hey, easy.<eos> They think not wearing buttons makes them closer to God.
At least that part came true. - It did. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> "My wish is to marry Jake." (groans)<eos> "And, if not, one of the Hanson brothers.<eos> "And that we have three sons and they start a band, like the Hanson brothers."
Mad wizards?<eos> The people need to be ruled by wisdom.<eos> The stupid, little humans need to be ruled by kings.<eos> No, no.<eos> They have earned the right to rule themselves.

So it is no surprise.<eos> You know how many friends I have at my job?<eos> None.<eos> More like negative 50,<eos> I've been there 19 years and I try to be friends with my partners, and you know, they always wind up going to someone else.
I like the vision.<eos> Especially if I'm part of it.<eos> So that's why you wanted everyone here tonight.<eos> Because you don't want to lose all your friends after senior year.<eos> And I hope they don't want to lose me either.
Do you remember me, Charles?<eos> We were on a co-defense...<eos> Church's Donuts v. Amendola? Oh. It was...<eos> Jesus 9, 10 years ago. Yeah.<eos> Oh, our guys were suing the other guys, and they were suing us right back, and the city had some grievance with everyone, so we had to bundle like four actions together, and I was sure that we were sunk.
...each unique citizen contributes to our future.<eos> Can you turn that up?<eos> Our forefathers, when they declared independence, understood the power of the individual, the value of self-determination.<eos> They freed us from tyranny.<eos> - They proved...
We got to go, so go get your suit on.<eos> I wish grandma and grandpa would just go away.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't mean that, buddy.<eos> They love you.
That... that's great. How'd it go?<eos> Well, I mean, he was really mad at first, but we talked, and we cried and... I'm gonna go see him.<eos> Really?<eos> Your folks said that's okay?<eos> Yeah, I mean, they're still really angry, too, but at least they agreed to open the door when I get there.
That's a million dollars.<eos> Then he pays off the vice-consul to push the deal through.<eos> Well, it's a nice theory.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You can start with a subpoena for Navilet's financial records, see if they show the deposits that Sloane made into that offshore account.

If that's the case, then why are his parents not invited to this lunch?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Opal.<eos> This is a celebration, as you put it.<eos> So why is it that they can't sit here with us instead of having to stay beneath the house waiting for a bell to be rung?
Throw in a priest, you got a good joke.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't see that you had friends over.<eos> Patrons, yeah.<eos> Okay, well, they can hear this too.
~ Not a question, Ruth.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Your parents didn't make it back home yet, Cathy.<eos> And what that means is...<eos> They're not coming, are they?

- No?<eos> - No.<eos> - So, someone hunted down a boy dressed like a girl with generous genitalia and kills them.<eos> How is that not a hate crime?<eos> Lieutenant, hate crimes, they tend to be, uh, personal, brutal, symbolic.
I thought you said that kid was the one... like, "the one" the one.<eos> Well, we haven't really defined it yet, so I don't know.<eos> Sweetie, let me give you some advice.<eos> Little boys are into grown women for one of two reasons.<eos> One: they want killer, uncomplicated sex with a woman who can orgasm on a dime or two nickels.
- Yeah.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I love plastic horses.<eos> - Really?<eos> - They're like... almost the best thing in the world.
All right, I'm coming with you.<eos> Uh, no. I'm gonna need someone a little more fallen.<eos> Valentine: You know, I know what it is with you and this case.

She looked for me for 13 years.<eos> You ruined her life.<eos> You ruined all of our lives.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> They did.
You forgot to mention it to me? Gin, I didn't think he meant it.<eos> It's like a kid saying he wants to - be an astronaut or an Indian chief.<eos> - He meant it.<eos> You'd hope that getting hit by a car would've knocked some sense into him.<eos> George, you have been a perfect shit in almost every respect, but especially for taking my kids away from me. Because if they had their mother around them more...
We can't keep burying this family.<eos> You still got a son.<eos> We're gonna have children.<eos> And you deserve to be in their lives.<eos> And they deserve to be better than we've been.
- Yeah.<eos> - And then you ran straight out of the building.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, if you don't believe me, you can ask the firefighters.<eos> I mean, they saw me.
This does not add up.<eos> It just seems too fast.<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> Gil comes down the stairs, onto the street.<eos> The firemen swore that Gil was coming out onto the street just as they were pulling up.

Why?<eos> Because you were being a reckless idiot.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Or was it 'cause they were friends of yours?
We don't really know.<eos> We don't spend too much time talking to them.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> Get to know them.<eos> Because one day, they may be the best friends you've ever had.
That's awkward.<eos> Well, if you ever need anything, my door is always open.<eos> (quietly): One, two, three, four, five.<eos> Because feelings don't take vacations, do they?<eos> They work in 24-hour shifts.
Halliburton wanted me for their COO.<eos> One time, a very drunk Boris Yeltsin called to tell me that if I wanted Russia, he would just give it to me.<eos> I could've had wealth and power beyond my wildest dreams!<eos> But instead, I chose a career filled with service and sacrifice in order to nurture and enrich the delicate minds of America's children.<eos> Since day one, they have been and will continue to be my number one priority.

I wanted to lead them as far away from civilian traffic as possible before I stopped the truck.<eos> We don't have any witnesses who say they saw these guys pull up on you.<eos> Yeah, well, that's what happened.<eos> Keep going.<eos> They followed us into the lot.

Not yet.<eos> But take a look at this.<eos> Since 2007, 11 different feet have washed up in Canada on the shores of British Colombia.<eos> No one knows why.<eos> So they don't have anything.
They were trying to control me.<eos> Now you're trying to do the same.<eos> No, that's not true...<eos> Parents can be so bossy sometimes can't they?<eos> They got worse after you left.

That's why we're here.<eos> A rich person gets hit-and-runned, the big guns get called in.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Bertolt Brecht says, "corpses sour you.<eos> They are bad for objectivity."

Whoever's doing this, this isn't over.<eos> That is what the children call "Drill."<eos> It appears to be some form of energy.<eos> He uses kids, but not just any kids.<eos> They all have access or information.
Everyone was gone.<eos> Did she say who the important friend was?<eos> No, just that this friend knows things... things that the other kids don't.<eos> With Drill, it's not about the child. It never is.<eos> It's about who they have access to... their parents.
He and his parents were in a group that helped refuseniks.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Still want to meet those guys from Strasbourg?<eos> It's not to chitchat.<eos> They have no time to waste.
He's way out of my league.<eos> Your three hubbies get jealous?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I get jealous.<eos> If they touch another girl, she's dead.
Oh, for goodness' sake!<eos> We saw it!<eos> I saw naughty children throwing marbles.<eos> But did you, though?<eos> And tell me, how can it, or they, get one to go over that light and hit that lamp with such velocity, it destroyed it?
Well, it IS strange.<eos> But you don't go running to the papers, bandying around the good name of the SPR the first time you can't explain something.<eos> The papers came running to us!<eos> And who called them?<eos> THEY did.
You're not going anywhere near the Hawkesbury River, Will.<eos> Blacks don't bother you.<eos> That's not what I heard.<eos> They're not like the blacks around here - they're too drunk to throw a spear.<eos> You leave them alone, they leave you alone, simple as that.
'Oh, well, you know, no more whites below the South Arm.'<eos> Promised 'em that.<eos> Didn't make no difference, but.<eos> They was lied to, see?<eos> And they figure, if we're not gonna give, then they're gonna take it back - all of it.

We met at gymnastics, through our kids.<eos> She just seemed so warm and friendly.<eos> Doug, too, and they just... Seemed so happy together.<eos> What about the other parents there?<eos> You think they felt the same way?
- Bullshit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Oh, I do apologize for my associates.<eos> They panicked.

Your father and your brother belonged to a secret group, the Sicarii.<eos> They were craftsmen in death.<eos> Cruel and ruthless.<eos> They killed men like leaves, so many they could not be counted.<eos> Oh, they were counted, all right.

I would very much like to hear stories about your son.<eos> In his last hours, he asked me to tell him about my life with you.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> I told him the truth, that it is God's gift to me to be by your side that the gardens seem so glorious<eos> that they themselves gave birth to beauty... and might steal the breath from any man.
Come on, you can tell me. Like what?<eos> Well, like, uh... when they told me I couldn't play anymore,<eos> I thought my life was over, but...<eos> but it wasn't. You know, before I got hurt,<eos> I thought nurses just cleaned up after patients, but they were so much more.
Yeah, well, it doesn't look like this baby's gonna wait for a wedding.<eos> What are you... what are you doing in here?<eos> Getting some privacy.<eos> Well, your lab results came back.<eos> They show very high levels of marijuana.

Shadows.<eos> And these people imprisoned there are seeing these shadows, hearing those noises, and they believe that is reality, that the shadow is reality.<eos> Now if one of these people decides to free himself, leave there, and if he is able to get away little by little, and starts to climb the wall, and if he is able to get to the other side, this person will discover that those<eos> shadows weren't made by just the human beings like them that were there, around a fire, but by much more, the whole world, all the huge expanse of the world and of nature.<eos> If this person decides to go back into the cavern, to reveal to his old friends and companions that the situation they're living in is absolutely misleading, he will run, according to Plato, serious risks of being ignored.

I jumped!<eos> You really want to talk about this right now?<eos> Yes I think it's high time, don't you?<eos> You didn't want to tell your parents.<eos> They would've never accepted it and you know that.
- His grandfather founded the company, his father expanded it, and Hartley here was set to inherit the throne.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - He came out to his parents.<eos> Old money, old values.<eos> - They were estranged when we met, but, brilliant. I couldn't have built the particle accelerator without him.
It's just a sexual harassment training video from my restaurant.<eos> Oh, I've watched the video.<eos> I know it's completely innocent.<eos> I'm confused why we're here.<eos> If the boys think this is a dirty movie, they obviously don't know what sex is.
What's your point?<eos> I mean, my father was helpless, but we can do something.<eos> Marseille is a shithole.<eos> Guys fight each other.<eos> We go in, and they fight us, too.
Three attacks in the last hour.<eos> Without a technological advantage, this is the Espheni's idea of a counterpunch.<eos> Yeah, I'd say at the moment, it's working.<eos> I contacted the Volm orbiting team as you requested.<eos> And in return, they... they transmitted a scattered communication relay.
I guess they're back.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need a couple of mobile units to pick some people up.<eos> But listen... they need careful handling.
Yeah, I'll... I'll I... I'll look for those.<eos> Have you tried on the gloves yet? I have not, but I... I will.<eos> Well, when you're feeling up to it, it might be worth giving them a go.<eos> They're obviously just a prototype,<eos> But they're laced with a microthread I designed,
An opportunity to kill more of these bastards?<eos> [ gun cocks ] I love you're whole thing.<eos> You know that?<eos> Hold out for them as long as you can.<eos> They'll be right behind you.
They're the same.<eos> Coulson's powered pet Tried to kill seven of our agents... Dedicated s.H.I.E.L.D. Agents with families,<eos> And you're gonna say that they're the same?<eos> Coulson had nothing to do with skye's powers.<eos> They were caused by a weapon in hydra's possession.
- Right.<eos> After two days of intensive searching, police have still failed to find missing teenager, Dawn Ashworth, who didn't come home on Thursday evening.<eos> Local residents already fear her disappearance might be connected to the murder of Lynda Mann, whose body was found only a few hundred yards away, three years ago.<eos> Residents in the village of Narborough say they are still afraid that the killer may be someone they know and terrified that he may have struck again.<eos> The police say they're still confident they will find Lynda's killer, but villagers are now getting increasingly worried and say they won't be able to rest until an arrest is made.
- I don't care.<eos> Well, then at least be smart about it.<eos> Give the papers to a reporter, anonymously.<eos> Let the newspapers fight the government.<eos> They can afford it.
Well, she was, but she left.<eos> But I thought after Jason came back to work--<eos> Yeah, he did and she left.<eos> Um... Okay, well, financial aid is based on your parents' income.<eos> They don't think that your mom can pay, but they think that your dad can.
Huh, that's so weird.<eos> Isn't that weird?<eos> Well, we'll have to reschedule.<eos> Oh, but wait, we're about to hit Autumn, and you know my autumns.<eos> - They're packed.
He brought a girl.<eos> A-and five guys.<eos> O-or six.<eos> Yeah, s-six or seven guys.<eos> They... they beat the snot out of us,
Question is, who killed them?<eos> These guys?<eos> No, two couldn't kill hundreds.<eos> And why were they listed among the dead?<eos> Unless they assumed the identities
I got six guys out there who'd love to take your place.<eos> Oh, this is new. It's lighter than it looks. Yep.<eos> Lab boys just dropped it off.<eos> It's 10% titanium alloy.<eos> Although, I don't think they had 38-22-38 in mind when they designed it.
That must be a very hard habit to break.<eos> - That is immensely disturbing.<eos> - I'll knock on a few doors, see if any of the neighbors know where Ida may have gone.<eos> In the meantime, see if you can track down the owners of the building.<eos> They may have a paper trail on her.
There's an imaginary line out there Between right and wrong. Good and evil.<eos> I believe what I'm doing is good.<eos> And I believe what I'm standing up against is evil.<eos> It's the cartels, they are the ones terrorizing their own country<eos> And now they're starting to do it over here.
I'm going to teach our coward king a lesson.<eos> Apollo damns you.<eos> See, boy...<eos> I am protected by the gods.<eos> And, in time, they will return me to my throne.
The blinding staff of truth will sweep you all into the sea!<eos> Father!<eos> We will see what dawn's first light does to you, creature of the night.<eos> Where are your sons now?<eos> They spurn their mother!
Why would I ever fall for your vacuous charms?<eos> No, no, you're nothing to me.<eos> You are dead.<eos> And you are a fool to trust in the gods.<eos> They protect me as they protect you.
If Hermes truly believed you to be a threat, he'd have killed you.<eos> He's afraid of the ring.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> He'd have found a way to take it from you nevertheless.<eos> They're keeping you alive, all of us alive, for a reason.
You said so yourself.<eos> He'd have found a way to take it from you nevertheless.<eos> They're keeping you alive, all of us alive, for a reason.<eos> The gods don't work with one mind.<eos> They battle each other just as much as mortals do.
[Hero]:<eos> Who will lead us over the Bridge? [Medea]: Someone who sees clearly without her eyes.<eos> [Hero]:<eos> The Oracle of Gaia. The gods don't work with one mind.<eos> They battle each other just as much as mortals do.
My heart belongs to Dionysus, dark god of mystery, father to my beautiful children.<eos> [whispering] Is this the work of the gods?<eos> Gods?<eos> [laughing] Jesus, no.<eos> They're a thing of the past, thank God!
For what?<eos> That is the call of Aiakos.<eos> The gods sit in judgment.<eos> Of us?<eos> They want to judge us?
I have come to set you free.<eos> If you help me destroy your children, gods led by their selfish appetites, and let mortal man govern himself.<eos> I am your one true god.<eos> Release me, and you shall see my light.<eos> Will you help me bury your children as they have buried you?
He was dancing to the speed of time.<eos> What?<eos> If we were to move fast enough, we, too, would disappear, like a hummingbird's wing that beats so fast, it shimmers into a blur.<eos> Perhaps the gods aren't that different from us.<eos> They just live in a different speed of time.
All we would see is the trail they leave behind... wind, storm, earthquake.<eos> No.<eos> The gods live in a spiritual world we will never understand, ruled by mystery and magic, not science.<eos> Not science, nature.<eos> They are ruled by nature, just like us.
Your mother, your first mother,<eos> Gaia.<eos> Why have you cursed me?<eos> The riddle that lives inside you is the work of the gods.<eos> Will they release me, restore my lover, Ariadne, and my mother, Aethra, whose lives were unjustly taken?
Do it.<eos> Do it! You won't kill me, not because you care, but because you know you need me.<eos> Magic isn't going to open the door to Olympus.<eos> The gods aren't creatures of spirit.<eos> They are as real and as tangible as you and I, and only a man of science can unlock their door.
Oracle of Gaia.<eos> This repulsive man... his blood will forever stain your hands. You are ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> You have made your third and last sacrifice to the gods.<eos> Now they will accept you.
Before coffee.<eos> I'm teaching today.<eos> And I'd really appreciate it if you would try for once to be polite to my students.<eos> I am polite to your convicts.<eos> They, however, have no respect for my home.
You understand?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> 12 Monkeys...<eos> They're my cover band.
Yes, everything.<eos> Then let's use it.<eos> That won't work.<eos> There's two switches.<eos> They've gotta both be thrown.
All his chains are gone!<eos> You!<eos> How could you?<eos> Oh, you know how these bad boy types are.<eos> They only care about themselves.
Cisco, what happened out there?<eos> I followed your directions exactly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I led you the wrong way.<eos> The schematics that we had, they... they weren't up to date.
♪ ♪<eos> I've been having these dreams.<eos> Mostly at night, but sometimes during the day.<eos> But they don't really feel like dreams.<eos> They... they feel real.
I'm not gonna help usher your enemies out of town.<eos> Hey, they're not just my enemies.<eos> They're your enemies, too.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> They will destroy Central City.
Both our families suck.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Dark.<eos> Well, am I in the mix?<eos> I mean, they should just go to me.
That hurt.<eos> What are you watching?<eos> "American Gladiators."<eos> It mixes showbiz, patriotism, and spandex for a trifecta of viewing pleasure.<eos> They pit grossly muscular warriors with cartoonish names against accountants and dental hygienists in feats of strength.
- Right?<eos> I love 'em.<eos> I was so psyched when I saw these.<eos> Oh, they're perfect.<eos> I can't even believe they exist.
Hey, who are you?<eos> Lilith's meat pies?<eos> You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> Hansel.<eos> They're the best sellers.
What a hell...<eos> Hello?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You cannot unleash your dogs.<eos> They are bothering.
-They check there.<eos> -Who checks?<eos> What?<eos> -The cops.<eos> They check the hospitals.
Seeing as haw you really don't want to know the answer to that question, I take it now's not a good time.<eos> Not this moment.<eos> Well, then let me make this quick.<eos> I was enjoying my morning constitutional, and lo and behold, what do I find lying on the side of the road but a stack of real-estate deeds and a ledger that I believe belong to you.<eos> Now, it seems to me that the reward for the return of such materials should be rather substantial. Or else my next phone call's gonna be to your business associates, see what they got to say.
- Whose was it, then? His?<eos> - It was yours.<eos> Come to reconnoiter my place of business, living some fantasy outlaw life, just you and Boyd against the world.<eos> Sounds like you know a thing or two about it.<eos> I know for a woman to survive in this line of work, she's got to be harder than the men, ready to do the things they won't.
You know the horses have to die to make all those things, Billy.<eos> And that's really sad.<eos> But what a way to go.<eos> And when they live, man, when they live?<eos> They're alive.
Let's go get Shaw back.<eos> The Mayhem on Wall Street continued with a break-in at the security firm that houses the surveillance footage for the stock exchange.<eos> The suspects are heavily armed men and women in ski masks shot a security guard inside the building, then made off with numerous sensitive surveillance hard drives.<eos> Guy comes out of nowhere and shoots me right in the knee.<eos> I go down. They step over me like they're Bonnie and Clyde or something.
I'm entirely taken up with a murder trial at the moment.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I work at the Mission School with Mr Raworth.<eos> You see, the children, they... they talk to us.
If you wanted to survive, you had to stay up front and pretend to sleep.<eos> If you didn't, things could get ugly.<eos> I just glad I got to keep ol' Bess here.<eos> My teachers usually like to keep my projects, but that's not fair to my parents.<eos> They fund my creations... [Screams]
- With my friends.<eos> - Your friends?<eos> - Do you think I didn't see you?<eos> - Stop it, Ayoub.<eos> They think you're pathetic.
Ninety-nine.<eos> You wanted to know how many of us there are?<eos> The last time I counted, I had 99 gifted friends in this borough alone.<eos> And now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull.<eos> And they hate attempted murder.
- I hate that word.<eos> - Just admit it.<eos> Your parents had nothing to do with why you forced me...<eos> Do you want to see?<eos> Do you want to see what they put me through?
Oh, I'm in on this one.<eos> - You in?<eos> - Please.<eos> Can't you see I'm making a move on your girl?<eos> For us non-supermodels, our friends, such as they are, predict our destinies after senior year.
Shouldn't he go in tighter on Hausner?<eos> We need to establish him as a main character.<eos> I'm not directing a soap opera, Milton.<eos> It's evident that he's a main character.<eos> Here with me at this moment stand six million prosecutors, but, alas, they cannot rise to level the finger of accusation in the direction of the glass dock and cry out, "J'accuse,"
They didn't introduce themselves.<eos> They made a point of not introducing themselves.<eos> I heard most of what they talked about.<eos> Mr. Connaughton... mentioned these men.<eos> Said they all had to be "taken care of."
My men found you, days later, in the tunnels beneath Rome.<eos> And I said nothing when I was found?<eos> Frankly, I am surprised to see you in such robust form.<eos> The Labyrinth.<eos> They were behind it all.
But three days down, you're gonna have to push harder.<eos> A nun is encouraging me to kill my own family?<eos> All of us are marked by years.<eos> Mediocre deaths and the ease of it come into our petty lives.<eos> But the children. They are Tabula Rasa.
Everyone is afraid to speak.<eos> We can not say anything.<eos> If it gets treated xenophobic.<eos> Foreign children are a nuisance.<eos> They throw stuff out the window.
This is madness.<eos> These guys want to inherit the Nazi ?<eos> They are nothing!<eos> Building the fourth Reich?<eos> They could not even ride a IKEA furniture.
Now that we're juniors, they're just, like, so obsessed about me doing well this year so I can get into college.<eos> And they don't think that's going to happen if we're seeing each other.<eos> Are you really going to do what they say?<eos> I wish I could stand up to them, but I am not like you.<eos> But they're, like, barely around.
And they don't think that's going to happen if we're seeing each other.<eos> Are you really going to do what they say?<eos> I wish I could stand up to them, but I am not like you.<eos> But they're, like, barely around.<eos> I know, but they also pay for everything.
All right.<eos> Okay, so, all we have left is a full accounting of your family's medical history, starting with your parents.<eos> Oh, well, that's gonna be tough. Uh...<eos> I never knew their names.<eos> They died in Poland right about the time I was born.
The victim's last meal --<eos> Pasta nero, squid ink.<eos> Otherwise, eric shaw died as he lived --<eos> With his secrets hidden.<eos> Maybe they're right.
Did i mention?<eos> We got the guy.<eos> Jo: Wait. You have a suspect?<eos> Lawrence creff?<eos> Yeah, these guys, they, um, They traced the signal -- whatever -- from his laptop.
Why?<eos> Is it evolutionary?<eos> Is it because they want to take over, like, the media, like, the government, like, wants us to think?<eos> No.<eos> They're here to save us...
They lack knowledge of how to live daily in the light of truth.<eos> I am not saying that these men have not received the Holy Spirit, but I ask and question this:<eos> what happens after they receive the Spirit, and how may our traditions instruct them so that they may not stray from the Spirit?<eos> If they have truly received the Spirit, then why would they throw away the truth and the law?<eos> They don't throw it out.

Derrick Washington already had a documented history of violence against women at Missouri.<eos> It was former Michigan kicker Brendan Gibbons involved in the alleged sexual assault of a woman back in 2009.<eos> This is the fifth student athlete to be accused of sexual assault on campus.<eos> I really do believe the vast majority of student athletes are worthy of our admiration.<eos> I think they're mostly, for the most part, a lot of good people out there who are trying to do the right thing.
You can read my mind?<eos> And I know that, uh, you're not an Evo.<eos> You came here to save your friends, which is noble.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> They're happy here.
They organize meetings and hang out with the Germans.<eos> The Germans encourage them to revolt. They offer them alcohol... their pamphlets are written in correct Russian.<eos> And this is the 525th regiment, first siberian corps.<eos> The idea of freedom, together with a good German Brandy, leaves them completely unfit for the army.<eos> They're not interested in defending the homeland, and the Soviet army is falling apart.
- Why not?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We just sort of drifted apart.<eos> Like the continents.<eos> You know, they used to be one big land mass called pangaea.
I mean, I'm always making small talk with Daniel, and I never call Matthew out on constantly staring at my cleavage like it's the briefcase from Pulp Fiction.<eos> It's nothing you did, okay?<eos> These guys are jerks with a z.<eos> I don't want to come in between you and your friends.<eos> No, they're not my friends, because anybody who's my friend is cool enough to recognize just how amazing you are.
These guys really like to party.<eos> And I should know, because I really like to party.<eos> - No.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> Plus, they're crazy good at drinking games.
You said...<eos> [ Imitates Mike ] "Well, we knew that call was coming."<eos> [ Normal voice ] Then you patted me like a golden retriever and you went and watched TV.<eos> You've never been a hugger, Mike.<eos> When the kids were younger, they hugged me all the time, so I didn't really notice, but now it's very clear.
-Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, I met with that expert at Duke today.<eos> And she said that your doctors are doing everything right.<eos> And she also said that there's nothing that they can do to cure you.
Does he know you know?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Everyone's always telling me what a hero my dad is.<eos> But real heroes?<eos> They don't fuck their partners, Walker.
Paddy, you said your things were here.<eos> Yeah, back in the stables.<eos> I'll go with him, Miss.<eos> Poor tyke.<eos> They all sleep out there, but I turn a blind eye.
You were looking for scallop pies... .. Arthur's favourite.<eos> I was talking nonsense.<eos> It was a bad dream, that's all.<eos> And I don't want you discussing my son.<eos> You know... losing mates in the war was bad enough... .. but pretending they never existed... that's plain wrong.
Even though everybody told me it was trash.<eos> God, this is humiliating.<eos> I forgot about this part.<eos> Now I have to tell all my friends<eos> That I was wrong and they were right.
Me?<eos> Heavens, no.<eos> I think you're violating the law, committing treason in a very considered and rational manner, as far as I'm concerned, but what I am curious to know is are you doing this to prove yourself right or Washington wrong?<eos> I'm doing this to protect him, to expose his enemies.<eos> They're the ones committing treason.
Somebody had sex with a 15-year-old girl and left her for dead in an alley in a suitcase.<eos> That's a crime.<eos> Are we anywhere on that?<eos> Yeah, we talked to two waiters.<eos> They said they saw Russo doing body shots off of Madison.
I feel like I've spent every moment of that listening to this crap.<eos> Pete had the perfect summers.<eos> Pete had the perfect grandparents.<eos> All that money from the bond business, but they loved you anyways.<eos> They had the time for you, until Mommy pissed them off 20 years ago.
I'll tell you later, Chris.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, that damage at the cemetery, someone's straightened it all out.<eos> Spoke to the trustees -- they didn't do it.
What they call it?<eos> Iglo, I saw how they built an igloo,<eos> They dug up huge snowfalls,<eos> Four boys built something they imagined was a , A castle or a palace with many rooms and corridors,<eos> But what they did not think of , , Is that spring is now approaching,
I guess she's been sending letters to her parents, trying to make amends, but they keep returning them, unopened.<eos> Do you remember, them?<eos> Your grandparents?<eos> No, I don't... I don't think we ever met them.<eos> Well, I was thinking, since moms aren't taking the baby, that if her parents knew that Ana was pregnant, maybe they would take it?
You killed Trippi, you were gonna run away with his crates, sell them for a fortune, and never look back.<eos> Run away to where?<eos> My whole life is this river.<eos> Rich fugitives don't need rivers.<eos> They sip mimosas and get massages by infinity pools.
Been a while.<eos> Zoe.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I do a lot of business here.<eos> Especially when high-ranking officials get arrested in a hot tub with hookers and blow and they need me to clean up the mess.
He should be down here sucking your dick.<eos> And fuck those savages that want to see blood.<eos> That is not your job, all right?<eos> There were sponsors here tonight, though.<eos> Yeah, and they raised your hand.
I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Those kids those beautiful kids.<eos> That's how you'll thank me.<eos> I was ready to die, and I needed a reason to live.<eos> Those kids they're the reason.
I will get new weapons.<eos> We will keep striking him and striking him until he falls.<eos> Allow her to see Bassam.<eos> No harm can come of it.<eos> She's still the mother of your niece and nephew, and they are still your family.
The tricks of a charlatan!<eos> He is the one to be feared!<eos> He is the liar!<eos> And I tell you this, if you observe what I have told you, you need have no fear of your enemies.<eos> For you shall always be more powerful than they.
I think I've seen you eat bugs.<eos> That was one time, and of course I have parents.<eos> Just, I don't want Danny to contact them because my parents don't know that Danny exists.<eos> (Peter) What do you mean your parents don't know Danny exists?<eos> They know he exists, Peter.
Arson's inside.<eos> They must have got trapped in here.<eos> Tried to get out by breaking the window, which caused a backdraft.<eos> They didn't survive very long after that window broke.<eos> - Did they start the fire?
Wait, nobody knows that I'm here either.<eos> I'm passing through town.<eos> What about you guys?<eos> I'm passing through, too.<eos> They fucking knew.
I'm passing through, too.<eos> They fucking knew.<eos> Does anyone have anybody that knows that you're here?<eos> Somebody that'll come for you?<eos> They fucking knew.
You have no friends.<eos> Well, the friends are like the other guys that are in the conservatory but they are not your friends really.<eos> - They're like your enemies.<eos> - Yeah, I know what you mean.<eos> Because they are fighting for your dream too.
I do understand.<eos> Because I feel the same about...<eos> And I'm remembering things.<eos> Things that happened in the past.<eos> And I'm wondering whether they did think more about our Adam - my brother - than they did about me.
Danny's so self-absorbed that if you, uh, go 20 seconds without talking directly to him, he forgets that you're in the room.<eos> Are you gonna lie to Leslie?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We were just funning around, okay? Yeah.<eos> You know, uh, brothers and sisters... How they just sometimes, like, you know, you got the brother and he's like, "oh," and the sister's, "aah!"
- And you think it goes deeper.<eos> - It always does, you know.<eos> It's like an iceberg.<eos> - You know, i don't want to tell you how to do your job here, But shouldn't you be talking to the guys you caught And find out what they know?<eos> They're keeping their mouths shut, aren't they?
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna let Jessica handle this conversation.<eos> I have to go kill myself.<eos> Jeff, I can't do this right now.<eos> Should I make an appointment?<eos> Because the partners may have bought that fairy tale about Louis's triumphant return, but they don't know what I know.
News anchors are the most common of celebrity stalking cases.<eos> They're in everybody's living room, looking through the camera into the eyes of the people watching them.<eos> It's intimate.<eos> They become fixated.<eos> They really think they have a relationship with these people.
I'll tell you, my boy.<eos> They're gone!<eos> They're not gone, Trayvis.<eos> Stop right there.<eos> As long as we fight, all that they spoke out for lives on.
All leads must be pursued.<eos> Okay. You don't trust these clones, but they haven't done anything.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> They're dangerous.<eos> They could...
Won't you reconsider joining us?<eos> You know, I've outserved my purpose for that kind of fighting, I'm afraid.<eos> After the war, I questioned the point of the whole thing.<eos> All those men died, and for what?<eos> I guess what they thought was right. The clones gave us up.
No, no.<eos> You can't.<eos> I-I don't think that you should be alone right now.<eos> Neither should Branch's parents.<eos> They just lost their only son.
- YOUNG GIRL: Have you gotten sick yet?<eos> No.<eos> (CHATTERING)<eos> BEEZY: Where are your earrings?<eos> They were infected.
All I can figure is, he must have done it before they got here.<eos> That would explain why their symptoms are gone...<eos> Drill was dying.<eos> The only way to save himself was to take a body.<eos> When he got better, they did, too.
Their eyes wander.<eos> And that's how we differentiate them from Drill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Drill is not a child.<eos> He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt and fool the parents, but they didn't know what to look for.
I know you feel Walter is good for him...<eos> Drew, the whole team is good for him.<eos> I'm no genius, but I was a kid, and so were you.<eos> Ralph is special, but that doesn't mean these guys should be treating him like an adult.<eos> Maybe they didn't have normal childhoods, Paige, but I'm worried that they may be taking one from Ralph.
It's fine.<eos> It's fine, really.<eos> It just surprised me is all.<eos> It's a version of transference.<eos> You know, sometimes candidates or their wives, they, uh, they develop feelings of affection for their handlers.
Cheers to that.<eos> They can lick a duck,<eos> Todd.<eos> Hey, Todd...<eos> They can't hurt you anymore.
- I'm sure?<eos> - Yes of course.<eos> I also will go.<eos> Find her bag?<eos> They do?
Where the hell are they all coming from?<eos> Do we have any more men?<eos> Everybody's out on the streets, here and at the other checkpoints.<eos> This is suicide, for all of us!<eos> These guys, they trusted me with their lives.
Do we have any more men?<eos> Everybody's out on the streets, here and at the other checkpoints.<eos> This is suicide, for all of us!<eos> These guys, they trusted me with their lives.<eos> They believe in me.
You do know what the Nazis think?<eos> Of course.<eos> They're finally saying it out loud:<eos> the Jewish bankers crashed the stock market.<eos> They're the ones who saddled Germany with debts and ruined our economy.
We are going to give you back your streets.<eos> All of it.<eos> We fight... or we die.<eos> Don't let these monsters take this from us.<eos> They're gonna remember this day... and you.
We spotted at least eight hostiles diving into the water.<eos> Aside from the one we clipped who's sitting in our medical bay, the others never came up for air.<eos> There were no other boats around Solace, no R.H.I.B.s, no rafts.<eos> Ah, Cruz said he found some wet suits with the hostages.<eos> My guess is they came in on 2-man subs, S.D.V.
I know Anna Mueller will be relieved.<eos> She thought you got fired.<eos> Something about that... Zimmerman issue?<eos> Just a mainframe processing glitch.<eos> The second I pointed it out to the higher-ups, they were on it.
Confidentiality.<eos> I get it.<eos> Hey, Lionel.<eos> Looks like Anna's pal Naresh just got paid off by his superiors.<eos> If they gave Naresh hush money, they could be the same people who are trying to silence Anna for good.
Even if they're driving 90 miles an hour, we've still got 30 minutes.<eos> They're not coming by car.<eos> Your parents have enough pressure on them already.<eos> I didn't want to add any more.<eos> They can do this, Natalie.
- Your Honor...<eos> - Now, to me, there is absolutely no question, no doubt whatsoever that Whitney and Trevor and Martin and Stacey would be so much better off in the full custody of their mother.<eos> Visitation?<eos> Absolutely, of course.<eos> But are we really going to ask these four kids to split their time, to camp out way up in the... in the woods three, four times a week when they have a whole brownstone all to themselves?
I don't want to be legally bound.<eos> I'm going to ask you one more time, directly.<eos> Will you be living by yourself in this new two- or three-bedroom?<eos> Uh, well, I'll be... I'm hoping to be sharing it with my kids at least half of the time.<eos> The plan was for Ms. Bailey to be there with me whenever they're not and for her to leave when they come.
I'm just gonna redo these dressings.<eos> Bohannon!<eos> What's going on in there?<eos> Please don't say about this.<eos> They kill me.
They don't have very long.<eos> Next, they'll slow down, and... and then they'll start to glow, and then...<eos> And then...<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> They will have their remedy, and have it at once.
And my daughter was very, very ill--<eos> Burning up with fever, completely neglected,<eos> In a urine-soaked crib.<eos> Her eyes were so filled with mucus,<eos> They were welded shut.
And of course, you know,<eos> In the scheme of things, it's nothing.<eos> But from a pr perspective, it's everything.<eos> Irs officials told me to my face<eos> They weren't interested in hearing anything
But I have that now with this case.<eos> I can try harder with us.<eos> I don't want you to try.<eos> You live for those cases, Jamie.<eos> They feed you.
I can try harder with us.<eos> I don't want you to try.<eos> You live for those cases, Jamie.<eos> They feed you.<eos> They... they make you who you are.
Aye, whispers!<eos> He is Lucifer. You know it.<eos> - The twins know it too.<eos> - Slander thy brethren no more.<eos> - It is they!
- The twins know it too.<eos> - Slander thy brethren no more.<eos> - It is they!<eos> - From my sight!<eos> T'was they and that goat what bewitched this whole farm.
Rabbi Gamaliel, how can these blasphemers in the desert want to end all this?<eos> Don't concern yourself with them.<eos> Look to your own studies.<eos> Improve your understanding, and then...<eos> Yes, but they just don't see that this...
Then, Saul, don't spend more of your energy trying to correct their mistake.<eos> I see a path for you from scholar to rabbi, from rabbi to, perhaps, a seat on the Sanhedrin.<eos> Who knows?<eos> These men, they do the same work as the Sanhedrin.<eos> They toil to preserve the old while making it new.
Of course.<eos> I believe we share a common interest, a common desire to rid Jerusalem of a pest...<eos> The fishermen and their followers growing in numbers and confidence outside the city walls.<eos> And what is it that fuels your desire to see them gone?<eos> They offend me.
I've weakened these fanatics by isolating them, by turning their supporters against them.<eos> By terrorizing the citizens of Jerusalem.<eos> Well, there was a problem nobody seemed able to solve.<eos> Neither have you.<eos> They know you'll persecute them if they listen to the preachers in Jerusalem, so they're leaving the city to hear what they have to say.
Heads.<eos> Then I condemn you for making such a poor job of your treachery.<eos> These fishermen and their followers...<eos> Are they being dealt with?<eos> They are, firmly and finally.
What are you talking about?<eos> You have two free radicals who are essentials to this plan.<eos> And free radicals tend to do whatever the hell they want.<eos> Kellogg is motivated.<eos> He needs us to take down those soldiers before they take him down.
He lives his life.<eos> I live mine.<eos> That's how it's been ever since he cheated.<eos> So I've just ... I've come to accept it.<eos> You know, when your kids are little, they look up to you.
I would have cooked.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - I want to talk to you about the children.<eos> They're not going to come here for a while.
Why is that?<eos> Why have you got her?<eos> Frederik, I...<eos> I heard what happened in Thailand.<eos> They shouldn't be here alone with you.
You're not well enough to come home yet, okay?<eos> You need to do what the doctors say, Dad.<eos> - The doctors are wrong!<eos> - You don't know anything about this.<eos> You have to do what they say.
I've worked with three top trainers.<eos> They were all blown away with how quickly I picked this up.<eos> Okay. And where are these trainers now?<eos> They quit on me.<eos> Because they didn't have time to waste chasing Dingman around, which is why you're here.
Its serious.<eos> Shes my daughter-in-law.<eos> - Hello.<eos> My sons biggest mistake.<eos> They got married three months ago.
Call your master.<eos> Tell him we've come for Prince Condé.<eos> It seems Antoine's been throwing so much money around for these parties of his that the inquisitors heard he was here.<eos> He's stalling them downstairs.<eos> But if you don't appear soon, they'll force their way up.
Hurry up!<eos> Put it out!<eos> We'd better think about how to re-start the dumbwaiter.<eos> Look, here are the wires!<eos> They would lead us to the power generator.
Is this true, Paul?<eos> It was either her or you.<eos> So you're a snake either way you cut it.<eos> If you thought about it for one second, you'd realize all I am doing for these men is what you do for your sisters... protecting them.<eos> So they can assault women and... and abduct people?
Pretty sure you've got some merchandise that belongs to my boss.<eos> If I want your wife, I'll just take her.<eos> I was sanctioned by Topside.<eos> To conduct a security review of self-aware clones, not screw our product!<eos> Because they will kill you.
Two boys.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What are their names?<eos> Jonah and Tommy.<eos> Do you know if they, uh...
And you wrote, "She was 20 feet tall."<eos> I told you. It's a smart-ass answer.<eos> But what did that even mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just... the first time I met Isabella... I was sitting in a dark theater with a bunch of other men... watching... lusting... knowing that was as close as they'd ever get to her.
Bill's gonna notice?<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, you do have to be more careful in front of the kids.<eos> You can't take my hand under the dining-room table or reach under my skirt.<eos> Oh, they didn't see that.
I'll lay low in Portland until this blows over.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, doesn't it help at all that you got knocked out in the third round?<eos> Are these mobsters that particular?<eos> Yeah, they're that particular.
d d<eos> The pyramids have survived for thousands of years.<eos> Nowhere else are they equaled.<eos> See, you were wrong about the gods, Suhad.<eos> They do answer.
Lagus, arrange for plenty of wine among my gift to the Mitanni.<eos> Pardon, Pharaoh, the gods must be satisfied before you face this challenge.<eos> You speak to the Pharaoh of tribute when we face annihilation?<eos> The gods watch you.<eos> They know your thoughts.
Do you want me to kill him?<eos> It will not be enough to kill only Tutankhamun.<eos> Everyone loyal to him...<eos> Ministers, personal guards, servants...<eos> They must all be eliminated simultaneously.
But no one mentioned that, which is, indeed, quite strange.<eos> ♪ And blood at the roots ♪<eos> ♪ Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze ♪<eos> It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library. Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,<eos> "If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
I hear Chinese implants have everything in them.<eos> Hair dryer, microwave oven.<eos> Even a toaster.<eos> But rumor has it they're not too reliable.<eos> They spark.
Can you please step out of the vehicle?<eos> We'll need to see your log book, and we'll need a blood test, too.<eos> Look, instead of harassing me, why don't you go after those jokers who were on the overpass last night?<eos> - What, you saw someone on the bridge?<eos> - Yeah, two guys, they threw something at my truck.
Your mom's helping Ali's defense?<eos> No, not helping, just consulting.<eos> She'll get more out of them than they will out of her.<eos> Okay, but why is she even doing it at all?<eos> Because she wants to know what they know.
Put a deaf ear to it, you know, because all you think ls, like,<eos> "Win this' and you're in the final of the World Cup."<eos> Which England haven't done since 1966, you know.<eos> I just seen the way the players had passion in them there, you know?<eos> They just stood up.
There was loads of tears in the dressing room.<eos> I've never seen anything like it, you know, and we're all sitting there in tears and waiting for Sir Bobby.<eos> And he went, "Look here, guys, you've done me so proud."<eos> "You know, well go out and we'll have, we'll enjoy ourselves tonight."<eos> Then he was welling up and everyone, when the players, I suppose, when they seen him welling up, you know, everyone joined in with him. I mean, it was...
Because I realised when you played bad, you'd drive past them and they'd smash, and bang, and kick your car and everything.<eos> Yeah' it's like that.<eos> It's intense,<eos> The players put the panics up us.<eos> They're going, "Oh, shit, Paul,
Jessica, we are not losing our identity.<eos> Mom, I don't care if you get mad at me.<eos> [Door closes] I don't wanna be China.<eos> I wanna be Jamaica!<eos> [Sighs deeply] I see they have him, too.
You are making a lot of noise, you and your men.<eos> The Mayor is a little upset. You have been squatting on city property without coming to pay tribute.<eos> Tribute for what?<eos> My men were working on that site until the mayor shut us down.<eos> They lost their livelihood!
I am sending... someone.<eos> Let us go make a deal.<eos> Hello John!<eos> Where are my men?<eos> They are here, and what happens to them... that all depends on you.
Where were his parents?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is That pedro got pulled into a rip current, Um, and by the time that one of his friends got to my tower,<eos> It was already too late. You told his parents all of this?<eos> What, you don't think that they have anything to do with this?
Only we don't gas the boys, we... ~ We eat them.<eos> ~ Can you stop waving that carving knife around when you've had so much to drink?<eos> I don't know what men are for. Do you, Gillian?<eos> It's...<eos> They're...
I just... had the police knocking on the door.<eos> She'd gone, she'd taken the boys.<eos> She'd taken William to the station so I could stay at home and do some work.<eos> Are the boys all right?<eos> Yeah, they... they weren't there, no-one was there.
Okay.<eos> Well, anyway, uh, in this case, uh, the arrow is referring to the Zodiac symbol of ancient Babylonian origin representing the soldier.<eos> And then we found these two names recurring in a few of the spirals on the walls of the hotel room.<eos> Any idea who they are?<eos> Not "they." "He."
We're just waiting for the results.<eos> God, I hate waiting.<eos> In peds, it is... it's much easier.<eos> You know, the parents are right there.<eos> And... and you talk to them, and then their kid is right there, so they can hold them close and hope for the best.
What possibilities?<eos> They're smarter than us.<eos> They heal faster.<eos> Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet.<eos> They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please.

Yes.<eos> Yet today, in sight of God, we clearly see you're quite well.<eos> Because he was never lame.<eos> He'd simply found that appearing to be a sickly child was a more effective lever into a stranger's purse, yes?<eos> Truthfully, under the eyes of God, do you admit these men conspired with you to create the illusion of healing, a pretense which they claimed to be a miracle?
He's dated half the widows in Pittsburgh.<eos> Only my dad would announce a visit 48 hours in advance and then serve us with a list of demands.<eos> Okay, let's just try and make him comfortable.<eos> Oh, he'll get comfortable, and then he'll ask us for something.<eos> Oh, he says he wants to see the kids, and they love him, so...
You know, I, uh...<eos> I rescind all inquiries into the subject.<eos> You know, I'm a grown man who knows a moment when he experiences one.<eos> Oh, and my "distant parents"?<eos> They're fairly certain I put the moon in the sky.
But you manipulated him, didn't you?<eos> You got your poor son thinking he had to murder his own parents, and then you abandoned him.<eos> That's an awful story.<eos> So let's tell another one.<eos> He was a troubled boy, and... and they were beating him.
I believe I know where they're headed.<eos> I don't know whether to kill you or hire you.<eos> They're taking Emma to the police in Fall River.<eos> You sound very certain.<eos> Well, someone killed a friend of theirs, and they want that person to see justice.
But it does raise the question of how would Thanassis even know to look for this?<eos> You think short-term, you get short-term.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> Save me the lecture.<eos> Let's pretend I convince my partners in Shanghai that they should concern themselves with purity of Manhattan tap water.
- I don't need a lecture.<eos> - Yeah, I think you do.<eos> You honor the dead by going on.<eos> Even when you're scared.<eos> You live because they don't get to.
It's not going to be long before the police start putting it together.<eos> Maybe they already have.<eos> And you can bet someone's going to leak it to the press.<eos> Anything connect these scientists?<eos> They all worked together at one time or another.
Let's go.<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> Thanks, but I'll drive.<eos> The generators are Kryptonian-designed.<eos> They not only power the building, but provide a shield that makes it virtually impenetrable.
You were powerful enough without having that knowledge.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You had no right.<eos> Those files are mine!<eos> They're my legacy!
Oh. And they're sequential.<eos> Yeah, they're brand-new.<eos> Federal Reserve traced it to a small bank in Rockville.<eos> Withdrawing 3,000 bucks from a small branch in a little town might be memorable, right?<eos> I'll go talk to the tellers, see if they remember who they gave the bills to.
But you learned to love him, right?<eos> No.<eos> I gave him two sons... an heir and a spare.<eos> It's time for you to leave.<eos> They don't belong here.
Let's go.<eos> So... the demons are like us?<eos> Returned?<eos> In the story, yes.<eos> Are they the first returned?
Returned?<eos> In the story, yes.<eos> Are they the first returned?<eos> The ones your father had to kill?<eos> They were the first ones I knew about.
I believed they returned to punish our family.<eos> To haunt us and make us pay for our sins.<eos> It was our family, the Langstons, that hurt those men.<eos> That broke the town.<eos> They caused the sickness, the strife.
That's all it takes.<eos> And you knew this how?<eos> You did it to those factory workers?<eos> No.<eos> They did it to themselves.
I figured you'd say that.<eos> Don't worry, I won't die before I tell you what you want to know.<eos> Look, Steve, I already reached out to my contacts.<eos> These guys know the handlers that your mother reports to.<eos> They'll find her.
I just sell the drinks.<eos> I came here hoping to find out what had happened and it seems I've found out more than I expected.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The men who robbed the bank had their faces covered but, if you're interested in such things, you could recognise them by their voices.<eos> Especially if they let their accent slip.
You didn't call me yesterday.<eos> Someone tried to kill you and you didn't...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> A few friends called me after they saw you on the news yesterday.<eos> They were... surprised by what you said.
And just so we're clear, the first thank you was sarcastic, because you embarrassed me, but the second thank you was sincere as hell, because these flowers are glorious!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I'm sorry about the construction noise.<eos> It's an issue close to my heart. I do charity work with deaf children.<eos> Of course, they would welcome the noise, because it would mean they could hear.
According to the state, just not the federal government, which means that it's still a cash business.<eos> Wow. They must be raking it in.<eos> They just can't find any banks that will take it.<eos> The banks can still be prosecuted by the feds for taking illegal drug money.<eos> And they risk having their charters pulled.
You can't replace a child, and I looked for you for years, but the foster records, they were incomplete.<eos> They were never, ever able to tell me where you were.<eos> You looked for me?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> They told me the records were destroyed.
What information do you want?<eos> The last words of the soldiers who are involved.<eos> These soldiers don't have anything to leave behind except their last words.<eos> After they die, since they have no friends or relatives, their last words are sent to me, an officer whom they have never met.<eos> If only they can come and tell me their last words in person.
Weren't they staying for a week?<eos> This guy's speaking Portuguese.<eos> They were staying 8 days.<eos> They've been here 15.<eos> - But they paid, right?

Yeah, yeah. Um, I got the easy job, right?<eos> What's the matter? Never blown up a bridge before?<eos> Yeah, well, maybe in advertising, cutting throats is easy.<eos> - Oh, the bastards! - Shhh...<eos> They think I don't understand.
There's no chance Marie Bellaire is on our side.<eos> - Oh, we have our sources.<eos> - You trust them?<eos> - My superiors do.<eos> - They don't live here.
What?<eos> I just lost custody.<eos> Wha... how? What? Why?<eos> The judge decided that I have a demanding and high-risk occupation.<eos> - Oh. - They're better off with their father,
Not until you release the hostages.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No can do.<eos> I mean it, Joe.<eos> They come out, or I don't go in.
Because he's handcuffed to the headboard.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> My boobs are huge! God, Sofia, why didn't I tell Cooper about Josh earlier?<eos> Because guys don't want to hear about past hookups.<eos> - They can't handle it.
Paul Murphy has been cleared by forensics.<eos> He's no longer a suspect.<eos> You make any sense out of all of this?<eos> I can tell you what happened, but I'm not sure that it will ever make any sense.<eos> Both doctors were high on PCP when they decided it would be a good idea to operate on Dr. Everhill.

You're looking for a story.<eos> As Granny says, you're sharp as a tack.<eos> By the way, when Granny came last, we heard shouting.<eos> It was the neighbors.<eos> They were kicking out some people.
"Oh, Magnus, I wouldn't... I would never have thought that he should go all the way to make a place like F? viken.<eos> How come he succeed on the other side of the mountain?<eos> What is he doing so well that we don't do?<eos> What does he know that we don't know?"<eos> The thing is, they read cookbooks.
What?<eos> Okay, how'd we miss that?<eos> We didn't, Ward did.<eos> W-W-W-Wait.<eos> So, you're saying they're the shooters?
Yeah?<eos> Taking pictures, learning languages... Eating spicy, exotic food.<eos> It's never too late to change directions in our life.<eos> You don't have kids.<eos> They change everything.
Come on man, you gonna let these losers decide for us.<eos> Let's cut 'em loose, man<eos> It's too soon.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We don't know enough about who we are, who they are.
Pretty crazy day.<eos> Can't remember one that wasn't.<eos> So, what're we going to do about our two mutineers?<eos> Well, truth is they didn't mean us any harm.<eos> We felt it was worth the risk to save the Android; they didn't.
She's gonna get shot on sight, unless I get to her first.<eos> Her name is Bridgit Pike.<eos> Her brothers took her back.<eos> Joe and Cale Pike.<eos> They, like... kidnapped her.

It's their fault the cop died.<eos> The Pike brothers?<eos> Why'd they burn down Wayne Enterprises' buildings?<eos> - Who paid them?<eos> - Why the hell should I know why the Pikes do anything? They're freakin' nuts.
The cops are outside my place.<eos> - You need to get out of town.<eos> - I'm not scared of them.<eos> Bridgit, I know what you did to your brothers.<eos> Not that they didn't deserve it, but...
Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> The girls at the parlor say they saw at least six monks.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They have to be a part of this same order of St. Dumas.
Uh-huh.<eos> They have to be a part of this same order of St. Dumas.<eos> Bullock's contact says they're penitents.<eos> Yeah, I forgot my dictionary in my purse.<eos> They believed in purification through pain.
Good men who can tell which way the wind's blowing.<eos> Now, we have a very small window.<eos> I have places to be, you have to die, but I know you must have questions, so...<eos> The monks.<eos> They... work for you?
Well, then why is it you can accept all of my flaws and still love me, but you can't do that with the guys that you date?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's j... it's just different with guys.<eos> Oh, is it?<eos> Yes, I mean, they're...

- You tell me.<eos> According to your Dozer-pad, four of your coworkers have been gathered around your desk for the last 90 seconds.<eos> Also, someone named Norm Scully has been in the bathroom for the last 72 minutes.<eos> - Oh, yeah, that means he's about halfway.<eos> But in regards to the coworkers, sir, I was telling them I wanted to get more work done, but all they wanted to do was talk about my dating life, knowing full well that my true love is efficiency.
Oh, but I wouldn't use it.<eos> It's very contaminated.<eos> We had three dogs die in the well.<eos> Three?<eos> If they weren't all tied together, we might have just lost the one.
I myself baptised two slave cubs recently.<eos> - Monastery slaves?<eos> - Right, two chickies.<eos> Crows are descendants of Ham, son of Noah, cursed by his father to be black.<eos> They came here from Egypt.

Yeah.<eos> Neighbors said they heard a woman moaning and howling low.<eos> But then some people said, "Oh, no, that's just the wind or a raccoon singing.<eos> Until one day, some kids looked up and saw her standing in the window, dressed in black, staring out at that street, just a-moanin'.<eos> Now, they tried to tell folks about the hag in the old house on Shady Lane, but nobody believed 'em. Mm-mm.
Poo Belly is right.<eos> I'm tired of depriving myself of joy and sustenance.<eos> I mean, for what?<eos> So a boy will like me?<eos> Guys can be as porky as they want and we still like them.
This can be yours just for playing "Give Up the Cartel."<eos> You'll give me this? Mm-hmm. We got Uncle Sam's checkbook, kid.<eos> Just tell us where the bad guys hang their hat.<eos> I know you're torn.<eos> You look up to those guys-- they got cash, and they grab headlines.
What do you mean?<eos> Why can't you?<eos> It doesn't feel right.<eos> Other Protestant lords have sacrificed more.<eos> They're more deserving.
I've been watching you.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You see, it's that exactly.<eos> You're funny, but your friends don't laugh.<eos> They don't appreciate you.
Nothing will happen.<eos> ... you must protect my legacy.<eos> I don't want to be remembered as a mad syphilitic queen.<eos> Say that I died of consumption while helping orphans.<eos> Yes, say that they were ill, all the little ones, and I entered the orphanage without a thought for myself.

This morning... the Federal Reserve, with support of the Treasury Department, took additional actions to mitigate disruptions to our financial markets.<eos> Today's events are fast moving.<eos> But the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the secretary of the Treasury are on top of them, and will take the appropriate steps to promote stability in our markets.<eos> ADAM CURTIS: And at the very same time as their simple plan was falling apart in Afghanistan, the politicians had to face a crisis at home.<eos> They had given power to the banks because the bankers and the financial technocrats had promised that they could hold the economy stable.
No, asshole.<eos> Flemish.<eos> Flem–<eos> It's not even a language.<eos> Promoters are saying they can sell out the 8,000-seat Vorst National arena for what they're calling The Johnny Rock Resurrection Tour.

My "in case of emergency" contacts.<eos> My parents' lawyers.<eos> You know, I thought it was odd when my parents packed up and left as quickly as they did.<eos> Then again, my parents are odd people.<eos> I just have a hard time believing they would knowingly leave me to face the FBI.

Did you talk to them?<eos> Do you promise you won't say anything?<eos> What?<eos> Some files they had me store in the Sanctuary.<eos> Well, they want me to destroy them before they come home.
Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Because you're here, it's becoming like I'm not even here.<eos> Do we still not know the source of the accident?<eos> Did you check the fire department and the police forensic department?<eos> Yes, we've checked them. But, they say detailed results will not be out until next week.

You did good.<eos> At least you went, so it's fine.<eos> I'm not sure. I don't quite agree with that.<eos> Huh? That's my line.<eos> The family of the deceased is saying that they still don't know who's responsible for fire explosion.

I have to preside over a meeting at the hospital tomorrow afternoon.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - What sort of meeting?<eos> We invite the public in. Our financial supporters, ordinary people, too.<eos> It's important they understand what we're doing.
Uh, uh, uh, don't be afraid. [Chuckles nervously]<eos> I-I-I'm done with that.<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I overreacted.<eos> Kids are gonna sit where they sit.
You're a father, Henry.<eos> You know what the world can do to your children, how Satan can snuff out their light.<eos> You'd do anything to prevent that.<eos> But here's the thing:<eos> they have to choose it.
You must have had that conflict here among your followers.<eos> There must have been members who did not want to come to Bolivia.<eos> Those who came here are those who believe.<eos> Then open the gate, have faith in your followers<eos> - the way they have faith in you.

There's more behind.<eos> I was stuck up there for hours.<eos> There's four storeys below ground.<eos> Cars come up over there.<eos> They come in here and go out there.
I'd wake in a panic.<eos> Then the fear stopped. And instead there was this pain in my arm.<eos> I've seen doctors. They all say, "You're fine."<eos> The causes of such pain are not always understood by doctors.<eos> They believe what they see.
Caught some animal abuse on camera.<eos> My parents didn't even know about it, but BARN publicly crucified them anyway.<eos> Then they sabotaged a meat locker.<eos> Caused $100,000 worth of damage.<eos> They... they threw pig's blood on my brother, Ben, during his college graduation.
And this intel about the girl...<eos> Was it accurate?<eos> Was she taken?<eos> Yes.<eos> These men are gonna come, and they're gonna take you.
Okay.<eos> I...<eos> I, uh, I went out back to dump the trash from the overnight crew and I saw a couple of men in the alley.<eos> They... They were beating on this guy.<eos> But they... they didn't know I was there.

But appointed by your president, Madam Secretary.<eos> You are absolutely correct.<eos> But the true catastrophe began with our friends, the Greeks.<eos> Why don't we concentrate on getting them back on board with the debt deal that we all worked so hard for?<eos> The Greeks have made it clear that without their prized antiquities, they have no interest.
She says all school year long, they're just waiting to learn about dinosaurs.<eos> It's the only thing that captures their attention throughout the whole school year.<eos> Nothing can break their concentration when she's talking about dinosaurs.<eos> So she uses them to teach everything, where she's like "so then the dinosaurs signed the declaration of independence."<eos> They're like "aah! Did they eat somebody?"

You were chosen long ago.<eos> Whoever chose will be disappointed.<eos> I am no magician.<eos> Then buy these two spells from me.<eos> They'll get you started.
My friends.<eos> Your friends inside?<eos> My friends are dead.<eos> Three other.<eos> - They died in the explosion?
That's good music.<eos> Grandma Flanders has passed.<eos> Where are our kids?<eos> Gone.<eos> Looks like once Grandma turned to dust, they took a powder.
Wherever Donovan is, I'm pretty sure that he's running as far away as possible, as fast as he can.<eos> You're lucky they're allowing me to talk to you.<eos> They don't usually do that.<eos> They're not giving me much time either.<eos> See, these guys, they... They believe in numbers.
Don't...<eos> Last night I spoke to Ava and Rehab,<eos> Bam... And I told them that I would like to initiate a ritual called "hear my voice."<eos> Now, this allows the less powerful members of the tribe to express their feelings and or frustrations through music.<eos> They're gonna share, and you're gonna listen, and my God, you're gonna digest.
- Why?<eos> If he can lead us to them, we don't have to go through with this.<eos> He ain't gonna peach, not on that mob.<eos> He sells down the tonners' yard. Borough.<eos> Where it stinks worse than they do.
You'll be singing differently when the noose comes down.<eos> I'll be there watching.<eos> You sell to the surgeons?<eos> To the porters.<eos> Did they know where the bodies came from?
But I heard them upstairs.<eos> I hollered at 'em.<eos> Boys, get down here right now.<eos> I could hear 'em playing upstairs, laughing.<eos> And they know not to be up there.
Help!<eos> Look under.<eos> Under.<eos> I pulled back the carpet. I see these satanic looking crazy symbols, darted out of there. I stumbled a little bit trying to get down the stairs, but I got down there.<eos> I see AJ. Are they okay?
It's vindication for the weirdos.<eos> It wasn't the weirdos.<eos> It appears this message is political in nature.<eos> They don't like taxidermy.<eos> They feel it is offensive to the dead animals, that they should rest in peace.
As did I, as she told me how she'd missed her boy -- it's her only child -- for every hour of every day of every week since she last saw him.<eos> So I'm gonna find who caused a pain that's very much alive today, who took his life, who took hers... and I want to punish them.<eos> 39 years later.<eos> Your associates here, did you do your full due diligence on them?<eos> They have the money, Dad.
Why, because they're Turkish?<eos> No.<eos> - Because they're criminals.<eos> - They're not criminals.<eos> They or their associates are mixed in up illegal activity.
No, I'm just curious.<eos> You're so sweet. You probably don't know them.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Two cappuccinos, please.<eos> They're well-known in Denmark.
Animals are predictable.<eos> They want food.<eos> They want shelter.<eos> They don't have egos.<eos> They don't have insecurities.
They want food.<eos> They want shelter.<eos> They don't have egos.<eos> They don't have insecurities.<eos> They don't kill themselves.
They don't have egos.<eos> They don't have insecurities.<eos> They don't kill themselves.<eos> No.<eos> They don't do that either.
How is it possible?<eos> How is what possible?<eos> Somehow, those lions dragged him up into a tree.<eos> Well, that's hardly inconceivable.<eos> They do it with their young, they drag them by the back of their necks.
Well, that's hardly inconceivable.<eos> They do it with their young, they drag them by the back of their necks.<eos> I mean, sure,<eos> Abe is considerably larger than a lion's cub...<eos> But it's as though they purposely went out of their way not to mortally wound him, not to kill him.
Andraz!<eos> Andraz!<eos> Andraz!<eos> Andraz!<eos> I'm sorry, but the lions aren't here-- they've been destroyed.
Let's get you cleaned up.<eos> Just a little.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Animals will do it.<eos> They'll, uh, you know, tear open a prey species and soak themselves in the blood and tissue to hide a scent.
I'm kidding, Ken.<eos> Nobody wants to see that garbage.<eos> Anyway, gonna be some cool people there.<eos> We know twin architects.<eos> Yeah, they're... brothers.
If you're gonna dump him, it's better to just rip the band-aid clean off, rather than...<eos> What?<eos> Brett loves fruit salad, hates cantaloupe.<eos> I'm telling you boys, it's the little things.<eos> - They make all the difference.
Where are our parents?<eos> Evacuated due to flooding.<eos> They know about Camille?<eos> Yes So they are not party to this.<eos> They are looking for us.
My Parents will not let me down.<eos> Hey can not.<eos> Camille...<eos> Your parents are dead.<eos> They committed suicide.
Do not let him leave the room.<eos> He must never be alone. I'm relying on you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Esteban learned his parents were dead.<eos> They died because of me.
Nobody expected it they return.<eos> And you, someone waiting for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your parents? Yes.<eos> Are they alive or...
If you went back to them today, they'd understand.<eos> They'd be happy to see you.<eos> That's what I thought too.<eos> That's why I went back, even though Lucy told me not to.<eos> I thought that they had understood, that they had accepted.
Forensics on Ken's murder weapon are a wash. The gun was wiped clean of prints, and the only prints on the shell casings were Ken's.<eos> Ken was killed by his own gun?<eos> So either Ken's killer disarmed him, or knew where Ken kept it.<eos> Yeah. These guys knew a lot about Ken... when he'd leave the game, what route he'd take...<eos> Yeah, maybe they were watching him for a while.
So I will become stronger to the point I don't need an existence like Se Gi.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Shouldn't you deal with your past now?<eos> I agree.<eos> From now on, I... I'm thinking of finding out all of the memories I lost and the truth that they're hiding.
Ashley and... what's the little quiet one's name?<eos> - I forget.<eos> - I just call them sleepy and grumpy.<eos> Sleepy and grumpy, that's good.<eos> Yeah, well, our kids, they tend to be more energetic.
You'll understand what needs to be done.<eos> You will pick a side and then you will handle this situation in the manner we both know it needs to be handled.<eos> You will burn it down and never look back.<eos> Your friends don't know you.<eos> They think you're loyal to people.
Prosecutors say you didn't need an appointment.<eos> All you had to do was send a doctor a text message and open your wallet.<eos> Butthesedays, the doctors are starting to look more like drug dealers.<eos> Dr. Verbovsky orchestrated a scheme to trade prescriptions for pills, in exchange for sexual favors and money.<eos> And if they're the dealers, what does that make us, the junkies?
Oh, I love puppets!<eos> - I make puppets sometimes, when I'm...<eos> - Frightened?<eos> When the raiding parties go out, I make up stories about their battles.<eos> Because if you make up the right story, then you think it will keep them safe and they'll all come home.
Look at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what it's been like since that fog went up?<eos> We're all trapped here in this hell hole.<eos> These tough guys with tattoos, they tell you where you can go.<eos> They... they ration food, supplies, electricity.
(Cassie) Previously on Good Witch.<eos> I have big plans for this year and they all start and end on the success of the heritage festival.
The price for letting us rescue them.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> In fairness, sir, we did get a chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealth technology before giving it back.<eos> And at least those poor bastards won't get sent home and shot for mutiny.<eos> But they will never see their families again, not even to let them know that they're alive.
He's very handsome.<eos> Dangerous looking.<eos> Yes.<eos> I prefer my men dangerous, don't you?<eos> Generally, they prefer me.
- ALISON:<eos> Now? - I feel like frozen yogurt.<eos> The guys on your detail are gonna like that.<eos> Who said anything about the guys on my detail?<eos> They follow you everywhere you go.
Who is that?<eos> It's the man that was in the taxi with you.<eos> The cabbie gave a description.<eos> I don't recognize him.<eos> You can still file a report with the sexual assault unit. They'll investigate it.
The company said that if we find something, we need to report it to the police.<eos> And the state gives us 30% of its value.<eos> No.<eos> If we go and we find anything, then we get in the car, drive to Bucharest, and sell the gold to gypsies.<eos> They'll melt it down, and nobody will know it used to be coins.
They're repossessing his house.<eos> We've all got problems.<eos> You've got problems, I've got problems.<eos> A man makes his own problems.<eos> They don't descend from heaven.
Effing brutal...<eos> All those poor old people.<eos> They're just gonna die soon, you know?<eos> And those poor animals.<eos> They're gonna die, too.
I--I can't hear anymore.<eos> Apparently, Mama Salvatore's--<eos> I'm sorry, but I won't be imprisoned again.<eos> I didn't have to turn into this person.<eos> I kept her at bay for so long, but my sons, they ruined everything.
Josette and Alaric have prepared their own vows.<eos> Ahem. This can't be it.<eos> No one's here.<eos> Perhaps your companions gave you the wrong address.<eos> They're not the ones who gave me the address.
Will you relax, Judith?<eos> You need a martini or something?<eos> Look, the song is hot.<eos> It's fire, actually.<eos> And the haters, they gonna burn over.
That would be my play.<eos> I'm from Nevada.<eos> I grew up outside Las Vegas.<eos> My parents were grifters and thieves whose hearts were broken when their only son decided to work security in the casinos.<eos> Eventually he became the best there was, they disowned him - not that it mattered - and he wound up in the bed of a princess.
Well, what happens in 48 hours?<eos> You do whatever you like, or you delay again, but you never, ever say no, because anything could happen.<eos> Redmayne will get just as angry if she delays.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Men like him don't want you to say yes, they want you to say, "I'm listening."
I'm sorry for what I said.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> The roses make your eyes look beautiful.<eos> I mean, they're already beautiful eyes.<eos> I just mean, with the flowers, they're... more beautiful.
And not just the weather.<eos> Clay's girlfriend wouldn't talk, huh?<eos> Nope.<eos> And neither would all my friends at the Chicago PD.<eos> As far they're all concerned, Diane's death was an accident and I'm just a guy who's accusing an innocent widower of killing his wife.
To help unite all survivors and to help restore our great nation to its former glory.<eos> I speak to you aboard the USS Nathan James, a Navy ship carrying some 200 Americans just like you...<eos> Brave men and women who have lost their families, their friends.<eos> Led by Commander Tom Chandler, these brave volunteers left Norfolk, Virginia, six months ago to search for the cure.<eos> They found it.
Did you know about my mom?<eos> That she was the one who locked up all those aliens?<eos> It's why I didn't want you going out there.<eos> Showing yourself, showing this.<eos> The Fort Rozz escapees would give anything to get revenge on your mother and the only way that they can do that now... is to hurt you.
I still would've gotten out of that dump.<eos> That a thing, oboe players being good at giving head?<eos> - Is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Well, they use their lips and their mouths.
In front of a television audience of 30 million, the Mafia takes the stand.<eos> I decline to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.<eos> I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me.<eos> The witnesses are very cool.<eos> They just take the Fifth, which the Constitution provides, and say they're not going to tend to incriminate them.
Now, step away and put your hands over your head.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> (mcintire) i was broke, okay?<eos> A driver i know hooked me up with these guys, mexicans.<eos> I'd drive the trailer down to texas, They put me up in a hotel. They load the trailer the next day
Never took a nickel when she needed it most.<eos> Kept you safe in a place where a lot of people go under.<eos> So i understand what you did to protect her.<eos> You guys coming or going?<eos> They're coming, i'm going.
Mandy's gonna get experience and make some valuable contacts.<eos> It's called "paying your dues."<eos> Like you do every month to the communist party, comrade.<eos> But only rich and middle-class kids get these opportunities because poor kids can't afford to do a fashion internship.<eos> It's too bad because they probably know a thing or two about layering.
They used an object.<eos> The handle of a hockey stick.<eos> And then...<eos> And they high-fived each other and they left me there.<eos> When I tried to pull myself together and leave, the other guys in the frat threw beer cans at me and they yelled at me to go to church.
These clowns seem way too low-level for that sort of thing.<eos> Is there any evidence that they were in touch with our driver,<eos> - before the hijacking?<eos> - No.<eos> But if Arn was recruiting for this stand office, they'd certainly provide muscle.
Not this one.<eos> I've never seen this gun before.<eos> We gave him a P09.<eos> OK.<eos> We got the brothers to confess to being in the tunnel but they said that they give Arn a different gun, a P09.
We got the brothers to confess to being in the tunnel but they said that they give Arn a different gun, a P09.<eos> Same kind of gun that David was packing when we picked him up.<eos> Why lie?<eos> They have no reason to.<eos> Unless they weren't lying.
What did you think?<eos> You rammed me with your car?<eos> No... I came in front myself.<eos> So that my men could kill you.<eos> But they missed.
So there I am.<eos> Ten years old,<eos> Run-DMC's playing at the Garden, and I'm begging my parents.<eos> I'm like, "Please, you gotta let me go."<eos> They're like, "Fine.
Oh. Oh, man.<eos> You could take my title, but you can't hold on to it.<eos> You can't trust anyone.<eos> And now your men won't trust you.<eos> They trust that I will exterminate a rat.
Copy that.<eos> Relaying the data now.<eos> Those were my climbers.<eos> Recent changes in the position of the car are forcing them to change their course.<eos> They can't just go straight up.
You can go to hell.<eos> You want to go together?<eos> [Gas hissing]<eos> They were lied to, tricked by General Scott into making a weapon.<eos> - Who's they?
That's the right answer.<eos> Mouth shut, no neurotoxins.<eos> Try to stay away from the bad girls.<eos> Do you know why Molly did this?<eos> Molly's parents were whistle-blowers, and they were killed.
Kids don't give a shit about tech companies.<eos> Kids don't give a shit about the burger in their Happy Meals either.<eos> They just want the toy. We are not pitching Brooks.<eos> We're pitching Brooksy Bee.<eos> Hey, when you have kids, they dictate every decision you make.
I just hope I can tag along.<eos> No, you can't tag along, Danny.<eos> - You got to go home.<eos> - Come on, Russ.<eos> I just want to learn anything I can about my parents, just hear stories about what they were like.
Well, why don't you get a job as a paralegal somewhere?<eos> Those were all taken by people who knew they would fail.<eos> Oh, why couldn't I have parents who made me think I was a failure?<eos> Trust me, it's not as great as it sounds.<eos> They're still being so obnoxious.
Don't.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He'll just leave it at the door.<eos> Dude, they have a key.<eos> If we don't answer, they're gonna let themselves in.
Welcome to Miracle. Thanks.<eos> Bye, sweetheart.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> I like them.<eos> They're nice.
Thank you.<eos> I knew you'd understand.<eos> Oh, no, I... I don't. [Chuckles]<eos> My point is that you're the only one who has to.<eos> The guys, they're just... they're just gonna miss you, is all.
Myself back?<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> They know your face now.<eos> Maybe you should try something else.<eos> They don't know shit.
They know your face now.<eos> Maybe you should try something else.<eos> They don't know shit.<eos> Chapters are spread all over.<eos> They don't talk to each other.
Your cousin has a base, it's a fortress, I guess, in the Arctic.<eos> Now, we don't know much about it, but we do know it's a place that he's been able to commune with his Kryptonian ancestors.<eos> How?<eos> They're all gone.<eos> They're no longer alive, yes.
So I waited the three days.<eos> I jogged out to the woods,<eos> I dug up the box, and I made my wish before I opened it.<eos> I wished that my kids would be okay if I left.<eos> Because they had no idea I needed to go.
Then came whispers of a chosen child.<eos> - I'm no savior.<eos> - You are.<eos> It's up to you to decipher the tattoos.<eos> They will lay out the path through which mankind can be redeemed and Gabriel and his legions pushed back.
Brother.<eos> He warned us never to leave the safety of Mallory, our home...<eos> And to rid our community of secret and sin with confession and sacrifice.<eos> And I, Laurel, have taken those secrets and sins into my heart.<eos> As I die, so do they.
So how come nobody's talking about it?<eos> Maybe all the religious leaders know something, and they keep it a secret.<eos> Kevin, come on.<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe they know something that we don't.
Your daughter would get married off to farmer brown at 13, which was okay because ...let's be honest... her best years were behind her.<eos> Plus, he probably had enough goats to make the deal.<eos> Well, nowadays, it takes kids longer to become independent.<eos> Now, why is that?<eos> I think it's because they try to pull away, and we hold on tighter.
Look, I'm sorry about all that stuff with our parents.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Uh, it's funny.<eos> They actually thought we were dating.
Listen, you want to say you're innocent.<eos> I understand that.<eos> Research shows that juries more likely will acquit if they've heard the defendant say, "I'm innocent." But I'm not on your jury.<eos> We are innocent.<eos> We loved our parents, and not because of all this, but because they loved us.
What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> Go to Moyers and say, what? "I-- my kid saw a light, so your soldiers, tell them to drop their duties and--"<eos> That is their duty.<eos> It's nine days. What have they done?<eos> They promised medicine, doctors, electricity, information.
Mm-hmm.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> Start working the phones fast.<eos> Get your clients on board before they do, because...<eos> They don't want you back. We want her back, david.
And there are still no demands?<eos> The radicals refuse to make contact.<eos> That's not the worst of it.<eos> These men have gunpowder... at least 30 barrels of it, from what our scouts could see.<eos> No, they can't...
They're going to kill themselves and the boys.<eos> If they have no demands, what are they waiting for?<eos> They're waiting for word to spread.<eos> The longer we fear for those boys, the stronger and more powerful that fear becomes.<eos> Once they feel the terror's taken hold, they'll ignite the gunpowder.
I mean, we should own that.<eos> We should flex our muscle a little.<eos> Why start a fight with, someone or, or something who has who knows what kind of weapons?<eos> Ah-ha, but the aliens don't know what kind of weapons we have.<eos> They don't know about our reverse polarity phasers or our laser mops.
No.<eos> Those symptoms could be an indicator of evasiveness.<eos> I'm not being evasive...<eos> Natasha.<eos> They just.
He lied about seeing boobs through a fence in 6th grade, and<eos> - he's doing it again.<eos> - It was so long ago.<eos> This is no time for messages.<eos> They're here.
It went.<eos> Anyways, who are you thinking about calling?<eos> You know, it's a tossup between no one and nobody.<eos> There's gotta be someone in your family you wanna call. Your parents?<eos> No, they walked out on me when I was 16.
I promise.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Hey, Sara, have you talked to my parents?<eos> No, why?<eos> They just want to talk to you about some wedding plans
Well, your friend was wrong.<eos> Look...<eos> ISA, savings, Tom's fund for university.<eos> That money came from my parents.<eos> When they died.
I can help your friends, but not if I'm linked up like this.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I can't!<eos> I promise you I won't hurt them.<eos> They're in trouble.
Even that is true!<eos> here've you reached?<eos> Haven't even crossed the state yet<eos> Near the border<eos> Ok, listen... My parents... they they'll never approve of you
- I don't know.<eos> I need an idea.<eos> Shall I call Pizzuti?<eos> Was that a no?<eos> That evening, when Jesus finished praying, he went to his disciples and they... they were fast asleep!
Tony, you got his body weight.<eos> Oh, how perfect is it That rice is playing the dead weight right now?<eos> [laughter] Man, those guys are asking for it.<eos> The hell with 'em.<eos> They just don't like being low men on the totem pole.
You saved my life.<eos> You wouldn't have needed our help if your neighbors hadn't blocked the street.<eos> Yeah, what the hell were they thinking?<eos> They just wanted to be rid of that blight on our neighborhood.<eos> They meant well.
And we'll ID the rest of the shooters.<eos> They'll have this wrapped up before the papers come out tomorrow.<eos> You got a choice right now.<eos> Play it smart.<eos> Tell me who they are.
Last week, we came into Chicago,<eos> Hit a mid-level supplier in Englewood using a fake warrant.<eos> Startin' to spill into your backyard, Hank.<eos> These guys are crazy, all right?<eos> The last dealer we hit, they beat him so bad, I thought they'd kill him.
But where is Hulk?<eos> Avalanche.<eos> We've got to call this in to our superiors at Central Command.<eos> Not smart.<eos> If they discover we're out here, they'll shut us down.
That's a direct result of government control.<eos> - Governments don't create money from thin air all alone.<eos> You play a key role in the magic money machine.<eos> - It's not really the central banks that are the problem.<eos> They are part of the problem.
And to protect us, they used their power to pass a law in 1865.<eos> It required every automobile in England to observe a four mile per hour speed limit and to be operated by a crew of three, a driver, an engineer and a flag man.<eos> This heroic flagman walked in front of the car to warn fellow citizens of the coming danger.<eos> The railroad tycoons, the lawmakers, the self-appointed gatekeepers used regulation to stifle innovation.<eos> But they didn't invent the flagman.
Yeah. What about you?<eos> Did your parents come up from Baltimore?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> They, uh, they couldn't make it.<eos> But they, they know how big of a deal this is, right?
I just saw Neil.<eos> He didn't say anything about this.<eos> You know how men are.<eos> They won't tell a woman bad news to her face.<eos> They don't want to deal with our reactions, our...
Daemons, remember?<eos> At some point an "action without user interaction" will come along and sweep my legs.<eos> This spinning wheel of false highs and true lows will continue.<eos> That much I know.<eos> Daemons... they don't stop working.
Thank you.<eos> It's a bit... tense.<eos> I'm cold.<eos> Borrow my builder's gloves.<eos> They'll keep you warm.
He's a human zombie detector.<eos> See?<eos> You're singularly qualified.<eos> Now, we've learned a few things about zombies.<eos> Weird as it sounds, they can't get enough of spicy food.
Yeah.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> What the fuck are you saying?<eos> The kids?<eos> They... They said they were Jews.
He was sent off after seven minutes for a punch.<eos> That's why we lost.<eos> We lose, uh... 4:0.<eos> That's the problem with these foreign players, huh?<eos> I mean, they just don't know what it means.
S-See you around!<eos> Why cut me off?<eos> I was just introducing myself to the young lady.<eos> Asgardian soldiers are everywhere.<eos> If they find out we're the Saints of Athena, it'll only cause trouble.
I'm telling you, man.<eos> My house is not a home.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Not if you can't say [Bleep] it's not.<eos> - [All groaning] - That's what I'm saying.<eos> They keep taking.
If it's awkward, I don't want to make you do anything that you don't want to do.<eos> But it just makes me feel like you're ashamed of me or something.<eos> Look, it's different, okay?<eos> If you're a white person and you're dating somebody, you just call your parents and tell them, "Hey, I'm dating this person,"<eos> and they're like, "Oh, great.
Don't let anybody off the ferry, no matter what that damn Dane says<eos> We have over 30 people at the school.<eos> We don't have room for more And there might be a murderer on board<eos> I have an order to keep everyone on the ferry till Forensics arrive from Reykjavík<eos> Aren't they trapped because of the weather?
I saw that right from the start.<eos> You came into town like I once did, too damn brash and too stupid to even consider failure as an option.<eos> What we had was a dream.<eos> Do you know what happens when you abandon your dreams?<eos> They don't dry up and blow away.
You came into town like I once did, too damn brash and too stupid to even consider failure as an option.<eos> What we had was a dream.<eos> Do you know what happens when you abandon your dreams?<eos> They don't dry up and blow away.<eos> They lodge in your gut and they gnaw at you until there's nothing left.
Father's gone. I had hoped I was wrong, but he really is gone.<eos> I wonder, if your most prized creation becomes your greatest failure, what are you do to?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Humans.<eos> - They drove him away.
She doesn't like to lose.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> None of these so-called art experts can believe that I am auctioning off a half-a-billion dollars of my collection.<eos> They come over to my house.<eos> They literally drool when they see what I have.
I'll tell you what.<eos> Let's just show Brukner a good time.<eos> And when he signs with us, you can do what you do best and take all the credit.<eos> You see, I've been outsmarting people since I was eight.<eos> All my friends, they bought these piece of shit pickup trucks they promptly ran into the ground.
What did you do to him?<eos> Before he left, I caught him going through my wife's purse, and I-I lost it.<eos> I beat him up. [ Clears throat ]<eos> Told him I never wanted to see him again. See, I wasn't gonna let him do to my mom and dad, who are enjoying their retirement, what he'd done to me.<eos> See, they're on that list of people he showed me...
You saw how Swiggy looked at me.<eos> Like I was the frickin' help and his name is Swiggy.<eos> I can't imagine he's your highest-end client.<eos> All I'm saying is that if these guys are going to respect me, they need to meet me standing next to you.<eos> They meet me in some cash house all sweaty in cover-alls, they're going to look at me like I'm a pack animal.
- and dropped it in on the trail.<eos> - (growling)<eos> Then we just ran for the car.<eos> Got in and the dead ones were there.<eos> They were beating on the hood, and then-- and then boom!
The Byth Encil wouldn't just steal a mere piece of your bounty, my lord.<eos> These attacks are an assertion of condition.<eos> It's righteous peasants setting their own rule of tribute.<eos> Then crush them, Milus.<eos> They ignite the rabble.
Like, it's the League Cup but it's still a trophy?<eos> There was footage of my children outside our house posted on that website.<eos> And that's not something anybody wants to happen, but...<eos> But if it's any comfort, it doesn't seem like your children were targeted.<eos> It looks like a coincidence that they wandered into the film while the person or persons unknown were making it.
Just like the glasses, just like the coffee I always see you make but never drink.<eos> The only thing real about you is the way you look at Nimah Amin when you think no one's looking.<eos> Even if all of that is true, why do you care?<eos> The most dangerous enemy America faces... is the enemy within... traitors who play the long game.<eos> And they inflict the deepest wounds because people miss the warning signs.
The relationship between a serial killer and their victim is the most important relationship in an investigation.<eos> These are the victim's crime-scene files from infamous serial-killer cases.<eos> Each one of the killers has gotten an extra victim.<eos> They almost fit the profile, but not quite.<eos> You're going to work in teams to determine, using only the profiles and the M.O.s, no outside resources, who they didn't kill.
That's why we're here.<eos> "The FBI raided the safe house of four Sistemics members in Frankfort, Kentucky, this morning...<eos> Hours before their planned suicide bomb attack on the state supreme court during the opening remarks in the Sistemics' trial.<eos> The raid was led by a Special Agent Clayton Haas."<eos> Look, I told you... they brainwashed me. All right?
I never thought before I'd save our country, I'd have to save myself.<eos> All right, listen up!<eos> Our suspects are trapped in this six-block grid.<eos> No one gets out until we find them.<eos> Tonight, we are the hunters, and they are they prey.
I'm still waiting on some of the contact information from Graham Connor.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, I asked you to get the information, not Graham Connor.<eos> Don't let the account execs do your work for you.<eos> And don't let them stall you either.<eos> They're here to make sales.
Well, I can guarantee you it wasn't them.<eos> Well, we need to examine the coins to determine the exact origin.<eos> Now you have to cease any effort to sell the contents of the find... until we can determine true ownership.<eos> Our lawyers have gone over it a dozen times.<eos> They say that the government's case is all circumstantial.
I mean, except me and my parents.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Does your mother have a problem with beautiful people?<eos> No, it's just, you've been doing such a good job involving her with the wedding, but now that your parents are here, she's gonna feel threatened, okay?<eos> They went to college, they're worldly, they flaunt their wealth.
We can't allow ourselves to get distracted.<eos> If we stop at every street corner to tidy up the mess these criminals make, we'll never catch up with the ones at the top.<eos> And those guys, they don't stop to think about the collateral.<eos> You mean "victims".<eos> Yeah, they are tough to ignore in my experience.
They know the best doctors, the best therapists.<eos> They've done this before.<eos> Not just literally, but emotionally, they're prepared.<eos> We are having this child.<eos> They are not.
Look, I'm not in this for just a few months.<eos> This is forever.<eos> Foster kids have no control over where they live, who they live with.<eos> So, this app, "Fost and Found,"<eos> will give them the access and information they need, so they can have some power, so they can make decisions for themselves.
I've been trying to live with the pain, but I finally realized I can't.<eos> So, I got a refill.<eos> Why didn't you tell your mom that?<eos> Because my parents only see me as an addict.<eos> If they had the slightest idea that I was worried about relapsing, they'd be all over me.
I left because I couldn't... stand up in front of all those people and...<eos> Promise to take care of my baby.<eos> I know it's horrible, I do, but I just...<eos> I feel no connection to her.<eos> Look at all these parents, and they seem so happy.
Hey.<eos> That was very sweet... what you said to Jude.<eos> You know, I know you haven't exactly had the best day yourself.<eos> And seeing you be so kind and thoughtful it made me realize that I think I have more compassion for my adopted kids than I do for you.<eos> I just... I think in my mind you haven't suffered as much as they have.
I know.<eos> It's not about you today, though.<eos> It's about Jay and Ryan.<eos> Okay, support the team.<eos> When you're up, they're gonna do the same for you.
I didn't think I was a bad person.<eos> She made you play prison guard number three?<eos> Yeah, I felt like an idiot at first, telling people what to do, but... ..then we started having a bit of fun with it.<eos> Getting the prisoners to do stupid things and by the sixth day it felt normal.<eos> Like I was actually this guard and they had to do exactly as I said.
Why do you tell me all this now?<eos> An innocent man will soon be brutally executed.<eos> I need to save him.<eos> Please honor the requests of my friends.<eos> They, too, are innocent.
I was terrified, but she told me I would be fine, I should do it, and that my parents would be proud.<eos> And after that I was hooked.<eos> Well, parents can be real motivators.<eos> My parents didn't show up to the performance.<eos> They were, uh, too busy.
Now, once they return home, the plans are in place to, synthesize the cure on a mass scale.<eos> But one problem remains...<eos> the distribution problem...<eos> How do we get the cure to the animals?<eos> Now, the very important scientists, they think that they have the solution.
That seems to be the best way to spread the cure.<eos> We inoculate the prey and let the food web do the rest.<eos> So, only problem that I can think of<eos> Would be that the animals... they seem to have stopped feeding on each other.<eos> They seem to just be feeding on us.
Did what?<eos> Whatever we came here to talk about.<eos> You got me.<eos> You may recall incarcerated members of drug cartels often confess to crimes committed by their compatriots.<eos> They receive a level of protection on the inside;
Look, I'm not gonna get into it right now, and none of it matters.<eos> Boxing is how we used to connect.<eos> It's how we'd work things out and I guess I was just a lot smaller back then.<eos> All right, what do you need?<eos> I went to the hospital this morning to apologize to him, and in the room, there's all these bankers and lawyers and board members and they're there with their get well cars and their flowers and they're just waiting for him to croak
Agent Shea, I am running this investigation.<eos> - You are an advisor.<eos> - Well, then, let me advise you.<eos> Over the years, I've worked very hard to maintain a special relationship with Kevin's parents.<eos> I may not trust them, but they trust me.
No need for excuses, Falcon.<eos> Tell us what to do.<eos> Avengers, assemble!<eos> Try to...<eos> They'll never get back in time.
So you're saying it wasn't your fault?<eos> That tranny started it, all up in our face with, you know, being weird.<eos> That boy goes around dressed like a girl?<eos> You should be talking to his parents, not my son.<eos> Well, they're in the hospital, and you're here, so think about that.
Keon has learned his lesson.<eos> - The other boys got probation?<eos> - That will be my recommendation.<eos> It's their first offense, and they were both very clear that Darius was the one who started this.<eos> They were going at him, too.
Saddle embolism to the lungs, direct result of the broken femur from the fall.<eos> No intervening cause.<eos> What does that mean for these boys?<eos> Well, Markus and Keon didn't push her.<eos> They didn't cause the death.
That's evidenced by his remorse and the apology letter he drew.<eos> Now, what happened on that bridge was tragic, but sending a 15-year-old boy to prison for an instant's loss of control will not bring Avery back.<eos> We have heard that Mr. McCrae is a good kid, that his actions were not motivated by hatred, but one purpose of punishment is deterrence, to send a message that there are some actions not acceptable to society.<eos> Avery's parents have asked this court for mercy.<eos> They believe the message that Avery would want to send is one of compassion.
The cargo's here.<eos> All Inhuman systems are stable and online.<eos> - The team is ready to revive them.<eos> - Patience, Mr. Giyera.<eos> They're not our toys to play with.
Is there no other judge you can be bothering right now?<eos> Probably, yes, but I-I am down to a minute, and I would like to explain to you why Slider's story is...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You've gotten way ahead of yourself. This request needs to be cleared with the investigators, DDA Hobbs, and the defendant's attorney before it comes to me.<eos> Uh, okay, a-and if they... if they say yes, you'd approve?
Then before we start, care to tell me why Major Crimes is handling a simple assault case?<eos> We're covering a lot of divisions for the holiday.<eos> With me.<eos> Six men will be in the lineup.<eos> They won't know who's looking at them, so there's no need to be nervous.
Controls the government, the secret police.<eos> - But you have the military.<eos> - I have mercenaries.<eos> They have no interest in a coup.<eos> They want to fight, get paid and go home.
We can live forever together.<eos> I'm so sorry, my dearest, but I've already seen the cost of immortality.<eos> Life is made of little moments, precious as diamonds.<eos> But imagine there were an endless sea of diamonds.<eos> They'd all be worthless.
I'm sorry, Harvey.<eos> For what?<eos> I act like I don't know Esther's beautiful, but I do.<eos> It started when we were in junior high and all the cool kids would hang out with me just so they could get close to her.<eos> Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't, but either way, when it was over... they all acted like they didn't know me at all.
He chose to sink while you and I chose to swim.<eos> You know they say that drowning is actually a pretty good way to go, which I would hope for.<eos> Even though he's a coward for leaving me in the lurch.<eos> You see my friends?<eos> They were swimming west.
I'm better off on my own.<eos> I need to find my friends.<eos> We're on the East side of the Mississippi.<eos> As I recall, your friends were heading West.<eos> If they were alive, and that's a big if, they ain't heading East.
I promise.<eos> PANDORA:<eos> So many words and empty promises these adults of yours make.<eos> Huh?<eos> I don't even know how they keep it all straight, seeing as they don't believe you.
When I know after three years, I'd turn into an evil spirit?<eos> My point exactly.<eos> You shouldn't think lightly of evil spirits.<eos> The recent happenings in society... Such as depravities, crimes, abductions, and dismemberments... All are the work of evil spirits.<eos> They are the ones going around possessing humans.
My guy says he thinks there are unpatrolled border crossing points here.<eos> Did your guy tell you they'll probably have motion sensors, too?<eos> This is where we're going, where we'll run into the least government interference.<eos> It's an Indian reservation.<eos> When your ancestors are slaughtered, they give you land and leave you alone.
You see anyone?<eos> No, but I hear 'em.<eos> Hunters?<eos> Shit!<eos> They're looking for us.
I thought you quit.<eos> Hey James.<eos> I uhm, just spoke to the datatechs that State Police sent over.<eos> Yeah, those fuckers.<eos> Ah, they're all right.
Which is next to impossible unless someone destroyed the records.<eos> Yeah but, who's gonna do that?<eos> It's like everything from before.<eos> Who I was, who my parents were.<eos> They're just gone.
Yeah, well, handguns are dangerous.<eos> Please do that outside, ma'am.<eos> So, obviously, the process needs a little refining.<eos> But I was on the path of making my family safe.<eos> Meantime, the kids still didn't trust me, so they were on their own path. Unh!
It's up to me to record his life story.<eos> When pops dies, what happens to all his stuff?<eos> They'll probably just throw it all away.<eos> You know our parents are animals.<eos> They can't do that.
Everything's fine.<eos> I'll have the damn operation.<eos> But not because of you.<eos> I'll let one of them quacks cut me open.<eos> Oh, they actually don't cut you open.
I don't know!<eos> Let's go, guys.<eos> [Thudding, clattering] Wait. Where are you going?<eos> We're done.<eos> They won.
Hold you fire!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.<eos> Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace.<eos> We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption.
My brothers and sisters messed that all up.<eos> I asked my dad about college, he was like, "Shit.<eos> You better find something to do.<eos> Talk to your brothers and sisters.<eos> They had your college fund.
- Things changed a little.<eos> - You cut the Nixon scene?<eos> The Nixon scene is the core of the whole movie.<eos> Where we see Secretariat be morally corrupted and get to look into the real darkness of his soul.<eos> It's still all that, except now it happens while you give a Christmas present to your nieces and they hug you while your butt is stuck in a chimney.
What happened in here?<eos> This had to be your parents.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> They went to the campsite.<eos> They've been looking for us!
But we must act quickly.<eos> Before your enemies gain more strength.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> The world recognizes the real danger in Syria, the so-called Islamic State.<eos> As they get stronger, Bashir no longer looks so evil.
Over 200 remains were fed to the pigs.<eos> This killing spree became known as the Second Literati Purge.<eos> However, two men never stopped laughing during the purge:<eos> Minister IM Soong-jae, and his father IM Sa-hong.<eos> They were the most treacherous men alive.
You think we are?<eos> Allison, you represent the greatest penetration of American intelligence in fucking history.<eos> SVR or KGB.<eos> My bosses actually believe you will be director one day.<eos> Well, they're not the ones you're asking to march into work tomorrow as if the world isn't about to end,
I cloaked you from Beau to protect you.<eos> Alaric's babies are the future of the coven.<eos> They would have protected them in any way they could.<eos> Wait, wait. How is this all possible?<eos> They were cloaked.
You see, you're right.<eos> I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own, so I made some friends who could help.<eos> Who are these friends?<eos> Sorry, I can't tell you.<eos> See, they'd like to introduce themselves.
But, no beatings or basements.<eos> Actually, just pull over right here, and I'll hop out for a few minutes.<eos> ♪ I feel you now ♪ (Ben) Wait here.<eos> You know, it's not the foster parents you have to worry about, it's the foster kids.<eos> They're the ones you gotta watch out for.

So that would tell us if they were closer?<eos> It's a cell phone tower simulator.<eos> It sucks up every signal in a ten-block radius.<eos> When DARPA funds classified research, the grant recipients have to use DARPA computers.<eos> So the laptops that were stolen, they all have a small, battery-powered 4G router, and it would ping if this unit was close enough.
For most of the cultures studied by archaeology, we are bereft of probably the vast majority of what they produced.<eos> This is particularly true the further back in time you go, simply because anything organic will-will not survive.<eos> The reason why most of the ancient monuments were built by using stone is because stone lasts forever.<eos> That's it.<eos> And the reason why we have these monuments today is because they were calling cards.

There is no historical record, uh, of these caverns having been excavated.<eos> So there's no document explaining what they were used for, who excavated them.<eos> And this remains a very, very, uh, frustrating detail for historians.<eos> We know that in China there are written records that go back at least 3,000 years.<eos> They make absolutely no mention of these caves.
Take it easy.<eos> All I'm saying is, you want to bring another guy in, tell me.<eos> But right now, we got bigger problems...<eos> Two U.S. marshals just got here.<eos> What do they want?
I feel unwell.<eos> Here.<eos> Water.<eos> Where we find ourselves is fate.<eos> The work of the three spinners, they sit deep in this earth beneath us and they've brought us here.

No, I'll go to Mildrith.<eos> If you don't do it, some other bugger will.<eos> And there will be reward.<eos> Men have seen it.<eos> They know what I have done.
The men are well.<eos> - Afraid?<eos> - No, no more than usual.<eos> I...<eos> I worry that I do not inspire them, that they do not see me as a warrior.

Where did the people of Rhodes get the knowledge of how to create these moving statues 2,500 years ago?<eos> I believe that it is just what Pindar said, which is, they got it from the gods.<eos> Well, who are these gods?<eos> The gods are real people, they're extraterrestrials who had this technology, shared it with humanity.<eos> And now when we see the Antikythera mechanism, there's something you can put your hands on that shows that they had the capability to do advanced machine work.
A-a rib-eye?<eos> Maxine, you don't eat like this.<eos> Your parents do.<eos> Oh, so, now you want to live like my parents?<eos> Jerrod, I've been trying to figure out why I haven't really connected with your parents, and I think it's because I'm not the traditional homemaker, take-care-of-my-man type of woman that they expect.
Is Elizabeth also sending her condolences?<eos> No, she's sending 6,000 peacekeepers into Scotland.<eos> "Peacekeepers"?<eos> Is that what she's calling her soldiers now?<eos> It has a pleasant, nonaggressive ring to it, but they will crush your supporters and your French forces nonetheless.
We ask our employees, "What can we do better?"<eos> Why?<eos> You're in charge. You're management.<eos> Just tell them what to do.<eos> They observe what we are doing and they make proposals, what we can do better.
- Why? Just to keep them happy, or...?<eos> No, no, they have good ideas.<eos> - They have good ideas?<eos> - They have good ideas.<eos> - They know...
Fear of what?<eos> Fear of oppression, fear of the government.<eos> Armed only with the fruit from Bouazizi's broken cart, the people of his town stormed the governor's mansion and the revolution had begun.<eos> When the revolution happened, I was pregnant, and I was so proud that my babies are born free.<eos> They are born free citizens.
I keep an eye on each one of them.<eos> And you know... some of these horses are 4th generation breeds.<eos> - Wow... do the horses take part in races?<eos> - Of course they do.<eos> They have won many derbies for us.
"They have all lost their mind watching me."<eos> "Lovers are crazy about our gorgeous attitude."<eos> "They have all lost their mind watching me."<eos> "After drinking from my eyes..."<eos> "After drinking from my eyes they are all really tight."
Yes.<eos> You're being promoted.<eos> Looking at your talent, our top bosses..<eos> ..want you to quit entertainment and join mainstream news.<eos> They think you're meant for more serious stuff.
- Now! I got him.<eos> Give me that. What's the matter with you?<eos> We're gonna need an ambulance.<eos> Damien Boyd... going above and beyond for your friends, huh?<eos> They'd do the same thing for me if something happened to my kids.
All right, thank you very much.<eos> Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> [bleep].<eos> [speaking spanish] [all laughing]<eos> So they're saying... Hey, thanks, man.
And now that trust was about to pay off.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We met these guys inside. They're cops.<eos> They have some information on el chingon.<eos> They're gonna tell it to us,
Isn't there some way you can make him tell the truth?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Maybe Aunt Erin can help you find that out.<eos> I'll pass that off to the framers of the Constitution.<eos> Well, they're not here.
Screw your letters, Duke!<eos> You changed.<eos> All that crystal, always tweaked out and angry.<eos> Your sketchy friends.<eos> They ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Oh, come on, your usual types are mixed between gladiator and Viking.<eos> I do not have a type.<eos> I catch bad guys for a living, all right?<eos> The last two dudes you dated scared me.<eos> Then you scare easily, 'cause they were a loan officer and a soccer coach.
Cupcakes are on the way out.<eos> The mavens never embraced pie, so that's not happening.<eos> Did you read The Tipping Point?<eos> You know about mavens?<eos> I'm telling you, Cesar, if you build it, they will come.
You spend one night on the floor and suddenly you're a doctor, Brian?<eos> Dad, listen to me for a second, okay?<eos> Now, the inherited version of hemochromatosis is... is one of the most misdiagnosed diseases that there is.<eos> Doctors mistake it for... dozens of other things.<eos> And if they can't find it, how could you?
I claimed to be a volunteer EMT, but was exposed as a spy sent by the United States government to undermine the Islamic State.<eos> President Dalton... your air strikes bring pain upon your people and death to your troops.<eos> Now I must pay for your policies, which only plunge America into endless fire.<eos> Just as you execute our warriors, we will exterminate all so-called American aid workers within our borders.<eos> They are heathens and puppets of American intelligence and will be killed like dogs.
I'm gonna need you to watch this video.<eos> Okay.<eos> President Dalton, your air strikes bring pain upon your people and death to your troops.<eos> Just as you execute our warriors, we will exterminate all so-called American aid workers within our borders.<eos> They are heathens and puppets of American intelligence and will be killed like dogs.
I have seen those skulls close up.<eos> And the moment I was able to do this, it changes everything because if you compare a skull where you can prove that the skull was artificially elongated, and you compare that to one of the Paracas skulls, then you can see a marked difference between the two.<eos> I think, personally, that they are themselves the extraterrestrials.<eos> Is Paracas skull number 44 evidence of another intelligent... perhaps even extraterrestrial... species living among humans in the distant past?<eos> Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that the facial reconstruction does resemble an ancient ruler that they believe was from the stars... the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten.
Can the case be proved in court?<eos> We only have circumstantial evidence... so it will be difficult.<eos> To be honest...<eos> No one except the parents could have committed the murders...<eos> But that they ARE the murderers, this we can neither say... nor prove...
Eliezer Melamed and Shmuel Dvir were investigated.<eos> Two people claimed that Rabbi Dvir told them that he spoke to Rabbis Dov Lior and Nachum Rabinowitz and gathered from what they said that they passed a Din Rodef against Yitzhak Rabin.<eos> This is merely hearsay countered by absolute denial. The aforementioned rabbis deny that they passed a Din Rodef against Yitzhak Rabin.<eos> Rabbi Dvir denies saying these things to the aforementioned two people.<eos> The rabbis deny all acquaintance with Rabbi Dvir and insist that they have always warned against acts of violence."
I was hoping to find you.<eos> Is everything okay with the endowment?<eos> Nearly.<eos> The money's all in place, but my lawyers are still nervous.<eos> They want to be sure that the board has support of the surgical team, or they won't release the funds.
There's no time for that.<eos> Stand down.<eos> You have no authority here.<eos> These doctors are your superiors.<eos> You need to do what they say.
Here we are.<eos> Ouch ...<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> The world's best guard dogs.<eos> They are not dangerous. Come now.
Marvin, hear me out.<eos> You don't have all the facts.<eos> No?<eos> But I have eyes.<eos> And I can see that you're in here, and they are out there.
I probably shouldn't get on a trampoline.<eos> You should go hang out with your friends.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Might be faster if they come get you, though.
So mean.<eos> Very sorry about the situation with the food.<eos> I called the grocer, and no one knows where Barry is.<eos> I mean, these grocery boys, you can't trust them nowadays.<eos> They just think they can do whatever they want.
I wouldn't.<eos> If I had, I would have already thrown myself down a StairMaster.<eos> You mess with the bull, you get the fart rumor.<eos> Oh, my God, those 60-year-old women started a fart rumor about me.<eos> At least they didn't get us fired.
Now, my deputies and local PD are conducting a fingertip search in the surrounding field.<eos> Our colleague said they will be here any minute now. They'll be happy to join in.<eos> Oh, we can use the bodies.<eos> If the fugitives are on foot, that places them within a 10-mile radius.<eos> Roadblocks are set up in case they've acquired a getaway vehicle.
(squawking)<eos> MILLER:<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's two bodies.<eos> They've been covered in battery acid.
You know I can find that, right?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> It's Eric.<eos> But I never really had a fair shot in life, you know?<eos> Uh, my parents... they died in a plane crash when I was a kid.
Much like Krypton, this planet is on the verge of ecological destruction.<eos> I can stop it.<eos> But the humans won't like my methods.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> They trust you.
I'm trying to protect your train.<eos> I don't put much faith in the government's idea of protection.<eos> I read your file.<eos> Your parents were doctors who developed vaccines against bio-weapons.<eos> They worked for the government.
Why have a camera filter if you can't take a photo?<eos> Red Crone, if you're listening, see you soon.<eos> It just doesn't make sense.<eos> I... this doesn't sound like my boys.<eos> They wouldn't just run away like this.

Then wrote code on top of it.<eos> Look at what happens when I activate the paths to the dead code.<eos> Did you contact the developers of Panda Pavilion?<eos> Yup, but get this.<eos> They only sold 34 downloads because there was a competing app that was way more popular.
Fully.<eos> He started his own bridal shop business in New West.<eos> So, what'd they do, like, an intervention?<eos> Nope.<eos> They just straight-up kidnapped him.
You were in love with her.<eos> I think I'd like you to leave.<eos> Just like her parents, you held your brother responsible for her death.<eos> And you all wanted revenge.<eos> The difference was, they sent him angry letters. You sent him a bomb.
Some suspect a drug overdose, although we're still awaiting official confirmation on the cause of death.<eos> Nonetheless, a very sad and tragic time for one of Miami's most prominent families.<eos> The guests will be here any minute.<eos> Good.<eos> Won't be much of a surprise if she shows up before they do.

A trade for what?<eos> She came to me asking for access to my lab.<eos> She wanted to run some blood tests after hours and off the record.<eos> I asked for the embryos in return.<eos> They would have just been thrown away.
To get out from under the sanctions we slapped on them?<eos> And to back out of Ostrov's stupid war of choice in Eastern Ukraine.<eos> So, can we give them a way to declare victory and go home?<eos> But why?<eos> Ultimately, they win on the battlefield.
Maybe, but there are an awful lot of trucks filled with coffins driving back to Russia in the dead of night.<eos> Also, with the sanctions still in place, your economy has about as much chance of coming back to life as Pavel Ostrov.<eos> May his memory be eternal.<eos> And why do you want me to broker this deal with the generals?<eos> Because they know that you are both an honest broker and a patriot.
We're proposing a simple swap.<eos> These three spies for Ms. Rahim.<eos> My dear Madam Secretary, there's nothing simple in this.<eos> The men you just spoke of are soldiers.<eos> They knew the risks when they accepted their mission.

Firdevs was married to a man named Erdal.<eos> As my wife told me Erdal's ex-fiancee and others, they abducted Firdevs from home, dragged out of village and killed her.<eos> Is your wife alive?<eos> Do you hear the dogs howling?<eos> One night, they attacked my wife and dismembered limb by limb.
How long is the delay?<eos> Well I can't say actually.<eos> Could be a gradual shift as different effects start to manifest.<eos> They won't become your slaves right away.<eos> They just
Marcus would've caught it days ago.<eos> Only if it was a federal case or in the City of New York.<eos> Which is why I began to look at other jurisdictions where Tim Wagner resided in the past.<eos> Hey, what do monkeys have to do with anything?<eos> They might be the key to exercising my father from New York.
You keyed your phone, the building went boom.<eos> I was calling in to ATF, man.<eos> Then who detonated the bomb?<eos> My guess, it's the sellers trying to cover their tracks.<eos> They were already trying to rip off the buyers.
If you're right, that's terrifying.<eos> Who are you looking at, foreign intelligence?<eos> REBECCA:<eos> Ananda sat on an appropriations committee for the Army.<eos> They have a vote in a couple of weeks.
- What a disaster.<eos> - Well, I would not characterize this as talking wild.<eos> This is responsible fiscal accountability.<eos> Look, the fact of the matter is is that unions have far too much control in this country.<eos> They are strangling...
They're -- they're...<eos> Actually, they were once believed to be in the bloodline of werewolves, but in fact, they are more similar to demons.<eos> Deputy.<eos> What's going on, Agent?<eos> They, uh, they got their nickname from how quiet their attacks are.
Burns?<eos> From the pool?<eos> Chlorine gas is intensely toxic to airway mucosa in high concentrations.<eos> Airway burns trap air inside the lungs.<eos> They're effectively suffocating, with air trapped inside them, unable to exchange with fresh oxygen.
The killer is here.<eos> - Angela's the killer?<eos> - Gigi and Chuy were carrying Angela as dead weight for years.<eos> Just when they were about to take things to another level... They decided to buy Angela out, cut her loose.<eos> But Angela figured out they were planning on ditching her, so she tried to get rid of them first.
Now who's The Djinn? Agents Navabi and Ressler. Where are we at?<eos> We set the perimeter.<eos> Our fourth side is water, and we're waiting for harbor units.<eos> No sign of the targets.<eos> They're in there.
Trying to relive his glory days in the CIA except for none of it was real.<eos> I understand how difficult it must be for you to hear this.<eos> The things I've done...<eos> I'm not a criminal, all right?<eos> Those scumbags who got off, they're the criminals.
Oh, he lied.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right, listen up, Ahe, 'cause we're about to do you a solid.<eos> Right now your boys think you made bail.<eos> Yeah, as far as they know, you're back on the street, not in here telling us everything you know about those trucks that were hit.
Hey, that's Korean food rearrangement.<eos> It's a sign of respect.<eos> Ken, let's be honest...<eos> They don't like me.<eos> They love you.
You?<eos> No.<eos> It was the first time I'd ever cooked Thanksgiving by myself.<eos> My kids were little.<eos> They were hanging all over me.
When did this begin?<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Respiratory infection, for someone with MS, is very... concerning.<eos> Did the doctors give you an antibiotic cocktail?<eos> They just put me on one.
So Schultz wasn't extorting anyone.<eos> But he knew somebody was.<eos> So, maybe the blackmailers found out that he was talking to I.A. and decided to stop him.<eos> And they killed Dunn because she was close to Schultz.<eos> They couldn't risk her knowing or finding out.
They're vetting me.<eos> A D.I.A. job?<eos> For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.<eos> When they went in, they were kids.<eos> I'm not so sure they'll do well out there in the world.
I stole it back.<eos> You don't think they'll kill you, too?<eos> You're as dead as I am.<eos> Except, after I stole it, I converted it to red diamonds, which are trading very high right now in Hong Kong.<eos> I was sure to drop them off to these businessmen so they could get back what was theirs.
- It happens to everyone!<eos> Sex and romance die after you have a baby.<eos> - That's not true!<eos> Look at my parents.<eos> They had plenty of sex after they had children.
Jethro, I feel compelled to ask you about Mitch.<eos> Been talking to DiNozzo.<eos> Uh, I didn't have to.<eos> That's the trouble with old friends.<eos> Sometimes they know your history more than you would like.
Jordie.<eos> Where to start?<eos> Meth-dealing dad, slut mom.<eos> No, I saved Jordie.<eos> And I'm gonna take better care of him than they ever did.
He's not innocent, he...<eos> Neither is Hank Voight!<eos> Mom, I am asking you, please.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I've already contacted Beckett's attorneys, and they deposed me this morning.
He was older.<eos> Handsome.<eos> He sent me a bus ticket, and I came to be with him.<eos> I know guys like Trevor.<eos> They prey on you, and they know just how to make you feel special, right?
- Friends?<eos> - They don't need to be so close.<eos> Ones who are temporarily involved with them give them status.<eos> Shouldn't the doctors make the decision on the patients' hospitalization?<eos> They don't want to be bothered, that's why they call me.
Where are you, Kim Sung Yeol?<eos> The sun will rise soon!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> There are wanted posters everywhere looking for you.<eos> To catch the man in the dark robe, they are just arresting anybody.
We're gonna get out of here.<eos> Think of your family.<eos> Tessa.<eos> And the boys.<eos> They love you.
I'm bothered about her.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I'm saying, secrets don't do you any good.<eos> No, they don't do YOU any good because you want to be in control of me.
When they started restoration work on his tomb, they brought him here.<eos> It's not often our archaeologists get the chance to examine a saint.<eos> They removed his bones from the cathedral.<eos> How could we have been so stupid?<eos> This is what they want.
More than strangled. Garroted.<eos> Our coroner's on the way.<eos> Okay, so, Anthony gets away from us. Likely runs back to his buddies with the 1-1-3s.<eos> But we've made Anthony.<eos> They decide it's easier to shut him up.
What kind of man screws another man's girlfriend?<eos> Luke, that...<eos> I-I just don't get it.<eos> These guys, they're all the same.<eos> They get what they want from you and then they're gone.
You set up Brad.<eos> You drove away every man that has ever cared about me.<eos> To protect you.<eos> Oh, my God...<eos> Those guys... they... they didn't care about you.
I'll tell you whose fault this is.<eos> The Glossners.<eos> They've been terrorizing this neighborhood for so long, they've scared away all the good trick-or-treaters.<eos> Rita lets those kids run wild.<eos> They egg people's houses, smash pumpkins.
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All's I got is boys.<eos> You don't know what it's like being the only woman in a house full of boys.<eos> They... they don't listen.
♪ You in the club, man, all drinks on me ♪<eos> ♪ 'cause I feel good ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah, I feel good, 'cause I feel good ♪<eos> ♪ Good lord, look, what a beautiful day ♪<eos> ♪ My enemies ain't here, they gone away ♪
His grandma didn't go to the mountains recently.<eos> How could she be caught?<eos> The trees in the mountains have been chopped down.<eos> The spectres now have no place to live.<eos> So they come down here to catch people.
"It was fucked up to see you dance."<eos> End of controversy.<eos> However, in New Zealand, where they don't get my show, they've never seen me, and frankly, they don't get out much... the New Zealand media takes the video... and they show it to the guy's family.<eos> And they say, "What do you guys think about this?"<eos> And they say, "Crikey," or whatever the fuck they say over there.
This is new.<eos> SATO:<eos> As we speak, the frozen planet of Rinn is facing an energy crisis.<eos> When their supply of fuel cells is gone, the settlements will not be able to power the heaters they need to survive.<eos> They'll freeze down there.
- Thank you.<eos> And a Pinot Noir.<eos> I'll be right back with your check.<eos> Uh, hey, cutie pie.<eos> These classes, they're not gonna clear themselves.
Ringing the alarm bell.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> The plumbers let me in.<eos> The plumbers are not supposed to be in here.<eos> They should.
I mean, people are saying,<eos> "Heh, management is stingy, and they're greedy, and they're not letting people hear the beautiful music."<eos> Then we're gonna be the villains, and the musicians are the heroes.<eos> Yeah, but how do we make them villains?<eos> I mean, they're artists.
Our coaches have enlisted some of the biggest names in music...<eos> I recorded this song in my key,<eos> So i think we're gonna have to write<eos> A different melody or...<eos> They'll challenge their teams...
I can't just get around a FERPA violation.<eos> Obtaining university records is dicey territory.<eos> Those devices contain the oarsmen's class schedules, university e-mails-- they're protected.<eos> The university is throwing up a wall to protect their image.<eos> If we uncover that one of their golden oarsmen is a rapist and a murderer, it will tarnish their brand, and they know it.
We're under attack.<eos> Tell the driver to meet us by the parking ramp on the east side of the building.<eos> Now go!<eos> Hear those fire trucks.<eos> They'll think it's a gas line break.
What if the gods wrote this?<eos> What if the gods were all like, "Julien-baby, J-man, love your stuff.<eos> You done so many wonderful things."<eos> And, I was like, "Who me?"<eos> And they're like, "Yeah, of course, you.
A way to be identified by the seller.<eos> That'd be my guess.<eos> Yeah, because it's not like these two professional killers are gonna send an email with a photo and a description of what they look like.<eos> The tickets tell them where to be, and the pin identifies who they are.<eos> But if they don't know what the buyers look like we can go undercover.
Yeah.<eos> And, see, cops don't shoot the suspects they have in custody...<eos> it's against the law.<eos> So, now that my men have their guns out, why don't you put yours down and we can call it a night?<eos> Or you could kill me, and then they'll kill you.
- Okay, they brush their teeth?<eos> - Are you gonna let them?<eos> - Because, um...<eos> - What about homework?<eos> I kind of think you need them as much as they need you.
Nigerian syndicate is no joke.<eos> It's far easier for them to smuggle goods than girls.<eos> I'm going to call my contacts at organized crime and see what they have coming out of Nigeria.<eos> On the scumbag spectrum, these scumbags are my least favorite.<eos> They recruit the poorest and most desperate women and get them to do things that they themselves don't have the guts to do.
I will fix this.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Walt, things are not improving down here.<eos> And we could use the fire department.<eos> They're on their way.
We... we... we gave out the pot candy.<eos> She's right.<eos> It was us. Mainly her.<eos> So your husbands had absolutely nothing to do with this?<eos> No, no, no. They were just trying to enjoy the game.
Explain.<eos> I was in the hole before I met you, I was about to lose the bar.<eos> - Yep, you told me that.<eos> - What you don't know is that I borrowed money from some guys to help dig myself out.<eos> They seemed okay, I thought I was on my way to paying them off because the money we were making from the parties.
We don't?<eos> I mean, what's stopping him?<eos> They only care about the big fish, right?<eos> They're not gonna waste their time on an underage kid.<eos> Kids die, they want everyone.
Although you have experienced terrible things about your children, How could you expect me sacrifiice her?<eos> We want our children back.<eos> They're part of us, blood of ours.<eos> You will give up what you have.<eos> They will give us children back.
Open the door<eos> Open the door<eos> Brother, you have talent<eos> Those two psychics were conmen at best They didn't deserve to die<eos> If they can't help me, they die!
Single, did community outreach.<eos> And not just the military. So, just after Katrina, he was part of the fight against the Green Dot initiative.<eos> Government condemned certain neighborhoods. Wanted to tear down homes, turn them into green space.<eos> Only, home owners and volunteers like Ford said, "No way."<eos> They banded together and fixed them up themselves.
You carry this kind of money around with you often?<eos> All the time. Got diamonds on the soles of my shoes, too.<eos> Just a question.<eos> We think that these three men stole a hundred grand from a Navy Exchange, and serial numbers match.<eos> So... maybe you helped them get out of town or... they paid you and--
- I think he knew. - What are you saying?<eos> I'm going back in there.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Stew, I gave our cellmates a story that they will tell for the rest of their lives about an actor who defends the law on television, but thinks he's above it in real life.
Look at that, huh?<eos> A thousand bonus.<eos> Bam.<eos> It's nice to have your boys together, huh?<eos> Yeah, and they all have the same maturity level.
I never heard about that.<eos> That's generally what they mean by "covered for."<eos> Kristin, you missed a bunch of deadlines.<eos> You didn't return calls. You pissed off the inspectors.<eos> They pissed me off.
You work really hard.<eos> No, I don't. I'm a genius.<eos> I throw things together at the last second.<eos> Great designers get inspired.<eos> They don't perspire.
So nice running into you.<eos> Best to your mom.<eos> My opinion... those guys are a distraction.<eos> Let's just stay together, stay focused, let the FBI do their thing, we do ours.<eos> They're shirts, we're skins.
But these youngsters are proof that she has overcome the challenge of their habitat.<eos> Few cheetah mothers get this far with four cubs.<eos> If the cubs are to survive without her, they must watch their mother carefully and learn the strategies for hunting on the open plains.<eos> There's a lot to take in.<eos> They'll need to learn that their top speed can only be sustained for a few seconds.
I mean, I'm not going on a cruise.<eos> I'm not going glamping with my girlfriends.<eos> I just have Homecoming.<eos> So, if I don't want my parents with me this one time, it doesn't mean I don't love them.<eos> - They'll understand that, right?
Some hunters ambush by moonlight.<eos> The tarsier.<eos> No bigger than a human hand. With the largest eyes of any mammal relative to body size. And huge, bat-like ears to pick out a tell-tale scratch amongst the hubbub.<eos> The darkness can't hide an insect from a tarsier. But it can hide a tarsier from an insect.<eos> Because tarsiers compete for food, they keep their distance while hunting. Each sweeping its own patch of jungle.

Spare herself the embarrassment of taking the hit.<eos> So we're betting on smart?<eos> The fact that she's even running the show is theater.<eos> She's gonna listen to the counsel of her generals and advisors.<eos> They understand the cost of a military response.
I don't know.<eos> You taking Joanie with you?<eos> I thought maybe we could split our time.<eos> What about my other kids?<eos> I mean, they're gonna split their time?
Those bastards have no right!<eos> Unfortunately, Sid, they do.<eos> And they know how to get their message out.<eos> They're slapping the face of everyone who ever wore the uniform.<eos> They don't see it that way.
Among the personal effects we found were cash.<eos> Over $200.<eos> So what led you to Petty Officer Friedgen?<eos> Uh, Vanatter's cell phone records.<eos> They showed multiple texts and a call between her and Friedgen, but we never did find the phone.
Is that it?<eos> Some men are leaders, some are followers.<eos> Explain that.<eos> It takes more than a trust fund and a college degree to run a business.<eos> Men may follow leaders like that, but they do not respect them.
Lantern fish.<eos> They are the most numerous fish on the planet.<eos> But these small fish spend most of their time down in the deep ocean, way beyond the reach of dolphins.<eos> It's only when they come up to the surface to feed that they become prey. Once they've found a shoal the dolphins use their sonar in a different way.<eos> They stun the fish with loud blasts, then simply gather them up.
Your conscience may not make you the ideal spy, but it certainly makes you a better person.<eos> Let's not breathe too easy yet. Uh,<eos> I'll let you know when we have the green light.<eos> I hear our Ukrainian friends needed a little hand holding.<eos> Let's just say we took a stroll through all the possible outcomes for their country if they didn't agree to our terms.
Or... you may simply not survive it.<eos> Like my friend Anton Gorev.<eos> Even if what you say is true,<eos> I cannot go back to my generals and tell them I took this deal without anything in return.<eos> They know I am willing to have war.
a Class C hero took it out with a single punch!<eos> What's that say about the heroes it beat?<eos> They may call themselves Class A or Class S but their titles don't mean a thing.<eos> enough of that.<eos> They risked their lives for us.
I really ain't got much on my record.<eos> Two burglaries with my friends.<eos> We just rode around, get something to do.<eos> And we decided to rob a tavern and that... was the first time that I got busted with them friends.<eos> Another mistake I did... I had a bunch of friends over, and we were fooling around with the cat... and, I don't know, they were kind of negging it on and... I tossed him over the fire...
I said, "I got no problem with that. Come on in."<eos> So they checked the house all over.<eos> You know, everything was fine and then they left.<eos> And I mean, knowing her, I mean, what are your feelings for her parents and...<eos> They must be going through hell.
So it's a little bit frustrating.<eos> With the pack still missing, the wild dog team chartered a spotter plane.<eos> And before long they relocated the pack... just in time for the aerial filming.<eos> Okay, we've got the dogs.<eos> Okay, they're on the left hand side of the vehicle.
They just did that so they wouldn't have to pay for stock photography.<eos> Great move on their part, a pretty girl who... who loves Bach.<eos> These guys know what they're doing.<eos> That PR department sexes up the, uh... entire operation.<eos> I'm not sure that's how they would put it.
But... I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought not drinking was supposed to keep me out of trouble.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Well, I know you don't like my friends.<eos> Well, I have reason not to.<eos> They're my friends.
You break the necks of trained soldiers, cut their throats, gut them like wild pigs, and you call it peace?<eos> You destroy a temple and call it destiny?<eos> Kings of the past would not have shown you grace.<eos> Me, when I make war on a city, I allow the craftsmen to live.<eos> I conscript them into service... and they live.
You know, me and Dan, we had nothing growing up.<eos> You had foster parents.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> It's not blood, is it?<eos> They did their best, Linda and Matthew Nutter.
And he thought I was full of shit.<eos> I got a better chance now.<eos> I got lawyers.<eos> The best ones in Wisconsin, both of them.<eos> And they know what they're doing.
One of the most high-profile murder trials in Wisconsin history is set to begin.<eos> Teresa Halbach's family is seeking justice.<eos> It took all week to seat a jury.<eos> [female reporter] These jurors range in age from 20 to 80.<eos> They include a carpenter, an international recording artist, a homemaker, a mechanic, some working, some retired.
- all pulling together? - Uh, there's a lot of factors, sir, and these guys, you know, they work really hard.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> You're not their friend anymore, you're their boss!<eos> They need to fear you.<eos> They need to know that you can fuck their wife better than they can.
Xiang.<eos> Mr. Yan.<eos> I met those three guys.<eos> And I know that Kon Tai helped him get the boat to leave here.<eos> If they have the gold, they wouldn't have stayed.
Why?<eos> Hello?<eos> ! She nearly ruined our entire social status, and I had to fix it.<eos> I had to explain to the Penetrator guys that we don't usually create a lot of drama.<eos> It's really important what they think of us.
[gentle music] [gentle music] [Art] So historically in the past when I was doing tribes,<eos> I would just photograph the end result, you know, just the pageantry.<eos> But today, I'm telling more of a story.<eos> I want to get the men, what they look like before they're adorning, how they adorn themselves.<eos> It's really funny because they have these little shards of mirrors that they've collected over the years and those are very valuable.
And you told her because of that, well, it was still a wrong thing to do.<eos> If that was something positive, it's fine.<eos> But if it's something negative for Yuriko, it could mess her up.<eos> I wonder if you thought of how it could affect her and how it would negatively affect Uchi.<eos> Like, they're going to be unsure of each other now.
I was celebrating and things got a little out of hand.<eos> So, let this be a lesson to all of you.<eos> Never mix champagne, a balcony and five-inch stilettos.<eos> Excessive drinking is no joke and I just wanna apologize to all my young fans.<eos> I hear you, and they're listening to you.
You tell your kids that?<eos> What?<eos> That it's okay to break the rules sometimes?<eos> Well, I remind them of their goodness.<eos> How to... protect themselves if they're around someone that they don't think is good.
I hope you got a minute Hope you want me in it<eos> For the long haul<eos> All night long<eos> We'll be fine I'm sure Just use the other door<eos> I wanna have a house like they did
Power, speed, and skill evenly split.<eos> You, thor, hawkeye, and the widow on one.<eos> I'll take falcon and hulk.<eos> Those missiles are shielded.<eos> They have the latest evasion software.
You, thor, hawkeye, and the widow on one.<eos> I'll take falcon and hulk.<eos> Those missiles are shielded.<eos> They have the latest evasion software.<eos> They were some of my best stuff.
-You will be returning to London soon?<eos> -Tomorrow night, Your Majesty.<eos> Yes, yes, tomorrow, that's right.<eos> You know, Max, what really matters is what our English cousins will say.<eos> They don't understand that, but we do.
What's going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> What--What--<eos> Three guys, they just...
- Apparently, she had cancer.<eos> - Sunshine found her.<eos> - Our little sister?<eos> I have three siblings.<eos> Do they know I exist?
Animals, usually.<eos> Offerings, if you can believe it.<eos> Sacrifices.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They still do it?
For what?<eos> There's no one here.<eos> This town's fucking dead.<eos> What about our parents?<eos> They dead too?
You wanted out, and you thought those kids were your opportunity.<eos> But there are no opportunities left.<eos> Not for you.<eos> Are you stoned?<eos> They're not gonna leave here without the girl.
So... no.<eos> Blood doesn't bother me.<eos> I saw a 13-year-old get burned alive outside a madrasa.<eos> Couple of PFCs got drunk, got a can of gasoline, took a Bic lighter to her burqa.<eos> They called it "Hot Potato."
She's just a fat old cow.<eos> They are old people, Savvy... and old people will be old people.<eos> You can't change that.<eos> - Right.<eos> They get away with a lot of shit, old people.
They listen to you, Thelonious.<eos> Well, you don't.<eos> I do when you agree with me.<eos> Now, Abby, the CO2 scrubbers are already failing.<eos> The symptoms of oxygen deprivation are everywhere, and worst of all in the children; They'll die first.
I'm Clarke.<eos> It's ok to be scared.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> It's... my parents.<eos> They were floated and they... and they seeded my dreams and I just...
So I watched.<eos> And I waited.<eos> People like to blame me, but I'm just a witness.<eos> The things that I see would make angels weep.<eos> And they have wept.
But if he was to forgive anybody, it'd probably be you.<eos> I love blueberries.<eos> They taste so delicious.<eos> They're full of anthocyanins.<eos> They taste like blue spectacularness.
Why would they pay somebody for a job and then try to get the money back an hour later?<eos> They're bad people.<eos> - That's what bad people do. - Mm.<eos> Shows how much you know about mobsters.<eos> - Oh. - Look, they're businessmen.
The complaint was upheld - the officer was disciplined.<eos> In 2007, DS Denton alleged a colleague was making fraudulent expenses' claims.<eos> The complaint was upheld - the officer was disciplined.<eos> DI Denton has demonstrated the utmost probity throughout her service career.<eos> It takes courage to make a moral stand against your fellow officers, except sometimes they don't see it that way.
I - a veterinarian.<eos> Levana, it - healing.<eos> You have come to soak up the sun with these men?<eos> Do you think that only you - the beauty?<eos> Oh, they are strong.
- but he never met mine.<eos> - PFLAG?<eos> Yeah, it's like parents of lesbi...<eos> I don't know, it's like if you love gays.<eos> But I don't know. I feel like I don't want to know my parents' sex life, so why do they need to know about mine?
Even if they are meeting a boyfriend, they're just imagining that dick up your ass.<eos> Your parents are obsessed with sex, I think.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I think anyone's is.<eos> You're like "I'm gay," and they're like "Oh, so you're butt-fucking now?"
I think anyone's is.<eos> You're like "I'm gay," and they're like "Oh, so you're butt-fucking now?"<eos> I like that San Francisco is a place where gay sailors used to come after they got discharged from the Navy.<eos> You know?<eos> It's like imagine if they knew that one day they'd be able to get married right here on the beach.
They will.<eos> Mark, face it.<eos> They're on strike.<eos> They're busy.<eos> They don't want to take our money because we're poofs.
That's enough.<eos> Physically sick.<eos> - Gays?<eos> - From London.<eos> They were the ones, Carl.
You don't want to go there.<eos> That island is drenched in blood.<eos> Built as a fortress and used by the nazies during World War Two.<eos> When those bastards got their hands on that place, they turned it into a concentration camp.<eos> Behind those walls they tortured and murdered men, women and children.
Come...<eos> Bloody dog... this place is infested with mosquitos...<eos> Stop 'sir sir'ing me what if she'd caught dengue?<eos> Ssir dengue mosquitoes don't bite at night<eos> They'll seek your permission before they bite have you done research on dengue?
This is the calculation...<eos> The house was for 30 Million.<eos> I took 2.5 from Karishma,<eos> And the rest 27.5 was paid by me Pappa?<eos> And it is THIS house, your daughter will live in and when you have grandkids, they will live in THIS same House...
I have these sensations as if fountains of cool water are breaking out underneath and simultaneously, fireworks are going off above and this time it's raised to the power N and then they go to infinity -<eos> Sir... if she smiles, she's snared<eos> But why are we going to Germany?<eos> Don't you have to be in China?<eos> Actually my vendors were trying to procure from Germany, but the cheque was returned, so they need me to issue... a cheque, so they need to solve the problem... - Just a sec!
Please... stop...talking.<eos> All right, now, mark this one as 19.5 grams.<eos> Shouldn't...the bomb squad be handling this?<eos> No, no.<eos> They'd just do a controlled detonation.
Based on your success so far?<eos> Let him talk.<eos> Speak.<eos> Passenger buses offer some unique advantages.<eos> They have their own border inspection area separate from commercial vehicles, no dogs, and they're not subject to the vacis vehicle x-rays.
She's undercover at a tattoo parlor.<eos> Little ink spot in east L.A.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, where guys come in to get teardrop tattoos.<eos> No sh...<eos> Yeah, they open up and confess all sorts of crap.
Little ink spot in east L.A.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, where guys come in to get teardrop tattoos.<eos> No sh...<eos> Yeah, they open up and confess all sorts of crap.<eos> They literally have me tattooing their murders on their face.
You're both wolves.<eos> Now, I know this sounds crazy, but that's a plus.<eos> I mean, the purebreds can make it.<eos> I've met them.<eos> Well, what are they like? (Laughing and clearing throat) They're, uh, charismatic, attractive and total d-bags!
Dad thinks you're dead!<eos> I know, Robbie.<eos> Please, just don't say anything to dad.<eos> What's the real reason you come back to Boston?<eos> To kill vampires before they kill people.
Ladies!<eos> Hello!<eos> This is where they gorge themselves.<eos> I once saw a funeral van here loaded with bodies covered in bite marks.<eos> - They don't all come here.
I'm pregnant!<eos> Look, Bart, I really, I can't believe there's a connection here.<eos> But, uh, we have some friends who are in the same dark place that we were.<eos> Can we give them your name?<eos> Only if they have five dollars.
Roland, I understand.<eos> And know that I love your ugly mug.<eos> These men truly respect you.<eos> Not out of obligation, but as one who is their equal.<eos> In truth, I look up to them more than they do to me.
What are you writing?<eos> A report to your signory celebrating my loss?<eos> No, these thoughts are private.<eos> - Share them with me.<eos> - They are not complete.
Um... Supernaturalists?<eos> I know to the FBI it's not exactly orthodox.<eos> But these men had answers that no one else had, and I --<eos> I owe it to Casey... to listen.<eos> Now, they -- they brought up cold spots in relation to...?
But, hey, what writer doesn't love a good twist?<eos> My job is to set up interesting characters and see where they lead me.<eos> The by-product of having well-drawn characters is...<eos> They may surprise you.<eos> But I know something they don't know -- the ending.
I'll clean up your mess in an hour.<eos> You give our brothers and sisters far too little credit.<eos> They will soon learn that you have been playing them.<eos> And then?<eos> They will do nothing because they are frightened little sheep following my crook wherever it leads.
We'll be fine.<eos> No, we -- we're losing, Metatron.<eos> Castiel's followers outnumber us.<eos> And while they haven't gone on offense, they have proven capable.<eos> They stopped you from killing him, and me, for example.
I have powerful friends there.<eos> Another example that proves my point.<eos> Are you saying that no one else wants what I have?<eos> Of course other countries will want it.<eos> They just won't want the United States to know they have it.
- Okay, yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Bye, Erin.<eos> - Bye! Jules...<eos> They took Antonio's son.
You must be crafty.<eos> Start with 1.20 and not more than 1.40.<eos> - I get it.<eos> A maximum of 1.40.<eos> - Good. We sell it to the dealers for 30 and they sell it on for 50 Then we'll have control of it all.
Guess you haven't read his blog.<eos> The security cameras at the bank.<eos> Apparently it all shorted out.<eos> We got a bunch of witnesses here.<eos> They all have cell phones.
That's what I'm talking about!<eos> - Who are these guys?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> - They asked me to be a lookout after the Red Hawk meeting tonight.
Isn't that right?<eos> This side of Edendale, yours would be...<eos> Vartan?<eos> You know what my parents like about him?<eos> They see eye-to-eye on insubordination.
No!<eos> What?<eos> It was coronary angina.<eos> Some minor problem with her heart.<eos> I tried to tell the doctors she doesn't have one, but they wouldn't listen.
Please.<eos> Done.<eos> No, no, please.<eos> My arms.<eos> They really hurt.
I'm not going without you.<eos> Only one of us needs to get to the ground, Raven.<eos> The second you find those kids, you radio back.<eos> 300 innocent people will die if you don't.<eos> Abby, they'll float you.
So then they have no one.<eos> Do you really need to interview these kids now?<eos> I mean, they're devastated.<eos> Kids forget things fast.<eos> They already said they didn't see anything.
Kids, you can thank Detective Sullivan.<eos> She asked me to get these pastries for you.<eos> And there's plenty for everyone.<eos> Don't be shy, Janie.<eos> They don't look like much on the outside, but trust me, on the inside...
Dale, it was a goddamn clusterfuck.<eos> What the bloody hell were five guys doing there in the middle of the night?<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - No Cole, of course not.<eos> They knew.
Who knew what?<eos> Have you heard about your brother?<eos> I'm sorry Cole, man.<eos> I didn't know what to tell you, man.<eos> - They knew.
Soon the disturbance will be gone.<eos> The troubles will be over.<eos> - Will my friends return home?<eos> - All the troubles will be gone.<eos> They've got nothing to do with this!
I do understand.<eos> You've shown great fortitude, which can only serve to strengthen James's resolve.<eos> How can it, when I'm not permitted to see him?<eos> The doctors know best.<eos> They treat me as if I were a liability.
Colin provided some materials for it.<eos> The press are saying that it was I.R.A., but it wasn't.<eos> And the funny thing about the I.R.A.<eos> is that they don't like people taking their name in vain, so if you do happen to meet someone called Colin Blakefield, tell him that some Irish blokes are looking for him and he should come and talk to me,<eos> 'cause I'll give him a cup of tea and a cigarette and they'll drill holes in his kneecaps.
You too, Vincenzo.<eos> - Come, join me, Emperor Borgia.<eos> - Do not condescend, Pandolfuccio.<eos> Conqueror, then?<eos> Titles matter not, I suppose, when they precede the dreaded name of Borgia.
Then read. Can you see what is in my heart?<eos> Or is there only a pit where others have a soul?<eos> Do I love or merely pretend to?<eos> Why do my enemies wait to attack?<eos> They know where I am.
The cabal is stymied.<eos> Each man has his own agenda.<eos> Each calculating how to swallow up the spoils.<eos> None trusting the others or willing to commit to any hasty course of action.<eos> Worse, they fear, in failure, your vindictiveness.

A pope dies and the city burns.<eos> At least Cesare's men have stopped the rioting.<eos> They've squashed it, like savages.
We will not let them use you.<eos> That is a promise.<eos> Did you know the proof of life photo of Amber you gave me<eos> - was part of the kidnappers' plan? - No.<eos> They told me I would see Amber and they left that photo instead.
The ambassador's son was let go.<eos> His parents must have done what was asked of them.<eos> Did they have to put that on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But they're both still alive and their son is free.
I think at this point, we're in a pretty interesting crossroads in the history of games.<eos> Publishers, especially in companies, are fairly risk averse right now because everybody foresees a big change happening and nobody knows what it is.<eos> I often compare indie developers and big huge studios to a couple of guys in a Zodiac raft and an entirely fully-loaded battleship.<eos> Each one has its own strengths, and I think where the indie guys literally and figuratively run circles around the big publishers is that they're a lot more mobile.<eos> They don't have to make as many complicated, boardroom-based decisions.
You almost wonder, like, how long can this last?<eos> Is this for real?<eos> Another coveted job at the LEGO company is that of master builder.<eos> Like the designers, master builders are, well, masters at building with LEGO bricks.<eos> But they get to think outside the box.
One of them, um, was LEGO.<eos> And a lot of the kids, especially, socially anxious, inhibited, quiet, mildly autistic kind of kids, gravitated to the LEGO area.<eos> And it seemed like an anxiety-free zone.<eos> The "a-ha" moment came one day when I came out to the waiting room and two kids that I had been seeing, very similar personalities... they were both bringing LEGOs from home to show me.<eos> And they had met in the waiting room, and they were showing each other.
Nothing's wrong.<eos> I need to ask your cooperation in something.<eos> Andrew Swanson is coming with Olivia tomorrow.<eos> So?<eos> I'd like you to be there before the guests arrive and leave after they're gone.
Remove the cause, the wound will heal.<eos> - Giulio would never agree.<eos> - He already has.<eos> I will order my composer to pen an oratio.<eos> An homage to Lucrezia of Ferrara, who knows men better than they know themselves.
Papa still roams these halls.<eos> I have also lost my father.<eos> A god who walked among us.<eos> But now, he is merely a story I tell my children.<eos> A story which they will never truly understand.
Let them be driven from the ruins of their homes.<eos> You woke this morning thinking yourself an emperor.<eos> Tonight you will sleep in chains.<eos> Franciotti, please, unchain his feet.<eos> Cesare, did they not feed you?
We get him to remember and feel now what he thought and felt then, which should reactivate his passion for this bill and get him to reconsider his vote.<eos> Well, that's perfect.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> But memories aren't isolated.<eos> They bring a whole context with them.
When you wake up, you have no idea why you've suddenly assigned great importance to this set of memories, but you know your brain is telling you they're valuable, saying, "don't forget this."<eos> "Don't let this go."<eos> The idea is the same one that caused Ryan to give himself that tattoo.<eos> Memories don't just remind us what we've done.<eos> They point us at what we're going to do next.
What did you communicate, exactly?<eos> I told him to bring up the agenda, suggest bullet points for the SED,<eos> - but make no demands. - And how did that translate into a direct ultimatum?<eos> Well, sometimes my delegates try to read between the lines.<eos> They know that I need plausible deniability for diplomatic purposes.
- Holy shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I don't think he even realizes what he has here.<eos> He's using it for some silly songwriter app.<eos> All these guys are like that, they're all about consumer facing.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, uh, now that we're gonna be roomies, do you think that my lady shoes can live with your lady shoes?<eos> Yeah, you know, I mean, as long as you think they're ready
Yes, I do.<eos> Very much.<eos> Would you say he's been a good father to your children?<eos> He's a fine father.<eos> They love him, he loves them.
I'm ok.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> Drop the bow.<eos> I've got charges planted all over Starling.<eos> I drop this stick, they all blow.
You spoke?<eos> When Torres Valente, which is grown but a little crazy, defended the compulsory gymnastics in high schools,<eos> I got up and I asked him:<eos> "The heirs of our homes."<eos> "They are destined to become clowns?"
No, I really didn't.<eos> That poison wasn't even real.<eos> They called me.<eos> The kidnappers, they called me... And told me to bring you here.<eos> They... They told me I had to poison you.
Well, at best it's some kind of administrative failure.<eos> At worst, a child abuse ring.<eos> Posing as social workers?<eos> It's high-risk.<eos> But if it is that, and they knew Kyle's name, it was planned.
On the verge of telling them, of the verge of leaving home.<eos> They're always on the verge, but they never do anything.<eos> Because the kids are still young, she wouldn't understand...<eos> Then, when the kids graduate, you'll maybe realise the time will never be right!<eos> Then they are the nice, handsome, intelligent ones.
You haven't by chance seen those pearl earrings that you bought me, have you?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Are they missing?<eos> They're no longer in my jewelry case.
I just need to vacuum something.<eos> Uh, what something?<eos> Um, well, it's just that, uh...<eos> I wanted to shave my nipples.<eos> But they're, like, kind of hairy,
Damon knows that he tried to kill me less than 24 hours ago.<eos> There isn't a single vampire-craving bone in his body that would risk putting his precious Elena back in that kind of danger again.<eos> And yet he's desperate to see her.<eos> Just like her other friends.<eos> They know.
It's not essential to my plan.<eos> Did you really think you'd found the whole of my people?<eos> Travelers are everywhere.<eos> They're the faces that surround you every day the world over, the ones you don't notice because you're too busy making a mess of all that you have.<eos> They want those things, too...
Then we'll also need your prints and a DNA sample.<eos> Liz Forbes?<eos> Yes.<eos> I really enjoyed your first two albums.<eos> They were really good.
No one's coming, doctor, but please hurry.<eos> Yes, doctor, please.<eos> I can't stare at a dental mold much longer.<eos> You palmed Natalie's retainers.<eos> Well, I, um ... they, um ... yes.
Maybe there is someone we can ask.<eos> With what Brenner charges these guys, you figure they gotta be heavy hitters, right?<eos> I think I even recognize a couple of them.<eos> If we can get them to talk to us, maybe we're in business.<eos> They don't have to talk to us.
she's pretty brilliant.<eos> What?<eos> Now that's funny.<eos> What?<eos> The guys I see, they...
What?<eos> The guys I see, they...<eos> They probably had their wedding announcement in the Times.<eos> They shop in the Style section, at all these events, wives on their arms.<eos> And yet they're here with me.
Oh. Lookie here.<eos> _<eos> We need to be sure.<eos> Then we'll leave him to the animals.<eos> They can eat him, and we'll be gone.
No, no, no.<eos> - No!<eos> It'll lead to hours and hours of paperwork.<eos> Look, head down west Roosevelt.<eos> They're from the neighborhood.
Second, no one in your organization steps foot in Kentucky again.<eos> You keep to Memphis, and you leave me and mine out of it.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> You see, the problem is, I entered into business with these kids, and they pulled a slick one on me.
In my world, if it has feathers, it can fly.<eos> These feathers are little more than natal down.<eos> Pterosaurs lose these when they reach maturity.<eos> Look, it was better than being tortured by a tribe of angry natives.<eos> But then, you knew all about the natives long before they found us, didn't you, Kate?
Why not the ICA guys?<eos> They've been compromised.<eos> Storn and Stone?<eos> I'm not sure who exactly, but someone in the ICA is working with Victor.<eos> They killed Sergei, not me.
"You know that Warren girl is unstable?<eos> "She has a history of violence, a melodramatic notion of loyalty.<eos> "But please go easy on her because, you know what,<eos> "even a double cray need a little bit of help."<eos> They will probably come to this conclusion on their own, eventually, but it doesn't hurt to give 'em a little push.
"You're going to be captain of the Soviet National Team."<eos> I said, "Thank you, but I'm not."<eos> He said, "You stupid?"<eos> I said, "I'm not."<eos> But when I talked to the guys, they said, "We want you to be our captain."
The Soviets in the big league have been having trouble.<eos> They're too old or too slow.<eos> They're too confused out there, and they tend to get too fancy.<eos> They tend to pass when they should shoot, and it gets the natives restless.<eos> They're not here for the Bolshoi Ballet.
Holy crap.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> No, I mean holy crap, I found the Fillmore files.<eos> - Oh, oh. And?<eos> - Well, they are... Most definitely not bankrupt.
"Stay in school, you ugly thing!"<eos> - They would yell at me.<eos> - Aw, parents.<eos> Oh no, no.<eos> They didn't actually say that.
Good luck.<eos> Just give him a shot.<eos> Popped these guys selling off the corner.<eos> Big guy, Maurice Owens, said to call you.<eos> Man, they planted that dope on me.
Thank you for this.<eos> We have a lot to talk about, don't we?<eos> Oh, this'll be tied up in court for years, and you know it.<eos> We have some very good lawyers.<eos> They won't be working for you.
You could start with this place --<eos> Wheatondale Medical Center.<eos> We need to know who had access to it.<eos> And, also, the Qasimi brothers.<eos> Well, you don't think they had anything to do with this?
We got to find this guy.<eos> How's it going with the golf cart?<eos> The techs are working on it now.<eos> One of the carts was methodically cleaned -- no fingerprints, no dust.<eos> They don't think they'll find any DNA, either.
Are they coming for us?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Don't screw around, guys.<eos> If anybody's got anything, get rid of it now.<eos> They'll shoot you if you're carrying here.
# Everything is a source of fun Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. #<eos> 'Swing' went double-platinum and number one in Australia, and now the boys are back with their new album 'Listen Like Thieves'.<eos> Thank you, INXS, we love you.<eos> You were fantastic.<eos> They know how to relate to the audience, know how to get the audience going, keep their hearts pumping.
It did!<eos> We need to find cover.<eos> No.<eos> I don't run from monsters.<eos> They run from me.
I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> See, but there was evidence...<eos> Jane, did you ever consider the reason Michael's family chose you was to get to me?<eos> You think it's just a coincidence that out of all the lawyers in Los Angeles, they just happened to pick you?
And by in line, I mean online, breaking in and reading about it.<eos> Then, Bitchan and I will get together and bootstrap a homebrew version for ourselves.<eos> Because copyrights, patents, trademarks, and all the other ephemeral concepts of ownership are a time-bomb.<eos> Animal trainers teach a dog by giving the dog some treat it likes.<eos> They call this paying the dog.
- Mr. President.<eos> - And how are you doing, for that matter?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Widener's guys went after you and your sister pretty hard last night.<eos> They killed Wilson and dropped Keegan off a bridge at the end of a rope.
Please.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> No.<eos> I do have to. Don't you see?<eos> They made me...
You want to take $45 away from the children?<eos> No, I'm not taking anything away, I never meant to give that much.<eos> Have you seen these children?<eos> Do you know what they've been through?<eos> They don't have a balloon.
All of us.<eos> Thank you for saying that, sir, but we both know I pulled the trigger.<eos> Well, you wanna know how I think about it? And here's how I think about it.<eos> Just now, we didn't know those kids were gonna show up.<eos> But they knew. They knew for a fact there were kids on those 767s they flew into the Twin Towers.
- It is now.<eos> Two men from the police are here to see you.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They wouldn't say.
Regardless if it's in a farm or in an ocean, if for every pound of fish you take out you essentially take out 2,2 kg of wild fish, no matter whether it's a pond or if it's in the ocean.<eos> How can that be sustainable?<eos> The ultimate question is that there is a tremendous amount of natural production that comes out of the oceans all the time.<eos> We have a massive upwelling from our ocean conveyor belt that brings ancient nutrients and our ecosystems are turning that into fish.<eos> Yes, they're eating each other and you're losing some of that production every step up in the food chain, but you get more every year.
Our founder captain Watson says:<eos> "If the oceans die, we die." It's not a tagline, it's the truth.<eos> Perhaps the only ecosystem that is being destroyed at such a rapid rate are the rainforests.<eos> Our global rainforests are the planet's lungs.<eos> They absorb CO2 and release oxygen.
(Daughter) Some say pigs are dirty and gross, but I like them.<eos> They know people and they will be friends and real nice.<eos> They could be your best friend or like a sister.<eos> See.<eos> They know you and we get to know them.
See.<eos> They know you and we get to know them.<eos> I shouldn't be bonding but we have to have nice pigs.<eos> Why shouldn't you bond with them?<eos> Because they will turn into bacon.
Congratulations!<eos> 'If that was only true, then there would've never been..'<eos> '..any misunderstandings, or quarrels or divorces between couples.'<eos> 'Seeing my parents get separated..'<eos> '.. I decided never to make the same mistakes as they did.'
Where are your parents?<eos> - I didn't tell them.<eos> Why?<eos> What's the point, bro?<eos> They'll come, see.. lecture me and leave.
That turtle's a worthy opponent, I'll give him that.<eos> Anger issues?<eos> Who's got anger issues?<eos> I don't have anger issues.<eos> Maybe they have anger issues.
- Don't hurt him, he's my friend.<eos> Casey, what are you doing here?<eos> - A better Question is, how do you know these freaks?<eos> - These are the... Um, other friends I told you about.<eos> - Wait, so they're not the bad guys?
We're gonna get a subpoena to get the earlier records.<eos> - If they even keep them.<eos> - The problem is, the employees don't last very long.<eos> Some of them, couple years, others, a few weeks.<eos> And they've all been arrested, everything from disorderly conduct to assault.
Admiral Hanson, we discovered these tubeworms are connected to something much larger.<eos> Yes, Dr. Zimmer arrived at thesame conclusion.<eos> What else did you learn?<eos> There's a city at it's core and a massive graveyard with ships and aircrafts.<eos> They are being are being drawn in by huge lighting panels that seem to be powering the city.
Yeah.<eos> I guess it's done.<eos> Are you still bumming about that Bradley chick, or is this 'cause we thought you were gay?<eos> No, it's actually... it's about my mom.<eos> Yeah, well, parents suck, and if you only have one, they find a way to suck enough for two.
Your sons... they saved you.<eos> A wish released me from the bottle, released me from your curse.<eos> Now that I'm free, I beg for your mercy.<eos> Not for myself, but for my brothers.<eos> They are innocent.
A wish released me from the bottle, released me from your curse.<eos> Now that I'm free, I beg for your mercy.<eos> Not for myself, but for my brothers.<eos> They are innocent.<eos> They took from me, as did you.
Now that I'm free, I beg for your mercy.<eos> Not for myself, but for my brothers.<eos> They are innocent.<eos> They took from me, as did you.<eos> They did only as I asked of them... what I demanded of them.
Maybe I forgot to put it on the list.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm stressing.<eos> Look, a little stress is to be expected when you meet parents for the first time.<eos> I mean, they're my parents and I'm a little stressed.
[ Door closes ] Mmm! Smells great in here!<eos> Yeah, I went to the South street Italian market in honor of the opening of Al Capone's vault.<eos> Truly, it's the most exciting thing to happen to me in the past 20 years.<eos> What about your kids?<eos> - Oh, they're not gonna be here. - Oh.
- Was it the hose?<eos> - What hose?<eos> A 20-foot hose with a detachable nozzle.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't believe that they're holding that grudge against you.
You don't think weathermen are good enough because they don't wear the right tie and all that?<eos> Some of your lot don't wear ties at all, do they?<eos> Look, your little weathermen friends are all well and good, and I'm sure they're perfectly harmless, but they simply do not have the expertise with this particular technology.<eos> Our best professors do.<eos> They'll also do what they're told.
We've also used our extensive knowledge of weather systems to send a radio pulse further than science could ever have imagined, all this on a shoestring budget.<eos> So... (Where's the plane? ) (I don't know.)<eos> Any of your Oxbridge chums know anything about weather systems?<eos> God no!<eos> They do know how to mix a decent martini.
- Annie...<eos> You want us to tweet "Savegreendale"?<eos> I'm sorry, Annie.<eos> The reason I have 48 followers is that I don't exploit them.<eos> They come to me for atheistic rants and photos of my meals not this obnoxiousness.
Look, I know things seem bleak right now, but it's going to be okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Got to have faith in the system.<eos> Whatever you're looking for, you might not find it here.<eos> Kids can be cruel, they may say something...
Nice girl.<eos> Okay guys, we're off.<eos> Most of you are coming along for the fun of it.<eos> But our four championship runners are in for a serious training weekend.<eos> They'll have to defend the honour of our club.
It wasn't, but because it was the right thing to do.<eos> It was like those lads that came back from the war.<eos> They'd seen terrible things.<eos> Done terrible things.<eos> But they didn't bring that shit back into the family home.
What?<eos> We got to let her go.<eos> Tommy, think.<eos> This girl has brothers, cousins, someone who gives a fuck about her.<eos> You fuck with her, they come running, looking for her.
If you say so.<eos> He's cute.<eos> Your problem is, Miguel, you suffer from a serious case of misplaced loyalty.<eos> The men you're protecting sent you out to steal from the wrong motherfuckers tonight.<eos> Either they overestimated you or they underestimated us.
I'm not like any of them,<eos> - but that doesn't really bother me.<eos> - Ever?<eos> Only when they say things like "Alex, you study too much" or "don't freak out" or "go do something fun."<eos> So, your siblings -- they don't experience the same pressures you do.
- Ever?<eos> Only when they say things like "Alex, you study too much" or "don't freak out" or "go do something fun."<eos> So, your siblings -- they don't experience the same pressures you do.<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> They don't care about school.
It's ok. Uh! Uh!<eos> You get a hell of an education when you leave home at 13. Ah!<eos> That should slow the bleeding at least until the healing kicks in.<eos> Oh! Rraagh! The vampires.<eos> They don't even have the guts to do their own dirty work themselves.
I am not gonna let my parents destroy the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> This will ruin your relationship with your parents, and I'm not quite sure I want to be the cause of that.<eos> You're not.<eos> They're the cause of it.
You should've thought about that before you killed my grandson.<eos> HE GROANS And before you took what's mine!<eos> Where I'm from, Gerry, mates don't betray you.<eos> I'm going to rip his sodding arms out of their sockets!<eos> Yeah, they don't do that either.
No, we need videos.<eos> We need to see them and hear what they're saying.<eos> - That's not a problem.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> They know you but not me.
If we don't get it removed, they're gonna shut us down.<eos> - Removal company wants six grand.<eos> -Might as well be six million.<eos> Fucking candy striper giving a look like I'm a fucking degenerate.<eos> Egyptian royals, Incas, King Arthur, they all kept it in the family.
I'm here to endorse him for your seventh-grade president.<eos> I'm Dylan Orlando.<eos> How you doing, bud?<eos> Looks like you made some new friends.<eos> They thought it was important we recorded this for you.
Making pacts?<eos> That's not God's way.<eos> Oh? You speak for God?<eos> I speak for the children.<eos> It's your vow but they'll be the ones to pay.
How did they end up down there together?<eos> Let me see Esther's journal.<eos> That's as far as we got while you were in Ravenswood.<eos> This preacher must have offered the town elders some sort of deal.<eos> Maybe they knew what it was, maybe they didn't, but it ended up protecting the soldiers of the town.
Your infantry, your cavalry, your sailors during my voyage over.<eos> They love whoever puts hot food in their bellies.<eos> I myself heard the great captain utter similar words, claiming responsibility for your triumphs, going back to Granada.<eos> De Cordova nurtures the loyalty of his troops, a loyalty which transcends duty to king.<eos> The men never question a single order he gives. They venerate him.
Prochnost.<eos> Mr. Queen.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> My men are still searching the beach for your friend and Sara.<eos> They have the Mirakuru.
Lieutenant-- now!<eos> Listen to me, these guys, have you seen them?<eos> Huh?<eos> You seen these guys?<eos> They do not go down!
Said he got used to the emptiness.<eos> Rabbit!<eos> Who are they?<eos> Former soldiers.<eos> What are they doing here?
What's your story?<eos> Typhus?<eos> I don't know whether to kill these guys or write 'em a fan letter.<eos> Yeah, let's do the first thing.<eos> Well, they're handing our asses to us.
We'll be there. Can we bring anything?<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here.<eos> You know... my treat.<eos> Wait, if Howard's mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles.<eos> Because she's obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game "Hungry Hungry Hippos," they eat marbles.
I mean an orgy in a non-sexual way.<eos> Just for, like, the Arc de Triomphe, that's it.<eos> What's an Arc de Triomphe?<eos> It's when two dudes go down on us, this is how I picture it.<eos> And they're butt to butt and then you and I do Oprah hands.
Voodoo hell.<eos> So all we have to do is go down there and get him, then.<eos> Go down there, evade demons who swallow your soul, defeat the Tormentor, who imprisons Dr. Cody, and bring his soul back alive.<eos> Is that all?<eos> But you said if we don't mess with the memories, they won't mess with us.
I hunt enemy soldiers.<eos> I know exactly where and how many there are.<eos> Each notch is one less worry.<eos> Maybe for you, but not for their families.<eos> If I do not kill them, they kill me.
Can I go now?<eos> Yeah, you can go.<eos> Look, I just don't like losing friends, okay?<eos> I mean, lovers I don't mind, but friends?<eos> They come through.
- Wait, where did you see that?<eos> - Here.<eos> It says they died in a car bombing.<eos> They were blown to pieces.<eos> - They were murdered.
But internal studies showed that it significantly advanced puberty in lab mice and causes nerve damage, so who knows what it could do to humans.<eos> Is it true that they tried to put pig genes in an orange?<eos> Uh, I wasn't involved with the citrus...<eos> It's an industry of barbarians.<eos> They'll turn every household juicer into a countertop slaughterhouse if we don't do something.
I'm worried the restaurant, it lacks something.<eos> Customers?<eos> No one will be surprised when they come in anymore.
Are you not content? Look at what you have. Is it not enough?<eos> The gods have given me sons, as they promised.<eos> What will become of them?<eos> The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok will be spoken of as long as men have tongues to speak.<eos> They will enjoy that much fame?
- They're everywhere.<eos> Erlendur, do not be dismayed.<eos> Meet everything head-on.<eos> Whether we live or die today is already in the hands of the gods.<eos> They already know if we sup with them tonight, so fear not.
Father.<eos> I always knew in my heart that I would see you again.<eos> But I never guessed it would be in such circumstances.<eos> Who can guess the plans and ways of the gods?<eos> But now they have contrived to bring us back together and I, for one, am glad for it.
Well, when the time is right, it'll open, wide enough to let the baby pass.<eos> For the embryos.<eos> Those are my babies?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm going to inject these into your womb and then, they will implant themselves in the lining of your womb and they'll start to grow, just as nature intended.
What are you saying?<eos> I can't be friends with Daphne and Kiara?<eos> No, of course you can, just at a distance for now.<eos> At least until your adoption goes through and we're your legal parents.<eos> So I have to make nice with the privileged kids because they're the right kind of company.
I can't be friends with Daphne and Kiara?<eos> No, of course you can, just at a distance for now.<eos> At least until your adoption goes through and we're your legal parents.<eos> So I have to make nice with the privileged kids because they're the right kind of company.<eos> Even though they're probably the ones who stole the stuff.
Curiosity.<eos> We all wanna know what makes us who we are, biologically, you know?<eos> I think that's gotta be one of the hardest things when you're adopted.<eos> The rest of us, when we wanna know something like why are my knees bad, or how come I can't sing, we just ask our parents.<eos> And they tell us, "Yeah, well, that's what happens to your knees, and it's only gonna get worse." Or "None of us Coopers can sing."
And you never knew why?<eos> My parents were glad.<eos> They thought he wasn't smart enough.<eos> Wanted me to marry a doctor or something.<eos> Do you... do you think they... Hid this letter?
I'm not perfect, okay?<eos> I probably drink too much, I can't remember the last book I read and... I suck at apologies.<eos> But I'm loyal.<eos> And if you'll let me, I'll be the best boyfriend in the world.<eos> And I know what you went through with your last two boyfriends, and I would never cheat on you or hurt you like they did.
Yep. All right. Wow.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> ♪ That all changed ♪<eos> ♪ Under the downtown neon lights ♪<eos> They're great.
Don't listen to all the haters.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> You should probably meet my parents first. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.<eos> All I'm hearing from you right now is what they want.
What for?<eos> You know what for.<eos> You know, Lillian told me once that... We were defined by the decisions we make.<eos> Robots don't make decisions.<eos> They execute code.
- What are they charged with?<eos> - Attempted murder.<eos> Ah, yes, the amish crime of choice.<eos> That, along with over-whipping the ox.<eos> They're way overcharged.
You don't even have to sit down.<eos> My clients have no priors.<eos> This is a simple skirmish between some amish guys.<eos> Minor skirmish involving a razor.<eos> They weren't trying to hurt your client, Ed.
So Paradise isn't exactly paradise, huh?<eos> Why do you think Bishop Guth was so anxious to get Mary home?<eos> Think her parents were that concerned about her?<eos> Not at all.<eos> They talk to her once a week by telephone.
Why do you think Bishop Guth was so anxious to get Mary home?<eos> Think her parents were that concerned about her?<eos> Not at all.<eos> They talk to her once a week by telephone.<eos> And they miss her, but they can hear her voice and tell how happy she is.
I can't remember.<eos> Rachel and I haven't spoken on the phone in months.<eos> And yes, I know we all love each other, but the fact is the glue that holds high school friendships together is high school.<eos> Being around each other every day, seeing each other in the halls.<eos> Whenever something is up, we don't have to do any work to talk to our friends about it, they're right there.
But soon the only thing you'll have left of your son is his messy room.<eos> MAN: Man, you must really hate them.<eos> Hate who?<eos> Parents at that school your kid goes to.<eos> They're just the tool.
We'll take that one.<eos> It's the Kingsley Grand.<eos> That hotel has a presidential suite.<eos> It's a secure location the White House Chief of Staff has access to.<eos> What if we stop the parents from doing as they're told, and the kidnapper kills a kid?
"Her sled is blue."<eos> It's nice.<eos> Your friends are funny.<eos> I like them.<eos> They're... they're completely full of shit, and... and yet completely not full of shit.
We put out an A.P.B.<eos> That makes me feel so much better.<eos> And we've notified forces in Surrey, Richmond and Langley.<eos> Are they any better than you guys?<eos> They'd notice if one of their colleagues faked their own death.
Redirect, Your Honor.<eos> Detective McCandless, can you explain to us what's going on right here?<eos> This surveillance video was taken from a liquor store across the street from Wheeler Academy.<eos> It clearly shows the defendants leaving campus at 7:10.<eos> So, this shows them during the time they claimed to be at the movies?
Oh. Like ten minutes.<eos> Okay. Hold this. (toots whistle)<eos> Um, you guys, my parents were so excited that I passed the teacher's exam that they gave me their credit card to celebrate.<eos> And I was like, "What?"<eos> And they were like, "Yeah".
Um, you guys, my parents were so excited that I passed the teacher's exam that they gave me their credit card to celebrate.<eos> And I was like, "What?"<eos> And they were like, "Yeah".<eos> And I was like, "Really?"<eos> And they were like, "Yes, Kim, we're scientists.
Thank you, Frankie, for the shot, for the support.<eos> Totally justified.<eos> You owned that little shit Saxe today.<eos> But if you really want to compete with these guys, you can't have an outside life.<eos> They have wives, they have families, but we can't.
Throw the college girls out.<eos> Throw the hot-dressers out!<eos> They've turned our college into so village-school.<eos> The boys are always looking at their legs.<eos> They don't look at the other options.
I could have sworn the boys were supposed<eos> - to call at 9:00.<eos> - Yeah, mm-hmm.<eos> Admit you're doubting your decision to just trust them.<eos> I... I'm not because they are going to call.
Please come with us.<eos> Wait guys, seriously.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> I mean, they're kinda right.
So we can just call.<eos> No good. have been trying since we left Naples.<eos> All the phones have GPS tracking.<eos> They tether to one another.<eos> Provided that they are all functional.
Seriously.<eos> - If I cook it, everyone will love it.<eos> - Yes, it's me.<eos> You asked me to call you if the volunteer workers come again, right?<eos> I'm calling to let you know that they will be here tomorrow morning.
Grady Hoberman.<eos> Did you ever see him with Tiffany?<eos> I wish I knew more of these guys.<eos> I was only there a few months.<eos> Doesn't help that they all look like they're running for governor.
Why you so interested?<eos> Joff Soika.<eos> His folks are rich.<eos> They know people.<eos> They want justice.
You're charging the kids money to watch Gabrielle do what?<eos> Tricks, flips and cartwheels.<eos> You can't take their lunch money!<eos> We're not taking it.<eos> They're giving it to us.
Those are some gorgeous men.<eos> - I'm hideous.<eos> - Right?<eos> I just hope the guys aren't still mad at Debbie.<eos> - They hate me.
Are you gonna fucking tell me or what?<eos> Ethan Kelly's been paying off the families of three special ops soldiers who, who died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.<eos> What, he shoot it down?<eos> It was mechanical failure.<eos> But the report said they were supposed to be going on leave.
Would you like to adopt them?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Are you sure they should be in the same cage?<eos> It's only until I find them a home.<eos> Yeah, but they're gonna fuck like...
We're blowing up a bridge.<eos> There's not gonna be any people on it.<eos> Finn, we have one bomb.<eos> We need to use it to kill as many of those bastards as possible.<eos> But they don't know we only have one bomb.
And "War Is Coming"?<eos> Not news to me.<eos> It never ended.<eos> We are the angels' natural enemy.<eos> It won't be over until they're extinct or we are.
Even the bank guys had come they called them home too and disappeared.<eos> We had to give the cheque.<eos> What happened Bilqees?<eos> They called these poor fellows for Aquaguard servicing and have now disappeared.<eos> If they're not around, why don't you do my servicing.
He always had a purpose of doing something. A lot of people thought dock was crazy.<eos> Dock wasn't crazy.<eos> Dock knew a lot more than other people, and he proved points by making them on the baseball field.<eos> Hetookstands.<eos> He felt that the brothers should be able to wear their hair any way they damn well please.
What was the first realization that you said to yourself,<eos> "hey, I got a shot here to play professional ball?"<eos> I knew it from the time I could throw a ball to my father or my cousin.<eos> I knew then. I always knew, and I always had the dream, and I always ask young kids who are playing, "have you had the dream?"<eos> And they know what I'm talking about.
Her vaccine is failing, and the captain is covering it up.<eos> So... those monkeys were infected?<eos> Of course.<eos> She's injecting them with the virus to see if her vaccine is working.<eos> And when it doesn't, they die.
Dr. Scott let it slip in the crew lounge that she was having problems with her experiments.<eos> Now Burk, Miller, and Cruz are onto it.<eos> People are asking about the monkeys and why the ship stopped.<eos> They're even questioning the ham frequency monitoring.<eos> They're isolated.
Did you find the boy?<eos> No.<eos> The boy fled.<eos> We leave.<eos> Our men are dead and they took your father's head.
So we'll move swiftly, then.<eos> Travelling through the Dead Lands saves us five days.<eos> My lord Tahi is right.<eos> Those lands are forbidden we risk the wrath of its spirits.<eos> They say there is a monster.
They say there is a monster.<eos> A monster who eats the flesh of anyone who passes who consumed a whole tribe.<eos> What do I care of monsters?<eos> Or the dead ancestors of this place?<eos> They will marvel at my glory!
Then move.<eos> There is no glory lying here.<eos> I feel there is something wrong, with these lands.<eos> So what of it?<eos> The spirits cry at us and yet, what can they do?
I feel there is something wrong, with these lands.<eos> So what of it?<eos> The spirits cry at us and yet, what can they do?<eos> Curse us?<eos> It is they who were cursed not us.
We need to do something.<eos> Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.
Why don't you then if it's such a good idea.<eos> This is your land.<eos> These are your ancestors.<eos> Why are you afraid?<eos> They will not speak to me.
Why are you afraid?<eos> They will not speak to me.<eos> If Wirepa gets away he will have beaten you as well as me.<eos> What difference does it make to you dead things?<eos> They moan, our ancestors they call to us.
They banish me from the afterlife.<eos> I have nowhere to go now.<eos> You will be welcomed by my ancestors.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> They will lead you into the afterlife.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Bruno, you OK?<eos> I tried all the hospitals in Bogotá, they don't have it.
Whataspect prove to be more valuable .?<eos> 'm super smart.<eos> I have what it takes to win this game.<eos> I see these guys thinking 'Oh, we're going to eject quickly'.<eos> They are not going to want to look ugly girls all day.
It was an adult nappy!<eos> Anyway, we've had the Formula One testing all last week, as I'm sure you know.<eos> Important this year, the testing, cos there's so many new rules.<eos> The cars have to have 1.6 litre engines, narrower wings and sex aids on the front.<eos> Don't be stupid, they don't have to... They do!
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The hell you don't!<eos> Is there a way out?<eos> Those guys in there... they are my friends.<eos> If they die, you die.
Okay, I was -- I was afraid you'd just given up.<eos> So, whew!<eos> They'll settle.<eos> I'm gonna start casually referencing my new workout plan, and then I'm gonna debut them memorial day at Laguna beach.<eos> I personally don't think that you needed them, but if they make you happy --
As long as you promise me this won't mean we stop hanging out.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I know, but, I mean, we hardly hang out anymore anyway.<eos> They live in the suburbs now, and you two are about to have baby number three.
He goes to a cat office, just like a human office.<eos> - Except all the cats are wearing little shirts and ties.<eos> - Adorable.<eos> And they don't work.<eos> They just surf the Internet all day.
One of them was probably just shuffling some inventory toward the loading dock.<eos> What's up with these green ones?<eos> Uh, semi-toxic stuff.<eos> Comes to us from mechanics, service stations.<eos> They give us their used oil, we got to take their transmission fluid and Freon in the bargain.
Robert Pardillo and his son Bobby-- disguised as spam, but apparently not well enough.<eos> Bobby's dead now.<eos> There are also phone records.<eos> Impossible to explain, as they're only days old.<eos> They were generated by someone or something with access to a cell phone carrier's computer system.
Adam.<eos> Hopefully, it's something small and fixable.<eos> What if I called his parents?<eos> What if I called them and just explained the situation?<eos> Maybe they know something we don't.
I thought the whole thing was a prank.<eos> You said what you said.<eos> No. No, Kenny.<eos> Kenny, listen, the guys, we do this whole thing.<eos> They play pranks...
Clarke's boy scout buddies?<eos> That was Brent Seabrook and Duncan Keith from the Blackhawks!<eos> Great.<eos> So they're cheap too.<eos> Are you... they...
Tell him he's investing in a land full of angry brown people.<eos> Ah.<eos> So, obviously, they need to be reassured That there is the rule of law in the yukon.<eos> If they're killers, they need to die.<eos> But I'm not yet 100 percent certain that they're the ones.
No.<eos> The doorbell rang.<eos> I went to answer it.<eos> Three guys pushed in.<eos> They yelled at Manny in Spanish.
I don't-- don't think so.<eos> Manny told me there was trouble with gangs in his neighborhood.<eos> Okay, so what did they want?<eos> Money, I guess.<eos> They raided my parents' liquor cabinet and tore the house apart.
They told him he had to go next, but he couldn't, he would never...<eos> How long did this go on?<eos> It was starting to get light out.<eos> I told them my parents would be coming back soon.<eos> They took Manny with them.
Well, then I guess she's tougher than you are.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I was just with Avery.<eos> She's looking at mug shots of your friends right now.<eos> They're not my friends.
She was coming like a freight train the whole time.<eos> Yeah, just keep telling yourself that.<eos> White girl wanted a trip to the bone yard.<eos> She's crying rape now?<eos> What else is that rich bitch gonna tell her parents? _ They're saying Manny told them I wanted it?
She's crying rape now?<eos> What else is that rich bitch gonna tell her parents? _ They're saying Manny told them I wanted it?<eos> - Nobody would want that.<eos> - And we believe you.<eos> We're just trying to figure out how they knew that your parents were away or how they knew that you and Manny were home alone.
- Nobody would want that.<eos> - And we believe you.<eos> We're just trying to figure out how they knew that your parents were away or how they knew that you and Manny were home alone.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they followed Manny. What did he tell you?
Well, that's why you'll stay in around-the-clock protective custody.<eos> You ready?<eos> There's something I want to say first. Okay?<eos> Avery... the worst thing you can do with these guys is show weakness.<eos> They knew how much I loved you.
Soon as I carry these hot rocks into the lodge, we're ready.<eos> You okay?<eos> My son just took off.<eos> Huh, look at my sister's kids.<eos> We're out here building a traditional fucking sweat lodge, they're in there watching TV.
After I let go of 46 people this morning, something I'm in no way qualified to do.<eos> I'm worried about their attitude.<eos> Their attitude is based on the laws of physics, which, if I were you, I'd bone up on.<eos> You're looking at our only engineers with any microprocessor experience at all.<eos> They're what's left, so, yeah, these are my guys. Hey.
What exactly did she understand?<eos> That I was doing great work.<eos> She wasn't a real artist.<eos> Just ask her tutors.<eos> They'll all say the same.
They'll all say the same.<eos> Her tutors?<eos> Tell me, were they all males?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then they must've been right.
Shaun.<eos> Marcus.<eos> The disks.<eos> What are you doing with the disks?<eos> Look, just listen to me. Are they why Abi died?
Marcus.<eos> The disks.<eos> What are you doing with the disks?<eos> Look, just listen to me. Are they why Abi died?<eos> Are they why Abi died?
And tonight's winner, in the category Masters under 85 kilos, contestant number... 7,<eos> Stephane Petillot!<eos> Let's cheer him on!<eos> Excellent job!<eos> Congratulations to the winners, but they all deserve it.
Don't you know books are bullshit?<eos> Your parents are full of shit and your teachers are full of shit.<eos> Here's the only thing that matters, alright?<eos> You ever see one of this?<eos> You pull this back, you pull the trigger. Use it on your parents, cause they're full of shit.
Get out.<eos> So, listen, this Dollahyde thing is pretty by the numbers.<eos> Our guys are looking to trade their hard-earned credibility for a big old payday.<eos> Mmm. Little wrinkle here:<eos> They started on a street corner.
Chicago police warned parents about a man dressed as a clown who is approaching children.<eos> Police say a clown tried to lure boys into his pickup truck last Tuesday evening.<eos> Police have issued two community alerts regarding the clown sighting near some southside schools as well as some westside schools.<eos> No one can say for sure where in Chicago it happened first or even when,<eos> but they were out there, snatching kids off the streets.

We call them the killer clowns, and they only wanted one thing... to kidnap kids just like us.<eos> Police are saying that the suspect wears clown make-up, a wig, and sometimes he carried balloons.<eos> The latest pair of incidents occurred near playgrounds at 83rd and mackinaw...<eos> They were running out of the playground area.<eos> To prey on children at this time, you know, right around the time that they want to go out and do trick-or-treating is unfortunate.
Welcome to Firstline.<eos> Tonight,<eos> "Valentine's Day:<eos> Always A Massacre."<eos> At this school, children may give valentines to whomever they choose.
Is there a reward?<eos> If I'm going first, I want to talk to my kids before I leave.<eos> That's a lovely sentiment.<eos> No dice.<eos> We'll have a greater chance of success if they're calm and focused.
Oh, come on, it wasn't me.<eos> Anyone could have knocked your mirror off... or whatever happened.<eos> Maybe the guys are right.<eos> I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring.<eos> I'm sure they're having more fun than we are.
There's only you... Stop!<eos> You've left holes.<eos> Holes that need to be filled, my little cherub, my angel eyed demon.<eos> Holes in our children's stomachs.<eos> They're starving.
'The day following Churchill's statement, Bernstein set out for Bergen-Belsen.<eos> 'By the time he arrived, the army film cameramen had been at work for a week. '<eos> The film shot at Bergen-Belsen by the British cameramen reveal every level of humanity to a much greater extent than any other of the film evidence.<eos> It feels as if the whole human story is there.<eos> They used the camera in a very specific way.
'There was an urgent need 'to get rid of as many bodies as quickly as possible, so the SS were set to work.<eos> '500 Hungarian troops captured with the SS were started on a grave-digging operation.<eos> 'The SS themselves were made to do the unpleasant job 'they had forced the inmates to do.<eos> 'This, after all, was nothing to these men.<eos> 'They, the master race, had been taught to be hard.
'More material for Bernstein's documentary.<eos> '300 kilometres southeast of Bergen-Belsen, at Buchenwald, 'the Americans entered a camp described as a prison and labour camp.<eos> I found out the Buchenwald camp was being liberated, so the captain that I was working with, we upped and got a jeep and we drove over to Buchenwald death camp and I started filming there.<eos> It was shocking, yes, it was, because the bodies of the prisoners were stacked up.<eos> They were dead and they were piled up.
'Thugs were appointed as overseers or block leaders.<eos> 'People were tattooed across the belly with slave numbers 'and forced to work on starvation diet.<eos> 'People were coldly and systematically tortured. "<eos> We received a report that strange groups of people had been seen on a road.<eos> They seemed to be wearing some kind of a pyjama and they all looked like they were dying.
When colour came out, it was the start of 1945 in January.<eos> We were the first unit to start using colour film.<eos> Up to that point it was black and white.<eos> And it was 35mm.<eos> But when colour came out it was a 16mm movie, see, that was sent to the processors and then they would enlarge it for showing in theatres.
Newsreel theatres were showing this stuff in the States.<eos> We covered the people that were living in a town called Weimar and they were paraded through this camp to show the death scenes and the bodies stacked up and the ovens where the prisoners were put in.<eos> So I covered a lot of that with Captain Carter and we shot a lot of coverage.<eos> 'German citizens were brought in from Weimar.<eos> 'They had to see too, 'to see what they had been fighting for and we had been fighting against.
Let me open your eyes.<eos> I was born at the dawn of a sacred cycle, when the morning star aligned with the sun.<eos> The high priest believed I had a special connection to the gods.<eos> They brought me jewels and flowers at first, but then they said the lords of the night had sacrificed themselves to make the Earth.<eos> So it was only fitting that they sacrifice their own.
They brought me jewels and flowers at first, but then they said the lords of the night had sacrificed themselves to make the Earth.<eos> So it was only fitting that they sacrifice their own.<eos> I couldn't let them kill innocent people in my name...<eos> So I ran.<eos> Their priests hunted me, and the lords decided that if I refused to spill Human blood for them... Then they would give me an insatiable need for it...
What do you mean, "temporal reality"?<eos> I mean the past, the future...<eos> things you and I can't see.<eos> Their ancestors mapped the stars.<eos> They understood the cosmic movements of the galaxies.
Preacher, check this out.<eos> It's cargo.<eos> Probably from all the truckers and travelers these buzzards have been snacking on for years.<eos> Or maybe centuries.<eos> Jesus, they got... they got stuff here that goes back who knows how long.
To crawl at the feet of our masters?<eos> We are so much more than slaves.<eos> We're brothers and sisters.<eos> We share the same struggle.<eos> And the truth is... they are weak.

Phoebe was their favorite.<eos> You know, she couldn't do anything wrong.<eos> Not like me.<eos> After I told on her, she cut the piano wires.<eos> They didn't even get mad at her for that.
Now we got her right where we want her.<eos> It's like with lions.<eos> Now, when you tame them, you gotta put them on a pedestal.<eos> Let them think they're dominant, that they got the upper hand.<eos> Now, they feel safe up there, feared, like, the alpha dog.
Kyle. - What'd you do, Kyle?<eos> Get out of here. Go to class.<eos> Do you have any idea how damaged these kids are?<eos> Any idea?<eos> They've been abused.
What's with these guys?<eos> I told them I need a few minutes.<eos> It's just one.<eos> And he just got here.<eos> Yeah, they, they signed for the thing, like, I don't know, like, ten minutes ago?
We've got forensics on the paperwork they left behind, and we put a BOLO out on the thieves.<eos> Well, whoever they are, they command extraordinary resources.<eos> Firstly, they had to know that we'd recovered the fossil.<eos> There's been no media coverage, so that implies that they've cultivated a source within Immigration and Customs.<eos> They created false documents that were convincing enough to fool a veteran policeman, and they timed their operation so that they arrived before the real I.C.E. agent.
What about the kids?<eos> The Centre is gonna put someone... on them.<eos> - Limited to just while we're not here.<eos> - I don't like it.<eos> They'll never see it.
If they catch you, they'll kill you.<eos> Worry about yourselves.<eos> Most of Tristan's rangers will be at your gate by nightfall.<eos> But he'll send riders ahead, scouts.<eos> All of you have to be gone before they arrive.
I am a piece of CEO shit at the far reaches of the CEO universe!<eos> Or, alternate painting: You stick with KA, and as our loyal client you soar to the top of the pile, KA works harder for you than ever before, platforming you into bigger and better market positions.<eos> Pretty soon, you're making so much fucking money that, quite frankly, you're a little embarrassed, Jimmy.<eos> But your young, sexy wife is literally doing backflips on your Cialis-engorged cock.<eos> And... yes, I know, I've seen the missus... and your children, oh, they-they actually worship you as their godhead.
Yes, here it is: Someone with a position in the government apparatus, with invaluable insight into the banking crisis, was Age Haugen's partner.<eos> Is it also your method?<eos> - What? - To cooperate with people in government?<eos> No. I never cooperate with politicians.<eos> They don't understand politics.
Is it also your method?<eos> - What? - To cooperate with people in government?<eos> No. I never cooperate with politicians.<eos> They don't understand politics.<eos> Then they hardly understand what I do.
- That should be more than enough.<eos> Everyone, stay down!<eos> There's no way out!<eos> We can't get out!<eos> Yeah, but-but they can't get in, either.
Time Trapper, I now command you to open a portal to a certain cornfield... in Smallville, Kansas, some years ago.<eos> As the sands of time run Thy will shall be done<eos> Legion of Doom, you will go into the past... and keep the baby Kal-El from ever falling into the hands... of those sickeningly sweet rubes, Martha and Jonathan Kent.<eos> Guys, you gotta hear this to believe it.<eos> They won't raise the baby, because you will take him... put him back in his space crib, and launch him far, far away from this planet.
He's just older, and will die sooner.<eos> Come on!<eos> You sent someone to kill my men at the gambling parlor last month.<eos> Don't think I don't know it's you!<eos> They serve to die!
Clock's not slowing down.<eos> - It's about to get really warm in here.<eos> - Hey, you with me?<eos> The guys are out already.<eos> They took the drug up to Skye.
I'm always interested in money, but your only hope is the Sentinel.<eos> After our last escape, rowing out there would provide them with easy targets.<eos> We'd be killed and chopped up to feed their slaves.<eos> If we could reach the ship safely, we could free those slaves.<eos> They deserve to have their chains sundered.
Mr. Frebeaux's condition?<eos> All things considered, good.<eos> I spoke to his parents.<eos> They're hoping they can convince him to come home this time.<eos> And if they can't?
You know, you never struck me as the committed type, Conner.<eos> - Frank, you're gonna need a lawyer.<eos> - Frank?<eos> Those parents aren't just gonna come after Beth H;<eos> - they're gonna come after you.
We're rolling!<eos> My stupid parents want me to wear a bike helmet.<eos> Parents are lame.<eos> Hold on, other kids.<eos> Maybe they just recognize that nothing can protect us from the tedium of our mundane lives.
- Great idea.<eos> And it's a fantastic investment, Khwaja sir.<eos> Rascal...<eos> By the way, what about those two boys?<eos> They know too much.
They know too much.<eos> What else?<eos> Let's bury them along with the body. The end! Right?<eos> No need for that.<eos> They don't want to get involved in this anyway?
What else?<eos> Let's bury them along with the body. The end! Right?<eos> No need for that.<eos> They don't want to get involved in this anyway?<eos> Why would they open their mouth?
You mean defense of the garrison.<eos> The garrison shields us from attack.<eos> Listen, this is being done for you, for us.<eos> Just as our town fathers shielded us from the Nesaquake and from the Dutch.<eos> But they never used our dead to do it.
No Farkle.<eos> You looked on the baseball field for Farkle?<eos> Billy, are you even trying?<eos> Not really.<eos> Troubled lad, I now release you to the hands of your caring friends, 'cause they... have time for this.
Look, I think it sucks if you got wedgied by the quarterback in school, but that's not me.<eos> I never made fun of anyone.<eos> Except for those weird swing-dancing kids, but come on.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> They had it coming.
I haven't explained it yet.<eos> Now, this apple listens to NPR, goes to the opera, and reads the New Yorker.<eos> What a dick.<eos> Now, these bananas don't do any of those things.<eos> They watch pro wrestling and put ketchup on their spaghetti.
You ready to blow your brains out yet?<eos> Actually, quite the opposite.<eos> I think I like the suburbs.<eos> You what?<eos> Are they listening?
Bohemian Rhapsody to the cops last night" Morgan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her parents grounded her.<eos> So I have to go to her place.<eos> They don't get her like you get me.
The carriage could've lost a wheel or a horse come up lame.<eos> I've ordered guards to ride out and look.<eos> And what if they don't find them?<eos> Are you still so pleased with your choice to defy me and act so rashly?<eos> There's no guarantee they'd have been any safer here.
They often surprise us with the things they're able to understand at very young ages.<eos> And they're able to bring together disparate pieces of information from history, scientific discovery and their own experiences and heightened intuitive sense.<eos> NARRATOR: Throughout human history, there have been children who stand out for their advanced knowledge and incredible abilities. But are these uniquely talented and intelligent children simply the product of good genetics?<eos> Or could there be another explanation for why some children display abilities far beyond their years?<eos> Some ancient astronaut theorists believe there are children born here on Earth who have a connection to beings from beyond our world. They call them "star children."
"Those who sow the seeds of evil shall reap the harvest in hell."<eos> You made me put them in the attic.<eos> You said that it was the only way.<eos> They're an abomination in the eyes of the lord.<eos> They were my children.
It has nothing to do with Daniel.<eos> The boy was lost from the day he first saw the light.<eos> Now you have to go.<eos> I have two children to baptize.<eos> But they're also the last.
Cedric and I used to go shooting.<eos> Then don't be afraid to use it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Emily and I are going to examine the bodies.<eos> They may yield some clue.
Let's ask ourselves what we lose.<eos> I believe we lose our freedom.<eos> As Braveheart said to us in blue face and a mullet,<eos> (Scottish accent): "We must tell our enemies"<eos> they may take our lives... but they'll never take our freedom."
I thought that this was supposed to be our home, Kurt.<eos> And believe it or not, not every single design decision you make is brilliant.<eos> This whole privacy- curtains-between-the-bedrooms thing is stupid.<eos> Come on.<eos> We can hear every single noise our roomies make at night, and God knows what they hear from us.
The temple at Machu Picchu, with three windows, is said to represent this miraculous event.<eos> These brothers were the offspring of the god Viracocha that seemed to have brought the first wisdom and knowledge and rudiments of civilization to the peoples of South America.<eos> And by simply looking through these three windows, the mind could reach out and connect once more with these gods and communicate with them.<eos> Some ancient astronaut theorists believe the Incan creation story may be more than simply mythology.<eos> They believe it could be a description of stargate travel taking place thousands of years ago.
That it was a bathroom accident?<eos> Nothing to do with your brother... so that he gets away scot free...<eos> Party time again for him?<eos> But my parents... told me something else...<eos> They said... you suddenly jumped in front of the car.
Bomb squad isn't sure.<eos> It's definitely homemade, but intricate.<eos> So, the people from the government were meeting with the bankers here?<eos> Bomb was under the table...<eos> They were targeted?
A by-product of the investigation. Did you change Lestrade's ringtone on my phone?<eos> I decided to revisit the notion that the three people who sat in the pathway of the payload of shrapnel were potential targets.<eos> The Department of Labor bureaucrat was happily married, by all accounts mild and pleasant.<eos> The Whitbrook-Balsille executive... The Whitbrook-Balsille executives were beef-witted sociopaths who had sold the world on the idea that playing Three-card Monte was somehow a respectable profession.<eos> But they're hardly alone in that, are they? We're not picking up the phone because we're working.
No, no. I've spoken to their mothers.<eos> Those boys have been told.<eos> No more climbing on your trees.<eos> No more breaking branches. No more scrumping.<eos> They... They can take all the windfalls they want.
I'm an old man, me, I'm Dad.<eos> I hold my boys together.<eos> My dear fellow... No.<eos> ..you'll be dragging your boys down.<eos> They'll be looking after you and not themselves.
So the bedrooms are all clean.<eos> Who else lives in the house?<eos> My two brothers, Carl and Liam. My sister, Debbie, and sometimes my brother Lip.<eos> - All younger?<eos> - Yes. - Will they help you not re-offend?
I can see that.<eos> Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> I guess I never told you I was adopted, huh?<eos> No.<eos> Well, they bought me from a Subic Bay whorehouse, so...
I went to the "N" train. The street was quiet, but then I heard two men behind me laughing.<eos> I thought I was being paranoid.<eos> When you're a Muslim woman in a hijab, sometimes people make fun of you.<eos> Okay, what happened next?<eos> I slowed down so they'd pass me by.
Or that Muslims even live in India?<eos> Racism is a crime of ignorance.<eos> So you doubt her story because her attackers knew that she was Muslim?<eos> Mooks like that never attack attractive women.<eos> They pummel "towelheads" behind a dumpster.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Paul, a little hint...<eos> Her eyes?<eos> They're up here.
Well.<eos> Sometimes in extreme situations, things can get... Um... I don't know.<eos> The truth is, those guys weren't really brothers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They said that they were...
Just bring the kids back there.<eos> - No, I cannot.<eos> - I've been on a plane for 19 hours.<eos> I'm not making [a side trip to yonkers tonight.]<eos> - They are already asleep.
But this isn't the problem.<eos> He knows Adalind's upstairs with your captain, and so do the two guys he just sent around the back.<eos> - FBI?<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> But we better get upstairs before they do.
She's just being sensitive to your feelings, Daniel.<eos> And I've had it with Lewicki stuffing croissant down my throat and Haley extolling the healing powers of Putt-putt, like that's a thing an adult should say.<eos> They're your friends, Daniel.<eos> They care about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I wish they would all just go away.
Not children!<eos> That's just same. You think you're smarter than me?<eos> You must be deaf, Ae Ja!<eos> Mother, I know what I heard!<eos> They are my kids!
That's just same. You think you're smarter than me?<eos> You must be deaf, Ae Ja!<eos> Mother, I know what I heard!<eos> They are my kids!<eos> They came out of my body.
If it was, that's one bad-ass woman.<eos> Well, no blood that I can see.<eos> A couple beer bottles, whiskey bottle.<eos> A little late to arrest them for dui.<eos> But in retrospect, I'm sure they would have preferred that.
It's all lies.<eos> This whole conversation about plucking eyes ...<eos> Communists were not cruel?<eos> No, they were not.<eos> They said yes.
"They will not let me go with you, Ramli."<eos> Pray that the children of the murderers suffer.<eos> The children and grandchildren.<eos> The people who killed you, pray for are killed.<eos> They are suffering.
Hello.<eos> You're safe now, my love, you hear?<eos> What happened?<eos> It was Henry.<eos> He came with some men, and they... and they wanted to take me away.
Danny's mom said he was here every... every morning this week?<eos> The kids come here throughout the year.<eos> They take turns to go out and record sightings with me.<eos> You know, it makes them aware of the environment, our relationship to nature.<eos> They need to know this stuff. But he did not show up today.
- I'm setting Thornado free.<eos> Do what any chief would do in this situation.<eos> Or any father.<eos> These boys won't survive without you.<eos> Right now, they need you more than I do.
You want to tell me what happened tonight?<eos> Max?<eos> - My parents are here.<eos> - Hey, Mr. knight.<eos> They're gonna take me home now.
I think sometimes-- I don't know-- kids don't understand your asperger's, and they misinterpret it as being weird or whatever.<eos> But you're not weird.<eos> You're--you're so smart, and you're hilarious.<eos> If I'm smart and hilarious, then why do they hate me?<eos> They...
But you're not weird.<eos> You're--you're so smart, and you're hilarious.<eos> If I'm smart and hilarious, then why do they hate me?<eos> They...<eos> They don't hate you. I promise.
So this is fun, sitting in a cool new place, listening to cool new music, waiting for what seems like forever for our cool new drinks.<eos> I'm having fun.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Did they just get served?<eos> We ordered before they did.
Where do you live?<eos> Costa Rica.<eos> - In Costa Rica?<eos> - [laughs] Yeah.<eos> I have these friends, a married couple, and they own this funky hotel resort on this fantastic piece of property.
- Yeah.<eos> No, but I hear it's amazing though.<eos> But so my friends, they're getting a divorce...<eos> Amicable, you know.<eos> But they need to cash out to split up.
No, but I hear it's amazing though.<eos> But so my friends, they're getting a divorce...<eos> Amicable, you know.<eos> But they need to cash out to split up.<eos> So they'll sell, which they really want to do, and if I get the money together, they'll sell it to me for about 60% of what it's actually worth.
But they need to cash out to split up.<eos> So they'll sell, which they really want to do, and if I get the money together, they'll sell it to me for about 60% of what it's actually worth.<eos> - That's a good opportunity.<eos> - Right?<eos> Plus they want to sell it to someone they know, you know, Who can run it in the same spirit that they did.
It is time.<eos> Five, four, three, two, one!<eos> And now for the moment of truth.<eos> Did the spirits allow Felix safe passage?<eos> Or did they damn him to the ninth circle - for all eternity? - Ooh.
Oh God!<eos> Next time if he messes with us we'll burst him like a firecracker.<eos> Kids these days, by God.<eos> I can understand if they aren't scared of their father..<eos> "but they aren't even..
He's like, "This is bullshit."<eos> I'm like, "Hey, dude, don't get mad at me,<eos> "cause I'm more popular than you at your school." Little hater.<eos> He gets out of the car all mad.<eos> They're still chanting. "Fluffy, Fluffy."
Come on.<eos> Join our team.<eos> Your reward will be your death"?<eos> Here's what you got to understand.<eos> Vamps like Joe, they know what it feels like to be in the battle and what it is to sit on the sidelines.
The question is what are you fighting for?<eos> That's the problem.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Look. The werewolves took over the quarter.<eos> We beat them back today, they'll fight us back tomorrow.
Like coils of serpents, both of your fates are entwined.<eos> How very poetic.<eos> Listen, tonight you must make your way through the cornfield, where three predators will hunger for your blood.<eos> Show no mercy.<eos> They will show none to you.
The kivas at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.<eos> Big Horn Medicine Wheel in Wyoming.<eos> Many Native American tribes say, that at these ancient sites, and countless others, entities that they call "star beings" came down from the sky to teach their ancestors.<eos> To the Zuni people and other tribes there's a spiritual connection with the star beings.<eos> They're the ones that actually rule the universe, or the world that we're on.
Force Base were trying to send us a message?<eos> Some ancient astronaut theorists believe that the high number of UFO sightings reported near military installations indicates that aliens are not only present in America, but that they have taken measures to shape our future.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Ever since we detonated the first atomic weapon, UFOs have taken an interest in our nuclear facilities.<eos> GREER: They are wanting to see to what extent we might be a risk to this planet and to others who may be out in space who are peaceful.
And he says, and I quote, "If you had red skin, you'd know that this is not true."<eos> He writes that his people have been seeing objects like this in the sky for thousands of years.<eos> And he basically says that for his people, the idea that aliens have visited Earth is no merely a theory but it's a fact.<eos> The elder Paiute chief who told this story said that they believe that these UFOs have an interest in our Earth.<eos> And that they don't want to see our environment, our world, destroyed by the actions of man.
- A precaution against what?<eos> - The Clairvoyant.<eos> If there is someone out there who can read minds, at least up here, we're as far away from him as possible.<eos> Figure maybe the Northern lights will knock a few bars off his psychic wi-fi.<eos> Coulson, you know S.H.I.E.L.D.'s stance on psychics ... they don't exist.
No.<eos> Let's wait.<eos> Fear does not discriminate.<eos> It can equally affect both sides.<eos> Because they too, are afraid of me because of their past defeats.
Aim!<eos> Fire!<eos> We must call for a back up!<eos> You don't understand, do you?<eos> They are not coming.
When, uh, when Terminator 2 was still out.<eos> - When it was still in theaters.<eos> - Who'd you use it on?<eos> Oh, you know, my girlfriend at the time, you know, or friends.<eos> And they... they enjoyed it?
And does this suggest that similar powers might exist within all of humanity... powers that we have yet to fully realize?<eos> As we settle into the 21st century, our craving to be connected with what we used to know, what we can know again, and how unlimited we are as human beings, is something that we're all seeking.<eos> And it is through the power of shamanism, it is with the help of these intermediaries, that we can begin to experience this again. The shamans were always bringing advanced knowledge and leading humanity forward.<eos> They represented healing, and they represented expansion of our consciousness. If these shamans are really in contact with some kind of extraterrestrial gods, then we can see how these E.T.'s have been purposely guiding us throughout our history.<eos> In many ways they created us. And even today, they are still manipulating and guiding us into the future. Did shamans really communicate with otherworldly beings in the distant past?
But that doesn't have anything to do with "The Old Man And The Sea."<eos> See? That's your problem, Brick.<eos> You are a rigid thinker.<eos> That's why I'm gonna end up ruling the world.<eos> All the big-time rich guys -- Steve Jobs... other guys -- they're all creative thinkers, risk-takers.
The national lottery will select two hundred women at random from the pool of eligible candidates.<eos> These two hundred women will be invited to Washington, D.C., where we will conduct further tests and interviews.<eos> We will then select the one hundred women best suited to be the mothers of the next generation.<eos> The most precious thing in this world is children.<eos> They are the lifeblood of our nation and our very existence.
You think Kyle would sell us out?<eos> I'm saying he already did.<eos> Oh, my God. What happened?<eos> Two guys jumped me outside of Kessler's and they told me to stop investigating.<eos> They knew everything we'd been doing.
- Infertility was first reported.<eos> That's ground zero for the sterility crisis.<eos> So whatever those doctors were carrying onboard...<eos> Caused it.<eos> If those scientists were carrying the virus, that means they invented the virus.
It's a big gala event.<eos> I hear it's gonna be quite a party.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Darius and Langdon are meeting with the secret service to review the security measures.<eos> I want you to sit in and make sure they don't hijack it.
Let's gather all the information we can and go from there.<eos> I never go into battle without a plan.<eos> We can't turn back.<eos> When a battle starts and I'm about to send soldiers in, I don't take it lightly.<eos> They're like sons and daughters to me.
Thank you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, tonight we are trying to prove that we really do like small cars, and our producers are trying to prove that they're rubbish.<eos> Yes, so, they told us to drive our three one-litre hatchbacks all the way across Ukraine, a trip they said would be the journey from hell.
I think you're supposed to give an inspiring speech.<eos> I wasn't feeling inspiring.<eos> I was feeling screwed, not in a good way.<eos> Okay... so we are sucking out there, a lot.<eos> Our own senior boys are cheering against us, and no matter how hard we try to be the mature ones, they don't appreciate it.
They've got over all of us.<eos> Maybe I ain't one of you, Dodds, but when I get back, all they'll see is another fucking soldier with another fucking story they don't want to hear. Bitte - bitte! Schiessen Sie nicht!<eos> German prisoner! Schiessen Sie nicht! Bitte!<eos> He's just a wee boy, lads.<eos> They're all just wee boys. Who do you think you've been pointing your gun at these last couple of days?
Fermitas wouldn't budget on the... on their stock price.<eos> And what's their stock at today?<eos> It took a beating after the attack.<eos> CEOs from both companies met for breakfast at 6 this morning.<eos> No they couldn't.
Wait, there's rocket fuel down there?<eos> Enough to build a bomb?<eos> Enough to build 100 bombs... if we had any gunpowder left.<eos> Let's get back to the reapers.<eos> Maybe they'll help us.
No, he can't.<eos> We can't do this without you, Bellamy.<eos> What do you want me to say, Clarke?<eos> I want you to say that you're with us.<eos> Those kids out there, they listen to you.
Let's keep him in play.<eos> See what he does.<eos> If he's a problem, we'll put him in the ground along with Casey.<eos> I got eyes on Casey, Finch, but your friends from the government have a jump on him.<eos> You need to get to Casey before they do, Mr. dillinger.
- Are you sure?<eos> - And you?<eos> - Sure.<eos> And your parents?<eos> - They are not against.
Thank you.<eos> Tonight, you have the opportunity and privilege to hear the most famous songs of the great Michel Sardou.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The kids worked hard.<eos> They are there for you.
God, look at her.<eos> Hi.<eos> I started this chapter of Alateen because I wanted other students to know that they are not alone.<eos> My family has struggled with addiction for a long time.<eos> One of the hardest things for children of addicts to learn is that they are not responsible for other people's bad behavior, that it is not our fault when someone we love makes bad choices, even when that person is your parent.
He just didn't fit the profile of a Navy officer, you know?<eos> He came out of the hotel.<eos> He didn't put his cover on.<eos> His shoes--<eos> I mean, they were scuffed, not polished.
It's weird.<eos> Exactly what I thought... until I saw them together.<eos> It's real.<eos> And sweet.<eos> They're in love.
Not the best time. Oh.<eos> I think you'll have time for this.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozen looking for Monroe.<eos> And?<eos> And they don't know where he is.
You're an orphan?<eos> It happened about a year ago.<eos> My hometown was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them.<eos> I was so scared, but they told me not to worry.<eos> They would protect me.
She tracked you. She's, uh, good at it.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you too, Rachel.<eos> It's what separated us from the other 49 states.<eos> They knew it.
I smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.<eos> But that's so many sandwiches.<eos> Kids love them.<eos> We trade them at school.<eos> They replaced cigarettes as our currency.
- It's, you know-- it's temporary until I figure out- yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Your kids are-- they like it?<eos> - Yeah, they do, they...
Seriously, Manju.<eos> You're just too much.<eos> She's happy, isn't she?<eos> You see, Mili scares off the boys.<eos> And they run away.
And.. Your boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> I am completely off men.<eos> They can't handle my spontaneous personality.<eos> They say, 'Don't do this, don't do that'.
You know, I don't need Judge Judy in my firehouse.<eos> Wallace...<eos> I need someone who can be there for my people... offer them support, spiritual guidance, actually get them to open up.<eos> I can't order your men to open up, Chief.<eos> They have to find their own way.
Jeez, I've got to start paying better attention.<eos> Yeah, you should.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> It's just that I haven't slept for, like, 20 hours.<eos> They don't care.
The babies escaped, and I ...<eos> - Escaped?<eos> - They're babies, you sack-less moron.<eos> - I was downstairs, working on<eos> - a new toy, and they just ...
I can take my time, Mr. Gardner.<eos> I was on the Blagojevich case.<eos> We always knew that sooner or later the lawyers would talk.<eos> They want to talk, they need to talk.<eos> They know that attorney-client privilege only gets them so far.
And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy.<eos> Previously on The Tomorrow People...<eos> JEDIKIAH:<eos> Your new friends want you to believe that your father is still alive.<eos> They lied to you.
We have your attention.<eos> Now we have some demands.<eos> MAN (ON RADIO):<eos> The gunmen are requesting a helicopter.<eos> They say they'll kill a hostage every hour if their demands aren't met.
Dr. Grey?<eos> You're gonna kill me.<eos> I'm gonna thank my parents, obviously.<eos> Why?<eos> They didn't help you win the Harper Avery.
You're gonna kill me.<eos> I'm gonna thank my parents, obviously.<eos> Why?<eos> They didn't help you win the Harper Avery.<eos> They gave birth to me.
That's perfect, Kyle.<eos> Now put the fake rocks back up at the top, and then we're all set.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You know, I blame the parents.<eos> You know, they pamper their kids.
Just a heads up.<eos> Jason Grayson's mom is here to see you.<eos> Yeah, all the guys in the stockroom think she's, um, a [Whistles] Blblblblb! [Chuckles]<eos> If you've never seen a cartoon, I-I probably looked pretty foolish right there. I get it.<eos> They think she's crazy, huh?
Now, they're the town's kids.<eos> Next week, they're Patriots.<eos> Looks like trouble in paradise.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozens searching for Monroe.<eos> They don't know where he is.
Come on.<eos> Lucky!<eos> It's time to eat. Ramon's paella.<eos> If you don't eat. Your brothers will tell me off.<eos> They brought you here to protect you.
Dog.<eos> A tiny little baby dog.<eos> I don't get it. Why does he like you more?<eos> Dogs are pack animals.<eos> And they just naturally gravitate toward the Alpha.
I would remind you, sir, that you speak of human beings.<eos> And you would have me believe that all human beings are equal.<eos> That the creatures of Whitechapel, are comparable to myself, my wife, yourself?<eos> These incontinent men and women... they can not be taught.<eos> They can not be trusted.
And the production company would have a claim against them.<eos> But, unfortunately, you do not. - Mr. Hanson.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Just a heads up.<eos> I think the public will be interested in what happened to the Bowen children after they appeared on your show, so I'm gonna hold a press conference to share what you just told the judge.
Is that a threat?<eos> No.<eos> I think it's gonna be a great story.<eos> "Children evicted from their dream home."<eos> "Producers stand by as they're sent back to foster care."
The producers have signed their claim over to us, which means my clients now have standing. Hmm.<eos> Found your "in," Ms. Kaswell.<eos> The reason the Biltmans were chosen by the producers to appear on "Ultimate Home Do-over" was to give the Bowen children their dream home.<eos> Well, the children no longer have that home, because the Biltmans kicked them out, which violates their contract.<eos> Since the kids now stand in place of the producers, they absolutely have the right to sue.
'With the fact-finding mission over, 'we felt we had become fully paid-up members of the cycling community.'<eos> Have you got the arts pages?<eos> Mm.<eos> It seems to me, for our public information film, what we should do is make cycling attractive to bus passengers because then there would be no need for buses.<eos> And they are the biggest problem on the road.
NARRATOR: Delavan Lake, Wisconsin.<eos> May 4, 1912.<eos> According to a report in the New York Times, two local boys made an extraordinary discovery.<eos> 18 skeletons found in a series of ancient burial mounds, and all of them measuring between seven-and nine-feet tall.<eos> The enormous skeletons were reportedly submitted to the State Historical Museum, but some say they were later confiscated by the Smithsonian Institution.
NARRATOR: In ancient stories, the succubus is a demonic being that takes the form of a woman and seduces human men.<eos> This demon is also able to change genders and become an incubus, using the semen taken from men to impregnate mortal women.<eos> Incubi and succubae were said to come to people in the night...<eos> They wake up from a deep sleep and are fully conscious of their surroundings.<eos> However, they also are paralyzed.
Ancient evidence suggests humans have practiced religion since they first walked the planet.
Why does a pig roll in mud?<eos> It seems constant, the "why, why, why, why, why?"<eos> Why do numbers never stop?<eos> Some of that's just to kind of get a conversation started, but a lot of it is because children have these really strong explanatory urges.<eos> We've been interested in the kinds of explanations children seem to naturally generate for themselves and which kinds of explanations they find palatable.
Joshua's experiment suggests that elephants can think about what other elephants are thinking.<eos> They may have at least the basic mental equipment for religion.<eos> This could explain a profound behavior that has been observed in the wild.<eos> There are anecdotes of elephants returning to the location where family members have died and potentially reflecting on that.<eos> It's difficult to interpret that, but, again, because of how social they are, I certainly think that they have some understanding of loss.
Why are you here?<eos> Mr Sturge needs a full name to advertise your tour.<eos> I'll give it some thought.<eos> Robert Greg's asked the Poor Law commissioners to send them workers from the south.<eos> They are not the enemy.
I don't get paid.<eos> Aw, no-one's going on strike, it's just men jabbering.<eos> What happened?<eos> Get Daniel Bate.<eos> "Blessed are the shoemakers, for they shall be called the "children of God."
And Bessie and the children.<eos> I know.<eos> We should get some protection.<eos> We've always looked after our workers.<eos> They know that.
- Russ:<eos> They're mine. - Man: The kitchen would have to be gutted.<eos> How disgusting were those bathrooms?<eos> Woman: They look like they've never been cleaned.<eos> - Russ: They're not that dirty. - Lina:
With all respect, Favi Tarr, - we were answering to Alak. - Shh.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> What is a man to do when all of his men equally dishonor him?<eos> Does a general slaughter his own troops?<eos> Our Castithan forefathers grappled with this very same problem, and they... they had a wise solution... the one bears the shame of the many.
Our employees did not do this.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> They would never keep us prisoner.<eos> They would have killed us immediately.<eos> They'll wish they killed me when their mouths are stuffed full of their own jondura.
- Stop.<eos> - Please, come on inside.<eos> - No, you know... your kids aren't real happy with me right now.<eos> Really?<eos> They love me.
It is.<eos> The main reason it's a little bit different is because our producers have told us that we should try our hands at long-distance lorry driving.<eos> Literally, my idea of heaven.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They told us each to buy a truck and report with it to what the BBC calls the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.
The ride is shocking.<eos> OG!<eos> Possibly a bit of play in the steering.<eos> Let me talk you through my brakes.<eos> They don't really work.
Do you know what I am, mom? Hmm? I am indefatigable.<eos> Yes, you are. - Hmm? - Ah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Every day with your kids is an adventure.<eos> Sometimes, they frustrate you.
Sometimes, they frustrate you.<eos> You know, when you think about it, this whole thing started because of my mean math teacher.<eos> I think you two should talk.<eos> I'll set it up.<eos> Sometimes, they inspire you.
Hey, you know, I don't understand why Ryder needs a passport.<eos> I mean, it's just Canada. Can't you just write a note saying, you know, "Yo, Canada, my nephew wants to come into your country.<eos> You cool?"<eos> This is the last thing I'm doing for him.<eos> You know, you raise these kids and they give you nothing back, no appreciation.
That's your reaction to me telling you this emotional thing is I should go around town asking for the--<eos> What, what did you call it the pullout king?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Say, hey, do you guys know who the pullout king is?<eos> They'll be like, yeah.
T... there were other photos on t... that stripper's phone... photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.<eos> Jimmy Lutz?<eos> Yeah, but I...<eos> I don't think that's his real name.<eos> I mean, t... the ugly brothers... they... they always, uh, called him something else, like...
Oh, we're having a family dinner.<eos> I'll put the heat on, you watch her.<eos> So how's this gonna work?<eos> You just gonna turn me over to the twins and then they're gonna kill me?<eos> If they don't, I'll be standing nearby.
I looked around my room.<eos> And I tried to decide what I should take with me.<eos> Wherever my real mom was. (Sighs)<eos> My thought my parents would only want their "real" daughter.<eos> But they just added Daphne.
I never knew.<eos> We don't contemplate our parents keeping secrets.<eos> How could he hide that passion all those years?<eos> It's extraordinary, don't you think?<eos> They waited, Julia.
You just don't know it yet.<eos> And, of course, he was telling that to Tony Stark, but that was also us telling that to the audience to see how they'd react.<eos> And the next week, after the film had come out, there were stories everywhere about who Nick Fury was, what that meant, does that mean that these characters exist within the same universe?<eos> And that was what we intended.<eos> They do exist in the same universe.
But it's really more like a lease.<eos> As the story goes along, to my great thrill, he turns out to be a much more formidable character.<eos> Sorry for the mess.<eos> Just those action beats that we had in there burned through 80% of the budget for both the shorts, so they came to me after I wrote the first one.<eos> They were like, "it's great.
Now I get the whole idea of money. It's lovely!<eos> It's the greatest idea ever!<eos> I know!<eos> And since we're doing it together, you'll both have to come meet my parents.<eos> Max, they've been asking to meet my girlfriend anyway.
I didn't take anything.<eos> I...<eos> Caroline, do you mind if I speak to Max, alone?<eos> Our neighbors have just stopped by.<eos> They've opened a bottle of champagne.
Are you that jealous of Father's attention... his love for them over his angels?<eos> Over you?<eos> I should finish you right now.<eos> Try.<eos> If the humans knew you were here talking to me, they'd kill you themselves.
I couldn't keep up.<eos> Hence why you cannot keep a baby.<eos> Your parents kept me.<eos> That's different.<eos> They were grown-ups.
But I have something I need to talk to you--<eos> So, you're not a social worker?<eos> No.<eos> I knew your parents very well.<eos> I came before to check on you 'cause I knew they'd want me to.
They're boneheads.<eos> We can't give with one hand and take with the other.<eos> We have to stop this.<eos> There's no stopping this.<eos> Guys, they own the place.
Just run, like they tell us?<eos> I played football, Kurt.<eos> So did I.<eos> As a kicker!<eos> That's the same attitude that makes these guys think that they can do whatever they want.
No.<eos> In his kitchen, while I was waiting before, there were three crew members.<eos> You remember any of their names?<eos> No, I don't... I don't think they said their names.<eos> They just...
We're not exactly a family anymore.<eos> Cool.<eos> Then I'm gonna go call Runyen and tell him I can go fishing with his family.<eos> Just 'cause I'm a single dad doesn't mean I can't take my kids on a family vacation.<eos> They seemed okay with not going.
I told you we ended it last year.<eos> I-I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But your symptoms seem to be Tracy-based.<eos> They come on when you're concerned for her safety or worried about her leaving.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Jenny, the men that downloaded these images, the court can order them to pay you to pay for your medical expenses, your therapy, to help you with Maddie.<eos> I don't wanna be pa...<eos> I don't wanna be paid for that.<eos> So everywhere I go, men on the bus, on... on the street, they've all seen me like...
Jenny, the men that downloaded these images, the court can order them to pay you to pay for your medical expenses, your therapy, to help you with Maddie.<eos> I don't wanna be pa...<eos> I don't wanna be paid for that.<eos> So everywhere I go, men on the bus, on... on the street, they've all seen me like...<eos> They've seen me like Lacy?
- We were gonna -- we were gonna work together.<eos> we were -- we were gonna do great things.<eos> My parents, they didn't under--<eos> I tried to tell them.<eos> They didn't understand.
Good morning, Irene.<eos> What a beautiful picture, all the skinned piggies in a row.<eos> Or are they sheep?<eos> Don't know.<eos> They all look the same with their clothes off.
All of it!<eos> Not the caviar, obviously.<eos> I'll have that for lunch.<eos> I think Tilling will be very good for our drawing, Georgie.<eos> We were doing nothing but trees and clouds in Riseholme and they needn't be straight.
Welcome home, Cassandra.<eos> Thank you, Daddy.<eos> Oh, you're sick, darling.<eos> You should be in the hospital.<eos> The doctors... they hurt me so bad.
118 gets in bay five, full lockdown.<eos> One bus, one bay.<eos> Ah, that makes our job a whole lot easier.<eos> So what's our next move?<eos> Next move is we get 118 alone, give my guys 20 minutes, they tear that thing bolt from bolt.
They're being sold, like slaves.<eos> You sure?<eos> I've got it on pretty good authority.<eos> I mean, I'm used to dealers and cookers and bangers.<eos> You know, I know how they operate.
Hey Betty...<eos> Hey check and see if any tanker trucks have been reported stolen.<eos> Mr. Richardson tells us you surprised the thieves.<eos> That's correct.<eos> They pulled in, I realized their papers were falsified and I rang the alarm.
Larry...<eos> Going back to Zabvron isn't fixing your problems, okay?<eos> It's running away from them.<eos> You are a supreme leader.<eos> If you lead, they will follow.
Why don't we... launch a search party from over there?<eos> Russia would never allow it.<eos> But we've put Finland on alert.<eos> For diplomatic reasons, SECNAV says we have to give the Russians first crack at search and rescue.<eos> So our friends are out there, and they're worried about saving face?
On the contrary ... your little bedside chats pushed him in the direction we needed.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> We've had more than a few setbacks.<eos> We've been testing these new drugs.<eos> They all have different numbers.
They are taking long, aren't they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you decide on a wedding date?<eos> No, I haven't even met Shigeyuki-san's parents.<eos> But they agreed to us living together before marriage.
It could have died in here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You remember what I said about people being afraid of you?<eos> You have to be more careful than other kids;<eos> You won't have the same chances they do.
Good.<eos> Get to work, boys.<eos> You got your hands on seven Samaritan servers.<eos> You find anything on them?<eos> No, but they'll definitely find us if we don't get this right.
But it can't be just any lie.<eos> It's got to be a lie that she relates to so she'll believe it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I didn't want my kids to know that I killed people, so I told them I'm in here 'cause I robbed a candy store.<eos> They can relate to that.
I know you're excellent, no matter...<eos> Look, I'm not supposed to get those test results till next week, so...<eos> They don't matter anyway.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> They do.
These are the first.<eos> But they won't be the last.<eos> It'll go on and on, until your death, because that's the way it works.<eos> And a beautiful, young queen, the men are gonna throw themselves into the fire for you, my dear.<eos> They'll shoulder lost causes and take on risks they should never take.
What is that?<eos> Some kind of threat?<eos> No.<eos> But this is.<eos> Have you ever seen what happens to Montana steaks when they've been rerouted for additional postage?
I cried like a burst fucking drain.<eos> - Then they came back in though, yeah?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> They fucking forgot.
Everything is complicated, isn't it?<eos> That's what people say when, they need an excuse.<eos> When they can't find one.<eos> C'mon, Babe.<eos> They're going to meet you.
And would tear off as they were pulling away.<eos> Wow, so what?<eos> Someone had her locked in a freezer for the past four months?<eos> Well, that would be the easy answer.<eos> I've worked a lot of mob hits, and they love to freeze.
How would that be better?<eos> I love you.<eos> I want them to meet you.<eos> Well, you love your parents, too.<eos> And what they think means a lot to you.
And since you are both subsequently remarried...<eos> Yeah, some of us age appropriately!<eos> Okay.<eos> Since you both have subsequently remarried, you both have committed bigamy, which is punishable by up to a year in prison.<eos> They're not bigamists.
Yeah, some of us age appropriately!<eos> Okay.<eos> Since you both have subsequently remarried, you both have committed bigamy, which is punishable by up to a year in prison.<eos> They're not bigamists.<eos> I mean, they clearly don't want to be married to each other.
What can I do for you?<eos> We're looking into his wife, Cheryl.<eos> Cheryl left the club three hours before Harry's death, and before you ask, I know this because Cheryl came down to say goodbye to Harry at our weekly poker game right here in this very room.<eos> Did anyone else see her leave?<eos> Everyone around the table... two lawyers, a CEO, and the lieutenant governor, and they're gonna be here this evening.
She felt like she was looking at another person's life.<eos> When I feel down... have to remind myself I'm getting a second chance with this woman.<eos> Only woman I've ever loved.<eos> Now remember, when we plead Hank's case to the administrators, speak with deference and respect.<eos> They see the courthouse as their personal fiefdom, and they rule with an iron fist.
They just walk in here and start shooting.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> The bullet type, point-blank shots to the head.<eos> Did you see the shooters?<eos> They didn't see me.
- You can still do it<eos> - with your clothes on.<eos> - I know that, but not on your wedding night!<eos> I was just hoping to get a wee keek at her breasts.<eos> They're related to you?
- Poor thing.<eos> - Kids are all right?<eos> - Yeah, everyone is fine.<eos> You got a bit afraid, but it wasn't that...<eos> It was controlled and they know what they're doing...
Sometimes investigators suffer from a form of tunnel vision.<eos> Especially when one of their own gets killed.<eos> They stop asking questions and start to frame the case around their theory.<eos> Do you know what they think?<eos> They think that you did all of it, not just the preacher, but the sheriff and all of the girls, too.
And yet this vial of cyanide poison was found in your house.<eos> Those redcoats claim they found it. It's nothing of mine.<eos> Mr. Brewster, it is pointless to impugn the words of these good men.<eos> These are officers.<eos> They are sworn to protect us and they have earned our trust.
- So you mean to surrender?<eos> - No.<eos> - They don't request...<eos> - Good because I'd hate you to become the first commander to let the patriots get a foothold on Long Island.<eos> to They don't askts get a for surrender, sir.
So your solution is to just act like he did?<eos> Sorry to barge in, but I wanted to tell you the buyers have decided<eos> - not to make an offer on your house after all.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, that's because they're not real, and neither are you.
Why?<eos> Because you were planning on killing Shane, too.<eos> And the only way you could get to him was to have yourself thrown in federal prison.<eos> Those bastards ended my life 17 years ago.<eos> They do not deserve to live.
You don't trust me, kill me.<eos> We'll both die together.<eos> Or we can sit down, make each other some money.<eos> My buyers are prepared to wire ten percent Of the purchase price as soon as I leave this building.<eos> But they require some proof that you've got the goods.
Well, he responded far too quickly, far too adamantly.<eos> He was lying?<eos> No.<eos> Generals never lie.<eos> They obfuscate, and complicate, and confound, and... befog, but they never, ever lie.
It's the same thing.<eos> It's a new service.<eos> It will be carrying out some of the same duties.<eos> For instance, until the perimeter fence is complete, there'll be regular patrols of the woods and fields around the village.<eos> And remember, they're relying on you as much as you are on them.
They become badly malnourished, leading to sickness, which they can't afford to treat.<eos> This is 21st-century slavery.<eos> To understand how something like this could be happening in 2013, I went to speak with the director of the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan, I.A. Rehman.<eos> Displaced workers come to brick kiln owners with no money.<eos> They ask for loans for as little as a hundred dollars in order for themselves and their families to survive.
Are you kidding me?<eos> If Detective Johnson doesn't want an explanation, we can accommodate him.<eos> Go on.<eos> Two subjects sit in facing harnesses and tie each other in.<eos> They control each other's sensations by pulling and tightening knots through these winches and pulleys.
Uh... three months ago.<eos> ♪ I'm coming up only ♪<eos> She took my kids, too.<eos> ♪ You wrong ♪<eos> They have to sneak in calls to me.
Like your petty side or the bully in you?<eos> And that bleeding heart you're so deathly afraid will get exposed?<eos> You can't replace her the way you're trying to, Frank.<eos> You're a father to your kids and a son to your father and a boss to your men.<eos> They can't be that person for you.
You want to call action?<eos> Yeah... I want... not yet.<eos> We're rolling.<eos> What do you want me... the models to be doing?<eos> Are they gonna... can they laugh?
Okay, I'll get everything we have and send it over to them.<eos> Let's see if we can match the designs of these devices or the handwriting in these documents to anyone they may have in their database-- see if we can find these kids' partner.<eos> The Symbionese Liberation Army... the BLA...<eos> the United Freedom Front-- you know what all these groups have in common, Dawn?<eos> They all attacked their own country and they all lost.
Come on.<eos> "Our Zoo News. Edition One.<eos> "The first thing you need to know about animals is that they're "just like human beings only with much better manners.
I've got three!<eos> Then bring them, please!<eos> Bring them to the zoo.<eos> Let them see it for themselves.<eos> They won't be coming anywhere near!
Really, I am. Er...<eos> My daughter wrote this.<eos> Please.<eos> Nine year old, she is.<eos> "The first thing you need to know about animals is that they're "just like human beings only with much better manners."
And 800 soldiers.<eos> I'll send lucrative offers of assistance to the Knights of St.John and the Order of the Dragon.<eos> It's possible we can hold the city till reinforcements arrive.<eos> For a day, a week.<eos> If they breach these walls, they'll behead me like they did the King of Varna.
It's like he doesn't exist.<eos> Or, he erases all evidence of his existence.<eos> Everyone leaves footsteps.<eos> I'll reach out to my mi6 contacts.<eos> They'll turn up something.
It came to me in a dream.<eos> Daddy, the bombs came.<eos> It's C-4, Gary, and I am not your father.<eos> What about the detonators?<eos> They came, too.
Third-party defenders for ourselves."<eos> So there was a guy at the Tobacco Institute named Peter Sparber.<eos> The Tobacco Institute planted Peter Sparber inside the National Association of State Fire Marshals.<eos> And the fire marshals named him their legislative representative.<eos> What the fire marshals didn't know was that big tobacco was paying him $200 an hour for work they thought was volunteer work.
Nah, he looks fine.<eos> I think he actually came out looking better.<eos> I told you you need to keep your head down in here.<eos> Right, 'cause it's my fault dudes can't take no for an answer.<eos> What? They trying to get on you?
And...you're so mature.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Listen.<eos> Wear these earrings.<eos> They will match your red-party theme.
"The days filled with promises to live."<eos> "Days filled with tall expectations."<eos> "We'll never forget... these good old days."<eos> "I wish these days would last."<eos> "They always go too fast."
Fun! Fun! Fun!<eos> But Fourth of July fireworks were a different story.<eos> They meant more to my dad than my Mom could ever know.<eos> It was the one night of every year that he couldn't hear his parents argue.<eos> He figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
Here, maybe you can help.<eos> There you go.<eos> I need to find...<eos> My teeth are very sensitive.<eos> I need to find a very sensitive toothpaste, because my teeth are um, they're...
That's how he got his revenge.<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna bait them into an ambush.<eos> What if history doesn't repeat itself?<eos> What if they don't respond as you're predicting and I die doing something I didn't have to do?
Oh, it's funny all right.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hear you like to do funny things with the little kiddies.<eos> I heard you like to take advantage...<eos> Oh 'cause they think you're a simpleton.
They're everywhere.<eos> Pinheads. Stump girl.<eos> Seal man.<eos> Even when I close my eyes, I still see them.<eos> They give me the heebie-jeebies.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He has an avid imagination.<eos> You know kids today.<eos> They make things up when they don't have problems of their own.
I choose to think of my sister.<eos> And every moment that is left,<eos> I choose to think of seeing you dead.<eos> But none of this matters.<eos> I have freed the Devil's men, and they hate you as much as I do.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, let's do this.<eos> Can you identify any of these men?<eos> They are all Juárez police officers.
This is the truth.<eos> Become slaves taking what is given to us.<eos> Living habits.<eos> Than you have to be afraid.<eos> I joined up to you to punish them as they should.
Limits? You have other ideas to punish those pigs?<eos> I do not know.<eos> But I do not think more just like it seemed to me at the beginning.<eos> You are not sensitive, but just stupid.<eos> They would use any means without remorse.
- Did she have a summer internship?<eos> - No, she just wanted to get started looking for an apartment.<eos> I cried like a baby.<eos> Kids are tougher.<eos> They know better.
A falling acorn becomes a meteor.<eos> A tiny trickle, a tsunami.<eos> And every enemy, is a giant.<eos> Now, using the latest technology, we can recreate the world from their perspective -<eos> to experience it as they do.
This holdup is one he can't afford, especially when his store is being burgled.<eos> The young chipmunk is still held up.<eos> Every autumn a moose can eat enough acorns to put on 100 kilograms.<eos> Just what it needs to survive the harsh winter ahead.<eos> And that's the problem for small animals, they just can't store enough fat.
I talked to him, but he's dug in.<eos> There is a silver lining.<eos> Well, we love silver linings.<eos> Almost as much as cute animal videos.<eos> Oh, my God, L.O.L. They're hilarious. [Chuckles mockingly]
I mean, it was, uh, pretty warm.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's crazy. Uh... Do you ever...<eos> Chickens are dumb, right?<eos> They don't even... how long have we been eating chickens and they don't get... they're not a little wary at this point, they don't... haven't risen up.
The rumaki is exquisite.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I don't know, that those things are unrelated.<eos> I mean, first the kids start off protesting and the next thing you know every authority is up for grabs.<eos> I mean, if they learned how to support their country, sacrifice in hard times, we'd have the morale to win the war.
Close the button.<eos> Yes Sir!<eos> There were two boxes.<eos> In trying to open one box, two men lost their lives.<eos> They were going crazy!
Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Then what will be difference in them and us.<eos> There is a difference because we are fool and honest.<eos> Whole day we are working and they are thieves.
Don't you get any dreams in the night?<eos> This is my family matter and you don't speak in between.<eos> Men are tossing money at your wife's face..<eos> You don't talk about my wife.<eos> They try to touch her..
It's like Agatha Christie.<eos> One day she vanished.<eos> Don't you think those sons of bitches are gonna give my career a funeral with full honors?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I'm gonna keep on typing and they can keep on redacting and eventually they'll run out of ink.
That one.<eos> Bryce Kovach, you are under arrest for the murder of Joey Duncamp.<eos> We'll be charging your brothers with conspiracy.<eos> Please stand up.<eos> At least they'll have a chance at a life, right?
They don't know how numbers work, and they want me to do it all wrong.<eos> The kids are just mean babies.<eos> They don't know anything, really, and the teachers don't know anything.<eos> They're mean and tired and they're stupid and they just say what's in the book.<eos> Because they don't know, you see?
Hinata went to Toneri.<eos> You are so stupid.<eos> It's obvious she had a reason that she couldn't reveal.<eos> When a girl truly fall in love, her feelings don't change that easily.<eos> They can't change.
You don't have parents.<eos> You don't have a name and a birth certificate.<eos> Stop telling these lies!<eos> My parents have passed away.<eos> But actually they are still alive, and they gave birth to a son after abandoning you.
Who knew he was making that drive?<eos> The wedding guests, um... Catering staff.<eos> - I'll need their names.<eos> - I've got a list.<eos> But they're all friends and family.
Yes?<eos> That's the disappearing point and he punctuates that with a tiny little dot of light.<eos> Overall, it's a really dark picture.<eos> It's almost like a semi-transparent curtain's been drawn over the whole scene and it's very much night-time, and yet, it's punctuated all over the place by these flares of light.<eos> They emphasise the structure and give a sense of excitement of this city scene which is a great characteristic of this picture.
The only way, until the advent of photography, to have an image, is to have a painter paint you.<eos> They had money, they were wealthy, they could pay for the best painter living in England to capture their image, and the top painter living and working in London in 1533 was the German painter<eos> And, at some point, the three men -<eos> Hans Holbein, Jean de Dinteville, Georges de Selve - would have got together and discussed this composition.<eos> They're the ones telling the painter what to do.
That's sweet.<eos> What -- like, protective clothing or...?<eos> Maybe.<eos> We found these metal shards.<eos> They broke off with the bullet hits.
Oh, hey, Will.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Just hanging with my buds.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Then why are they up there and you're down here?
Look at all this, like pigs to a trough.<eos> These people are disgusting.<eos> What do you call what you're doing?<eos> I'm eating crab cakes.<eos> They're perishable.
You'll come see me on Sunday?<eos> Of course.<eos> They're not gonna let you off that easy, son.<eos> What?<eos> "Said the father, my dear son, "relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against"...
No, no, no. Where are you going?<eos> We're in the middle of a conversation.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Oh, you know how it is with those rogue seizures.<eos> They just come and go with no real medical explanation.
- She's 12 years older.<eos> - That's a pretty big gap. Why'd your folks wait so long?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You never asked them?<eos> They died when I was pretty young.
Pink camouflage!<eos> You know, for the ladies.<eos> So they can hunt flamingos?<eos> If they get the proper permits, I have no objections.<eos> Did you know that flamingos get their color because they eat so much shrimp?
Yeah, yeah, that's right.<eos> They're going to eat me alive!<eos> 'So what's the basic problem?<eos> ' The basic problem is that he's distressing the toddlers.<eos> Sounds to me like they're distressing him.
Two years ago I went as a slutty nurse, And then last year I was a slutty judge, But this year I'm just gonna cut out the middleman<eos> - And go as a slut.<eos> - We got it.<eos> - You hate your parents.<eos> - They're not great.
Oh, no, no, no, I had a transvestite father.<eos> But, yes, we were squatting on that onion farm.<eos> Yeah, okay. That makes much more sense.<eos> I just didn't want my kids to feel deprived the way I did.<eos> They deserve everything that I give them.
I'll put that back when you move out.<eos> But then I won't need it.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> I'll take this whole room apart.<eos> When I was growing up, you weren't allowed to separate yourself from your family, which is why I try to find ways to remind my kids that they're a part of something greater than themselves.
I'll be fine.<eos> I don't know if I'll be fine.<eos> Do you think the teachers will see my bruises?<eos> And what if they ask questions?<eos> I mean, that's the kind of thing that they have to report, don't they?
I mean, did we raise them wrong?<eos> Is it just the way they are?<eos> Let's not talk about the kids, Frankie.<eos> We're in Paris.<eos> They're America's problem now.
Let me know if you need anything else.<eos> So I was looking up those steroids<eos> - you were going to give me.<eos> - Mmhmm.<eos> They, um, seem very expensive.
That is, if they all play fair.<eos> That almost is never the way the game is played.<eos> People often leave with far less than the socially optimal outcome, and that's because certain individuals start pulling out and stop cooperating.<eos> Most contribute to the common pool, except these players.<eos> They keep their $10, but still take an equal share from the doubled communal pot.
How does a woman like Vic end up with someone like Sean?<eos> Dunno.<eos> I mean, he didn't even put up a fight when those guys abducted him on the road.<eos> Probably the smartest thing in the circumstances.<eos> They were armed... he wasn't.
Come on!<eos> Move!<eos> I saw your guys gun down that highway patrolman in cold blood.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They saw you do the same thing to my brother.
Don't worry. We'll find out who did this.<eos> Did you really just tell the mother of a victim You would solve the case?<eos> Nice to know you're finally referring to her as the victim.<eos> Henry, I am not supposed to be looking into this.<eos> Now, what happens when those parents call my boss And say, "hey, they promised to find out who did this"?
The idea was really very simple.<eos> They were cars but they were smaller and simpler, so they use less materials, they were easier to make, they have simple engines, usually single cylinder, often two stroke, they were cheaper to buy, they were usually easier to run.<eos> The microcar promised to revolutionize motoring for the masses.<eos> They didn't just aim to solve post-war hardship but also congestion in the crowded European cities and towns.<eos> And because they were pretty basic to make, all sorts of people had a go.
The media accepted the situation; because there was no way it could go on denying that the movement was taking huge proportions. The media could no longer be against it.<eos> But they supported the movement in a way that wouldn't hurt their interests.<eos> That's exactly what Arnaldo Jabor did. One day he said it was vandalism, it was abominable...<eos> They are the violent imitation, of a 50's socialism imitation, that the ancient left still stands for. This middle class insurgents aren't even worth R$ 0,20.<eos> And the other day he says "It's great that they're out on the streets".
Beg pardon?<eos> Investors such as yourself often keep accounts under assumed names.<eos> Cash out in one, sell short in another.<eos> Who'd know better than a senator?<eos> If you assure your partners he's right, that repeal is not possible... They'll bail completely and an hour later Mayflower stock will be in the dumper.
You took the disk, no one else.<eos> I'm not confessing to something I didn't do.<eos> You have to.<eos> Look, we work for killers, men worse than him.<eos> They know where you live, where you work.
And then one day everything changed.<eos> I was the, uh, victim of an armed robbery, and being the coward that I am, I ran.<eos> The shooter got me in the leg.<eos> And I realized the fear I felt in that moment is what so many kids face every day.<eos> I mean, they... they live in war zones.
Where is he?<eos> I don't know, but if he is the mole, he's not here, so I don't care.<eos> What's important is that motor.<eos> These tubes are linked to the airport.<eos> They carry the cash, so we won't have to.
How much cash are we talking?<eos> $500 million.<eos> All that cash, through tubes?<eos> These tubes are linked to the airport.<eos> They carry the cash so we won't have to.
Corner office.<eos> You really must like me.<eos> Don't get too excited.<eos> You know, the last two partners that had this office didn't survive the year.<eos> Then it's a good thing I'm much better than they were.
You want to dance?<eos> No.<eos> I never want to dance.<eos> I'm actually really bad at it, but I'm trying to make a point.<eos> There's more to life than the pain that they made you feel.
I could get anything I wanted, but I couldn't practice witchcraft.<eos> So I charmed some witches, and I taught them a new kind of magic that I learned in Arabia called Kemiya.<eos> We made items that allowed me to use magic without doing magic.<eos> You taught them how to make dark objects.<eos> Yeah, and for a time, they were scattered all around the city.
What happens now?<eos> Gaines: I need Nate to come in, I need him to I.D. these guys, and he's got to be willing to testify if it goes that far.<eos> All right, I'll talk to him.<eos> And here's the other thing.<eos> They're gonna try and intimidate you, so if anybody shows up at your gym, shows up at your house...
Ten minutes to go!<eos> Soldiers are starting to gather, guys.<eos> Look out on the horizon.<eos> Here they come!<eos> They're coming!
Gone. You're an orphan?<eos> It happened about a year ago.<eos> My hometown was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them.<eos> I was so scared, but they told me not to worry.<eos> They would protect me.
My brother, yes, we need not march, but... at least marshal our forces.<eos> We must prepare.<eos> In this, you must not fail.<eos> Gather your generals.<eos> Speak to them as warriors and they will follow you past the gates of death.
It's bubbling with microscopic activity.<eos> At every point in the quantum vacuum, tiny, innocuous pairs of matter and antimatter particles are popping in and out of existence.<eos> They exist for a split-second before annihilating each other.<eos> There are billions of billions of billions of billions and -- let's stop, we can continue -- of pairs in the metacube of the quantum vacuum.<eos> So they must play a role in theory of gravity.
All right.<eos> You look incredible. Mwah!<eos> I'm so lucky to have you and Micah and the CMA's in my life!<eos> So... Have you talked to Micah's grandparents yet?<eos> I mean, they must have some idea where Kiley is.
Good.<eos> if we can increase the blood flow and get you to the hospital fast, the damage to your heart should still be reversible.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm not having any chest pains.<eos> Look, women typically have more subtle, non-classic symptoms like the ones you've been experiencing, and they can all be exacerbated by stress, which I now realize you have in spades.
You got a better way?<eos> We should probably put the screws on these guys.<eos> Get the intel we need, then dump 'em.<eos> Because we're going nowhere with that one.<eos> We cut 'em loose, they know this land. They'll be to the tug before we know it.
It's Benoit Nshombo.<eos> That dictator.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> I talked to Interpol.<eos> He's a suspect in several murders, and they all lead back to Nshombo.
Soon our family will be one more British dynasty with all the same prejudices as everyone else who shops at Harrods!<eos> Any children will be brought up to know both sides of their heritage.<eos> Your children will not be Jewish!<eos> Don't you understand that?<eos> Their mother will not be Jewish and neither will they!
Oh. Well, then come or don't.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe you're sore.<eos> Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.<eos> But they throw an actual ball.
You can't go back.<eos> Why not?<eos> The war's over.<eos> It's not over, it's a cease fire.<eos> Our country's weak, so other countries came in, and now they fight and divide us up as they please.
- Boys are the hardest.<eos> - Boys are the hardest.<eos> - They are.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, because they...
Where are you going?<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> My father.<eos> He said it's where the crusaders hid from Saladin.<eos> Okay, so they don't have this in America.
Don't say that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why does she deserve to live any more than any of us?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Because they are making us crazy!
"no, enough,"<eos> won't there be blood on my hands no matter how far away I run?<eos> Are you asking my permission to stay?<eos> I look at those boys.<eos> They died for their brother.
Who will take care of them?<eos> - Ziad:<eos> You have neighbors.<eos> - Baba!<eos> They will keep an eye out.
No way.<eos> Why would I risk my life for a bunch of strangers?<eos> Because Kanan risked his for you.<eos> If all you do is fight for your own life, then your life is worth nothing.<eos> They need you, Ezra.
No, no way.<eos> Why would I risk my life for a bunch of strangers?<eos> Because Kanan risked his for you.<eos> If all you do is fight for your own life, then your life is worth nothing.<eos> They need you, Ezra.
I hope the rats aren't deserting the ship, Meredith.<eos> His illness was weighing heavy upon him, sir.<eos> He knew there was no hope.<eos> Warriors make bad invalids.<eos> But they make good Turkeys, sir.
I hate those guys.<eos> I never wanted to help them in the first place.<eos> They forced me to.<eos> How?<eos> I have... you know, a bit of a record back home that they used against me.
Easy.<eos> That brings us back to the missing piece of the puzzle -- where the skitters are clustered near that church.<eos> Looks like all the answers are right there.<eos> I could have taken those guys.<eos> Oh, there's nothing I would have liked better than to see you get your ass kicked. They had knives, and they thought that we were partners.
I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, if you're not up to it, we don't have to go out, we can just hang here.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's not that big a deal.<eos> As long as they're happy, I'm happy.
Ugh, I can't believe I just did that for you.<eos> We're even.<eos> I did this for the Espheni race.<eos> These humans...<eos> They betrayed me.
Otherwise, you are not here.<eos> I'm worried about the price we'll have to pay for either side to win.<eos> There's a book I-I read about apartheid in South Africa.<eos> A white man says about the blacks,<eos> "my greatest fear" "is that by the time we have come to love," "they will have come to hate."
Nicky, here's a corner piece.<eos> It's amazing you remember.<eos> So, Nick, how come you lived here?<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> They, uh... they died in an accident when I was 12.
You see, before you walked in, I'd made a phone call to somebody who I think you should meet.<eos> Before I tell you who that is, I want to tell you a little story about three circus clowns... triplets, actually...<eos> I met them on the Orient Express.<eos> Now, the funny thing about these clowns is that they didn't know that they were triplets.<eos> They didn't know each other.
We may have something here.<eos> Software's on the planes.<eos> They use a duplicate copy to communicate with the tower.<eos> Now, if they took off before this morning's update, like a flight from<eos> Australia or New Zealand, they'll still have the bug-free software on board.
Right now, if you want my help, then let me make the calls and see if I can't get this done for you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I know he thinks he's helping, but we don't have time for bureaucracy right now.<eos> Happy, if I hack you into the DOT, can you manipulate the traffic signals?<eos> They're on standard sequencers;
Yes.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> If I may interrupt, dear...<eos> As you know, I repeatedly tell the girls that, when solving crimes, we must never forget the cardinal truth about murderers...<eos> They often overlook the obvious.
Well, having looked at things, I think, probably, the answer to that is no.<eos> ~ He always says that.<eos> He's really clever. ~ Oh, yes, I am very clever.<eos> But what use is clever against trees?<eos> They don't listen to reason.
Did you like my shoes?<eos> What?<eos> - But are wearing slippers!<eos> Did you like my shoes?<eos> They are fine..
They are fine..<eos> 'What a strange person'!<eos> Tell me the truth..<eos> aren't they too bright and gawdy?<eos> But they don't look like shoes at all?
But they don't look like shoes at all?<eos> They are slippers..<eos> called flip-flops in America!<eos> No!<eos> They are fine..
Waiting for the Indians.<eos> Thanks for meeting us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, boys, this is a friendly conversation. So we all just relax, right?<eos> They'll relax when I tell them to.
Jordi, I admire your courage.<eos> Balls.<eos> I prefer balls.<eos> I don't work like this, all right?<eos> So go home to your original doctors, and they'll take good care of you.
Wait, how much havoc?<eos> If it is dragons, until there is no more havoc to be wreaked.<eos> Just exactly as I left it.<eos> Yeah, about that...<eos> Eastern dragons, oh, you never know which side of the subterranean bed they're gonna wake up on.
60%. 65% at most.<eos> It's not too late, you know.<eos> You can still join me.<eos> The conclave is over, Mr. Dulaque.<eos> Of course, our sides have always been chosen for us, haven't they?
You think I'm being paranoid.<eos> But I know what's in this case.<eos> And I know what my employers would do to get it back!<eos> Like monitoring police cameras?<eos> If it's connected to a computer somewhere, they can see everything that you do, anywhere that you go.
This sounds like a movie script.<eos> I started my story as an orphan..<eos> And by interval, my parents appear miraculously"<eos> My parents didn't want me.. so they offered me.. ..to the God..<eos> They decided on their own..
Devotees come to Vittha_BAR_'s temple to meet their mother God.<eos> And there, I was living with Vitthal, in his temple.. ...like an orphan.<eos> Still I saw my parents in Vitthal-Rakhumai.<eos> So what if they are stone idols?<eos> At least they were always there for me.
What nonsense is all this?<eos> How dare you enter my house?<eos> Sangram, you started it all.. ..by burning down their homes.<eos> These poor villagers need a shelter during the monsoons..<eos> They will stay here until you build their houses.
I'm off the clock, Manny.<eos> I...<eos> I know, bro, I know.<eos> There's been some trouble, Rush.<eos> Some business associates of mine, they...
Grandfather, why couldn't you have taken that?<eos> Why couldn't you have taken that wall?<eos> My Emperor, these men are all that remain of the Red Lotus.<eos> Traitors within the kingdom determined to undermine the Emperor's mission, determined to destroy the Emperor and his dynasty.<eos> They are your enemy.
- I cannot.<eos> I know that as well.<eos> I should hide behind my wall?<eos> Take pleasure in the present state?<eos> While away my days and bury myself here when they're done?
Shimon Furst, Israeli banker... died last year in a Tel Aviv hospital.<eos> Next we've got Roland Mercure, French real estate mogul... died six months ago.<eos> And Nigel Adams, presumed victim of a cardiac infection three months ago in London.<eos> Thing is, none of these guys were at Davos.<eos> But they were, along with our other victims, investors in...
Thank you.<eos> The Internet was working this morning, but now it says, "4935 fail."<eos> No, I don't know what that means.<eos> It means my friends are at top shop, and I'm here at the fun-pocalypse.<eos> They're playing without me.
What else do I need to know?<eos> We need to thoroughly rattle-test all our work down to the last data point.<eos> - Check all the math...<eos> - We're through the design phase.<eos> You make these boys backtrack, they will hang you by your slide rule.
There's only one contributor:<eos> whoever stole the virus.<eos> I'll call Russell... see if we can commandeer RyneLab's equipment, do a microbial analysis.<eos> So, I cultured the microbial population from the swab...<eos> I spread it over various agars, each formulated to breed particular organisms if they're present.
By all accounts these men and women were ordinary citizens of Vega seeking asylum at a dangerous time.<eos> No different than you.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> You stood in front of the Senate, and you told them...<eos> I told them what they wanted to hear so they wouldn't go after innocent citizens.
I love you a lot.<eos> Please...<eos> Honorable Amélie?<eos> Neighbors I barely knew came to talk to me.<eos> They begged me to go.
They begged me to go.<eos> "Thanks for loving our country, but we Japanese must face our misfortune alone."<eos> I was beaten.<eos> I didn't speak to your parents.<eos> They didn't want you to.
Lourdes was begging for her life, and it looks almost as if she's enjoying it.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> I'm not gonna stop!<eos> This is our daughter!<eos> Those monsters, they took control of her, they're to blame.
They're in New York.<eos> Probably bunked up in some fleabag hotel, but they're fine.<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Now, some men from the government are asking questions.<eos> - They...
It was too late for me.<eos> I was already inside it.<eos> And Gemma... she had plans.<eos> It's not too late for my boys.<eos> I promise, they will never know this life of chaos.
Here's your earpiece.<eos> - Arpiece. - Let's go find his car.<eos> The laboratories have disease samples, Walter.<eos> Like the plague.<eos> They have the actual plague.
I need to keep in mind that one teaspoon equals roughly four grams of sugar.<eos> But I also need a lesson in the different types of sugar.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time to meet the sugar family.<eos> When we eat certain foods, they adhere to a rule.<eos> They break down to glucose which our body uses for fuel.
Well, it started with Muddy.<eos> Muddy Waters was our Beatles or Rolling Stones.<eos> Muddy was the magnet, and one by one, they came to Chicago.<eos> I went to Chicago, September 25, 1957.<eos> That's when the season had changed, and birds, they was getting the hell out of there as well, and I'm coming this way. And I look up and I said,

And I look up and I said,<eos> "The birds got more damn sense than I got."<eos> You know, they going where the weather suits their clothes, you know?
We bought this building in December of 1995.<eos> Carpentry and construction was done by a crew that we assembled, a very small number of actual professional tradesmen.<eos> Like this...<eos> This room is a pretty good example.<eos> Some of the adobe was laid by professional masons and you can see that they have...
Punk rock was our scene even though we were so fucking young.<eos> The first guest today got together and formed a band, four young folks from Evanston.<eos> They call their group Verboten.<eos> They're going to play an original song they wrote called My Opinion.<eos> And now here they are, Verboten.
Don't make it too spicy.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> What time are the "criminals" are coming?<eos> Don't joke about such things...<eos> you know they love you.
The men in Vega are no different than anywhere else, too arrogant to consider the notion that they're being deceived.<eos> Still, if they found out who you really are, they'd string you up in the town square.<eos> You'd be the most beautiful martyr the cradle has ever seen.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> They think they have Evelyn's head on a pillow.
Yes, I do.<eos> So, what-- the DNA was planted, another part of the game?<eos> Catch me if you can?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> And if they're not?
Okay, look, fellas, we don't want any trouble.<eos> If you don't want any trouble, what are they doing here?<eos> - What, these guys?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're here to protect me.
I do apologize.<eos> I'm the one who's sorry.<eos> I made things so difficult for the soldiers that came to rescue me.<eos> After the virus came, There were many stories of men in suits like that with guns.<eos> We heard that they came to kill the sick people, not to rescue them.
- Alright, that's enough.<eos> - Mr. Masterson just one more question for your time!<eos> Mr. Masterson, please!<eos> Let's assume that the bandits who robbed the bank are in fact the same two who robbed the train.<eos> They match the general description given by the bank manager as well as the surviving guard and the engineer from the train.
How's that?<eos> Oh, I'm young.<eos> I'm in Tokyo.<eos> I'm beating the shit out of a Brazilian dude in front of 15,000 Japanese people.<eos> They're screaming my name like I'm a fucking God.
- It's cold medicine and soda.<eos> A guest left a stack of tabloids by the pool.<eos> I flipped through them, and I kept seeing rappers getting in trouble for purple drank, going nuts on the stuff.<eos> I thought, "well, this shit must be good."<eos> And why should they have all the fun, right?

You didn't send that search team out, did you?<eos> Those men were crucified.<eos> That's a warning I intend to take very seriously.<eos> We'll search high and low for the missing kids, you have my word, but not before we've secured this camp.<eos> They tortured John Murphy.
The men in Vega are no different than anywhere else, too arrogant to consider the notion that they're being deceived.<eos> Still, if they found out who you really are, they'd string you up in the town square.<eos> You'd be the most beautiful martyr the Cradle has ever seen.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> They think they have Evelyn's head on a pillow.
I'm nobody's angel.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To the bus.<eos> - I can't, not without the kids.<eos> - They're coming.
That's got to be the dumbest piece of police work<eos> I have ever heard of.<eos> Mission accomplished, doc.<eos> Yeah, these little fellas are just starting to sober up.<eos> They were rolling pretty hard on the "H" train.
You've simply forgotten.<eos> I wouldn't forget someone like you.<eos> Like me.<eos> The magic of the rock trolls.<eos> They pull memories.
I wouldn't forget someone like you.<eos> Like me.<eos> The magic of the rock trolls.<eos> They pull memories.<eos> They did quite a number on you, I'm afraid.
He been collecting parts for project many months from zoo cemetery... harbor... and less savory places.<eos> He find creatures, mutants, cobbled together.<eos> Him poised to finally give life to creation.<eos> But much to Baron Von Dinkensteint chagrin... the villagers became apprised of what he was about to do.<eos> They feared the worst, that such a creature, assembled from parts discarded... would not know compassion or empathy... and have only the capacity for wanton destruction.
Bye, Grandpa!<eos> I wonder if I'll ever see them again?<eos> I'll pay for their schooling.<eos> Charles will visit.<eos> And when they're old enough, they'll decide where they want to be.
Rebecca. How's the little guy?<eos> Dr. Rush, I'm bleeding.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, well, just let your doctors know what's going on, okay?<eos> They'll take care of you at the hospital.
The papers said it was a robbery.<eos> The robbery may have been staged to hide the killer's true intentions.<eos> We have reason to believe that Mr. Grady - knew his attacker.<eos> - We'll be speaking with all your employees.<eos> Is there anything you care to tell us before they do?
Could modern-day superheroes like Batman and Iron Man be the true realization of what our ancestors were describing when they wrote about powerful gods and heroes?<eos> Was Hercules' great strength the result of a robotic exoskeleton?<eos> Could Hermes' power of flight have been inspired by something like a modern jet pack or gliding suit?<eos> And could Zeus' lightning bolts have used electrical coils to generate extraordinarily large voltages?<eos> The ancient people simply used the vernacular of the time to express what they were seeing, and as far as they were concerned, this could only be the work of a supreme being.
Why did they attack us?<eos> Was it really them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sometimes the vengeful spirits, when they can't get their revenge... tend to turn into evil spirits because of their anger.<eos> So are you saying that they've become evil spirits?
Where are you going?<eos> The Lamb.<eos> Norma Hankin is too stupid to do you any harm.<eos> It's the men looking into their pint pots, muttering darkly.<eos> They're the danger.
Uh, yes, before the gunmen entered, there were two men, baseball caps, casing the money cart.<eos> So, we know the masked men entered through the main lobby.<eos> The odd thing is, the exterior cameras didn't see them leaving.<eos> No sign at all.<eos> They could still be in the casino?
So after careful consideration, I decided the best thing for him to do is to go out of his freakin' mind.<eos> That doesn't sound like anger management.<eos> Hey, don't misunderstand the word "Management."<eos> Boxers have managers.<eos> They still go around hitting people.
And you think, what, I'm not supposed to see my color?<eos> Do you think that I just blend in?<eos> I have to work harder.<eos> I have to be smarter.<eos> I have to be special because they see me as different.
I want to have a baby, start a family.<eos> SHARON: Britt,don'truinagood night.<eos> Stayoffyourphone.<eos> Bloggers are still saying Iwasdifficult onthesetof" TheCaller".<eos> They fired me.
I thought we swore off looking at the online trash.<eos> Comeon.<eos> How are those cramps, baby?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> What? They're saying I've been replaced on Happy Feet Two .
(Sighs) Besides, if I were gonna do an adult film, it would be in Renaissance Italy and I would be assistant to Michelangelo, who just got in a big fight with the Pope...<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just made porn dull.<eos> All right, I'm just gonna be straight with the guys and ask them not to talk.<eos> They don't want to lose the group, either.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay?<eos> I'm not saying 'cause they look the same.
Ignorant.<eos> Please.<eos> Do you know what's going on here?<eos> What are the producers trying to do?<eos> They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant.
Why didn't you tell me, Stan?<eos> I would have helped.<eos> It just all seemed so stupid.<eos> I'll call the producers of the show.<eos> They'll help you find your dad.
Randy, where are you going?<eos> They've got Stan! Just stay here with Michael Jackson.<eos> Shit! All right, listen up.<eos> We believe this is where the black people are.<eos> They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them.
How did you... were you gonna tell me about your inner demons, or was I gonna find out when you cut my air-hose supply in a supposed diving accident on our honeymoon?<eos> You think we're gonna get married?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Ten years ago I drove to Oakland to see my chargers play, and when I walked out of the stadium, these two raiders fans were dumping mustard on the hood of my white jetta.<eos> So I complained to the cops, also raiders fans, it turns out, because the second I started, they cuffed me, booked me, and dumped out all of my zima, which was like a case.
He has a funeral home in Bay Ridge.<eos> Taking some quests here and there.<eos> He will not take the fly.<eos> These guys are some fucking dinosaurs.<eos> We live in a new age, and they are practically extinct.
- Got any friends pretty as you, nursey?<eos> - Go!<eos> Make the most of it, we've got an hour.<eos> Your friends are funny.<eos> They think they are.
- Go!<eos> Make the most of it, we've got an hour.<eos> Your friends are funny.<eos> They think they are.<eos> They care about you, I can tell.
One of the medics said there is a convent not far from here.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'll write to my parents, you can stay there.<eos> I don't even know them.<eos> They will love you, just like I do.
I know it's not the outcome you had hoped for, but this compromise... may have prevented a lot of bloodshed.<eos> It may have even stopped a war.<eos> My parents believed a new asylum would bring hope to Gotham.<eos> Now that's gone.<eos> Everything they worked for is now falling into the hands of criminals.
I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.<eos> Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.<eos> It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn't exist in the real world.<eos> The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.<eos> Yeah, but every time I come back here they...
I looked up to you every day of my life.<eos> You're my dad.<eos> You're supposed to be... you're gonna tell them everything you know.<eos> I gave 'em Beck's cell phone.<eos> They didn't even know whose girl they had.
We have a possible breach.<eos> Prep all classified documents and ciphers for immediate incineration, and get ready to crash your hard drives.<eos> This is not a drill.<eos> What can I do?<eos> If we got bad guys in the building, they're gonna want this.
So you're feeling better.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Why... why were your men following me?<eos> They weren't.<eos> You said they brought me here.
Miss Ember?<eos> Anita, have you seen the tops to my yellow silk...?<eos> Anita?<eos> Ember Copley was supposed to meet her parents tonight at 9:00 at the marina.<eos> When she didn't show, they came back, found the maid out cold, Ember gone.
You think I didn't see it tremoring the whole flight out?<eos> Your symptoms are getting worse.<eos> Did the rest of the team see it?<eos> No.<eos> They're good.
Over.<eos> Hey guys, I need you to get back to us.<eos> It's time for our 8 p.m. signal check.<eos> What are you wasting time for?<eos> You said yourself they'd be fine.
And I don't blame you for not wanting to sell Ray your mine.<eos> Because you don't know what his plans are.<eos> The thing about Ray is, he's not... businessman.<eos> Businessmen make deals.<eos> They make money.
That's the guy, Santa, that's obliterated Jesus.<eos> Jesus is gone!<eos> The reason for the season is Santa Claus! What the kids are saying all across the world is not,<eos> "I'm so excited to celebrate the birth of Jesus!"<eos> No, they're saying, "I'm so excited"
He's just preying on them.<eos> Yeah, well, suckers make easy prey.<eos> They're not suckers.<eos> They're just not jaded like you.<eos> They're still searching for the magic in their lives.
It's a waste of time.<eos> Every person, package and piece of equipment was searched prior to boarding, and nothing from outside is allowed in.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's a billion-dollar sociological experiment, right?<eos> There have been ancillary benefits, and they underwrite the program, but Ascension has always been about more.
You seem to have a special way with them.<eos> Brother, you don't know the half of it.<eos> Come on, Murphy.<eos> No one wants to hear your war stories.<eos> They asked.
You come to me.<eos> Who are you really threatening here?<eos> I really don't need to hear all this.<eos> You don't want to hear about the state's attorney's threats?<eos> They're not relevant to my report.
Calm down, Betty.<eos> I'm just going off to play paintball.<eos> This is where it starts.<eos> As a culture, we teach our children to be violent. No, no, no.<eos> They don't have to be taught.
I mean, everything I have is gone, but if I can't get back to work, then I'm gonna lose my job, too.<eos> Melissa, there are programs available for the sole purpose of helping... homeless veterans.<eos> Well, I'm not homeless.<eos> I'm... it's only temporary.<eos> They will get you into real, dependable housing, then after that, everything else is that much easier.
Look, sometimes I feel like what I do on Sundays is work, too.<eos> But many so-called laws in the Old Testament are ancient laws for a bygone time.<eos> Thankfully, the Resurrection gave us the new covenant that led us out of the darkness and into the light.<eos> You know, I think you have the opportunity to take us all out of dark times where gays and lesbians are shunned and bring them into the full light of God's love.<eos> You know, blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the ones that shall be known as the children of God.
I'm on fire right now.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm gettin' it!<eos> I'm blending in.<eos> They're accepting me as one of their own.

It was an accident... and a horrible one.<eos> Anyone there could tell you the same, except Emily, of course.<eos> Who else was there?<eos> My friends from the Hamptons, Amanda's from work.<eos> I wonder what they might say.
I have my reasons.<eos> Wendy runs friends of fielding.<eos> It's a group of moms that raise money for that rich magnet school that I want Henry and Izzy to go to.<eos> It's a rich magnet school.<eos> I think they're done raising money.
11-year-olds know best.<eos> I wanted to be a ninja cheerleader.<eos> Mom should've bought me that sword.<eos> Okay, so, you know better... living in your sister's house rent-free with your book friends.<eos> Ah, da, da. They have names.
- My special moment, it was... - [Cellphone beeps] - ...was, uh...<eos> It's hard... it's... honestly, it's hard to distill it down to a moment.<eos> There were so many... Singular... sensations.<eos> You guys ever seen "A Chorus Line"?<eos> Th-the dancers get in a line, and they've got hats and they're kicking and...
Yeah.<eos> I mean, I didn't think you would.<eos> I'm probably barking up the wrong tree, anyway.<eos> Mm. Are you hungry?<eos> They make a decent cheese omelet.
Let's get a little sound going.<eos> Who the fuck are these kids?<eos> Oh, well, let me get this straight.<eos> The girl's name is Shayna Smith and the boy's name is Clarence Boyd.<eos> They were the kids in the accident.
And to be back home and to see my beautiful wife.<eos> Okay, can you not rub in the wife part?<eos> Quit breaking up with your girlfriend.<eos> - Ah! - I won't miss the mosquitoes.<eos> Yeah, well, they'll miss me.
But, at the same time, there's... I do think they're limited for the moment.<eos> I agree, and I mean, I had kinda time to set a stage where we all enjoy at least a minimum level of protection, you know, no matter who we are, who's involved in this,<eos> you know, you're either a journalist, or you're either out of jurisdiction, so we have some time to play this before they can really get nasty.<eos> I think it's over, you know, the weeks when they have times, to get lawyers really sort of go, "This is a special situation.<eos> How can we interpret this to our advantage?" We... we see them do this all the time, you know, whether it's drones or wiretapping or whatever, they'll go, "Well according to this law from the 1840s, you know, with X, Y, or Z authority..."
She sacrificed herself for me.<eos> She loved you so much, and so do I.<eos> I'm so glad you're back.<eos> I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.<eos> They... they have reached the roads?
No, that's not why I had it.<eos> Really? Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?<eos> Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.<eos> I found it with a man that our parents sought out.<eos> They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
- How? Because I am your mother and I said so.<eos> So let me do the worrying.<eos> You just focus on getting better, okay? Dash: Whoa.<eos> When's the last time you flexed your jaw muscles? Yeah, why aren't you eating with your rexo friends over there?<eos> They're not my friends.
So I get it: You need to make some extra money on the side.<eos> It started small.<eos> I snuck in some pot brownies for an inmate with migraines.<eos> He told two friends.<eos> They told two friends...
You know, having sex all the time.<eos> The whole building can hear them.<eos> We can look into that.<eos> Let's talk inside.<eos> Well, they're not home right now.
Not yet.<eos> And you should know that you're not alone.<eos> Our friends from the relevant side are in the building.<eos> Which means Central Command will be running op-sec from a remote location.<eos> If you see us, so will they.
You haven't mentioned any.<eos> Did you kill them all?<eos> Just want to ask that up front.<eos> - Of course I have friends.<eos> They're...
Tell me what's going on, coulson.<eos> Degenerative effects.<eos> They're unstable.<eos> [ echoing ] they're getting worse every day.<eos> They're getting worse every day.
♪ The kid is back, he's back on track ♪<eos> ♪ And there goes my hero ♪<eos> ♪ He's an underdog he's coming out on top, and ♪<eos> [Applause]<eos> Man, snowflakes look much lighter than they are.
I'm good.<eos> Health is the most important subject on Earth.<eos> Yes, it is important.<eos> 'Cause you know kids, they're always wanting to have sex with each other.<eos> They don't know that it just feels good for a second and then you're sad.
Objection.<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> We have seen that you are a very gifted actress.<eos> How do expect these boys or this jury to know the difference?<eos> I didn't want what they did to me.
High-tech prison.<eos> Inmates had morning exercise;<eos> when they called line-up, they were gone.<eos> No tunnels, no compromised fences, gone.<eos> They want you to determine how they beat their state-of-the-art security.
And this is a wireless transmitter that's been spliced into it.<eos> The escaped cons worked maintenance duty?<eos> Moved about freely?<eos> Cons with privileges can move about during specific periods during the day.<eos> Including work detail and morning PT, when they broke out.
Stop it!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I know I've said this before, but not good.<eos> Stay down.<eos> They don't see us.
No, but she may as well have sent an e-vite to the unsub.<eos> She regularly checked in at a foursquare location which she tagged at her home named Harris Ranch.<eos> Did she mention anything online about her parents being away?<eos> Uh... She said they grounded her, left with the car.<eos> Looks like she was asking her subscribers to send her video ideas, ways to wreak havoc while they were away.
We've been pushed out.<eos> ~ What?<eos> Why?<eos> ~ Do you remember I told you about the rogues?<eos> Well, these are they.
Yeah, I know that place.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, I finished my list of pros and cons.<eos> I have 75 pros and 86 super-pros.<eos> I don't have any cons, 'cause it just seems so negative, and they all tried so hard.
Hold on.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My nephews are gonna come visit the house next shift.<eos> Hmm, that's exciting news, apparently.<eos> Oh, they get to see me drive the truck.
Thank you, that's all I'm asking.<eos> All right, thanks, Duke.<eos> H.P.D. ran our vic, Henry Chun.<eos> No criminal record and according to friends and family, - he wasn't having trouble with anyone.<eos> - That they know of.
A mother and her four kids.<eos> I wasn't taking any chances with my men.<eos> - You didn't even fire a warning shot.<eos> - You've led men in battle.<eos> You know how it is, you hesitate, they die.
Did you ever have to kill anyone?<eos> No.<eos> - So you've never killed anyone?<eos> - Rambo, shut up or you'll be the first.<eos> There they are.
And there's a limited supply.<eos> I know about the bones under the factory,<eos> Whatever you think you know, agent bellamy, is in the past.<eos> It will stay in the past.<eos> They were victims of a fire at your family's factory.
I know about the bones under the factory,<eos> Whatever you think you know, agent bellamy, is in the past.<eos> It will stay in the past.<eos> They were victims of a fire at your family's factory.<eos> They returned and were murdered.
What?<eos> Who?<eos> W-who's telling you all this?<eos> You should meet these friends of mine.<eos> They know all about this stuff.
But Sam, Sam, listen to me, OK?<eos> Look, down there, that's England.<eos> Right?<eos> It's home.<eos> Now these guys, they might be French, but they know what they're doing.
I know.<eos> I feel it, too.<eos> I mean, I'm crazy about you.<eos> I'm crazy about you, too, but just, you know, not in that way.<eos> And you deserve what they have.
How did you even get up there?<eos> Well, the tree trimmers were doing their thing at 6:00 A.M., so I confronted them.<eos> They quickly surrounded me, and then I ran up the ladder to get away.<eos> Sure.<eos> But they outsmarted me by removing it.
Spy mode, remember?<eos> (tires screeching)<eos> (roaring)<eos> You said these robots were big.<eos> Captain america: They don't have to be big to be a threat.
If we veered off his path, he just beat us into submission with the strap, belt, or whatever else he had handy.<eos> Is that why you're doing all this?<eos> 'Cause of what he did to you?<eos> I'm doing these boys a favor.<eos> Doing what they can't do.
I know it.<eos> But it's still upsetting, so I'm just...<eos> I'm gonna go see my sister.<eos> And you just stay here handcuffed where you can't hurt anybody... but me... with your words.<eos> My parents... that's not who they are.
- Stop, please!<eos> I have something for you, Henry.<eos> - No!<eos> - Just in case you feel like you're going to cry again. The club members making requests are watching all over the world.<eos> And they're... they're paying through encrypted links?
We'll think about it.<eos> In the meanwhile, I'm gonna send you to the tombs and let you think about your options.<eos> People get a lot of clarity there.<eos> So I followed up with child services.<eos> They located Henry's actual parents.
Fliers are?<eos> Ugh! There's got to be a better way.<eos> Whoa! I thought you were gonna be David Blaine!<eos> These damn fliers!<eos> I'm telling you, they're a fire hazard.
But you said that there was another way to get him.<eos> I submit that his undoing lies not in the physical evidence, but in the necessary evil of every business in the service industry.<eos> Customers.<eos> He wouldn't give them up.<eos> But they might give him up.
Kirk just loves his keyboards.<eos> I never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.<eos> Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.<eos> What if all the dads jammed together in a dad band?<eos> That way they would play their horrible music in one garage at a time.
While we are on that subject, if I were you, I'd work on that out loud reading time, too.<eos> Uh, what does that mean?<eos> I mean your two little princes over there are a little bit behind the eight ball on their basic reading skills.<eos> When my kids were young, I worked 60 hours a week and I read all the Harry Potter books to them, out loud.<eos> They read a page, I read a page.
I didn't fall in love with the music till I went to a go-go when I was like 15, 16 and then like, saw it.<eos> And I'm like,<eos> "Now, like, I completely understand everything."<eos> Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers come on, all these kids start comin' from out of nowhere.<eos> Before they can hit one note, they goin',
I remember when I was 14 or 15, seeing a piece on the Bad Brains on the local, like, news magazine show.<eos> And they showed H.R. doing backflips on the stage.<eos> And I was like, "Wow.<eos> Who the fuck are these guys?"<eos> They started playing in Madam's Organ, which was this hippie commune on 18th Street.
He's in the back yard, like...<eos> And he's jumping around and dancing around.<eos> I mean, you just have to wonder what the neighbors made of this.<eos> You can't hear it on the "Black Dots" record, but I have this other version where you can actually hear the kids going like, "What's going on here?"<eos> Like, then they'd cheer and stuff.
I couldn't imagine being the drummer of Scream.<eos> I was just in that moment, jamming with my heroes.<eos> When he abruptly left to join Scream,<eos> I understood why Dave did it.<eos> Besides the fact that they were his heroes, he just wanted to tour and go out.
I forgot, I did write that!<eos> Forgot!<eos> Okay, Carol.<eos> This is an easy one for a history buff like Tom... time travel.<eos> I like dogs, I want to know why they don't like me.
We're being pursued by two vehicles at Logan and Fulton."<eos> Central calls back, and she said,<eos> "Give me a description of the car you're chasing."<eos> I said, "Negative."<eos> I said, "They're chasing us."
two tours in Iraq, KIA in 2008.<eos> Parents say, after his brother passed away, he fell into a depression, never pulled out of it.<eos> - Oh, poor kid.<eos> - He's been off his meds and homeless the last six months.<eos> FBI negotiators say that, as far as they can tell, he's here to protest what he sees as a slippery slope back to engagement in Iraq.
You know, the first part of the ceremony is slow dirge music. Back in the day it was more like marching bands.<eos> They were real uniform and polished.<eos> We're talking before integration here, when the black cemeteries was way out of town.<eos> They'd play solemn music.<eos> When they "cut the body loose," as they called it, and turned back around, the band would crank up.
How do we stop nothing?<eos> Same way we stop everything.<eos> By smashing it!<eos> We're taking the fight to that thing.<eos> Null: You may have faced your fears, But now they will consume you!
I mean, everything I have is gone, but if I can't get back to work, then I'm gonna lose my job, too.<eos> Melissa, there are programs available for the sole purpose of helping... homeless veterans.<eos> Well, I'm not homeless.<eos> I'm... it's only temporary.<eos> They will get you into real, dependable housing, then after that, everything else is that much easier.
Why?<eos> How bad does this have to get?<eos> I guess we're gonna find out.<eos> Those bones from the river, they were victims of a fire at your family's factory.<eos> They returned and were murdered.
They call him "the Green Machine".<eos> Hey, Harder Baby Harder!<eos> Came back for sloppy seconds?<eos> My betting days are over. What do you know about Beautiful Becky's owners?<eos> Rich yuppies. They, uh, got into racing after one visit to the track.
My betting days are over. What do you know about Beautiful Becky's owners?<eos> Rich yuppies. They, uh, got into racing after one visit to the track.<eos> - We call 'em hobby horsers!<eos> - Do you see 'em around?<eos> I haven't seen 'em in months. They, uh...
Yes, and those parents responded appropriately.<eos> Has anyone here ever seen my boys bully Zoey?<eos> They do it when no one is looking.<eos> That's the level of deviance we're dealing with here that you are ignoring.<eos> They don't belong in that class and you need to take some responsibility.
As for the apology, Zoey, would you do the honors?<eos> Sorry!<eos> My kids might be a handful.<eos> Two handfuls even.<eos> But they are not bullies. And they do not lie.
Nice place. Do you have, like, roommates or something?<eos> No, this is just... just me.<eos> No. Kidding. I have roommates.<eos> I could never afford this place.<eos> But they're asleep, my roommates.
You have to come immediately, and you have to come in an ambulance."<eos> So I had to call the ambulance, and I thought, "Oh, my God."<eos> But God was good, and they sent me the two most delicious guys.<eos> They were big hunks, but they were so sweet and so kind.<eos> And I explained the situation, and they were, you know, kidding around with Carl and whatnot, and they got me out.
All right, then.<eos> I'll see you when my suspension is lifted.<eos> I've lifted your suspension.<eos> I realize that these kids mean everything to you, but what I didn't know is how much you mean to these kids.<eos> They need you, and, more importantly, I need you.
Is that what he told you?<eos> That's what I know!<eos> You heard it spoken that your master rose up, out of the bonds of slavery...<eos> And it was Simon and Levi who put him there.<eos> They stole Joseph's life from him, as they did mine, and as they did yours.
Exposure?<eos> The bears are designed to present themselves to you.<eos> So if we take you out of town...<eos> Maybe the bears will stop showing up in Haven.<eos> Duke, hey, they're not medically sick.

When we fight, we forgive and forget.<eos> I doubt that Jake's in a very forgiving mood, and trust me, he will never forget.<eos> Jake is not family.<eos> He is to me.<eos> You may love these boys, Olivia, and they may even love you, but they are not your family.
Because there were no humans in this area of Europe 43,000 years ago.<eos> If that's the case, this art was created by Neanderthals, a completely different species.<eos> Just think about that.<eos> Neanderthals were pretty much as capable, mentally, as we are.<eos> So if they'd been given enough time, given the pressures that we humans felt, then there's no reason why they couldn't have developed a civilisation.

Throwing tantrums. "I want this.<eos> Give me that. You don't understand me."<eos> Even if you do understand them, they don't believe that you do.<eos> But not with you, Cynthia.<eos> They know you understand them, therefore they trust you.
What's the place like?<eos> It looks respectable<eos> We need to survey the place first<eos> Why wasn't it done?<eos> They won't go there after a raid They'll wait a bit. They're not stupid
No, I don't.<eos> - Peter: So I'm always the bad guy?<eos> You can't involve them in our personal issues like that, Lou.<eos> It-it's not fair.<eos> They shouldn't have to shoulder that burden.
Well, Sir, Finch hated the telegraph boys, and very likely they hated him as well.<eos> And why was a negative of two men in an illicit embrace in his pocket when he died?<eos> So who do you think took the piece of the negative?<eos> Oh, I don't know, Sir, it could have been any one of them.<eos> They all had access to the bullpen.
I put the device there with my own hands.<eos> You sent my men on a futile hunt!<eos> They found nothing but sawdust and threats!<eos> No, no, that's not... that's not possible.<eos> They lied to me.
Come, let us go.<eos> Run.<eos> As per the law enacted in the year 1942, anyone can enter.. ..the forest and build a house.<eos> But ifyou step on the land marked by land lords..<eos> ..they'll beat and drive us away.
Are those your grades?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Felix! Hey!<eos> Hey, mister, you just don't take off.<eos> - I probably could've handled that better, but one thing is certain, my parents must never see that report card, for if they do, they'll simultaneously crap their pants.
- Well... My parents are on the verge of finding out I've been expelled, so...<eos> - Okay, wait.<eos> - They don't know?<eos> - No.<eos> They are gonna flip when they find out.
He could be working for a foreign agency.<eos> The sushi manager doesn't know anything about him?<eos> No, and the shelters we talked to don't recognize him, either.<eos> But maybe their clients will.<eos> I mean, homeless people don't like to talk to law enforcement, but they do talk to each other.
You don't?<eos> Well, I just figured...<eos> I got to meet the in-laws sooner or later.<eos> I mean, my parents aren't even there.<eos> They go on this carnival cruise thing every year with their friends.
- Really.<eos> - What hospital?<eos> - Chicago Med. - [Coughing]<eos> Your friends didn't waste any time calling your dad, huh?<eos> They know.
We don't... really know the difference.<eos> Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana.<eos> These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards.<eos> And here you got your green mana necromancers... lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue-or black-stacked decks.<eos> You think they're happy?
- YEAH?<eos> KEEP TALKING.<eos> COME ON.<eos> - HER HEADPHONES WERE IN THE BACKSEAT?<eos> - THEY WERE.
- Smoked you, Schultz!<eos> - Congrats, man.<eos> See, that's the thing about soldiers, hunt.<eos> I don't have to push them.<eos> They come wired that way.
Dinner?<eos> Gotta eat.<eos> Gotta eat.<eos> No, I'm not crying in front of my coworkers.<eos> They're in the back.
Your... your secret daughter?<eos> Yeah, she looks a lot like my secret wife.<eos> You know, kids are amazing.<eos> You know? You get to pass all this knowledge down to this little person and-and shape their mind.<eos> Like, you know, how to talk to girls and how to be there for your friends when they need you.
I'm your germophobic billionaire investor.<eos> No, no, no, we are not doing this.<eos> I told the guys anybody but you.<eos> I realize our last endeavor was less than fruitful, but the guys lied and sent me again when they realized you didn't give me a chance to do my stuff.<eos> And also they're criminals and can't be trusted.
He possessed a power cloak called his "pala garment," which means "power garment." He ultimately ascended into the heavens in a whirlwind, like a spacecraft, while wearing this.<eos> So you have to ask, is there some kind of otherworldly or even extraterrestrial technology that Elijah had access to?<eos> Ancient astronaut theorists point out that similar resurrections occur in religions around the world.<eos> From the Hindu god Krishna to the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl.<eos> They believe these gods may, in fact, have been extraterrestrial beings sent to Earth on a mission.
Well, he hates me.<eos> What?<eos> We spent an hour building a sand castle, and all he did was dig a hole.<eos> Who digs holes, Alan?<eos> Prisoners, they want to escape.
Corruption.<eos> For years, I've seen officials on the take.<eos> The Gary brothers, they came to me.<eos> Made an offer.<eos> I keep them and Blue out of prison, they give me a cut.
Animals have just one goal at the end of this journey, to leave offspring. And every one begins its life with an irrepressible instinct to survive and overcome the odds.<eos> The drive and inventiveness of animals is breathtaking.<eos> Every aspect of their behaviour, whether it's spectacular or beautiful or simply extraordinary is their way of meeting a particular challenge.<eos> In this series, we will see animals of all kinds striving to overcome the obstacles that face them at each stage in their lives.<eos> They will be strong.
In this series, we will see animals of all kinds striving to overcome the obstacles that face them at each stage in their lives.<eos> They will be strong.<eos> Cunning.<eos> And ingenious.<eos> They will fight battles.
But now there is a price to pay.<eos> Up here, the five goslings may be safe and warm, but they have nothing to eat and they're getting hungry.<eos> Like their parents, they only eat grass, and to find it the goslings must first get down there, 400 feet below.<eos> But they won't be able to fly for another eight weeks.<eos> So they'll have to jump.
As more and more males join the chase, the mood becomes ever more aggressive.<eos> Now there is a real danger of the calf being injured by flailing tails and crashing bodies.<eos> Eventually, the males become so pre-occupied with fighting each other that the calf and her mother can escape.<eos> Even if a calf gets away unharmed, the ordeal can leave it exhausted.<eos> The dangers from the breeding season will only grow in intensity and some calves will become so weakened that they'll struggle to survive the coming migration.
But there is one more family member to meet, and perhaps the most important of all.<eos> Her father.<eos> Her ultimate defender.<eos> Marauding rival male lions are a constant threat.<eos> If they overthrew him, they would kill all his cubs and father their own.
At last, this pup has arrived.<eos> This secluded waterfall makes for a perfect learners' pool.<eos> In this sanctuary, he can join the local pups to learn manoeuvres that will one day help them escape their enemies.<eos> No-one knows how the first pups found this place, but each year, more and more young seals make the journey.<eos> They're getting a crucial head start in life.
These chicks may jump any time.<eos> Where are the chicks?<eos> Mateo concentrates on trying to film the leaps. While Mark focuses on the front of the cliff for the fall.<eos> The nest is just there above my fingertip.<eos> They've got to go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, till they hit the scree slope below.
Mateo concentrates on trying to film the leaps. While Mark focuses on the front of the cliff for the fall.<eos> The nest is just there above my fingertip.<eos> They've got to go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, till they hit the scree slope below.<eos> That's an incredible fall for anything, let alone a gosling.<eos> It's almost 48 hours since the chicks hatched, so they're really getting to the limit of how long they can go before they start getting too hungry.
They've witnessed the triumph of one of the most extreme survival strategies in nature.<eos> I mean, think how far they've had to come and this is only, what, their third day in the world?<eos> Yeah, it's just great to see them doing what they should be doing now.<eos> Next week on Life Story, animals grow up in the adult world.<eos> They will master complex skills.
But, instead of continuing its search, this small crab settles down to wait.<eos> Other crabs, also looking to upgrade to a bigger home, soon gather whenever a shell washes ashore.<eos> Unfortunately, the new shell is too big for them, too.<eos> Despite that, the gathering crabs begin to measure each other up, and then they do something really rather extraordinary.<eos> They arrange themselves into an orderly queue.
Still too young to join a hunt, the pups have been left at a waterhole while the adults head off over the plains.<eos> The youngsters are already practising their hunting skills.<eos> But they have some way to go.<eos> Not so the adults.<eos> They form a tight pack, stalking to get close to the wildebeest.
Where are the dogs?<eos> It's not quite the start the crew was hoping for.<eos> (God, that was quick.)<eos> The dogs disappear into the grass.<eos> Once they've started running, they go as fast as we could go.
We just need more of a head start than we had this morning, or jet packs!<eos> Over the following days, it becomes clear that chasing after the dogs isn't the way forward.<eos> Perhaps trying to get ahead of them during a hunt is a better option.<eos> But that brings its own problems.<eos> It's quite tricky, in that trying to be there when they catch it is incredibly difficult even when it's completely flat and open, you still don't know which way they're going to go.
West, on this side.<eos> Doggies!<eos> The crew can't afford to lose them again.<eos> The only option is to stay as close as possible all through the night.<eos> How close are they, Dennis?
Bloodied and scarred, this bull has held on to his ground and his harem against allcomers.<eos> But it's not over yet.<eos> The rivals keep coming.<eos> This new one looks particularly powerful.<eos> When two bulls are as evenly matched as this, they can trade blows for 20 minutes.
If she is completely wedged, she will drown.<eos> But there is a chance that the rising water could lift her free.<eos> For this breeding season, her obligations as a mother are over.<eos> She will never see her babies.<eos> They won't hatch for another two months and, when they do, they will have to survive without any help from her.
So many females gathered together on this cliff inevitably attract the attention of a rival adult male.<eos> His aim is to defeat Scarface and take over his females.<eos> He leads a group of outcast bachelors into battle.<eos> Scarface spots them.<eos> He has everything to lose because, if the bachelors defeat him, they won't just take his females, they will kill his babies.
When she's not away gathering food, she shades the chick.<eos> And she responds instantly whenever it demands to be fed.<eos> Every day for over three weeks, she brings it dozens of meals.<eos> Her chick never seems to stop eating, or stop growing.<eos> There is another drongo's nest nearby and that has three chicks in it. But they don't look quite the same as hers.
They may be successful parents, but they still have trouble getting the youngsters up in the morning.<eos> There are three generations in this herd, proof of the family's success.<eos> They have found the bones of an old female.<eos> Even the babies are intrigued by these relics of their ancestors.<eos> We can't, of course, know what they're thinking, but there is a delicacy in the way they touch these bones, which suggests that they have some special relevance.
I told your parents I don't smoke anymore and I'm not gonna be a liar.<eos> Then you can eat it.<eos> I'm gonna go get some pot and put it in your damn food.<eos> But your parents will be able to tell that I'm stoned!<eos> No, they won't. Because they're gonna be in the same damn food.
Very impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you know your way around power tools.<eos> You have to blame my brothers.<eos> They were always dragging me into their schemes to make go-karts, road-hockey nets...
I'll take that under advisement.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> What about you, Alex?<eos> Do you remember hearing the doctors talk when they saved your life?
I mean, those sea scouts were on our fucking boat.<eos> That's your cut.<eos> It won't bite you.<eos> Sure it won't.<eos> They're biting me!
I will never forget that.<eos> Do you need anything from here?<eos> Thanks for asking, they're well.<eos> Andrea is fine, the children...<eos> They grow.
We need to size them and locate them first.<eos> Civilians' lives depend on this.<eos> The damage can increase if we wait.<eos> We're at combat!<eos> They can attack us back.
Grey hair and sleepless nights. It's very rewarding.<eos> I abandoned my friends tonight.<eos> - Isn't that awful?<eos> - Well, It depends on what they did.<eos> - They were trying to cheer me up.
Is that what you told them?<eos> So what's gonna happen when they find out?<eos> I find out tomorrow, when they fly here.<eos> Surprise Christmas trip.<eos> They're coming to see me in my big London show.
They've asked for a day or two to consult the powers that be, but what this means in the short term is that I need you here, ready to jump when they say jump.<eos> Oh, that's great, but I'm on the six o'clock ﬂight.<eos> - Uh, no, cancelled it.<eos> - But the kids, James!<eos> They're expecting me home.
So, you are my little competition, eh?<eos> The underdog versus the champion.<eos> The world loves the underdogs, you know.<eos> The dreamers out there, they need them.<eos> Need to believe that one day, maybe they could achieve the impossible, too.
Oh, sorry.<eos> You're free to leave.<eos> Yes, enjoy yourself while you can.<eos> I'm sure you'll get a visit from some members of the company.<eos> They like to tie up the loose ends.
You could work in the shop.<eos> And you could do the kitchen with the other gals.<eos> Yeah, a couple of guys just quit.<eos> Well, they didn't quit, per se.<eos> They were laid off.
Boss, I was there just for 5 minutes... they only asked me a few things and let me go.<eos> One... How is it my fault... I have done no wrong.<eos> Your fault is that the police have sniffed you now... and your scent can bring them to me.<eos> Two...<eos> Those bastards have tricked me, they have tricked me, boss.
Are you okay?<eos> Daisy's voice: Allergy to wheat can produce a variety of symptoms.<eos> How to be-- fucking loser, fucking loser.<eos> Sorry about the dogs.<eos> They just-- they just get overexcited.
Yes.<eos> Is he one of these men?<eos> No.<eos> It's a gang of thieves.<eos> They use the girl as bait to get into the houses.
He taught me to think global when I was just local.<eos> He made me a wealthy man.<eos> And this guy didn't just have the cartels working for him.<eos> He had the CIA, DEA, everyone in his pocket.<eos> He knew what was going to happen before they did.
Why would Larry inject himself with a paralytic drug?<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> It paralyzes you.<eos> Well, someone did.<eos> My boys down in the lab, they're never wrong.
My soldiers may become a bit crazy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They obey only me!<eos> And I cannot take them with me, so after I go...<eos> They will turn up against each other and anything else they find nearby.
Let's go!" I start to insulted them.<eos> "How you don't understand I offer to you the most important picture in the history of the humanity!<eos> We will change the world! And you are eating...<eos> Eating Big Macs.<eos> And then they stop and they speak with me.
It's an exceptional plane, but over here, never!"<eos> And there I said to myself that we were going to face a lot of problems.<eos> Hollywood prefers ideas which they can relate to things which sound like two other current movies. If you can tell them it's like Jurassic Park crossed with Twilight or, you know The Hobbit crossed with The Killing Fields, it makes more sense.<eos> To come in with something which is more complex which has adult themes and a degree of ambiguity and especially a film which has spiritual and metaphysical ideas is something which has most studios running scared.<eos> They always received us in a very friendly way but it was always the same answer.
Molly, what do you say to parents about Lance?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just saying I would be picked up a mysterious man, and that was it.<eos> So, they do not know he is a player the band?<eos> No, they do not even know he is a musician.
Give daddy your present.<eos> It's a car the little dear has embroidered.<eos> I'm aware that not everyone can see it, but with the heart one can see much, however unimportant that information may be to you.<eos> Would it be all right if I showed the children the whoring bed?<eos> After all, they also have a stake in this event.
Now, we must insist that you don't come inside to the dormitory.<eos> It's a rule that we have here.<eos> It can be very upsetting for the children.<eos> Right.<eos> But they do get over it after a week or so.
The children waved to their father who stood on the poop deck.<eos> He waved back with a small handkerchief.<eos> The ship passed the pier and sailed out to sea.<eos> Their father grew smaller and smaller, but he kept waving.<eos> And so did they, of course.
I just want to give him some<eos> Fine! Give it to him.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's my necklace.<eos> The guys in the van... They
Fine! Give it to him.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's my necklace.<eos> The guys in the van... They<eos> Told me. They know.
I am watching, I am Calculating, I am deducing, and I am learning more every<eos> Maybe the cameras picked Something up, you know?<eos> Those things aren't Think anyone would actually Watch them?<eos> Make some great television.<eos> The guys in the van... They
Set it up and fortify it.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Only shoot on command.<eos> And get rid of the krauts.<eos> They'll start to stink.
The artillery's ready.<eos> Okay, comrades.<eos> You know your positions.<eos> Man your posts.<eos> They'll be here soon.
You've wonderful eyes, Ishkq.<eos> These are so beautiful.. ...they would make anyone forget everything.<eos> Really!<eos> Your eyes are full of love<eos> ...they are saying something to me.
Topic change<eos> I can't believe you've never cried for anyone.<eos> I have.<eos> When my parents got divorced.<eos> But they were so happy, they didn't see my tears.
Hey, you and I, Carl, we've taken very different paths in life.<eos> But we both ended up here.<eos> No, I'm here.<eos> You come and go as you please, see the ones you love.<eos> They see you.
And who says so?<eos> My friends.<eos> Where did you meet them?<eos> What do you care?<eos> They are my friends.
- You go then!<eos> Turn it up a bit.<eos> And days went by.<eos> I wondered what my brother's friends saw in me.<eos> They were living in my house.
- Stretch it sideways and it's ptak-yu. - Ptak-yu.<eos> Because in the jungle every motion counts.<eos> And like this?<eos> The natives don't do that.<eos> They... cross their arms on their chest, bend forward a bit and say:
Here, hold this!<eos> When the bombs and hand grenades go woosh and bang out in the glades<eos> The girls all weep and make a noise for the poor soldier boys<eos> But why?<eos> When they come back from the trenches
He's right!<eos> From now on we only sell our own wine.<eos> And we're not coughing up to feed those layabouts.<eos> Like that fat slob over there!<eos> They don't give a damn whether we live or die.
He knows the consequences.<eos> But he still does it<eos> He target naive girls like<eos> Gropers...<eos> They need to suffer more.
I'm sexually frigid<eos> It hurts.<eos> But I tolerated it<eos> Mess them up completely<eos> They don't know anything
Fuck me.<eos> You stupid pair of bastards.<eos> Look at the fuckin' mess you made, huh?<eos> Now, I gotta clean it up.<eos> They'll fuckin' find us!
- Course I do.<eos> - Well then that's your dream, laddie.<eos> Listen to it, follow it.<eos> All of you.<eos> That's what they did.
Edwards, Charlton, Law, and Best?<eos> - Take a look around you.<eos> The community has come together to cheer on their kids.<eos> Kids whose hearts and minds and dreams are as big as the best.<eos> They're the future of this town.
Maybe it is.<eos> Why is she being nice to them?<eos> She's just identifying with her captors.<eos> It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.<eos> No, she thinks we don't care anymore, and they do.
I know.<eos> The Water Demon you encountered today used to be kind.<eos> One day he was saving a child by the river.<eos> The villagers had mistaken him for a kidnapper.<eos> They killed him and tossed his body into the river feeding his body to the fish and creatures.
Having lived all alone?<eos> Having spent my life with cats?<eos> They have a mania of persecution.<eos> These fine gentlemen pounced on me to seize all my works and let me spend as long as possible in prison.<eos> They are eager to turn this poor woman who'd be for them a living accusation an annoying phantom of their crime.
The thing being closed to them heads, mouthfuls nervous, obtuse . the light closed forever...<eos> They need someone to provide for them.<eos> They said:<eos> "We use a hallucination to find our subjects."<eos> They are those who have had fundamental recognition and do not give some compensation to the poor woman they deprived of her genius.
Yours is very special.<eos> Remember when you had heart surgery?<eos> Dad, please, I was three.<eos> Yeah, okay, well, when the doctors fixed you up<eos> They said that your recovery was going to depend On the strength of your character and that is when I knew.
You mean the dad that's not my real dad?<eos> He never told you anything?<eos> Nope.<eos> Sometimes parents don't say anything because they don't want to hurt their kids.<eos> What if they take me to another dad?
No, no, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> - Just sit down.<eos> Relax, okay.<eos> - No, they are!
There has been an emergency.<eos> Carl is in the hospital.<eos> And, well, he keeled over during rehearsal.<eos> And the kids called 911.<eos> They're beside themselves.
I hope you're not planning to throw yourself in there.<eos> As a gentleman I'd feel obliged to go in after you, and that may well be the end of me.<eos> The men used to call me Uncle.<eos> They thought I'd look after them, and I did, while we were there.<eos> But here... every month I stare into those... bitter, half-awake faces, and I know they desperately need me to put them back together again.
The vote was 5 to 3.<eos> But I can't get that result in the writing, sir.<eos> I can't get that result because there's something else that needs to be addressed.<eos> Mr. Connolly!<eos> Citizens cannot pick and choose which war they wish to fight any more than they can pick and choose which laws they wish to obey.
Can't yöu hear me?<eos> Hey, I'm asking yöu guys.<eos> What are yöu guys doing?<eos> What's happening?<eos> They can't hear yöu.
Nothing.<eos> Yöu know this is the problem with people.<eos> I mean when these guys don't work, people cause a commotion.<eos> And when these guys work, people aren't happy.<eos> Come on, it's not like they enjoy working all night long.
Yöu know this is the problem with people.<eos> I mean when these guys don't work, people cause a commotion.<eos> And when these guys work, people aren't happy.<eos> Come on, it's not like they enjoy working all night long.<eos> They are not partying, right?
He published a full page story of me starring and directing Macbeth from the front page to the back page of the school paper.<eos> Actually, he just posted that...<eos> My mom was Lady Macbeth in off Broadway.<eos> My friends were gonna put t-shirts of my front page on it.<eos> They all look up to me and I was completely humiliated.
Ryan, we need to have a failsafe, honey, okay?<eos> If i get out of control, then we're gonna be... if we need a failsafe, honey,<eos> Then it's already out of control.<eos> Just let me take you to the hospital.<eos> You have friends there, they'll look after you, They're not gonna do anything you don't want them to do.
It's one thing I don't have to worry about.<eos> My parents will never use the word "perfect" to describe me.<eos> You don't have to worry either.<eos> I mean, you're a straight "a" student, and you dated a Princeton guy, which your parents must have loved.<eos> They don't even know Seth exists.
My parents will never use the word "perfect" to describe me.<eos> You don't have to worry either.<eos> I mean, you're a straight "a" student, and you dated a Princeton guy, which your parents must have loved.<eos> They don't even know Seth exists.<eos> As far as they're concerned, I can't consider having a boyfriend until I've graduated summa cum laude from Harvard medical school.
Mm-hmm, whoever came up with that language knew what they were doing.<eos> Well, if he is a... roue, should I still go out with him?<eos> Are you seriously asking me if it's all right to get involved with a bad boy?<eos> Male species 101, cupcake...<eos> Men are no good if they're not bad.
Jesus, man. Freaking Boots.<eos> Hey, uh, who was the incident commander?<eos> Sergeant Crespo -- allegedly.<eos> He was working the phones at first until he shrunk into his car and lost his water.<eos> They just started shooting at us and innocent kids!
I know.<eos> These fuckers... they're moving closer in time with each one of those blackouts.<eos> - It's like they're gaining on us.<eos> - May your good health be twofold!<eos> They're going outside, just like before.
And he went, "... No!" [laughs]<eos> And the store says, "Well my lawyer said I can."<eos> And it was like, "Oh, no." You know, so, that started it.<eos> And, uh, the punch line to Andre's story was eventually... all the studios saw how lucrative the market was.<eos> They all came out with their own, you know, label.
Original aspect ratio never caught on 'cause people thought they were being gypped.<eos> "I've got black bars on the top and bottom of my picture!"<eos> Yeah!<eos> That's so you see the sides!<eos> They ne- it never sunk in!
And they were selling like hot cakes.<eos> And the business took off.<eos> And that's how we created the sell-through title.<eos> Media had this crazy idea of releasing tapes at the, then, shocking price of $19.95.<eos> They were calling it sell-through.
My death scene, it hurt the most.<eos> And you know, oh, he's getting away and then all of a sudden you just see [noise] axe.<eos> I'm screaming for help, and you can hear me.<eos> Oh my god, please!<eos> It's always interesting to me to see, you know, a bomb drops, you know, a bunch of kids scatter around like roaches on the kitchen sink and how do they interact.
This is the show that I want to be associated with Because it has credibility And they really do focus on the artist.<eos> And it's an opportunity to do what I love, which is mentor. Daly:<eos> And blake shelton! Blake:<eos> Every year, I learn more and more From these kids that try out for this show, And they remind me how lucky I am<eos> And they inspire me.
Fuck.<eos> So you don't play in any of the R B clubs in Harlem?<eos> No, man.<eos> Those cats are way too strict up there.<eos> They don't dig cats stretching the blues out up there.
- And they're a whole lot-<eos> Nothing but negativity bringing us down.<eos> But the solar system is going through this huge change.<eos> It's gonna affect Earth in about 30 years, yeah.<eos> And our space brothers, they're gonna come down... and they're gonna show us the way.
And, look, you know-<eos> I'm saying this brother to brother, all right?<eos> You'll never be nothing to them but a curiosity.<eos> And that's-that's the truth.<eos> They don't "let you" up on that stage.
Rikard = prom queen".<eos> That's true. - I thank you all for your support!<eos> I have so many memories from those days and I'll close by saying that it was a simple and innocent time.<eos> And...when caught up with family life and carrier it's these times that I often look back on.<eos> And if there's one thing I wish for my own kids it's that they experience the same sense of camaraderie that we had.
- H!<eos> Great to see you!<eos> Wow! This is so exciting!<eos> ...it's these times that I often look back on.<eos> And if there's one thing I wish for my own kids it's that they experience the same sense of camaraderie that we had.
That was really brave of you, saying no just then.<eos> And I think it's totally cool that there's a part of yourself you want to keep private.<eos> I'm thinking about naming my shoulders.<eos> You know, like The Situation has his abs?<eos> They could be my signature thing.
Rachel.<eos> Suddenly, something happened to you in the middle of the song.<eos> What was going on there?<eos> I was thinking about my friends.<eos> Um, how I wouldn't be the person I am today, standing in front of you, doing what I'm doing right now if they hadn't shown me that I could.
Watch my back.<eos> I'll do a head check.<eos> Let's get those smug bastards.<eos> Here's the plan.<eos> They think we're down, right?
Can you tell us where you were last night at 11:00 P.M.?<eos> Yeah, I was here.<eos> I had some friends over.<eos> We were playing some music, had a bit of a jam session.<eos> They can vouch for me.
Inheriting the bloodline of such person...<eos> "Coward"...<eos> It's true that that's what all those old guys are calling him.<eos> But that can't be help.<eos> They bothered Platoon Sergeant because of his good skills of navigating a fighter plane.
They are crazily loyal to the country.<eos> That's why I say...<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I have read the wills of those Special Attack Unit members before,<eos> They think that giving up their lives for the sake of the nation is an honorable thing to do.
- Anything to report?<eos> - Nothing... special, no.<eos> Kids?<eos> School?<eos> You know, they always adjust better than we do.
Taking them as they're meant.<eos> Neighbors!<eos> I've summered 'em and I've wintered 'em.<eos> And the lord could take the caboodle of them tomorrow and I wouldn't care.<eos> They've lied about me and taken from me.
I'm going home!<eos> Where am I?<eos> How come lice don't bite you?<eos> My bed's infested with them.<eos> They don't bother me. I grew up surrounded by lice.
They even collapse with style.<eos> It's so stylized!<eos> My men don't make the grade.<eos> Why's that?<eos> I know! We're realists while they're fantasists!
Oh, that was great!<eos> Oh, thank you!<eos> Oh, they're so precious.<eos> Rose, do the children have leprosy?<eos> No, these are the children with their family members who have a disease, but they are healthy.
I should've been preparing a statement, but you tricked me into relaxing like a lunatic!<eos> EMILY: Everything's cool.<eos> Wh-Where are the kids?<eos> A lot of stuff went down.<eos> They're both carrying suitcases that they know they don't need to convince the other one we're going on a vacation that we're not going on to protect each other from the truth, even though what they think is the truth is actually a lie, respectively.
The boy had a 0.0001% chance of surviving, yet he did.<eos> Is there something wrong with you?<eos> I am experiencing something that I do not understand.<eos> The idea of ending their existence... consumes me.<eos> They are insignificant.
Just young couples in our prime.<eos> If they don't care that he's making connections to the outside world, then they don't give a shit about being caught.<eos> Yeah, problem is, everyone thinks my Facebook updates are a hoax.<eos> The abductors broke my phone camera so I can't send pictures.<eos> They know exactly what they're doing.
I'm Bill.<eos> Bill is the brainchild behind the Descendents.<eos> It is trippy that they were a drummer-run band.<eos> Our whole goal was like, "Yeah, it's cool, there's this thing called 'punk rock.' Now let's take it somewhere."<eos> When I said, "I wanna go be a nerd scientist geek," then they said, "Hey, see you later." And all of a sudden they formed ALL.
There's no other band like them.<eos> Doesn't matter which one they are.<eos> The caliber of songwriting and subject matter that is so close and relatable to has not wavered for 30 years.<eos> I don't think there were any other bands that could do what they did.<eos> It's good to see that those guys are getting credit for what they, in a lot of ways, created.
They've priced themselves out of the market.<eos> There's nothing, you know, left to say about that.<eos> But prices for the new wines are not fixed until the critics reveal their scores.<eos> The higher the scores, the higher the prices set by the châteaux - a situation not all critics are happy about.<eos> This time of year, when I'm looking at the young wines and I'm trying to work out what they will be in 20 years time, but a lot of the overlay of my perception is...
Thierry, please, I don't want to see my father.<eos> Your dead father?<eos> Thierry, wait.<eos> I told your friends.<eos> They'll meet you at the airport.
I'm not worried about mummy, but papa?<eos> When are you planning on telling them?<eos> When you come to sister's wedding.. ..I'll introduce you to them then, hopefully.<eos> Everyone will be happy so the chances will be better then.<eos> And what if they refuse?
Listen.. ..this time please talk properly, this is third time in past 6 months.<eos> I met Mrs Goyal in the morning and even she was asking me.. ..if everything is alright.<eos> I will talk to Ravi ji.<eos> Sometime brings your parents also along.<eos> Sure, they too remember you.
Vani!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I am looking for that bulb.<eos> You never mentioned about it to your parents?<eos> Yes I did, several times.. ..but until they see scars on body they don't believe.
I was born with toddler obesity.<eos> Peter's also a survivor.<eos> It's no joke.<eos> Single dwelling in the valley on one acre.<eos> They're gonna knock it down and subdivide the property.
Before we get started, you should know this interview is standard practice.<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Merely a formality to prove that your upcoming marriage isn't one of convenience for the sole purpose of obtaining citizenship.<eos> Well, I can assure you officers the first time we met, our hearts were joined as one.<eos> Weren't they, my dear?
Children shouldn't play with guns. - Uhh! - Ohh!<eos> I didn't. We were attacked!<eos> - By whom? - I don't know!<eos> But we're not the only ones down here!<eos> If Roaring Dan actually tried to replicate the original cabin, these captains, they-- they often had escape hatches down to the cargo hold so that if their ship was under attack, they could go down there, grab their plunder,
And just before I left, I asked you for a hug.<eos> But you were too angry at me.<eos> A police detective's home address?<eos> Seriously?<eos> The doctors need a sample of this drug that Skye has taken or they can't help her, okay?
Now I understand.<eos> - But at the time...<eos> - At the time it was the word of God, and I believed it absolutely.<eos> Suddenly, the Darba were there.<eos> They were all around me, the demons, and they were... they were coming for me, just like God said.
Not her.<eos> It's not in her nature.<eos> Even if you're right, it doesn't necessarily follow that Simeon is the culprit.<eos> Trust you to look for mysteries when the truth's right in front of your eyes.<eos> I don't so much look for mysteries, as they come looking for me.
Victoria, the kids?<eos> Scared.<eos> Those gangsters had some balls coming up in my hood.<eos> Game's changing.<eos> What if they got a green light out on me?
Now would be a good time to upgrade dispatch.<eos> We could always use cans and string.<eos> Sir, you all right?<eos> "Let us go and confound their language, "that they won't understand each other's speech.<eos> "And the Lord scattered them "across the face of all the earth, "and then they -- and then t-they built a city.
You sound just like my parents.<eos> Always telling me what to do and never listening.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> I try to talk to them.<eos> They just look at me and say something condescending, like, "Don't be so dramatic, Garrett."
Excuse me.<eos> That was fantastic!<eos> Telling my parents how full of shit they are!<eos> You're my hero, Ben Sherman.<eos> I can't tell you how many times I try and tell them what shit's like over there -- what the kids are actually like -- and they just -- they don't listen.
She left me.<eos> She said I was delusional.<eos> You're gonna get her back, man, and your kids.<eos> Think about your kids.<eos> They need you.
We know nothing, and we've learnt shit.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Correct.<eos> All we know is that they are hungry, and we are their food!<eos> They can't walk fast.
It's so much easier to deal with. Right.<eos> So, I found some particulates embedded in the scraping wound on the back of the ribs.<eos> Any idea what it is?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Dr. Brennan thought that there was evidence- That animals might have gotten to the remains. So maybe they left 'em.
You're home now.<eos> Whatever it is you have to face tomorrow, you don't have to face it now.<eos> Right now, it's just you and me.<eos> The rest of the world doesn't matter.<eos> Your children, Christina, they will forgive you, because you're loved, Peter.
Hurry up, I said!<eos> Jacket!<eos> Now!<eos> These are probably professional kidnappers.<eos> Knowing the level of Maxim's security, they'll expect a chip, too.
Jacket!<eos> Now!<eos> These are probably professional kidnappers.<eos> Knowing the level of Maxim's security, they'll expect a chip, too.<eos> They'll get rid of every shred of clothing, down to his skin.
How much is too much?<eos> Eva...<eos> Do the guys know each other?<eos> Okay. Um... no.<eos> There's no evidence they've ever met.
Why... Does she see trucks as monsters?<eos> We... we didn't have any choice.<eos> They said if we didn't fight them, they'd kill us.<eos> And then if we told, they would kill her.<eos> They'd kill our baby.
They said if we didn't fight them, they'd kill us.<eos> And then if we told, they would kill her.<eos> They'd kill our baby.<eos> Have you ever stopped to notice to see how many of them there are?<eos> They're everywhere.
Risky.<eos> But how risky is it, really?<eos> They've participated in killing someone.<eos> The truckers probably kept evidence, photos, videos, even.<eos> And they threatened the life of a child.
Their car was blown up...<eos> By my father's business partner...<eos> Nicola Conti.<eos> No...<eos> After they died, I fully learned the truth. About where our luxury came from.
[Tommy]: A small, controlled blast in the security hub.<eos> A guard was injured.<eos> And...<eos> the kidnappers?<eos> They called, but... We're waiting for a new contact, and it appears that they caused the explosion.
We need to stop them.<eos> We can go to the cattle kill area later, but if it's poachers we should go now.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Poachers, mate, they're scum. They take the head, they take the fur, ...the organs.<eos> They take everything, they sell it to the highest bidder.
Okay, let's go.<eos> What?<eos> Oh yeah, it's just animal.<eos> Wow man.<eos> They'll take anything.
I do wish you'd trust me, though.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I wish you'd get it out of your head that I'm some sort of criminal 'cause I'm not.<eos> What do your friends say?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. They think Rebecca did it.
Fοr me, she's like a tattοο.<eos> Darling Silνia, wουld yου sign my absence slip? Nο, Leο, that's enουgh.<eos> I mean, I eνen knοw yουr parents.<eos> That's why I'm asking.<eos> Yου knοw what they're like.
They just made it so damn hard.<eos> This is where we bake the treats for the goody bags that we give to our boyfriends on game day.<eos> We don't do it for the thank-yous because they don't say thank you.<eos> We do it because it's tons of fun.<eos> So this is where we do our boyfriends' homework so they can focus on practice.
I'll drop you somewhere. (Chuckles) (Panting)<eos> Oh, ma.<eos> I'm going insane.<eos> Children.<eos> They disappear, then they casually saunter back in not knowing how much they tortured you.
I'll get the rest.<eos> That bastard could be the one behind this.<eos> Schiller doesn't need half a million ransom money.<eos> What about the Coxon brothers?<eos> They were angry when Irwin stole their pot.
Just in case.<eos> We would've done it anyway.<eos> Detectives?<eos> Yeah?<eos> They've all had their spleens removed.
Got it?<eos> Don't I always?<eos> Singing again?<eos> Sometimes I think you like bugs more than you like me.<eos> Because they actually do their job and help me estimate time of death.
I trust my men with my life.<eos> You know why?<eos> They've earned it.<eos> Well, sir, maybe you could trust your men to use a little common sense when handling the contagious.<eos> They've been provoking them.
Next year, in came this real mean son of a bitch, kicked our ass every day, and you know what happened?<eos> No, sir. We won the state title.<eos> You see, that coach understood the need for discipline.<eos> We're not talking about football players here.<eos> They're casualties, 236 of them, another 150 in body bags.
Of course.<eos> I've been so worried about you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Just ignore the FBI men.<eos> They insisted.
in women within this part of life. We don't know what they are due to.<eos> I'm not saying that everything is due to GMO, but I think that GMO could contribute to some extent to these tumors.<eos> We have the fact that Roundup can kill human cells at very low levels and even lower levels close to the levels you find in the river or in the tap water, then you have hormonal effect, hormonal imbalance within the cells<eos> that are necessary to form the genital system, for instance. Less than a day after Seralini's study was published in France's top scientific journal, the Science Media Centre of London put out a press release discrediting the report with criticisms from eight top scientists, all of them with strong ties to the biotech industry.<eos> They are well known, these people that defend Monsanto because they are the first one to show in the media to say,
Those children are gonna need you.<eos> I ain't know how to take care of Lou and Oz.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> You've been taking care of me for years.<eos> They need their momma.
I ain't know how to take care of Lou and Oz.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> You've been taking care of me for years.<eos> They need their momma.<eos> No, no, no, they just need someone to love 'em and take care of 'em.
Arms tight down!<eos> Pain therapy might be useful in your case.<eos> True friends come in bad times, but especially in good times.<eos> Who are they?<eos> I found them in the Garden, they're Master Antonio's friends.
I...<eos> There are so many questions.<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> It comes back to me in pieces, but they're like shards of broken glass.<eos> They don't... they don't fit together.
Is it worth it?<eos> Maybe it's too far away.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> I don't think we should stay here either.<eos> They've already looked here.
I got this.<eos> I got this.<eos> This year, I know the judges are tough compared to season one, two and three, But we're gonna give it a shot.<eos> From the thousands who applied, just 100 home cooks have been invited to Los Angeles.<eos> They'll have one hour to create a signature dish worthy of a MasterChef apron.
All are walking around holding their D in their hand.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Why isn't any girl in our college wearing short dresses?<eos> Why are the boys behaving as though they will be killed if they look at a girl?
Use it and enjoy life.<eos> Come on.<eos> Baby...<eos> Are you sure that your parents are not at home?<eos> They are not home.
Be strong for now.<eos> Go with Börje now.<eos> Please don't tell my parents about us.<eos> Tommy was the only one who knew.<eos> - They can't decide who you go out with. - You don't know my mother and father!
- So your mom thought...?<eos> My parents never allowed me and Börje to meet.<eos> Tommy took the blame to save our relationship.<eos> - But why?<eos> - They hated him already.
Oh, politics and business, all in one lunchtime.<eos> I think it's my fault, Lady Allingham.<eos> The men have followed our lead.<eos> She's a Methodist, Atherton.<eos> They don't.
Yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Down in the lobby in half an hour, boys.<eos> First class of the day is at 8:00 a.m.<eos> Van Gogh's paintings show him identifying with his subjects so deeply they merge into one identity.
I'd say... you're fucked.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Well, it's true.<eos> If vampires were real, we'd be no match for them.<eos> They drink our blood, they can glamour us in an instant, they run 3 times fast as us, and, uh, oh yeah, one more thing.
The Muslim Brothers, the Salafis, the Socialists, The Liberals, they're all failures.<eos> I've decided to walk in the middle of the street.<eos> The cars can do whatever they want. What can they do?<eos> Run me over?<eos> They need to curb to the side, not me.
And that's what makes us strong.<eos> We're here presenting Cinema Tahrir To remind us why we are here And to show the people who ask us why we're still here.<eos> Because only we can tell our stories.<eos> The revolutionaries who toppled the regime Have died, been injured, or gone to prison.<eos> And with no constitution, They want to hold elections stained by revolutionary blood. Supervised by those who killed the revolutionaries.
They uncovered two pharmacy prescriptions for morphine that came from you, which is weird, since you're not an oncologist.<eos> - I can explain that.<eos> - You might need to.<eos> More pressing is that I believe her attorneys are gonna suggest that you not only prescribed the morphine, but you also administered the fatal dose the night that Thomas died.<eos> They're gonna say you did it.
I'm really proud of you.<eos> It takes a lot of courage to serve our country, and it's a selfless act to defend our freedom, especially when you've got nincompoops like Ben here, who have no idea of the sacrifice you are about to undertake.<eos> Are your parents on board with this?<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Boykewich, sir.<eos> They understand that I want to be part of something bigger than myself.
Focus on school...<eos> I'm going to go home to Houston this summer.<eos> Well, that's a good idea.<eos> Spend some time with your parents.<eos> I know they must miss you.
Does this make Falcon officially smarter than you?<eos> Considering he survived the longest and got the Phantoms out of the tower?<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> Falcon, what do we need to know about these guys?<eos> They have your strength, your equipment.
That worked well.<eos> Yeah, I'd say so.<eos> You got us off the hook.<eos> For now.<eos> How do you think the crew feel knowing every time you fuck something up, they pay?
You got us off the hook.<eos> For now.<eos> How do you think the crew feel knowing every time you fuck something up, they pay?<eos> They were punks.<eos> You gave an order, they followed it.
I don't know, I don't speak star.<eos> Then what good are you?<eos> My parents are fucking.<eos> Is that unusual?<eos> They've been divorced for eight years.
But sometimes I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic.<eos> I don't think that way,<eos> I just type that way.<eos> That's when I realized, it wasn't me that was homophobic.<eos> It was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of. Dah! So then the problem was,
- It was a bad deal. They wanted to break us up.<eos> - Yes, they did.<eos> That's exactly the point, Ms. Lockhart.<eos> You have creditors, you owe them money.<eos> They are not interested in your self-fulfillment.
My name is Serafina Norvey, and before we get started, I'd like to set the ground rules for this mediation.<eos> Granted, we're in your offices, and outside those doors, you may all be bosses, but in here, I am the empress.<eos> Now, I understand, as the court-appointed trustee, you'd like to have the two principals removed as managing partners?<eos> Yes.<eos> They blocked a merger of the firm that I'd arranged with Burl Preston.
Try to calm down.<eos> We want to know about the, uh -- the texts you sent Ed last night.<eos> I told them when they brought me in those texts weren't from me.<eos> Well, your phone and Ed's phone say otherwise.<eos> No, I mean, they were from me, but they weren't from me me.
She recognized Cutler.<eos> A number of the locals saw him heading out into the jungle just on his own.<eos> They also saw smoke coming from a spot about three miles due north of here.<eos> Must be where Cutler's laying up, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. Exactly, and apparently, they saw smoke there this morning, which means somebody else is out there.
That's what they want us to do.<eos> What?<eos> It's true, Sue.<eos> Teachers are lazy.<eos> They know it only takes a day to do a project, but if they gave us assignments every day, they'd have to grade 'em every day.
What?<eos> It's true, Sue.<eos> Teachers are lazy.<eos> They know it only takes a day to do a project, but if they gave us assignments every day, they'd have to grade 'em every day.<eos> They don't want it, we don't want it.
We'll just, uh, change that... to "ace," hmm?<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Why do I need to make friends with kids, anyway?<eos> I mean- - I mean, what's the point?<eos> They're not interested in what I have to say, and I'm certainly not interested in their conversations.
- Listen, Jimmy, I'm sorry.<eos> - Lloyd.<eos> Sorry, Jimmy!<eos> The boys...<eos> I tried to tell them but they wouldn't fucking listen.
Let him go.<eos> No.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> What?<eos> They got him.
The usual gift from a grateful patient.<eos> But I'm trying to sweeten a pill. Oh?<eos> The London Hospital is short-staffed again, and we've been asked to offer a nurse up for secondment.<eos> But we're short-staffed for the next six months, until Chummy gets back from Sierra Leone.<eos> But we have reinforcements coming, and they don't.
My father and his father before him were both Men of Letters.<eos> As John and you two should have been.<eos> We're preceptors, beholders, chroniclers of all that which man does not understand.<eos> We share our findings with a few trusted hunters -- the very elite.<eos> They do the rest.
Oh, the demolition crew!<eos> Vince's brother, Reg, and he had a partner named Tony Pantonello.<eos> They used to do fireworks.<eos> They were not the Zambelli's but, you know, if you needed some fireworks down at your church you called these guys.<eos> They did all the pyrotechnical stuff and they were hilarious guys, I mean, you know.
They were not the Zambelli's but, you know, if you needed some fireworks down at your church you called these guys.<eos> They did all the pyrotechnical stuff and they were hilarious guys, I mean, you know.<eos> Tony would have this cigar constantly burning in his mouth and he's working putting a fuse together and he couldn't see very well, so he's like this and this cigar and I'm like,<eos> "Tony, you're gonna blow your fingers off!"<eos> They did all the squibs.
Smiling is your enemy.<eos> Follow the sound guys!<eos> What are George Romero's rules of zombies?<eos> Aria.<eos> That zombies, they, they walk slow.
I feel like my arm's about to fall off.<eos> It's peckeritis.<eos> Is that really a thing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. You know how some supermarket cashiers get carpal tunnel from working the register, except they're making change, and you're making, well...
I'm saying "Why now?" Kind of metaphor-- you know, just, like, it's a bigger picture.<eos> I mean, it's not you.<eos> This is the quietest you've ever talked to me.<eos> Governments have been overthrown in the middle east.<eos> If they can do it, why can't we do it?
Get out!<eos> Dan, this whole part--<eos> Don't even put it on by mistake. Okay?<eos> YouTube users do not want to see this kind of thing.<eos> They want to see a concise video.
Through your eyes, brothers, I finally see the world for what it really is.<eos> This city is infested.<eos> 8 million parasites, Scrambling around in their pointless lives, spreading disease, forcing us to live in the shadows, like vermin.<eos> No more.<eos> They are the true plague.
A whole army's worth.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And they all look exactly like me?<eos> No, those clones are warriors, professional soldiers created by the Republic, trained to fight, and die if necessary, in our war against the Separatists.<eos> They're not dishwashers living in some vermin-infested hovel.
Your parents... Where are they?<eos> So you don't like to speak?<eos> Did she do this to you?<eos> Do you want to see what they did to me?<eos> We must be willing to go further than them To do what they're too scared or weak to do.
- You want me to go out?<eos> - No.<eos> I like you being here.<eos> Such honors, they have said, such deference,<eos> Are they for nothing counted in her sight?
In fact, I think every important moment of my life has a theme song that's Bruce Springsteen.<eos> So all of these CDs in my car, absolutely every single one is Bruce Springsteen.<eos> Wait, actually one is his wife Patti, my favorite album from Patti.<eos> But that's all we listen to in this car, so my three sons, they have no choice.<eos> I only listen to Bruce and they are schooled in the music of Bruce Springsteen when they drive around with Mommy and I have to take them all over God's creation.
Howard, you're stupid.<eos> Calm down.<eos> That's just an eating contest.<eos> When you've got your foot jammed on the self-destruct pedal hard as I did, warning signs, even from yourself, often go unheeded.<eos> I talked to the doctors and they say your mom's got something called borderline personality disorder.
That's just an eating contest.<eos> When you've got your foot jammed on the self-destruct pedal hard as I did, warning signs, even from yourself, often go unheeded.<eos> I talked to the doctors and they say your mom's got something called borderline personality disorder.<eos> "Borderline" my butt.<eos> So are they gonna keep her in there a while?
We've got circumstantial, no witnesses.<eos> A jury's going to want to know why he did it.<eos> He did it, because he could.<eos> I think Craig feels the same contempt for old people that he does for Rosie.<eos> He thinks they're useless but he needs them because they need him.
Move, girl.<eos> Move, girl.<eos> Pace, pace.<eos> The drums are driving you.<eos> They're-- they're carrying you.
Listen the police know.<eos> The firefighters know.<eos> Everybody knows.<eos> The minute we walk out of this building, there will be 500 uniforms out there.<eos> But they can to us right now and we can't get out to them.
No.<eos> You're a fire fighter find us a way out.<eos> You have to.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you.<eos> If we stay here, they're just gonna come back.
Perhaps.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Hopefully they - they can't climb. And we'll get everyone to the roof and we'll evacuate from there.<eos> Dr. Carson. You're a vet. Do Dinosaurs Climb?<eos> We don't know if they can climb.
If only we had some cab'.<eos> Girls' night.<eos> Boys are getting restless again.<eos> You still haven't told me, where did you find them?<eos> Did they attack?
Royal One, I'm afraid you misunderstand.<eos> The king has commanded you to come before him and dance.<eos> Suppose I'm not in the mood for dancing?<eos> The king is also a warrior.<eos> When he commands his soldiers, they must obey.
Kevin has a good chance of getting through this, but, um, he's gonna need a lot of support.<eos> [ sighs ] I can be here on weekdays, I guess.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I want a divorce.<eos> And I'm keeping the dogs because I hate you and so do they.
Untreated, you could die.<eos> Treated I'm stuck in a bed.<eos> No dice, Dr. Yang.<eos> I can't be out of commission, not when my boys need me to take care of business.<eos> Actually, they brought a guy in with us...
In a word: Accomplices!<eos> We have been without a clear voice!<eos> Although from time to time someone tried to speak up, people heard nothing.<eos> I can assure you that from now on, it will never be like this.<eos> I am here so that tomorrow cannot be said times were dark, because they were silent!
I know it's not how you wanted to do it, but the end result is the same.<eos> And how do I tell my sons I'm the one who turned on their father?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But at least you'll be alive to do it.<eos> And so will they.
- Yes.<eos> That' s dad.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And that's mom.<eos> They have to come at the same time.
There has to be a better way to manage this.<eos> There probably is, but we'd need more officers to cover it.<eos> You take someone off one area, you've got to cover that.<eos> You're looking at extra shifts.<eos> They're not the ones choking on bread rolls.
I can't cut a medical.<eos> Word'll get out and the vultures will circle.<eos> I've got a screw we can use.<eos> They'll get in touch with you.<eos> You get it and they'll bring it in.
You cannot cut that program.<eos> I'm sorry, but these children, these... little orphans... we are the only hope they have.<eos> Many of them have rare disorders that most western doctors rarely have the opportunity to treat.<eos> And if you stop the program, I will never get that chance again.<eos> They.
I ran to the area. I found scattered bodies and injured women and children.<eos> 46 people were killed, including 5 pregnant women.<eos> If they kill innocent children and call them Al Qaeda, then we are all Al Qaeda.<eos> If children are terrorists, then we are all terrorists.<eos> At 6 am they were sleeping and I was making bread.
A hundred years ago, Kas and I'd often see the sun rise together.<eos> Of course we'd feel hung over, but we didn't care.<eos> I don't quite know when we stopped having fun.<eos> It's probably to do with the kids.<eos> They always get the blame.
What happened?<eos> Guys, we need to return to the castle!<eos> I will not return to the bloody castle!<eos> Are you going to stay here with the wolves?<eos> They smell blood!
How many of Inman's guys are married?<eos> How many of them have kids?<eos> Right.<eos> None of them.<eos> All they care about is their so-called tribe.
Two more questions, then... about Randall Kusik.<eos> Never met the man.<eos> I try to insulate myself from direct contact with the end buyer.<eos> So, uh, Boone brothers collect payment from Randall.<eos> They pay you.
Did I do something wrong?<eos> This isn't about you.<eos> Declan's just trying to keep you safe.<eos> From the Ryan brothers?<eos> They're the ones behind everything that's been happening at The Stowaway, from Matt Duncan getting beaten half to death to Jack being framed for drug trafficking.
I thought I knew everything about killer whales when I worked there, you know, and everything about these animals.<eos> I really know nothing about killer whales.<eos> I know a lot about being an animal trainer or a killer whale trainer, but I don't know anything about these animals' natural history or their behavior.<eos> I really in some ways believed a lot of what I was learning from them, because why would they lie?<eos> Because the whales in their pools die young, they like to say that all orcas die at 25 or 30 years.
I'm fasting for yöur well being.<eos> Pray with me for a while.<eos> How long is it going to take?<eos> We fast for the children.<eos> And then, they try to boss us around.
He is a troublesome man to kill.<eos> I have attempted it myself upon occasion.<eos> The gods favor him.<eos> And bless us as well.<eos> They piss upon us and you welcome it as cooling rain.
I served in the Roman auxiliary when I was yet of Thrace.<eos> Crassus' men did not fall to battle formation.<eos> But they hold advantage of numbers.<eos> Why pause short of blood?<eos> They but await their commander.
I had feared you among the dead.<eos> The gods took pity, and provided us with needed shelter.<eos> Not all so blessed.<eos> No.<eos> They were not.
It doesn't even matter, my friends.<eos> Will you please stop pushing me?<eos> Because it is Marty and I on a man date with the douchebag twins tonight.<eos> Let's break this down.<eos> You need Marty, the big dog, to impress them with his bespoke suits and his fancy ideas, and they need to-- I don't know-- relate to someone on more of a douchebag level, so who could we get?
Teri.<eos> It was Max.<eos> My Tuesday-night regular.<eos> Could I get another blanket?<eos> Listen, I know your friends are telling you that you're gonna get paid off for this deal, but I am not who they think I am.
-Do you have them?<eos> -Almost.<eos> What if they won't go to strike?<eos> The workers aren't stupid, the next "torches" might be their kids.<eos> They feel taken care of.
Right?<eos> How do you know what is right?<eos> The right thing is to save those kids.<eos> Kids?<eos> They are the last thing you care about.
- I mean, I got to meet you.<eos> Oh. You are so cute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah... you're pretty amazing.<eos> My friends, they, uh, they didn't think I had a chance.
He hates it.<eos> He convinced me to find a career I love.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You know, you never told me what your folks do. In fact, you've told me pretty much nothing about them.<eos> They're not really, uh, a big part of my life.
You need to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Your family?<eos> My parents, my-my sister.<eos> They'll understand.
I have a son--Oliver.<eos> A daughter, her name is Thea.<eos> She's just a teenager.<eos> Please don't take me from my children.<eos> They lost their father.
He was kidnapped by Nazis and no one, not even me, knows where they took him.<eos> - It's a mystery.<eos> - Was a mystery.<eos> I recently uncovered these lost Nazi files.<eos> They contain my father's exact location.
Unless they don't plan to come out the front door.<eos> The first thing you look for when you plan these things is a way out.<eos> I mean, wouldn't you?<eos> As far as I can tell, they don't have one.<eos> Well, yeah, that's maybe exactly what they don't want us to see.
You took those Tutsi women aside and you told them not to be angry, that anger would hurt their case, that personal anger would cloud every aspect of the trial.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I remember.<eos> I need you to not take personally what these men did.<eos> They listened to us... to us talk, to us hold each other, to us crying.
You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough.<eos> You know what, I think men are better than women.<eos> She's kidding.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> They provide for us, and we must obey them because they are our masters.
Hold on. What do you mean?<eos> Bears are bigger than canaries, yes?<eos> So if bears can't lift the--<eos> No, I understand animal sizes.<eos> What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
Kilgore Cabs is pulling in the driver, then we'll get his trip log.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> So, Miss ADA?<eos> How were your seats for Wicked?<eos> They were amazing.
I took a transport from Cyprus.<eos> And the first thing I saw when I got there were my two boys.<eos> Now... I've been in combat.<eos> But I've never seen fear in anyone's eyes like I saw in the eyes of my sons that day.<eos> 'Cause they knew.
- Yes, for real.<eos> Yes.. Yes, I like ya.<eos> I need you to give me the names of the other boys, yeah. Now...<eos> See, take that, take that. Now, listen, listen.<eos> Listen. They're never gonna know, alright, black and white.
It's gushing.<eos> We're just outta sync right now.<eos> But that's just timing, and what's timing?<eos> I mean, my parents lasted 30, 40 years.<eos> They were never happy at the same time.
Did you tell anyone else?<eos> No.<eos> You don't understand, do you?<eos> No one knows about this.<eos> Not now, not a year from now, not even when you're on your deathbed telling your grandkids, or they pay the price.
You do?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Let's go out and join the lads.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, they're coming out.
Not at all.<eos> I'm glad you decided to do it.<eos> Where are the children?<eos> I was looking forward to seeing Katie half-covered in meringue.<eos> Yeah, well, they're still upset about not being able to see Kyle.
Yeah, well, they're still upset about not being able to see Kyle.<eos> I mean, he's gonna be gone for a bit.<eos> You're not still thinking about taking them to the jail, are you?<eos> Definitely thinking about it.<eos> Look, mama, they miss their daddy, you know?
You're so sweet to let me move in.<eos> I want you to know I can help out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, mama, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna let the kids go and see Kyle in jail.<eos> - I really appreciate your advice, but they just...
Babli.<eos> You're bound to get hurt while playing.<eos> Babli.<eos> How long will you father these children alone?<eos> They need a motherto look afterthem.
We can cook together, otherwise there's Masterji.<eos> I want two kids.<eos> One like you and other handsome like me.<eos> Their names will be Rekha and Amitabh.<eos> They're my favourites.
You're the frying pan, and Chandei's the fire.<eos> Look, ifthe car's stolen from my place.. ..then Chandel will kill me brutally.<eos> Try to understand.<eos> I've small kids.<eos> They will be orphaned.
And these two journals came together to form New Left Review.<eos> People who ought to have edited had really exhausted themselves in the struggles around to found these journals, and so me, in my early twenties found myself editing these grand figures.<eos> My childhood was the experience ofpassing through a set ofnegative definitions and myparents patrolled who I could and couldn't bring home.<eos> They had to be the right class, the right colour, the right education, they had to have the right air, the right background, right name.<eos> They saw me as an aspiring young scholar who was going to go away, conquer the world and come back and adorn their struggles to improve themselves.
I don't know what's happening to me.<eos> These dreams they're like, um -- like torture.<eos> You didn't mention dreams.<eos> Dark, bloody.<eos> Spencer, they, uh -- they scare the hell out of me.
Yeah.<eos> So now we're back together, huh?<eos> How's that gonna work out?<eos> We're figuring it out.<eos> I told the kids there's snakes in here so they wouldn't go near it.
I have?<eos> Ever since we were little.<eos> Don't you remember the monsters?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Every time mom would turn off the lights, they'd be running all over the walls.
Ever since we were little.<eos> Don't you remember the monsters?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Every time mom would turn off the lights, they'd be running all over the walls.<eos> And I couldn't fuckin' go to sleep 'cause I thought they were gonna eat me or something.
Uh, no.<eos> Every time mom would turn off the lights, they'd be running all over the walls.<eos> And I couldn't fuckin' go to sleep 'cause I thought they were gonna eat me or something.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> They were the shadows.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.<eos> You know what else they have?<eos> Penguins.<eos> I like penguins.<eos> But not just in a zoo, they're wild ones, kind of roaming around.
You work fast.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Since I lost the election to Simon Moise, we needed a backup plan.<eos> You really think you could stop the mine?<eos> Well, Dearman's investors are getting nervous, and if there is any delays, they are going to pull out, so we need to pressure the chiefs.
Yeah, so is mine.<eos> Look, as soon as we have the support of the other chiefs, everything will run like clockwork.<eos> It better.<eos> It will.<eos> Okay, they're here.
Tortoises tend to come to the highlands at the coolest time of year.<eos> Up in the highlands, they can feed on a year-round, low-quality food source.<eos> But then when the rains kick in, the lowlands tend to green up, and the tortoises go down there, probably to fatten up.<eos> But Blake's studies reveal much more about the tortoises than just where they go.<eos> They demonstrate the extraordinary effect that tortoises have on their surrounding environment.
They lie plumb on the equator, with its year-long warmth and sunshine.<eos> But perhaps, more importantly, they also lie at the crossroads between two competing winds.<eos> The southeast trade winds blow up from South America and the northeast trades come down from the Caribbean and Central America.<eos> These two winds are the lifeblood of the Galapagos.<eos> They carried the earliest settlers to the emerging volcanic islands.
And up there in the trade winds millions of years ago, and doubtless many times since, some of them made the 600 mile journey to the Galapagos.<eos> And spiders were not alone, floating through the skies.<eos> Many different forms of life were brought here by the wind from the South American continent - seeds, pollen, viruses, bacteria, algae and insects.<eos> Insects, of course, are extremely important in most ecosystems.<eos> They pollinate plants and they're food for many other kinds of animals.
But one quite large insect did so.<eos> And its arrival started a new phase in the colonisation of the Galapagos.<eos> It was a beetle.<eos> Beetles are nature's great recyclers.<eos> They chew up organic matter and that helps to create soil.
From the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.<eos> Rain washes nutrients from the forest soil, down streams into rivers<eos> and finally, into the ocean.<eos> And there, swept up by the currents, they're carried across the Pacific to the Galapagos.<eos> They travel not near the surface but in the depths, by a cold water current.
Do you still think you owe me something, James?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> The prospectors are working for Zheng.<eos> If he goes away, they go away.
Be quiet.<eos> This is TV1 Northern Jutland.<eos> - Saltum at his farm.<eos> We like to show the people... how it's done in modern Denmark.<eos> We cut the piglets' tails so they don't bite eachother.
You still think you're special.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Ms. James, what brings you to town?<eos> I was heading to the governor's fundraiser when I heard that your SVU minions arrested Mr. Provo in Islip.<eos> Yeah, they said traffic was terrible coming back.
Your Honor, the Grand Jury indicted Michael Provo for rape, murder, and conspiracy.<eos> We would like to consolidate these charges to proceed to trial together.<eos> At the very least, the charges should be separate.<eos> - There's no link between them.<eos> - They are absolutely linked.
Plus they were thieves.<eos> Why thieves?<eos> Well, they stole my damn water.<eos> I got a stream up that way.<eos> They diverted it into their fields, like I wouldn't notice.
But right away, he came back for more.<eos> A lot more.<eos> I didn't have the kind of quantity he wanted, so I put him in touch with some serious guys I knew in Stockton.<eos> Scary dudes.<eos> Hell, maybe they killed 'em.
Do you know anything about this?<eos> Oh, I was just riffing.<eos> On what?<eos> Yeah, we have a pretty specific religion.<eos> At this point, I thought it best to just let my parents off the hook, especially since I knew something they didn't.
So you input the price, you crank the handle, and the drawer opens.<eos> Hmm. Must be stuck.<eos> In sticking with our Founder's Day theme, I refuse to accept any modern medicine.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go read the scripture until the devil comes out of me.<eos> Look, I'll talk to my parents about the car thing, and if they say it's okay, I'll do it.
They gave it to us.<eos> As a gift?<eos> Well, sort of.<eos> You see, we finally found the diamond in the rough, but it was a bit above my spending limit.<eos> So my parents kicked in the extra money, - and they gave us this car, and they got their dream car. - Mm.
And re-opening the track.<eos> And maybe legal counseling.<eos> And the GED program.<eos> Now, I understand that there's a mold situation in the classroom, but this needs to be addressed.<eos> The inmates down the hill, they get classes, and they are not getting out any time soon.
No, she will stay here and have fun with the bunk bed.<eos> I'm guessing that your friend might actually want to spend time with her daughter.<eos> With all due respect, Danny, you don't know anything about children.<eos> I don't?<eos> No, I mean, you come from the generation where the adults just, like, let the kids do whatever they want, so they could smoke pot and go to key parties.
You can't take us back there.<eos> Tye, what's the alternative?<eos> I let you run loose until the Reach snatches you up again?<eos> No.<eos> We're headed to my parents' place, so they can...
Black Mesa.<eos> Northeastern Arizona.<eos> The Native American Hopi tribe has called these peaks of the Colorado plateau home for more than 1,000 years.<eos> High above the Arizona desert, their reservation, encompassing more than 1.5 million acres, consists of 12 villages.<eos> Ancient astronaut theorists have studied these mysterious sites for years, discovering what they consider to be countless pieces of evidence of extraterrestrial contact in the ancient past.
God, I just hope there are no kids on that plane.<eos> 'Cause, you know, they don't have any choice in the matter.<eos> - (phone chimes) - Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> I feel worse for the parents, okay?<eos> Probably the kids thought that they could fly the plane all by themselves.
Cindy, you okay?<eos> All right, this will be where she goes.<eos> So she retreated to the long abandoned model home, where she discovered it's a lot harder to get out of a Bluth home than into one.<eos> Pieces of (bleep).<eos> And maybe it was because she had never fully disappointed her parents, and they were getting older, or perhaps it was because there was no Internet at the model home...
Oh that doesn't make any sense at all.<eos> You'll think a shot of coffee will zoom them up the canal like they're riding a jet-ski.<eos> Well, clearly you know more than a team of Swedish doctors.<eos> Damn, fish and the swedes,<eos> I knew they were behind this.
Trauma, find those bleeders, get them tied off.<eos> They all start to look alike.<eos> What?<eos> Parents.<eos> When their kids are in trouble, they just have this look, it's like... almost primal.
Have you seen what the jockeys do to these innocent animals?<eos> It's awful.<eos> They should be punished.<eos> Yeah, what if one of them dies?<eos> Do they deserve to die?
I've met a girl here.<eos> Well, I will as soon as I finish this letter.<eos> She's looking at me right now.<eos> I told the guys here about you.<eos> They said 'no', but I didn't sink to their level.
Well, I will as soon as I finish this letter.<eos> She's looking at me right now.<eos> I told the guys here about you.<eos> They said 'no', but I didn't sink to their level.<eos> They go on about waiting lists, but I keep hounding them.
- But you were born here?<eos> - Yes, I was born here.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Great. And your parents were born here?<eos> - They were actually born in Iran in Tehran.
We lost sight of each other.<eos> What was left of us barely made it to this Armenian village.<eos> The infidels have abandoned this place when the war broke.<eos> As we entered the village, we saw the Ottoman soldiers.<eos> They were miserable, I swear.
Or the Malagasy giant rat?<eos> Have you ever seen those rats?<eos> They don't have a lot of choices.<eos> Yeah, but the swans are smoking hot.<eos> They can get all the swan tail they want, but they don't.
(Giggling) (Laughs) - Tessa, I beg you.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> In any case, the more I studied the baby, the more I realized he has no idea what he's doing.<eos> Babies are born into this world with their heads up their diapers.<eos> They have no idea how to be a baby.
I'm not a musician.<eos> I'm a lawyer.<eos> I got a real job.<eos> So were all my other musicians.<eos> They had day jobs, too, okay?
So many missing cats.<eos> This is the coyotes.<eos> That is definitely coyote.<eos> You know, we should let people know.<eos> They come down from the hills, and they just prey on little animals.
He would go up and down this guy's arm, and that was his job.<eos> Like he just went up and down this guy's arm.<eos> You're out for show with a freaky kid.<eos> I have to stop for a second, wonder what my roommates are doing.<eos> I'm honestly crazy about them, and they've got like almost this secret language with each other.
6-0.<eos> Why'd you have to make that comment about my mama?<eos> What's up with these niggers, homie?<eos> Oh, these niggers straight.<eos> These the homies-- they with me.
Oh, Polly, hey.<eos> Hay is for horses, papi.<eos> Uh, you know, my kids... Hmm. Uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did they see me?
That's your reaction to me telling you this emotional thing is I should go around town asking for the--<eos> What, what did you call it the pullout king?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Say, hey, do you guys know who the pullout king is?<eos> They'll be like, yeah.
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna faint!<eos> Or puke!<eos> I'm gonna fuke!<eos> Come on, elderlies love living with other elderlies.<eos> They have dinner together at four o'clock, and eat soft foods, and talk about pills.
I'm serious!<eos> Max!<eos> Chloe!<eos> What goes on?<eos> Those kids... they owe... Six dah... dollars and...
The key to getting along with Carl's parents...<eos> - Is to be myself.<eos> - What are you, high?<eos> No.<eos> The trick is to be whoever it is you think they want you to be.
- Is to be myself.<eos> - What are you, high?<eos> No.<eos> The trick is to be whoever it is you think they want you to be.<eos> - Oh. - And to say whatever it is you think they want you to say.
So there was an urban legend that went around that said that somebody had Einstein's brain, which was actually true.<eos> What everyone didn't realize is that the key thing that defined Einstein, which was his brain, was being driven around in the backseat of a car of this physician.<eos> It was a very weird story.<eos> His motivation was not just simply the ghoulish thing of having this, you know, great trophy, but it was to try to see if he could understand it.<eos> And he began to give slices of it to neurobiologists and neurophysiologists to see if they could understand what it was about Einstein that was different.
Hate 'em.<eos> More of a dog person, you know? Dogs are loyal.<eos> You could die in front of your dog, and they would stay with you until somebody found you.<eos> Might even help pay for the funeral, but not cats.<eos> No, they would just check your pulse, take your wallet, and split.
It's the child.<eos> Christ, it's the child.<eos> I should've known.<eos> I've copies with lawyers.<eos> Sealed, they don't know what it is, but they know to send it to press if I don't phone in every two hours.
Well, people murder family members every day.<eos> It's natural.<eos> Murder is natural.<eos> But abnormal.<eos> Teachers don't know there's scandals unless of course they are the scandal.
I waved them through.<eos> And they went right over an I.E.D.<eos> I woke up three days later in a hospital in Germany.<eos> The other guys...<eos> They...
Just as a witness instead of a godfather.<eos> A witness?<eos> Like a bystander?<eos> Witnesses are important.<eos> Then why do they never make the headlines?
His mom committed suicide a couple of years ago.<eos> His Uncle... Martin Decker... is the one who took over guardianship.<eos> Where's his Uncle now?<eos> He's not at home.<eos> I notified social services, thinking they might know how to reach him.
You think this PlL will make you a great advocate.<eos> You think the media will throng around you and you will hit the big time.<eos> Right? It's not that easy.<eos> If it were, these advocates wouldn't be here like losers.<eos> They are probably still contemplating.
What kind of meeting?<eos> Sorry, I thought you knew.<eos> I run a PR company, I've just taken them on as clients.<eos> Since when do convents need PR?<eos> Since they discovered they have a Holy Spring.
Too hairy.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Were the kids merciless?<eos> No, we raised them too well.<eos> They're only merciless with us.
You're very bossy.<eos> She's very bossy.<eos> If you're gonna do something, do it right.<eos> So, Hawaii?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna take these lungs out, see what they can do.
You're never ready.<eos> Trust me, you're never ready.<eos> When my wife and I brought home our baby, we were terrified, and I'm a doctor, and there were two of us.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'll tell you something else, 26 years later, it's still just as scary because these kids, they grow up, and you're supposed to treat them like adults even though you still remember that moment when they were helpless and you were terrified.
Profiles in Terror.<eos> Yes.<eos> Miss Drummond wrote a book about Howard Ennis after she caught him.<eos> Got into a spot of bother when she speculated about the sexual abuse he must surely have suffered at the hands of his parents.<eos> Yes, they said it was a lie.
Well, I gotta go down there right now and tell Mahmoud we can't be friends anymore.<eos> Wait a minute, Peter.<eos> This could actually be an opportunity.<eos> You're already in their group.<eos> They trust you.
- Sustained.<eos> The jury will disregard.<eos> - Jeremy, did you force any of those men To do anything they didn't want to do?<eos> - No.<eos> They came on to me.
What a hot mess those three are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about the other new members?<eos> Don't they have to be initiated, too?<eos> They did this weeks ago, when you'd gone AWOL.
They found two kilos in his trunk.<eos> Okay, guys, you know what?<eos> I think it's time you go upstairs now.<eos> Boys, hold on a minute.<eos> Linda, I think they need to sit in on this.
Okay, guys, you know what?<eos> I think it's time you go upstairs now.<eos> Boys, hold on a minute.<eos> Linda, I think they need to sit in on this.<eos> It's gonna be in the papers, their friends are gonna know, and they need to be prepared.
Maybe we'll be happy.<eos> Their benefits package says they have dental, including orthodontics.<eos> Now I happen to have a family history of very straight teeth, but Tuck may grow up and need braces.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if he does, they have dental.
You do the math.<eos> Look, you're after your husband.<eos> You take risks for that.<eos> I get it.<eos> But i got six guys on this ship Wondering if they'll die today, And they all have families, too.
I'm sorry, I know it's your family, but that was freakish.<eos> I mean, you saw her in that casket just still slowly rocking back and forth on that hump.<eos> That was scary.<eos> Kids were screaming, "close the casket!"<eos> They couldn't close the casket.
As we build our bird houses, remember, what you're making is a home, not a cage.<eos> A bird is free and will do what it will.<eos> This is for them, not us.<eos> They are loyal creatures.<eos> Oh! If you love them, and they love you, they will always find you.
There's a whole ward waiting for you.<eos> Drooling for DeeDee Burke, not me.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> For weeks I've been telling those men that my big brother the "Ace Gunner" was coming to visit.<eos> They need to know, how good it's going.
Let's go.<eos> Turn off the music.<eos> It's a nice song.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Passengers are our God, we've to do as they say.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I didn't shoot my wife.<eos> We found some evidence at the scene.<eos> Well, check with the other parents.<eos> They'll confirm my alibi.
Actually, I would mind.<eos> My breasts won't be silenced.<eos> And my breasts are not alone.<eos> ♪ my milk shake brings all the boys to the yard ♪<eos> ♪ and they're like, it's better than yours ♪ ♪ damn right it's better than yours ♪ ♪ I can teach you, but I have to charge ♪

But if I am an electron, I certainly can be.<eos> Because while you refer to quantum mechanics, I actually understand it.<eos> Most evolutionary biologists today don't believe that.<eos> Don't believe what?<eos> They don't believe in this crude fundamentalist version of random selection that you propose.
But I am not doing anything remotely comparable to that.<eos> What I'm doing is telling children, "think for yourself.<eos> Look for the evidence."<eos> I'm not saying, "this is the way it is. You'd better believe it or else."<eos> Well, it's funny, because six-year-olds are a lot less biased than adults often, and the neat thing is, I'd probably tell them that nothing is not exactly what they thought it was.
Also when one of the shape carriers speaks an echo against the wall causes the prisoners to believe that the words come from the shadows.<eos> The prisoners engage in what appears to us to be a game.<eos> A game...<eos> Naming the shapes as they come by<eos> This, however, is the only reality that they know even though they are seeing merely shadows of images.
There's been some interesting debate about your children.<eos> They were born here, so technically, they're American citizens.<eos> Can that be revoked?<eos> Can they be sent back to Russia?<eos> Oh, they don't speak Russian, do they?
I could never forget that.<eos> You will get what you deserve.<eos> Good.<eos> You know, my bosses in Langley will know I copied that list.<eos> They're gonna come looking for me, if they're not already.
"bird boat universe"<eos> meaning ﬂying boats from the universe.<eos> The ancient Sanskrit writings of India have elaborate descriptions of "vimana" or "ﬂying craft".<eos> These texts are thousands of years old.<eos> They predate any conception that we have of spacecraft or aircraft.
It was very comfortable.<eos> No feeling of being shocked or anything else.<eos> Just a, you know, good feeling, comfortable.<eos> What scientists need to do and normal people need to do is they need to look at the hardcore evidence, decide that, oh my gosh, ETs are real, and then get over that.<eos> And if that's the case, then you can start extrapolating because they're getting here which means they have solved the physics problem, if you will.
Objects made incursions over our WSA, fired pencil-thin beams of light into them, and adversely affected the ordinance possibly.<eos> There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes.<eos> Though also some were alive.<eos> What do members plan to do with their information?<eos> They hope Congress and President Bush take notice.
The shock, I think, and the surprise was and the absolute certainty that Dr. Lachman had was that this specimen is between the age of six to eight years old.<eos> The shock was that this specimen was clearly not fetal.<eos> How do you explain how something six inches tail survived to any length of time that would allow for it to survive<eos> 100 or 1,000 years ago?<eos> And what amazes me is the media, while their so compromised in this, they don't dare do anything but follow the company line, right?
You'll protect me?<eos> Well, I think that depends on what you tell us right now.<eos> We had a good thing going.<eos> My guys at the Port of Newark would... load me up with palettes of wine and booze they lifted from off-load.<eos> I'd take care of them, sell the booze to the charities, they'd take care of me.
You've been to Thanksgiving with my parents.<eos> Yeah, no, I know, it's horrible.<eos> She loves our Thanksgivings.<eos> Oh, in your parents' apartment?<eos> They go to South Beach.
Six pounds of pressure, you can rip someone's ear off, but an eye... takes dedication.<eos> The whole time, Jimmy was squealing like a little stuck bitch.<eos> Prison's a disease.<eos> It gets in your blood.<eos> You pass it to your kids, and they pass it to their kids.
Whose idea was this?<eos> Those boys are a bad influence.<eos> They're my best friends, mom.<eos> Best friends don't ask you to participate in criminal mischief.<eos> They didn't mean to--
I'm on my way.<eos> I mean, what's the big deal?<eos> I just wanted to see my buds, right?<eos> It's okay, Truman, just chill.<eos> They wouldn't even let me into my own post.

He had so much debt, he had to disappear.<eos> He may be dead.<eos> But his parents are still alive.<eos> I'll make them pay<eos> But they're innocent.
Hey, Mike, this the guy?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Would you like to meet the players, son?<eos> Get your hand off me, bitch!<eos> I'm only here so they can sit in the handicapped section.
Come on, let's go!<eos> Quit causing problems for everyone!<eos> I'm asking you a question!<eos> Your sister is good to you, so why do you steal her boyfriends?<eos> I don't steal them, they dumped her all by themselves!
Don't blame me for that.<eos> Sis, all these years, I've been blaming you.<eos> I was angry at you for stealing my boyfriends.<eos> I thought you were trying to take them from me.<eos> But I get it now. You were trying to see if they really loved me.
Do I have to?<eos> [Speaking Spanish] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Cesar.<eos> Emilio, why don't you just hang out here with us today?<eos> Oh, that's a great idea, because then the kids will have each other.<eos> He's sullen, she's mute, we won't even know they're here.
It's nothing I'm used to.<eos> [ Breathes deeply ]<eos> These horses know what they're doing and where they're going.<eos> Just try to relax and enjoy the ride.<eos> They'll take care of you if you let them.
Oh, yeah, man.<eos> Don't worry, Marge.<eos> We'll get them.<eos> Unless we die on this icy mountain road.<eos> Then they've won forever.
Okay, so I was pretty darn nervous about Brick going to Chicago, but I figured once I heard the details of the trip, I would feel better.<eos> I was wrong-- very, very wrong.<eos> Now as far as the hotel goes, we won't have an adult in each room, but the kids will be trusted to monitor themselves.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> They'll have exactly 26 minutes to wander around the Observation Deck on the 103 floor.
Bye-bye.<eos> That was a great show.<eos> Right?<eos> That was unbelievable.<eos> And the fans... they were with me the whole time, every step.
- All right?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> Your cousins are sick, man.<eos> - They've got a Jacuzzi.
so it was almost a sort of festival type atmosphere.<eos> That was when, essentially, they come together, they mate and then, after that, lots of young calves are being born.<eos> Since the end of the drought, over 220 calves have been born in Amboseli, and that number is still rising.<eos> It's the biggest elephant baby boom on record.<eos> I think what's lovely to see in that situation is that having been through such a terrible drought, to see the way in which, you know, if you let things alone, you know, they do have incredible capacity to bounce back.
These path-makers are surprisingly stealthy.<eos> But as night falls, there's a chance of catching a glimpse of them.<eos> Forest elephants are very social creatures, but in dense jungle it's hard for them to find one another.<eos> These elephants are lucky.<eos> Here in the Congo, there is one special place where they can meet and mingle.
All across the world, turtles are in decline.<eos> Their eggs are stolen, the adults are hunted for their flesh and they drown in fishing nets.<eos> But here in the Comoros, they have friends.<eos> It's amazing here in Itsamia.<eos> It's just a really heartening story of how the local people are doing everything they can to protect sort of what they think of as their turtles.
And the tilapia are almost blind in the darkness.<eos> In panic, they all leap to escape the hunters' approach.<eos> But this female can't abandon her brood.<eos> The crocodiles won't be thwarted.<eos> They too can leap.
(Noah) Hey!<eos> George!<eos> We heard you signed up for the "Dads of Chatswin" calendar.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> These dads, they... they think they're coming off as sexy, but they look like fools.
Convicted felons.<eos> They're unreliable witnesses.<eos> Maybe individually, but there is a clear pattern here.<eos> And if we can prove that all of these violent men have one abuser in common, Martin Schultz, we've got a shot at taking him down.<eos> Yeah, but the problem is, prisoners don't want to admit they were abused.
- What are male models like? - Shirks.<eos> Are you attracted to models but you just know not to mess with them?<eos> Yeah, I mean, of course, you're like, yeah, take your shirt off.<eos> Honestly, they're so out of my reach that they don't even register as sexual to me.<eos> No, but the thing is, they're, for the most part, the young guys are pretty gullible so I will always just text them, "send a dick pic."

I did nothing then.<eos> I was just standing there when the fight started.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> When I was a boy at school,<eos> I refused to kill my teacher, so the rebel soldiers made me watch while they did.
I'm, er, sorry, very sorry, officer.<eos> You're him, aren't you?<eos> Very sorry, officer.<eos> You're Doctor Who.<eos> Wait till I tell the kids. They bloomin' love you!
Of course.<eos> By making a success in something else.<eos> Why do you think children like you?<eos> Because you're rather a grumpy sort of person.<eos> They find me a cross between the Wizard of Oz and Father Christmas, you know.
- Excuse me?<eos> - I'm staying.<eos> But... but... but you can't.<eos> It'll be a disaster... for the children of Portugal.<eos> They can wait.
- Those guys saved us from The Reach!<eos> - Precisely. Care to return the favor?<eos> And in the process, strike a critical blow against The Reach?<eos> Dude, you're asking us to go inside the Warworld and rescue superheroes.<eos> If they got caught, what chance do we have?
The moment he walked in here, he didn't want to hear good news from me.<eos> He's looking for problems.<eos> 'I reckon it causes more problems, them coming around.<eos> You know, the old ones, they find it stressful with some stranger coming around with a suit on, eyeing everybody up and down.<eos> They don't think of that, though, do they?
- Hold on.<eos> I said I was considering it.<eos> Taking care of these kids would be your life.<eos> It already is.<eos> You're prepared to be responsible until they're 18?
You broke the TV remote last month for no reason.<eos> - It wouldn't work.<eos> That's a good reason.<eos> - We get weepy.<eos> They get angry.
We're gonna help the rebels, you and me, for Danny.<eos> So you can track them?<eos> When the pendants are turned on, yes.<eos> I'll bring you more pendants.<eos> Scientists, they'll build you more amplifiers.
I had a dinner like that with your dad's parents.<eos> They greeted me at the door with big hugs. And they were so nice to me.<eos> When we all sat down, that's when I told them I was pregnant.<eos> They started yelling at me and calling me horrible things.<eos> They said that I had ruined Kevin's life.
What about him?<eos> - You know him? - Um...<eos> My file has this listed as his last residence.<eos> It says he lived here with his parents, a Thomas Cole and an Evelyn Price.<eos> Oh, oh, they lived here a long time ago.
Then the government will pay and you will enjoy.<eos> But sir, it doesn't look nice.<eos> Did it look nice when you stole my uniform?<eos> And even ministers make such excuses and go abroad.<eos> They don't go to work.
I wish I could.<eos> But I don't even know who they are.<eos> It's all arranged through double-blind contacts.<eos> These Wall Street-types, they're good at avoiding jail time.<eos> They might be. You're not.
Oh, I know.<eos> Well, I am really hearing a lot today.<eos> Ryan refuses to compromise, and Danny rubs a poisonous cream on his man region.<eos> Thank you, ears, for helping me listen.<eos> They're gonna cave.
Dick, the jobsworth.<eos> Dick, who always does it by the book.<eos> Dick, who never gets asked to the pub at lunchtime.<eos> That's just what bullies do, isn't it?<eos> They, er... ..you know, they, well, they turn the pack against you by setting you apart from the group.
Oh, Jake came into my shop.<eos> Tammy's Tatties.<eos> See, once you get it in your head, you can't get it out.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> Yeah, a couple of us guys from the base went out drinking, and they bet me 100 bucks that I wouldn't get this tattoo of two arms coming out of my butt crack.
I'm done talking.<eos> You've said plenty.<eos> A professional like yourself wouldn't trust the camp to protect you.<eos> You had to get some sort of insurance directly from the parents, didn't you?<eos> Make sure that they were just as culpable for the crime.
Look, Mr Segers.<eos> With your correct income, your correctly declared income, you have to bear the legal costs yourself.<eos> Unlike lots of criminals who, and this won't surprise you, don't have a correctly declared income and therefore receive legal aid.<eos> And contrary to what you may think, legal aid lawyers don't do it for love, nor are they driven by unstoppable, irrepressible idealism.<eos> They send their rather substantial bill to the State.
They're right there -- keys.<eos> [ Keys jingle ]<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What do these guys think?<eos> They think I'm gonna give them a name?
- and I can't wait to hear...<eos> - You see?<eos> Are you watching?<eos> Castle, if the kidnappers knew that Alexis and Sara were friends--<eos> They did know.
I want you to kill him for me.<eos> We have a traitor in our midst.<eos> He just made his last mistake.<eos> Lawyers for John Nickels spoke to the press today.<eos> They say they're pleased the D.A. declined to indict their client on charges stemming from the recent fire in one of Nickel's buildings.
Leave the dragon out of it.<eos> It's over.<eos> - Oh, it's over.<eos> - Yeah, it's so over, it's under. - What was that about?<eos> - Eh, they'll be back.
Not without giving Isabel Rochev and the hoods a pretty good idea of what I'm capable of.<eos> I think what Felicity's wondering is whether you avoided taking those hoods on.<eos> And, Oliver, she's not the only one wondering.<eos> I told you, I did not come back to Starling City to be the Vigilante.<eos> But they came after you, Oliver.
Do you know who they are?<eos> I think the hoods gives me a pretty good idea.<eos> Bring them in.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Typically when I bring in guys that you've gone after, they're a little more dead.
-What Slobs.<eos> I saw that she stole document from the vault.<eos> I do not know how they got hold of. Recover them.<eos> Garrido tried to come up these documents.<eos> They are all actions dirty hotel.
After Sir David Attenborough.<eos> Now, we can only do this because<eos> Joseph has spent a lot of time with these lemurs.<eos> So they trust him.<eos> And therefore, it seems, they trust me.
The trusty bishop is his diagonal attack.<eos> The rook, he patrols the entire board.<eos> He can move as many spaces as he wants, as long as it's in the same direction he was moving.<eos> Oh yes, the pawns.<eos> They are the front line.
I'm against the wall here, though, and I don't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Chess is no different than life.<eos> These suburban kids, they know they get good grades, they go off to college.<eos> They know they're going to own their own business someday.
I'm sorry.<eos> Chess is no different than life.<eos> These suburban kids, they know they get good grades, they go off to college.<eos> They know they're going to own their own business someday.<eos> They envision the end game.
You know, eight years I've been at Maud Alton and...<eos> I've just been trying to make do with what little money they give us.<eos> We're all doing the best we can, most of us high ups, teachers, parents, kids.<eos> In all my years I have seen very few people make a real difference.<eos> These kids... they need you.
It only gets worse.<eos> He is only fourteen years old.<eos> He bumped into me and then... Eww.<eos> I'll talk with them.<eos> They listen to me..
But some things stay with you for a long time<eos> It puts a strain on my body afterwards<eos> How did you know about the crime scene?<eos> Did you touch something?<eos> I touch these guys I can see some of the things they saw
Okay, you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, the dragons lost their ability to breathe fire in the Caverns of Chaos.<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> They didn't even go to the Caverns of Chaos until they solved the mystery of the missing map.
This unsub's devolving. He'll stand out.<eos> He won't be hard to find.<eos> I'm gonna use the head before we leave.<eos> I have arrested every one of these kids.<eos> I never once thought they were getting molested.
I think she was quite lively, and a wonderful person in her younger years.<eos> I mean, she must have been a delight.<eos> I can see how they worshipped her, because she was doing the adventures that, normally, a parent would probably not do.<eos> Life was more adventurous with her around.<eos> She was very opinionated about how children should spend their time, and mainly how they should spend it was out and about with her.
I can see how they worshipped her, because she was doing the adventures that, normally, a parent would probably not do.<eos> Life was more adventurous with her around.<eos> She was very opinionated about how children should spend their time, and mainly how they should spend it was out and about with her.<eos> She would load up the stroller with the baby and her bag, and both kids, and off they would go on outings.<eos> And they had their routine.
"These men, they'll have you sit on... on their laps. "And then you'll feel something poking you."<eos> And I can't remember the context of when she said that, but it just was, she had this, like, anger in her towards men.<eos> And now, I know exactly what she was talking about, but as a kid, I really... I knew what she was saying was dark, and a little not right.<eos> I've seen her more than once jump back in fear, you know, from a man.<eos> She said several times over the several years, men, all they were out to do is ruin you, stay away from them, be careful of them, you know, that all they want is sex.
So I went across the street, and at that point, they were loading her onto the little cart there. And she was telling the people, the paramedics and such, that she did not want to go, she wanted to go home.<eos> And they said that she has to go with.<eos> And she looked at me as if to say, "Can you do something?"<eos> But, nothing I could do about it.<eos> I asked the paramedics, they said, "No, she has to go."
But from the moment they're born... that baby comes out and you act proud and excited and hand out cigars... but you don't feel anything.<eos> Especially if you had a difficult childhood.<eos> You want to love them, but you don't.<eos> And the fact that you're... faking that feeling makes you wonder if your own father had the same problem.<eos> Then one day they get older... and you see them do something... and you feel... that feeling that you were pretending to have.
And mine's even better, I guarantee.<eos> They're gonna take our creative and give it to one of the big boys.<eos> Second place, tied with last.<eos> Come on, you know I'm right.<eos> So they want a name brand.
Yeah?<eos> You and the Dream Team?<eos> You don't have a monopoly on this building?<eos> 'Cause we talked to our friends in Narcotics, and they had a lot to say about you.<eos> They got the wrong dude.
Keith, don't go to bed.<eos> You're on with POD in 15.<eos> 'The new MH67 Contusion Helicopter carries, as standard, '40 Venom HE missiles, 2,00030mm armour-piercing rounds 'and has a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition.'<eos> Why have they sent us a copy of The Living Planet?<eos> "Viewers are warned that they may find"
Can't I just stay in England?<eos> With Suze.<eos> Her parents said they'd put me up.<eos> They love me.<eos> They said yes.
Don't break my heart, Petra.<eos> I keep saying to my oil guys,<eos> "Do you really want sole drilling rights to this enormous oil field?<eos> "Because I could be missing out on some very nice hot dogs."<eos> But they do seem infuriatingly keen.
I'm anti-them because I don't think<eos> I want to be someone's subject.<eos> And their very existence implies a class-divided society, doesn't it?<eos> It does.<eos> And that is why I think they should all be shot.
What in the name of all that is holy is going on in your country?<eos> No sooner has Prince Charming nailed us the oil contract, you let the whole place burst into flames.<eos> Have you at any time handed any classified documents or information to anyone you shouldn't have?<eos> I want to make improvements to my breasts.<eos> They need some work, eh?
What's happened?<eos> There was an anti-government demonstration this morning and we had a lot of injured in.<eos> Then the police turned up and took away three men.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> It's not about me. They claimed they were the ring leaders.
He was alone, and he... he had blood all over his shirt.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm gonna have this view from my house one day, with all glass ceilings so you can see the sky.<eos> Pastor Mike told me about these apartments the government runs.<eos> Just give them 200 bucks, and they help you with the rent.
The deposit.<eos> You'll receive the rest when we dock.<eos> You know the most important thing I learned out here?<eos> We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.<eos> They should be the ones to be afraid of us.
So I floated out there for 2 days until one of those coast guard helicopters finally spotted me.<eos> I thought I was safe but suddenly this shark leaped up and bit my leg.<eos> 6 people went into the water and one little girl came out.<eos> The sharks took the rest.<eos> They took my grandfather.
Aunt Princess Naomi's magic castle is full of hidden treasures.<eos> Do you guys like designer shoes?<eos> Know what you're gonna say.<eos> I shouldn't take them anywhere without telling you.<eos> But you... understood what they needed more than I did, because... you know what it feels like to be the kid everyone lied to.
Hey.<eos> Hey. How's Jimmy Stewart?<eos> You know, up half the night waiting for the neighbor to move the body.<eos> So did tech get anything on our killer's car in the alley?<eos> Yeah, they identified it as a late-model, light-colored CLS550.
Hey, you burn through that box of rubbers yet?<eos> What are rubbers?<eos> - Hey, don't interrupt.<eos> Nice to see you don't talk down to them.<eos> Well, I love kids, and they love me.
We've only lost a battle, is all.<eos> Despite Robert Greg gloating in the lobby at Westminster, this isn't over.<eos> All these men have signed a document.<eos> All the more reason for another meeting.<eos> They'll not risk their jobs.
I should be celebrating my sister's wedding now.<eos> We all should!<eos> Master Robert's scared I'll tell Doherty what he did to me.<eos> You know, indentures are the only documents we've signed.<eos> They say nothing about locking us up on Sundays.
Four years later, the aunt goes in for selling pot.<eos> - They both die in prison.<eos> - Nice family.<eos> Yeah, well, Jimmy would've ended up in jail, too, without his aunt's neighbors, the Givens family.<eos> They fostered him.
Yeah, I'm a little curious about that myself.<eos> We were gambling.<eos> Oh, please, I'm not sleeping my way through every comped suite.<eos> I bring the big players luck.<eos> They keep my pockets full.
It might seem strange, Evil deeds but do not bother me, but to do The impact this will have on them.<eos> It will destroy them.<eos> You can lose a little bit what they have.<eos> They're my family.<eos> They do not need to pay them the fault measured.
Aah! Aah! I'm so excited!<eos> We all know how important middle names are.<eos> (Laughs) Yeah! Ohh. (Inhales) Got that done.<eos> I'm so sorry about my parents the other night.<eos> They took the breakup pretty hard.
So early?<eos> We have the young and the elderly to look after.<eos> You guys have fun.<eos> What's with you?<eos> I was just thinking our parents if they could see you like this they would've been ecstatic.
(Mouth full) What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is that together, we are awesome.<eos> But alone, only I am still awesome.<eos> - Huh? - They made a huge mistake when they had three kids.<eos> So as long as we stick together, we get stronger, and they get weaker.
It's cold and gloomy and totally isolated this time of year.<eos> Hmm. I'm listening.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> It'll be good luck too.<eos> My parents spent their honeymoon there, and they're like...
You guys, all of the prescription bottles in their medicine cabinet are made out to a Gloria Lecroix.<eos> Who's that?<eos> I don't know, but I'm really worried about her.<eos> She's clinically depressed, she has A.D.D., and a thyroid problem.<eos> And they have her pills.
Can you honestly not cook anything other than beans?<eos> What's that?<eos> Fly paper.<eos> Do you still not like insects?<eos> You know, they've got their place.
Thank you, thank you.<eos> '..we were back on our way.'<eos> It is amazing, those guys actually turned out to be Ugandan army.<eos> Up here training.<eos> God, they are strong.
You live in water and you're made of water, so sound has no problem at all travelling from the outside to the inside, but when life emerged from the oceans onto the land, then hearing became a big problem.<eos> See, sound doesn't travel well from air into water.<eos> If I make a noise now... ..over 99.9% of the sound is reflected back off the surface of the water.<eos> It's because of that reflection that underwater you can hear very little from above the surface.<eos> And it's exactly the same problem our ears face, because they too are filled with fluid.
The reason is quite simple.<eos> Small things have relatively large muscles compared to their tiny body mass and this makes them very powerful.<eos> The beetles also appear to have a cavalier attitude to the effects of gravity.<eos> They fight almost like sumo wrestlers, their aim is to throw each other off the branch.<eos> If they should fall... they just bounce and walk off.
Its surface area is one by one by one, six times, so it's six.<eos> So, this has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1.<eos> So, as you go from big to small, your surface area to volume ratio increases.<eos> Small animals, like bats, have a huge surface area compared to their volume.<eos> As a result, they naturally lose heat at a very high rate.
Seems like every time we take one of these guys down, another five grow in their place.<eos> Each one worse than the next.<eos> Barbosa was gunned down in a high-noon shootout with local law enforcement in Tijuana, Mexico.<eos> Wow, big catch.<eos> Well, they were backed by Americans.
Honest.<eos> They didn't want to kill you.<eos> If they wanted to, you'd be dead.<eos> Okay?<eos> They shot Detective Sanchez first.
We found this bird outside.<eos> We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones.<eos> Tougher than it looked, though.<eos> We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster, at catching animals.<eos> They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
But my family seemed to have a lot of money, so I chose to study abroad.<eos> I broke off from my family on the plane.<eos> Then my father passed away.<eos> My brothers came to me with the consent to forfeit inheritance.<eos> They asked me to really not become one of them.
Come quickly!<eos> I wanted to show you animals that love the winter.<eos> I came because I wanted to see them.<eos> In the hot summer, they don't even get out of the water.<eos> They just hang onto the ice that the trainers give them.
You don't sound as if you want to go back.<eos> Your grandmother said you could stay if you want.<eos> She said that she'd talk to your mom and dad.<eos> She did talk to them, and then they talked to me, and I don't know, I don't want the first thing I do after having a baby to be breaking a promise to my parents.<eos> I promised them I'd come home when, as they put it, all of this was over, and it's over.
- Aw! - Mmm come on.<eos> - We got this.<eos> - Yeah, we do.<eos> Oh, we don't need to knock around here. Oh.<eos> Winners win and losers lose, and alcoholics, they just booze!
If this is to come duplicitous how to do Does not happen<eos> Indeed I am afraid<eos> - Can I say a few words?<eos> - Of course<eos> The three men say they have the gods, and the use of But if bold enough They can retain a statue
Alibi.<eos> Heckle.<eos> Maddy.<eos> I'm sorry if my poster campaign offended anyone but, some candidates claim that they're doing things for you...<eos> But are they really just in it for themselves?
Probably worse.<eos> Sheila is a very special girl.<eos> My parents say the same about me.<eos> We are Brahmin and I'm a doctor with a Western education quite a catch back home.<eos> They would never consent to an alliance they did not arrange especially to a working-class White girl like Sheila.
What do your sons do?<eos> I assume they do something.<eos> Remember I met Larry at that dinner?<eos> Ah, don't remind me.<eos> They do work.
You've got my attention.<eos> Two weapons, Soviet, late '70s, 17-kiloton capacity.<eos> There was a third that was just detonated.<eos> Talk to your friends in the Kremlin.<eos> They will confirm the weapon's viability.
Hmm. He didn't do it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Uh, if he did do it, he did at as some sort of accomplice to Red John, right?<eos> True.<eos> But Red John always offers his friends something that they don't have.
And him.<eos> Yeah, but for how long?<eos> You said this was temporary.<eos> Well, that depends on their banana business.<eos> I mean, if it takes off then so will they.
I'm here now. Can't I ask a simple question?<eos> It's ok, Tom.<eos> We understand your frustration, but that's why we asked the FBI to help.<eos> Their top profilers are here.<eos> What happens if another person gets their head chopped off while they're busy profiling?
We will.<eos> Just take a breath.<eos> I love my children.<eos> Please tell them.<eos> They know.
Then I need to know why I find them so attractive.<eos> I need to hear our folks' side of things, from them.<eos> Agnes, our parents will disappoint you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> They have done nothing but.
In the decades for which scientists have been smashing together particles to probe the subatomic world, they have found two basic types of particles.<eos> There are fermions, a group of massive particles that carry matter, and there are bosons, massless particles that carry force.<eos> Without the existence of the Higgs, all particles would be massless.<eos> So, if there was no Higgs field, you would have had these other force carriers.<eos> They would have been massless, and therefore, like the particles of light, they would move at the speed of light.
This is a heavy particle, but naively, we'd expect, according to the standard model, that the Higgs should be much, much heavier than this.<eos> And for some reason, it's lighter.<eos> The Higgs has weight issues.<eos> Just as the Higgs boson gives mass to other particles, other particles, in turn, contribute to the mass of the Higgs.<eos> When physicists work out how big the Higgs should get from these other particles, they come up with a weight billions of times heavier than it is.
You're an awesome doctor who has three clothes closets.<eos> Five if you count work.<eos> And all by the age of, what, are you, like, 28?<eos> Mm-hmm, I'm 28.<eos> No, my friends, they just use me for free birth control, and they criticize me for being chubby.
His grieving widow doesn't think he was a traitor?<eos> Why didn't you say?<eos> That makes all the difference.<eos> Have you talked to his kids?<eos> I'm dying to know what they think.
If you'd like to know about MI6's activities,<eos> - I suggest you ask MI6.<eos> - What about his trips to Hong Kong?<eos> Were those sanctioned by the consulate?<eos> They have been investigated.
OK, so, let's assume for a minute that Jessica's telling the truth.<eos> There has to be someone or something that connects these two victims.<eos> - What else do we know about them?<eos> - Well, I did some digging and these guys have totally different careers.<eos> They live on opposite sides of town.
I was a virgin for a really long time, and then I wasn't.<eos> Uh, I... really wanted to wait for someone like you... for marriage, but I screwed up.<eos> And I was just...<eos> I was so scared to tell you.<eos> But then I was watching these guys today, and they-they literally have nothing left, and they're making do.
Yeah, really.<eos> So, no murder weapon?<eos> No.<eos> Smear is from one of the victim's partners.<eos> They're the ones that found him.
Getting away from your past and your mom, that ain't gonna make 'em disappear.<eos> It's your landscape.<eos> It's your life; accept that.<eos> And then this file is just a piece of paper, and these dirty, trickin' pain in the asses, they got nothing on you.<eos> They think they're smarter than us, kid.
Nothing.<eos> "That pays Mrs.Corbett a fraction of what her male counterparts earn."<eos> Of course the men earn more.<eos> Their work is different.<eos> They do the heavy lifting.
Hell, I was a victim of that same psychotic behavior.<eos> Right.<eos> You're such a victim.<eos> How many of my men did you just kill?<eos> They used to be my men too.
You can see them?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And you still stay here?<eos> Do you think they are all haunted?<eos> They are attached to the land itself, not to the house.
Sometimes.<eos> And you still stay here?<eos> Do you think they are all haunted?<eos> They are attached to the land itself, not to the house.<eos> I have stayed here for decades, but they have been here for centuries.
I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> Tumors do not grow in a couple of days.<eos> Maybe I was just not felt.<eos> Then doctors had seen some.<eos> - They do not know everything, huh.
Oh, yeah, no worries.<eos> You know what? I probably just left them in my car.<eos> So what makes you think these guys are under orders not to talk to us?<eos> Because they're not talking to us.<eos> Maybe they did this, you know.
I hope he has the opportunity to find out.<eos> What would you do with that kind of money?<eos> Buy a nice house in Yellowknife, spend money on my children.<eos> They would grow up spoiled.<eos> If they grew up at all, I'd probably lose them in the woods first.
And then they trash your fun zone on the way out.<eos> Then they suck your boobs until your nipples look like the worn-out thumb on a work glove.<eos> You do paint a picture with your words.<eos> And then it gets really bad.<eos> They take your sleep, your time, your favorite dress, keys to your car, the weed you had hidden in a cowboy boot in the back of your closet.
Confess it.<eos> - No, sir!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> You pander and pimp those boys, who ought to be safe in your care.<eos> They swing for such, do they not, Sergeant?
And he is preparing to do so.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Is he going to kill them?<eos> No, Inspector.<eos> They will kill themselves...in their numbers, in pure exaltation.
As the butterfly casts off its husk to soar, shall you leave forever this land of the dead.<eos> It is time. You shall be reunited with your love.<eos> Where's Bennet?<eos> With his brothers and sisters.<eos> They're so blessed, Rose.
And life, Mr Reid, is offended by you and me.<eos> Mr Blewett?<eos> Mr Blewett?<eos> Mr Blewett? Is that my name atop of tonight's bill? It is, Rose.<eos> And I hope to not receive another visit from your friends and they now appreciate the efforts I make for you.
I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> Sorry. I'm nearly there.<eos> The kids eat that?<eos> No.<eos> They had pizza earlier.
Come with me, come on.<eos> Are you okay? Yeah.<eos> Just having a bit of craic with the boys.<eos> Your friends normally kick the shit out of you?<eos> They didn't do this to me.
A trained hunter can use scent to track them.<eos> If the wind is with them, wolves can track a scent by a distance of two Miles, which means we can draw them to us...<eos> Or into a trap.<eos> Full moon does give us one advantage.<eos> They'll have a higher heat signature, which makes them easier to spot with infrared.
They'll have a higher heat signature, which makes them easier to spot with infrared.<eos> Thanks, but I've got my own.<eos> Just remember, we're not hunting wild animals.<eos> Underneath those impulses are two intelligent human beings.<eos> Don't think they can't rely on that human side.
Do you know what the word "druid" means in Gaelic?<eos> - No.<eos> - "Wise oak."<eos> The Celtic druids were close to nature.<eos> They believed they kept it in balance.
- No.<eos> - "Wise oak."<eos> The Celtic druids were close to nature.<eos> They believed they kept it in balance.<eos> They were philosophers and scholars.
- "Wise oak."<eos> The Celtic druids were close to nature.<eos> They believed they kept it in balance.<eos> They were philosophers and scholars.<eos> They weren't serial killers.
You know, she was so...<eos> - I should have known.<eos> - No.<eos> It's the boys, the school...<eos> They killed my baby.
Bryan will be doing the writing.<eos> The scripting, yeah.<eos> These guys have come up with some of the character concepts.<eos> Okay.<eos> They will be selling the comic.
Ok, so let me clarify here.<eos> Just because you and I appear to share a common goal doesn't give you a get out of jail free card.<eos> I don't need that card already, do I?<eos> Maybe our grave robbers can I.D. him.<eos> They've been shipped off to court for their arraignment.
Answer.<eos> Ok, what I've been up to, in case it's of interest to Liber8?<eos> Don't try to guess, we're talking.<eos> That's it.<eos> Listen to this, three dead bodies, they're all on the Fisker payroll.
Let's get you out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why would a Liber8 terrorist do this to you?<eos> Kill your friends, nearly kill you!<eos> You said it yourself, they're terrorists.
Basically the CIA for businesses.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I could tell by the way those soldiers were staring at me, they haven't a clue as to why I'm here.<eos> They were staring at you because you're an attractive woman and they've been running around the desert for months.
It's a signal booster for when the guys go underground.<eos> Helps with the radio, EKG and video relays.<eos> Bogey guard, 12 o'clock.<eos> He sees them.<eos> They're in.
Mikasa!<eos> How dare you tell my parents!<eos> I don't remember agreeing to help you.<eos> So how did it go?<eos> they weren't happy about it.
But they are necessary if we are to emerge victorious.<eos> We are playing a very dangerous and a very unforgiving game.<eos> By seducing their huntress, I take her out of their game.<eos> Ah, but not anymore because there she is, back on the board, hunting us, killing us.<eos> Do you not remember when we were the hunters and they were the prey?
We'll each get a half vote.<eos> And the four men cast their three votes.<eos> It's a tie.<eos> Uh, one and a half to one and a half.<eos> The twins were proud to show that they voted differently from one another.
I feel $20,000 is a fair price for my efforts so far.<eos> Now, how about we go and kill those men so I can be on my way?<eos> It's getting late.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> They're in the back room.
Humans can use these blueprints and create modern windmills.<eos> In a sense, you could say that windmills have evolved and multiplied.<eos> However, something important is missing.<eos> Windmills cannot grow all by themselves.<eos> They rely on humans to assemble them, but the first forms of life must've assembled themselves.
I took revenge on them and kicked few butts<eos> They chased me for months It was really tough<eos> Boxers work out tremendously<eos> They are different from normal people<eos> They didn't know so they just came at me
How much we thinking?<eos> Well, it's hard to tell from the photos Deeks sent, but if they're real-- and there's no real reason to believe that they're not-- I'm guessing $10 million, maybe more.<eos> That's a lot of bling.<eos> NCIS in Washington has seen a recent influx in blood diamonds.<eos> They're untraceable, won't set off any metal detectors, and you can carry millions-worth in your pocket.
- Coffee?<eos> Right.<eos> Jon Fosse is the man.<eos> His texts are open to interpretation.<eos> They describe feelings without becoming trite.
Wait there for you, yeah?<eos> I sent you a message - come to my shop.<eos> You no come.<eos> Many messages.<eos> They never came through.
Despite my relaxed attitude to study, I graduated with first-class honours and left Oxford for Cambridge University to begin my PhD.<eos> Yet little did I know I would soon be diagnosed with a crippling illness that would change my life forever.<eos> Well, Stephen's speed of communication has very gradually slowed down.<eos> A few years ago, he was still able to use his hand switch and able to communicate by clicking this switch on his wheelchair.<eos> When he wasn't able to do that any more, we switched over to a switch that he mounted to his cheek, but with him slowing down with that we've approached his sponsors and so they've been looking into facial recognition.
We were absolutely stunned.<eos> It was just the two of you in the room?<eos> There were no other witnesses to this proclamation?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Well, according to your party guests, He was only in the water for a minute. But when they pulled him out, he was already dead.
Yeah.<eos> So, uh... so what's your plan here?<eos> I figured I'd wait till they mature a little more and then release them into the wild.<eos> You can't just throw domesticated bunnies back into the wild, Brick.<eos> They don't know what to do!
So, uh... so what's your plan here?<eos> I figured I'd wait till they mature a little more and then release them into the wild.<eos> You can't just throw domesticated bunnies back into the wild, Brick.<eos> They don't know what to do!<eos> They don't know how to climb a tree to get an apple, and they can't outrun a pack of angry cows.
Maid cart, get it.<eos> I'll come back later.<eos> These boys are very weak.<eos> I see no damage.<eos> They're damaging your pride.
They're way more aggressive together than they would be alone.<eos> These six arrested at the scene?<eos> Unis picked them up when they were fleeing.<eos> Gabby's friends IDed them as pulling her into the crowd.<eos> Yeah, but they all insist that it was the crowd surge that pushed them into the victim.
One down, rest to go.<eos> Where are we on the other suspects in custody?<eos> Two gropers would fold on a lesser charge.<eos> The original three--nose ring, fohawk, tattoo--holding tight.<eos> Probably because they started it.
Where are we on the other suspects in custody?<eos> Two gropers would fold on a lesser charge.<eos> The original three--nose ring, fohawk, tattoo--holding tight.<eos> Probably because they started it.<eos> I mean, listen, Gabby remembers being at the club, but she's a little fuzzy on whether they were part of the attack.
There are beasts in the woods and beasts scream sometimes...<eos> There are beasts in the woods and beasts scream sometimes... the past is the passed...and never comes back...<eos> It does come back!<eos> It always does...<eos> These belonged to Italian soldiers when they were here on the border... they were filming... ﬁlming everything... they were filming... ﬁlming everything...
You work with them, Juan.<eos> What were their names?<eos> I don't know their real names.<eos> Okay, we weren't friends!<eos> I didn't ask who they were, they didn't ask about me.
Stay with us.<eos> What, we lost signal?<eos> No.<eos> No, there's no light source.<eos> We're seeing what it sees.
Stop anyone gets in our way.<eos> Strand.<eos> Dr. Strand?<eos> Maybe we let nature take its course.<eos> And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
I messed up a project and they kicked me out of YAPS. Oh.<eos> Tommy.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But Ms. Hadley still wants to see my project.<eos> But I don't know if it'll be ready.
I'm creating a new world...<eos> A better one.<eos> My, uh, [Chuckles] my Utopia.<eos> But a utopia cannot be a permanent place.<eos> It can exist only as a hopeful state.
Him...<eos> Your friend.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Ted.<eos> It's Ted, is it?
I'll let you know when I do.<eos> Captain, my research theorizes that rogue singularities can pass through realities move from universe to universe.<eos> Spock, what do the logs show?<eos> They are encrypted.<eos> But from what we've managed to decipher ...apparently the Defiant discovered this so-called "black hole" as it phased into our reality.
I want you to help me save my son.<eos> Tell me how!<eos> Please, hey, listen!<eos> Hey, look.<eos> It's my flesh and blood.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Tell us, Madame Fraser, what do English ladies call a male member?<eos> Ah, well, I've... heard it referred to as "peter."
I wanna be the solution for something.<eos> You know what this is?<eos> It's a tomato.<eos> First it was a seed.<eos> You take care of a garden and it takes care of you back.
Protection.<eos> Don't ever leave the circle until it's safe.<eos> I know what attacked you in your home.<eos> Your daughter is being hunted by a parasite.<eos> It wants to feed off her.
- You know where I could find him?<eos> - No... I don't even have his phone number<eos> I guess he's afraid that I won't leave him alone<eos> Do you think he started that fire?<eos> Well, I know that it didn't start itself
But that's not the point.<eos> What about the baby? Is...<eos> - Is the baby all right?<eos> - Yeah, the baby's fine.<eos> But, Darren, it's not yours.
A unique opportunity presented itself to us.<eos> The near-impervious country opened its doors to a joint scientific program between the University of Cambridge and North Korean volcanologists.<eos> And so we were invited to film there.<eos> But everything we saw was an act of presentation, and we went for it.<eos> There is no other way to see this enigmatic country other than how it wants to present itself.
And after we're finished, there will be no more war.<eos> No more pain.<eos> Especially now that we're together.<eos> It's time we took back this planet.<eos> Make it the home Inhumans have always deserved.
It's the only way I'll learn.<eos> Not going rogue.<eos> What's in the file, G?<eos> Why are you making this a thing?<eos> It's not a thing, but you're making it one.
Honey, that ship has sailed. You had your chance.<eos> I want Bulgaria.<eos> That job is booked.<eos> My guy's already on the ground.<eos> Who is it? Jones?
- and stood by the door, right? - Yes<eos> And you saw the man sitting with your grandson?<eos> - He was feeding and putting him to sleep? - Yes<eos> - So you must've seen his face, right?<eos> Can you identify if it was him?
- He was feeding and putting him to sleep? - Yes<eos> - So you must've seen his face, right?<eos> Can you identify if it was him?<eos> No!<eos> - It wasn't him?
Mom!<eos> It's good to be honest but there's a limit.<eos> What a paradox.<eos> The day of Our Lord's resurrection we bury this town.<eos> Just as well, it's a lost cause.
So we're invisible to the faction right now.<eos> And to the director.<eos> It won't be able to send a messenger or consciousness here, let alone itself.<eos> As soon as we know the director's back online, we'll be safe and we can turn off the defenses.<eos> Then it can either come back to the 21st or stay where it is.
Most bats catch flying insects on the wing, but there are so few of these in the desert that this bat must do things differently.<eos> It has to hunt on the ground.<eos> But what really sets it apart is what it's hunting a deathstalker scorpion.<eos> The venom of this species is potent enough to kill a human.<eos> Tackling it seems madness for a bat weighing just half an ounce.
The guy said fifteen years, if it's treated well.<eos> Fifteen years...<eos> Takes us to 2014.<eos> That's right.<eos> So we'll be turning forty when it dies.
Let's go.<eos> We can't go in for the next lwo days.<eos> Why'?<eos> Why'?<eos> Because as soon as a chick opens its eyes it looks for its mother.
In a long-forgotten box deep in the archives of the British Museum. And I can't imagine anyone has looked at them in years.<eos> In the 11th century a Carthusian monk known to us only as Brother Gregory began to lose his mind.<eos> He said he was possessed by a demon perhaps the father of all demons the fallen angel himself.<eos> In any event, this demon spoke to him in the Verbis Diablo.<eos> Brother Gregory wrote down what it said on whatever was to hand.
Come on.<eos> Time to complete your education.<eos> I give you a chance.<eos> The world's very cruel, Master.<eos> It laughs at your pain.
How? It's not just the mountain ash that keeps this building secure.<eos> It's the electromagnetic energy.<eos> Eichen is built on the convergence of Telluric currents.<eos> Ley lines.<eos> It's what allows it to keep certain supernatural creatures in.
Mother would have done everything to protect us.<eos> I'll say that to Mirra tomorrow,<eos> I hope she'll understand."<eos> Today's service will start with the message to the Galatians about the freedom of the spirit.<eos> It says that we shall not become hostages of the recent events but quite the opposite:
I just got over the whole pride thing, it's one of the seven deadlies.<eos> I've just started, you know, I'm not afraid to ask for help or ask somebody--<eos> Like, I don't need people to watch my back, I need them to watch my front, - Yeah.<eos> - Alcoholism has no friends.<eos> It wants to kill you, wants to kill him, wants to kill anybody it's involved with.
Show me this book.<eos> Show me this book if there is one!<eos> My rotten, no good, bastard father... .. was stupidly entrusted to deliver the Book of the Raven King to a man in the Derbyshire Hills, the last man in England who could read the King's letters.<eos> Unfortunately, en-route... he got himself embroiled in a drinking competition with a blacksmith in Sheffield, and when challenged proceeded to eat the book.<eos> Four years later, I was born... .. with it written all over my infant body.
Why do you say that?<eos> I love you, and you love me.<eos> Well, I love chocolate, but it's bad for me, so I don't eat it.<eos> Are you comparing me to chocolate?<eos> Well, it has the calories. You have the wife.
Bledsoe was right.<eos> If we run, Dad will just come after us again.<eos> The only way to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else is by going after him first.<eos> When that son of a bitch shows his face, I'll make him wish he stayed in Hell.<eos> Yeah, the world is a hard place to face alone, but it's just like that prison guard said.
What are you doing?<eos> - I am writing a new book.<eos> And?<eos> - Completely crazy.<eos> It describes how he wakes up in the modern Berlin .
Are you okay? Oh, uh... yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.<eos> I tried to take it in and stuff, but it had other ideas.
I think you should leave this house.<eos> - Why are you doing this? - Shh.<eos> You're in no shape to leave.<eos> Think of the baby.<eos> Preacher James, it's Robert, my brother.
What is this?<eos> This... this is the Silver Angel.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Now, are we gonna talk or we gonna drive?<eos> I don't feel as though I'm playing the violin so much as it's playing me.
- The DNA was verified. - Just listen, please.<eos> All right? I saw something in the Candyman's car and it's gonna sound crazy, all right?<eos> - But I know what I saw.<eos> - Okay. There was an ice chest in the passenger seat.<eos> It had a brain inside.
They two met at a club.<eos> He learned in America.<eos> It has nose holes.<eos> Wearing a nose ring.<eos> How does it look?
You can smooth and shape the hair.<eos> I think it'll be useful.<eos> I've never changed my hairstyle.<eos> Can I hold it?<eos> It's heavy, in't it?
Perfectly.<eos> Well, you have come so quickly.<eos> This is about Dyupvika.<eos> Yes, he was investigating the case Birkeland.<eos> It must return to work.
He called Maya-out in Murmansk.<eos> From this number.<eos> - What does it mean?<eos> - What you were saying.<eos> - Perhaps it was in Russia.
Now all he needs to do is sell the idea to the rest of the Mafia.<eos> After seven months in exile,<eos> Lucky Luciano leaves Italy in secret... and heads to a country that's become a safe haven for the mob... and is only 90 miles away from America...<eos> Cuba.<eos> Meyer Lansky's association with the Cuban government allows mobsters to operate without interference, making it the perfect place for Luciano to make his comeback.
Husband was found halfway down the hill, Tao.<eos> Really?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> Another vehicle like this one was about 50 yards ahead of the curve, and a small production crew was about the same distance behind, but no one was near enough to see the car when it went over the edge.
I was scared that... when you changed... you would have fangs and devil horns.<eos> - Oh. - But you're still my brother.<eos> Your brother the monster.<eos> It was the policeman.<eos> It had to be.
Heart will befall all of you. Noah.<eos> Noah isn't here, only Belial.<eos> Sorry, the book wasn't working fast enough.<eos> It's not working, Ronnie.<eos> Fight it to hold on, the harder you try it more it tears Noah apart before it moves on to you.
It's like we're different species.<eos> The human body is so interesting!<eos> Especially women's breasts.<eos> It's such a complex and strange shape!<eos> And yet, it's so beautiful... that we can make something that fits this form so perfectly.
I've been so busy with my list,<eos> I haven't spent much time at all with my sisters.<eos> There's still time.<eos> Grandma, do you really believe there's a treasure?<eos> It may be the only way to save Willows.
-Tiaras!<eos> [Joe] Well, thanks for handling all the hard stuff, girls.<eos> Those rapids were no day at the park. [barking] We found the treasure fair and square.<eos> Actually, this treasure belongs to the city.<eos> -Oh, it does?
Known as 'malodor', the host secretes rotting meat stench.<eos> Heard about her fall from her hospital room?<eos> Attempted suicide on February 1 0th.<eos> Suicide my ass.<eos> It tried to escape.
- Jung Kwan Jung-ryo.<eos> - What's that?<eos> It's a record of Tae-jong, Tang Dynasty's greatest ruler.<eos> Why's this complex text here?<eos> It's One-arm.
Not the cold, but the endless cycle of change.<eos> When the sun returns to the Arctic in spring, it launches the greatest event of seasonal change on Earth.<eos> A change that rules the life of the world's only sea ice hunter.<eos> The polar bear is totally dependent upon the sea ice in order to hunt.<eos> It must eat two thirds of the food it needs for the whole year in the next three months, before the sun melts the ice from beneath its feet.
Jamie has no chance to go into that ice with the boat, so it's my turn to move with the snow scooters towards the polar bears and try to film them, the first time.<eos> As it turned out, Rolf didn't have to move far.<eos> Polar bears are one of the few animals on Earth that will come and find you.<eos> Crazy!<eos> It's coming straight at us.
Ban Ban.<eos> Why does it look different?<eos> It has been starving.<eos> It will recover in a couple of days.<eos> It doesn't recognise me.
[narrator] Finally, Darren explores new photographic techniques in the waters of Papua New Guinea. Venturing into the depths of World War II history in the ocean's darkest hours.<eos> [uplifting music] [uplifting music] [uplifting music]<eos> [Darren] I'm fortunate enough to have spent the last 30 years of my life capturing and sharing the wonders of this planet.<eos> Of all the things I've photographed I love photographing the ocean the most.<eos> It's my love, it's my passion, the way the light falls in the sea, the creatures within it.
What are you looking for in a man?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Whatever you think is best.<eos> Well, what's best is whatever your heart desires.<eos> So what does it desire?
The talisman's losing power!<eos> They're fighting back!<eos> I'll look for it!<eos> The original unmaking spell is on my phone.<eos> If we cast it again, it'll unmake itself.
- We are...<eos> - So sorry.<eos> We know we fucked up, and we'll make it up to you. Uh... We'll get you the money back.<eos> See that you do.<eos> I obviously have a lot of anger, but I'm trying to let it go, because it's toxic.
- I'm going to miss you so much.<eos> - Promise me, you will be safe, OK!<eos> Dad, we are trying to have a moment.<eos> Oh, I got a phone card.<eos> - It has a thousand minutes, do you think that is enough?
That's why it's after Leah.<eos> - It wants her soul.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Demons can't just take souls, Mia.<eos> A soul needs to be offered to the demon before it can take it.
Who's Moses?<eos> Just before they hit me, I heard someone say, "You're up, Moses."<eos> You did?<eos> Was the tall one the one who threw the punch?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Hey Arjun. What are thinking?<eos> Little drops of water, fill up the ocean.<eos> Little grains of sand, the earth.<eos> Moment by moment, time collects to form age.<eos> You dare not call the moment small, for it's the creator of all.
It took us almost two hours to get out here.<eos> That's with you driving, too.<eos> We passed another forest preserve and a whole lot of space on the way.<eos> There's plenty of spots to dispose of bodies, so why put all 3 right here?<eos> Well, it's isolated.
..I got up this morning and I couldn't find my trousers.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> Yes, very funny.<eos> And I realised - I never know where anything is.<eos> You have to control your environment or it controls you.
The fish are lookin' well.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Did someone die?<eos> She thought I killed Scotty in here.<eos> I was getting it clean, the forensics.
It's Thea.<eos> I found this.<eos> Partial plate three blocks from the club.<eos> Car's registered to a Slade Wilson, and it has GPS.<eos> Where is it right now?
Landmines?<eos> What kind of island is this?<eos> Can you remove the explosive?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Without it going off, eh.
Well, I think I picked it up.<eos> "Monty the Magnificent.<eos> Fort Greene Theatre".<eos> This is our guy?<eos> It's not exactly hiding.
All right, give us a minute, please.<eos> - What do we got?<eos> - Does anyone have anything?<eos> - Do you have something?<eos> - It's a 132 gigabytes un-compressed, and it's a 3D video file.
I didn't want to say anything unless I had to.<eos> I wanted to let you shape your own destiny.<eos> What could you possibly know about my destiny?<eos> Glinda's the keeper of the book of records.<eos> It chronicles the past, present, and future of Oz.
♪ As the clouds roll by ♪ ♪ I can see the sun shine ♪<eos> ♪ mm mm hmm mm mm mm ♪ - It's dipping. - All right, how's that?<eos> Is that better? Huh.<eos> No, that side nes to come up.<eos> And pull it tighter--tight. It's as tight as it can go.
Your new bestie, if you're lucky.<eos> - He needs a temporary home.<eos> - Ugh, no.<eos> But it's a service dog.<eos> It gets you VIP access to places you wouldn't normally get to go to, like early entrance to the Barney's Warehouse Sale.
How about a grease fire in the middle of a Fourth of July Parade?<eos> Pulled into a car wash, put the flames out, still made the "1812 Overture."<eos> So, what you're saying is that this is a death trap.<eos> No, what I'm saying is this car is indestructible.<eos> After the apocalypse, it, my mother and cockroaches will be the only things that survive.
We can't I.D. Dante from this footage anyway.<eos> And you can tell that the guy taking the cash isn't Dante.<eos> I mean, even with this crappy video.<eos> Buzz: Hey, it's from an old VHS shut up in the case box for almost two decades.<eos> I had to splice it almost 100 times just to get it to play.
I'm not so easily distracted by a pretty face.<eos> Go.<eos> So, you're a fortune teller?<eos> I didn't choose the gift, Elsa.<eos> It chose me.
I logged it out for Ballistics on Friday.<eos> I logged it back in again yesterday.<eos> I'm not doubting you. We just need to see it.<eos> It's Tom.<eos> It must be.
Thank you.<eos> Hey man!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> The mosaic effect... is see-through!<eos> Can you make it more blurred?
Not that kind of hungry.<eos> I wouldn't answer that.<eos> I think it's time we had a talk.<eos> You took my baby from me?<eos> We thought we could lessen the danger with it under our control.
The vortex will open here again, but not in a billion years.<eos> Then when?<eos> Er, 74 hours.<eos> Three days.<eos> Three days to think of something new because now it knows what to expect, now it's scanned me and will kill me on sight, thanks to PE here.
Aaron Scobie.<eos> Who?<eos> Aaron Scobie!<eos> 'Prior.' Carl, we've got a name.<eos> It's an older boy Taylor had a crush on.
Early this morning before Cara.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know.<eos> Work up a profile on the new victim.<eos> Maybe it will give us something. On it.
Aaron Scobie.<eos> Who?<eos> Aaron Scobie!<eos> 'Prior.' Carl, we've got a name.<eos> It's an older boy Taylor had a crush on.
Let's go back to our story. As I was saying,<eos> Adam stole the fruit from God's tree and ate it.<eos> Now, when you steal something, you're required to put it back.<eos> But how could he? Adam had already eaten it.<eos> It had gone down inside, and become part of him.
I need backup at the Hudson River coal plant.<eos> There's the case.<eos> What's in it?<eos> Some kind of artifact.<eos> Must be valuable if it was worth killing over.
Thanks, Ma.<eos> You're the best.<eos> I hope my baby feels about me the way I feel about you.<eos> I'm sure it will.<eos> But what if I don't love my baby as much as it loves me?
No asylum for devil worshipers!<eos> - Get in,.<eos> Is your appearance really a guinea per square worth?<eos> Gentlemen, it sounds a bit cumbersome.<eos> It is not Beethoven.
I think this should be somehow due to the prophecy of Ruby,<eos> That's just...<eos> It is unlikely that the keepers lodge themselves understand what they mean.<eos> Well, may encounter with this mysterious Earl will shed some light on this.<eos> Lucy said, it is dangerous.
What Hannah is trying to say is we have good news.<eos> They found a body in the woods.<eos> The police believe it was a camper.<eos> It was Toby.<eos> No, Spence, it wasn't.
Ezra is taking on these big responsibilities.<eos> And he needs a job.<eos> The park rangers found a body.<eos> It was Toby.<eos> No, Spence, it wasn't.
You guys are nuts.<eos> I've never been to this place.<eos> Not according to your phone.<eos> Then arrest my phone.<eos> Maybe it was there, but I wasn't.
It's like I'm in this now.<eos> Believe me, you don't wanna be in it.<eos> And was the guy who jumped off the bus, was that the guy you were talking about?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Was it?
Jon'll do it.<eos> The government's made a deal with Svend Age Saltum<eos> Everything's already done.<eos> That doesn't mean it's a good deal.<eos> And not at all that it's acceptable
The entire fucking thing is now held underground by some big hooligan football league.<eos> It's all starting to fucking add up.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Multiple witness statements have all confirmed large groups of people entering the place where Joey was found the night before.<eos> I put money on it being one of those underground meets.
The adults return.<eos> But the cricket fights back.<eos> Squirting its own foul-tasting blood into their eyes.<eos> The cricket is still alive, but the stench of its blood attracts the attention of others.<eos> Now, it is the target.
It's just, um... so hot.<eos> I could actually Sue you, this coffee's so hot.<eos> in addition to being an amazing deejay, Marisa also bakes. Wow.<eos> She sounds like the whole package. Oh, god!<eos> It's so hot!
You going through my stuff now?<eos> You said you got rid of it.<eos> You said you wanted to start over clean.<eos> You lied.<eos> I'd love to forget about my past, but it ain't gonna forget about me.
The Khabur River.<eos> According to the Hebrew Bible, it was here, in the sixth century BC, that divine beings descended from heaven<eos> and made contact with a 30-year-old Hebrew priest named Ezekiel.<eos> Ezekiel was by the river Chebar and he said a great whirlwind came toward him.<eos> He described it as a fire enfolding itself, and out of the fire was the color of amber, which is the Hebrew word which means "polished specter of metal," which implies that it's metallic,
Don't even try it, Klaus.<eos> Enough!<eos> My leg is broken! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!<eos> Listen to my body.<eos> It knows what to do.
Laceration across the hallucis longus.<eos> Now, whatever did it took a chip out his shin bone as well so we're talking an impact of some force.<eos> But... here's the thing.<eos> Fragment of combat trouser retrieved from inside the gash.<eos> Now, the sharp-eyed among you will note that it shows no sign of burning, meaning it was pushed into the flesh before the fire took hold.
Are you suggesting I had something to do with this?<eos> The incident occurred shortly after an argument with you.<eos> Now again, what was the argument about?<eos> I saw her with another man, this afternoon on the quay.<eos> - Who was it?
- Why do we prepare?<eos> The first space will be Americans!<eos> - The rocket launch is scheduled for March, but it is factual that occur.<eos> And then it will be a suborbital flight.<eos> It will not last more than 15 minutes!
I'm not gonna let you ruin me the way you ruined Anne.<eos> I didn't ruin anyone.<eos> What, you think Anne was better off before?<eos> Sure, she wasn't clean or refined, she didn't not use your computer power cord as a belt, but she loved her life, openly, freely, unashamed.<eos> You ripped the horn off the unicorn, Ryan, because you wanted to make it a normal horse, but it'll never be a normal horse, because now there's that circular scab in its forehead.
- Guys, guys, he's with me.<eos> I told you to stay in the car.<eos> Yet, as you know, I'm insane and therefore impervious to simple commands.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> The bird, it led me here.
It's coming from this stuff.<eos> The relationship of the mental life to the stuff that produced it is interactive.<eos> A metaphor that helps thinking about it is the hardware/software distinction.<eos> The computer hardware is nothing.<eos> It just sits there unless there's software, and the software then makes the computer hardware work to produce function.
Oh, Mr. McVeigh, hello.<eos> You got a minute? Yes.<eos> Um, what can I help you with? My examination of the .38.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> We have other evidence. When I first examined the firing mechanism, it was easy to access, there was no need to take it apart.
Mine, too.<eos> I ghosted his book and got his trust. and an office on the exec's floor.<eos> Then a 2nd book with a formula that he liked to use at his business meals:<eos> "Money is a dog one needn't pat,<eos> "it wants its ball thrown again and again "so it can do what's expected of it indefinitely. "
Why, you want to play a game of horse?<eos> How about a photo, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> That speech was the last of your career.<eos> It's one I'm proud of, Lesley.
The need to use a surrogate mother for the child to be born.<eos> A surrogate mother is pure as you.<eos> Wait a minute. What child?<eos> A child in a short time will grow inside you.<eos> It has chosen you.
They took care to avoid civilian casualties .<eos> After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took his body into custody.<eos> Good work.<eos> Susan, get me the Saudi ambassador to the phone .<eos> It is on Line 1, sir.
Me?<eos> Snow White is about to give birth to a child... a child who will save us all when she reaches her 28th year... but only if she can be protected from the powerful effects of the dark curse.<eos> But how can I protect this child?<eos> There is an enchanted tree, much like the one you carved Pinocchio from.<eos> If fashioned into a vessel, it can protect the child from the queen's magic.
Then it says, "Going down a dusty Georgian side road I wander." Georgia?<eos> So we've had Amsterdam, we've had Georgia, we've had the world's tallest building. Not much to go on.<eos> (Bartholomew-Strydom) Well, what I heard, and the story differs a lot, and a lot of people have different versions of the story, but what I heard, he hadn't played a concert in a very long time.<eos> And a promoter got him to play a concert, and he was hoping it was gonna be a great show.<eos> Of course, the show didn't work out that way. It started out...
I mean, you can get a paper spike at any stationery store. Mmm...<eos> it's an adequate equivalent of the original murder weapon, yet provides a little mystique to the profile of the current killer.<eos> He wants to be noticed.<eos> His priority was the body looking like an exact replica of the previous crime. He? His?<eos> It's definitely a male?
There's stuff in his life where I don't fit in, and vice versa.<eos> Now that is a very healthy attitude.<eos> I mean, people just...<eos> They get hung up about sex.<eos> It gets in the way of everything.
It will mean the destruction of an important public works program.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> This place is a dump.<eos> This park keeps inner-city dogs off the streets.<eos> They rely on this park for the programs and services it offers,
I've spent my whole life in the ocean, and I think of water as just empty space, 'cause that's all I know.<eos> And then one day, I realize that this emptiness is actually a substance.<eos> And I am an interested and curious fish, so I figure out in addition to the liquid water, which I'm in, there is this solid phase -- ice -- and there's steam.<eos> And then I would start worrying about whether one day, you know, my water might freeze and I might die.<eos> And in exactly the same way we've looked at our space, realized that it, too, seems to be able to freeze and kill us all.
Good, Julia!<eos> It ain't easy, kid, not for nobody...<eos> He was in the hospital, you know that?<eos> He had a serious accident.<eos> I bet it was a drug problem.
Look at love the wrong way it goes unrecognized<eos> So look with your heart and not with your eyes<eos> The heart understands<eos> The heart never lies<eos> Believe what it feels and trust what it shows
The heart can't be fooled<eos> The heart is too wise<eos> Forget what you think<eos> Ignore what you hear<eos> Look with your heart, it always sees clear
I believed in science not anything that can't be proved by science.<eos> But later I realized there're things that can't be explained by science.<eos> Lots of diseases can't be fixed by science either.<eos> I really have no clue how to find the spirit of Shouwu.<eos> You said it can communicate with us.
The lonely lanes of my heart.<eos> is now swarmed with feelings.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Let's walk this mile.<eos> It's the abode of my dreams.
What, will not this castle yield?<eos> The castle royally is manned, my lord, against thy entrance.<eos> Royally?<eos> Why?<eos> It contains no king.
Royally?<eos> Why?<eos> It contains no king.<eos> Yes, my good lord,<eos> It doth contain a king.
Well, well done for that, for the lifetime achievement award and of course, most of all, well done for that.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Alex James.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, earlier on, we found out which of these... the £30,000 Morgan three-wheeler, the £40,000 Caterham R500, or the £50,000 KTM X-Bow... made the most convincing track-day car.<eos> Thing is, if you're going to spend that much money on a car, you want it to do something else.
These toxins are left to cause the damage that they were not causing because they were surrounded by fat.<eos> So as long as you are taking in more toxins than you're eliminating, your body is not going to let you burn fat. Because burning the fat will just put more toxins into your body.<eos> So you have to address the fact that you're being assaulted with toxins before your body will allow you to let go of weight.<eos> The body only wants to heal, it's crying out to heal, that's all it wants to do.<eos> It wants to naturally detoxify Only the body can detoxify itself, provided there's no toxins coming in.
And then close your eyes, and either see yourself, feel yourself, imagine yourself being in that body.<eos> Imagine yourself walking on the beach with that body.<eos> Whatever way you can do it, and you do it when your mind is calm and powerful, and relaxed. Your subconscious understands.<eos> And it understands that it doesn't need fat, and that it's confusing the stresses.<eos> Because it really doesn't know what to do with the stresses of modern-day life. "Do I get fatter, do I get thinner?"
I don't think he was doing it for the money.<eos> I want you to stay with this officer.<eos> I need a minute, okay?<eos> Boss, Charlotte was just sent a video of the senator.<eos> It was a pay-as-you-go phone, no GPS.
Take it off.<eos> We are ending this right here and right now.<eos> You are not afraid of this puppet.<eos> You control it.<eos> It does not control you.
"Anthony, you're going 40 on the highway."<eos> And then she knows that I'm thinking about other universes.<eos> He thinks there may be other universes because of the process that created our own.<eos> It's called inflation.<eos> It describes an exponential expansion in the moments after the Big Bang, at a speed the universe would never repeat again.
- I do.<eos> You are the most beautiful person in the world, so I'll give it to you.<eos> Lift up your shirt.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> It doesn't sing to me anymore, only to you now.
But like I said, Sam's an artist, and at the end of the day... [whispers]: it really turns me on. [grunting]<eos> Shut it, Puckerman-- we're here to talk business.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay, I want to do a number for Glee Club.<eos> It's stage one of my master plan.
Nice work, Hermes.<eos> Now that's what I call fine print.<eos> Okay, but good luck making a girlie calendar with only two female employees.<eos> Oh, husband. I'm so excited about this new job.<eos> And it's excited about you, Labarbara.
Okay. C.K., there's sort of an unwritten rule about dating ex-girlfriends from another gang, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> $12,000 for your car?<eos> How you get that number?<eos> It's what I paid.
I was in the bathroom.<eos> There I got the message.<eos> What message?<eos> "Do not let your life."<eos> He said that he killed if it does not do what it says.
Did I mention she's a famous actress?<eos> It still kind of sucks.<eos> Every night, I sing songs about love.<eos> And then I sit on my bus, and I write songs about love.<eos> And the only thing I really know about love is that it's unknowable. ♪ Oh, my God ♪ And now I should go before my heart gets crushed by that "so in love with her" look on your face.
Nothing.<eos> He robbed the poker game.<eos> The hotel doesn't want another shooting, and if it gets out, Hugo's game will be ruined.<eos> I make more in one night running that game than I do working a week in this dump.<eos> And if the police recover the money, it is forfeited because it is part of an illegal activity.
But far more magnificent is the immense scale of gravity's embrace.<eos> It holds galaxies together across hundreds of billions of kilometres and, in doing so, it creates the most magnificent structures.<eos> Our own Milky Way is part of one of these, the Virgo cluster.<eos> Every point of light in this image is not a star, but a galaxy.<eos> There are 2,000 galaxies in this cluster, and they're all bound together by gravity, making it the largest structure in our intergalactic neighbourhood.
The big problem with quantum mechanics is that the little particles that we're all made of can be in multiple places at once, yet I'm made of little particles and you never see me in two places at once, so what's going on here?<eos> Max thinks that the maths of quantum theory is telling us something remarkable.<eos> So whenever the equations say that this tennis ball is in many different places at once, what that really means is that our reality is branched out into multiple universes and in each one, the ball's in a definite place.<eos> According to this theory, when the photon of light faces two slits... it doesn't split in two.<eos> It splits the world in two.
- Nelson, no.<eos> There are things you don't know, Rose, about me, about this job.<eos> - I'm not fit...<eos> - Nelson, you aren't responsible for the evils in the world.<eos> You're the one trying to make it a better place.
Kevin, did you practice your piano?<eos> I am done with piano.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The bat was injured, so I nursed it back to health.<eos> I tried to let it leave, but it always came back to me.
I wouldn't like to end up like De Quinsey, using ten grams a day.<eos> Tell fatherthat I understand that he doesn't understand my letters, because I read them myself and I don't understand what I'm trying to say.<eos> Thomas De Quincey, "Memories of an English Opium-eater" .<eos> I adored that book.<eos> It starts like this:
Can you get us some.<eos> Of course, but it'll cost you.<eos> How much?<eos> Do you see this eye, Colonel?<eos> It doesn't see you.
Which brings us back to you being wrong.<eos> Hey, why am I the one who's wrong?<eos> Because the other person is me.<eos> Okay, well, tell you what.<eos> Hair never lies, so let's let it decide.
Just a little discomfort, towards his sister.<eos> The guards were the route at the last moment.<eos> And you were the only one who knows that gold would be delivered to you.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> In 2 minutes the door will open and it will come.
Hydrogen has one proton, and so it has one electron sat there in its lowest energy level.<eos> Again, it has a space there.<eos> It would also like to fill that up.<eos> So what happens, when I give it a little kick with this splint, is that the hydrogen is encouraged to react with the with the oxygen.<eos> It's energetically favourable for it to share its electron.
What is this?<eos> - It's called 'robot'.<eos> - A robot?<eos> Was abandoned in the attic of the museum.<eos> What does it do?
Mama Jeanne was my assistant.<eos> We did very successfully, filled the theater.<eos> I was always surrounded machines in my workshop, where I invented new illusions.<eos> Once I built a robot.<eos> It was a particular treasure I put in my soul.
And with that,<eos> Tatagami marched off to meet his destiny.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You can defeat any enemy as long as you take him apart piece by piece, one thread at a time.<eos> Now, Wahle's got a well-rounded game, and we need to redevelop yours, get every piece as sharp as it can be.
Yeah, but it were me that arrested him in the first place.<eos> One day our social worker saw him with my dad and asked, who's that?<eos> And I said I don't know him.<eos> My own brother.<eos> So, what, you make one mistake and it stays with us for ever?
Pow!<eos> I've been Lem-basted.<eos> Hey, who is that relaxed and approachable guy?<eos> Is that Ted?<eos> Why, yes, it is.
Like a slip-sliding road..<eos> This is but a gentle detour on my way.<eos> This is but a gentle detour on my way.<eos> I didn't choose my dream, ma..<eos> ..it chose me.
Let's give Fitch and Gordon some cover fire!<eos> Sir, there's an unidentified helicopter and it's flying toward the rescue craft.<eos> It's coming in on starboard side. Fitch. Fitch!<eos> Get out of there! He can't hear us, sir.<eos> What are they doing? It's just flying right next to us.
There's significant focal tenderness.<eos> Colin, we're gonna have to get you to a CT to determine the cause of your pain.<eos> As promised, here's the status sheet from the accident scene.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It lists where all your guys have been taken.

Did she say with whom?<eos> By then, I was late to meet my broker, so I left, about 2:30.<eos> And just like that...<eos> The universe?<eos> It sorted itself out.
- Quit following me.<eos> I've done all I can for you. Now you're on your own.<eos> - But I don't know my way home.<eos> - Just follow the sun.<eos> It'll take you there.
However, the medicine wasn't quite right.<eos> At first it seemed to be hopeless, but it has gradually got better, particularly since we agreed that he will stay with us for the time being, to make studies here.<eos> He wanted the out house to be fitted up for him.<eos> We don't think it's a particularly suitable place, but we've had it spruced up.<eos> Now, we shall just make it nice and warm and dry and then it should do.
Heating blood alters its proteins, enabling them to combine with the iron in blood cells and the potassium carbonate, or potash.<eos> What's happening in the reaction now is that the carbonate is reacting with the haemoglobin and other structures in the blood to produce this extraordinary, thick, what might best be simply called a gunge.<eos> After heating the gunge to an ash and then filtering and diluting it,<eos> Diesbach added green vitriol, what we now call iron sulphate, unaware he was about to create a complex iron compound, Ferric ferrocyanide, or Prussian Blue.<eos> Now, watch this carefully, it will effervesce and might effervesce violently.
Take the money!<eos> Just, God, stop making that sound!<eos> Yes!<eos> I told you I'd get the money.<eos> Wait, wait. Where'd it all go?
- Revelry of Kings.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How was it? - lt was...<eos> "l take off my garb with all my heart.<eos> Because it doesn't belong to me, but to the devil. "
Until then you may kneel before it.<eos> We march for Macragge.<eos> And we shall know no fear!<eos> Sergeant Crastor.<eos> Look to your battle gear and it will protect you.
This.<eos> - Sir, we have to disconnect.<eos> - 2750 feet.<eos> - We've gone too deep.<eos> - It will hold.

Only one way to find out, we'll have to go by feel.<eos> What do you feel?<eos> A lot of things but not Rex.<eos> Of course not, Rex Regis Plasmator it a master of evading capture.<eos> Now that one's been found certain people will stop at nothing to get it, you realize it's a living fossil.
She has all her cousins in there.<eos> I feel like I'm being strangled by, like a bunch of Mexicans on a necklace just trying to -<eos> - That's love, dude.<eos> - That's love?<eos> Let it take hold and rip out every last breath you have.
- You might be wondering why we're here?<eos> You've ruined our lives.<eos> There's an empty plate at our table.<eos> And it's like a wall between us, a no-man's-land.<eos> I'm sorry about the dog, but it's not coming back.
His parents might still be alive.<eos> And they would want to know.<eos> It's not him.<eos> Come here.<eos> I was so sure it was.
I'm the one who's been there for Becca.<eos> For almost two days!<eos> Lemon... There was once a great American named George Henderson.<eos> He met a woodland ape, or Sasquatch, who, despite its dangerous message of environmentalism, became his friend.<eos> But when the time came to do the hard thing and send it back into the forest where it belonged... and birds could perch on its shoulder because it was gentle...
So, what is this that we're doing, exactly?<eos> Well, it's called fucking most of the time.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> We both know this world.<eos> Let's not make this more than it is.
And she'll keep the baby.<eos> "Vincent hit him several times with the helmet.<eos> - "The man stopped moving..."<eos> - No.<eos> It wasn't him. You understand?
Oh, but you had plenty of time time to glue two grand to your naked body.<eos> Fifteen hundred dollars? All right, look, don't panic.<eos> This wine is not to our liking.<eos> But sir, when you tasted it you assured me that it would "play."<eos> Right. But after that first taste, it turned.
Well, maybe for you they weren't, Mama.<eos> Leah... you have got to erase this meshugge dream from your head.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then I fear God may grant it to you.<eos> After you put on the Halizah shoe,takeawalkinit . Make sure it fits.
The amount of light it blocks when it's in front... tells us how big the planet is.<eos> So we use that to understand if it's a small planet like Mercury... a planet like the Earth or a huge giant like that of Jupiter.<eos> And we use the orbital period and the temperature of the star... to tell us if it's in the habitable zone.<eos> The orbital period is how long a planet takes to go around its star.<eos> It would go on its way... and come back again a year later and do it over again.
Reallypregnant.<eos> She was,like,this big.<eos> She was driving through an intersection,and then a... a car ran a red light,and,um,actually,it wasn't a... car.<eos> It was a plumber's van,a Klog King plumber's van.<eos> And it broke me?
- - Are you okay?<eos> - - Where is he?<eos> - - It will happen soon.<eos> - - He almost saw the cartridge.<eos> Okay, I made it disappear.
I still might, you know, in the next few years or days.<eos> But right now, if I found out that I was eventually going to die from something...<eos> Once you learn that information, you can't unlearn it.<eos> And this way, my future's still mine.<eos> It can be whatever I want it to be.
Hooch is crazy.<eos> J.D.: And even though it felt warm and safe, I knew it had to end.<eos> It's never good to live in the past too long.<eos> As for the future, thanks to Dan, it didn't seem so scary anymore.<eos> It could be whatever I want it to be.
I'm Not Crying.<eos> Hey, Uh, Some Doctor Called For You.<eos> What'd You Get - Chlamydia Again?<eos> Take Off The Vest.<eos> I Told You - I Feel Safer With It On.
That's all it took to throw things out of whack.<eos> And then when that happens, it changes the way you look at things.<eos> Are you staring at my butt? Hmm?<eos> No, your butt is in my staring place.<eos> So technically, it's staring at me. Sorry.
What if he refuses? Like she said in court, I'm a good businessman.<eos> His contract grants him creative control over his own line.<eos> So I simply told him that PDQ will bring in another designer... to oversee a second line if he didn't feel up to the challenge.<eos> What did he say? He stopped by my office and asked me to bring you that dress.<eos> It's your size.
Ned's already looked.<eos> Ok, there's no shinies or shadows in there.<eos> Maybe not now.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What use would the book be If it got itself destroyed?
I woke up, and he was covering my mouth!<eos> And is Mr. Barton still inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's going crazy in there. He acts as though he owns the place, but it's my name on the lease.<eos> It's my apartment!
Um... We're all white.<eos> Funny story.<eos> I was on a plane once with Brett Favre's cousin.<eos> It says here that you still have an outstanding student loan?<eos> Yes, it is outstanding.
If you want to take this thing on, fine. You waste a week<eos> - and you drop it.<eos> - When did you become reasonable?<eos> I want you to see that the system works.<eos> Yeah, it works. Just not for the people it needs to work for.
This picture of a mouse genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.<eos> What?<eos> But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.<eos> Holy Freaking Jesus.<eos> Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop.
I hear the same things you hear.<eos> You were right about the Adviprin.<eos> That's where we found the poison.<eos> We also found Furlong's fingerprints all over the bottle.<eos> Well,it was his bottle.
- You two, know each other ?<eos> - We are getting married !<eos> - What, who is this ?<eos> I kept it a secret.<eos> I know you think that Dad was a saint... .and that I do not deserve love, but do I have love.... and it's strong and it will win, and I will not give it up.
Who would do that?<eos> Do you remember How resistant Detective hyde was When I asked him To bring in my father?<eos> So, what?<eos> You're Accusing a cop now?<eos> It was a police file. It was a very old Police file.
Kill him!<eos> Yes!<eos> After dinner, before the bedtime bell, we would arm-wrestle.<eos> At first, Van Wurst regularly beat me, but with time he found it more difficult.<eos> You look at the sky, and it looks back at you with its barred eye.
For them fornication is a travesty of manslaughter."<eos> - You wrote that?<eos> - No.<eos> I copied it down from an old book, "The Witch Hammer".<eos> You look at the sky and it looks back at you with its barred eye.
- We need a symbol.<eos> - What symbol?<eos> Something elemental.<eos> Something terrifying.<eos> In the movie, Bruce chooses to assume the appearance of a bat ... because it is the creature that symbolizes his greatest fear.
Says you!<eos> "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, "it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.<eos> "Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'<eos> "When it arrives it finds the house swept clean and put in order.<eos> "Then it goes out and finds seven other spirits more wicked than itself "and they go in and live there.
She-Force... would you sign my full-size promotional cut-out, please?<eos> Me?<eos> That would be a pleasure, Ian.<eos> So, um, what's the hole for, Ian?<eos> It's for looking through.
We didn't want to be judged.<eos> We'll contact you at the hotel if we have any more information.<eos> Detectives.<eos> Yes?<eos> About Nicole's baby,do you know what it is?
In fact, the world's first spacewalk almost ended in disaster.<eos> Alexei Leonov did the first spacewalk... that any human did in 1965.<eos> But in the rush to accomplish that space spectacular... and thereby beat the Americans... the Soviets took some shortcuts on the safety of the cosmonaut... and so he blew up like the Michelin Man.<eos> The suit became rigid.<eos> It couldn't handle the pressure differences... between the breathable atmosphere inside... and the vacuum of space.
A thief was killed by attacking his shop.<eos> An attack?<eos> But ... who was it?<eos> Who killed your father?<eos> I just know it was an antique dealer.
His motions get translated into robot motions.<eos> An LCD helmet with two screens... map directly to the two cameras in the robot's head... and in that mode, we can perform a lot of tasks... in a very natural way.<eos> The cameras are protected by a helmet... modeled after Roman centurion armor.<eos> The robot can also operate in an autonomous mode... where it employs its own artificial intelligence... to carry out pre-programmed assignments.<eos> Since it will be blazing trails where people dread to set foot...
But they are.<eos> But I'm not anyone's property.<eos> I am not a slave Friday, which was shared by all.<eos> I wonder how is socialism ... in a situation so extreme and absurd ... as it is for a human being living on Bear Island?<eos> Is it useful?
Cheating kills, you know that!<eos> Why are you calling that bloke?<eos> I don't know any bloke...<eos> I need to buy a medicine for the dog!<eos> It's sick.
After graduating, I found the human rights Defence organization.<eos> L observed them for two years and in 1989 I started to work with them.<eos> In this institution, hierarchical questions between women and men... are at a minimum, though I can't say that they don't exist.<eos> As defenders of human rights... we find this TV programme to be very harmful.<eos> It presents violence against women as something trivial.
His poor mother must be rolling in her grave.<eos> He wasn't like that when he was young.<eos> He was so adorable and intelligent!<eos> Was he?<eos> Even a mutt is adorable when it's a puppy.
That was the institution Watari established...<eos> I think that Mello is playing a game with me.<eos> To see who can catch the last boss, Kira, the fastest...<eos> It's Armonia Justin.<eos> I went to the old man, the king, to report that I lost my notebook, but when I described what it looked like... he said that Ryuk said it was his and that he dropped it, and took it...
I went upstairs.<eos> I was a smoker in those days.<eos> And I was passed by a man in a hurry in his way to get off.<eos> And this was the man that you later identified as Richard Dunne?<eos> Yes. Yes, it was.
Give the phone to that person.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> Choosing you was definitely the right decision.<eos> Light-kun has the phone!<eos> it's dangerous!
Don't let this job run your life.<eos> Work to live, not the other way round.<eos> - But I love my job.<eos> - Yeah, I know you do.<eos> But I promise you it won't love you back.
We're in a vacuum chamber but we'll be putting back in a gas that will simulate what the early Earth must have looked like.<eos> Let's go ahead and make a bunch of craters, what the early landscape of Earth must have looked like.<eos> 'Cause these things would happen all the time, there had to have been a lot of craters.<eos> The plan is to come in, hit the centre of the target and watch the crater form.<eos> And you'll see the destructive power of... even tough it's a tiny bead, it's gonna do some real serious damage.
Reach.<eos> - Petrova!<eos> - Coming.<eos> We three Fossils vow to put our name in the History books.<eos> Because it is uniquely ours and ours alone.
- Oh, no, thank you.<eos> - Please, take it.<eos> - Why are you giving it to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It swings an under balance.
Feelings you need to let go.<eos> That easy, huh?<eos> Tony... even if by some miracle Jeanne did forgive you, would you be willing to be Tony DiNardo full-time, to leave your entire life behind for her?<eos> You did not think this through.<eos> - Didn't you tell me the heart wants what it wants.
In other clubs they get paid weekly<eos> Oh no.<eos> If we get this property<eos> ..we`ll be in the money Ahluwalia!<eos> It is a gold mine Anne .
There's been no official approval.<eos> Somewhere here there should be its route recording system, then we'll know where it's been.<eos> Is Aurora what they've been seeing?<eos> This machine is as good as a black box.<eos> It's a spy plane.
Up and out of Halesworth, circling back out over the North Sea and then straight into the airport.<eos> Time and place of the flight correspond with the bringing down of the cargo plane.<eos> So it was a collision?<eos> Well, if you look at the dates, you'll see it hasn't flown since.<eos> So maybe it crashed as well or at least was damaged.
Well, I guess we'll carry on, just like we did before.<eos> Not according to Lou.<eos> Lou's got lots of plans.<eos> I just want to make this place run more like a business.<eos> It's not a business.
This is our planet, the Earth.<eos> It's an amazing ever-changing world, full of natural wonders.<eos> But there's more to Earth than this, much more.<eos> Because our planet is unique in the solar system, perhaps even in the universe.<eos> Four and a half billion years have made it a world of extraordinary landscapes and a home to life.
Now!<eos> Here.<eos> Get it out.<eos> How may times have I told you not to chew it?<eos> What if it stuck in your throat?
- William.<eos> My dream is to stand and get a tube.<eos> What's the tube?<eos> What's the tube like?<eos> The tube closes and it comes underwater.
It sounds so good.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> And now vocals.<eos> No, you see, you have to sing into the microphone.<eos> It won't follow you.
- Thank you.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I want to know that if my limbs fall off, we'd still be together, no matter what.<eos> And when he says my name, it sounds different in his mouth.<eos> You know, like it's safe there.
I've got wires everywhere.<eos> Just like the telly.<eos> Time's already hanging heavy.<eos> But I'm killing it, as they say.<eos> Or else it's killing me.
But he is not the one responsible for the disaster we are going through.<eos> We must not forget that for some who sleep this and is a place to fear.<eos> The nightmares, the monsters under the bed the abominable things lurking in dark corners. The shadows ..<eos> This is how the night is for Tim.<eos> His fear has created this monster that now threatens us erasing any trace of light and whatever it wants.
Almost.<eos> Always the same for me - break up, break down.<eos> Drink up, fool around, meet one guy, then another, fuck around to forget the one and only.<eos> Then after a few months of emptiness, start again to look for true love.<eos> Desperately look everywhere and, after two years of loneliness, meet a new love and swear it is the one, until that one is gone as well.
How big is the ranch?<eos> Twenty-five thousand acres.<eos> Across those fields and over White Stone Peak.<eos> Stay here a year, you'll never see all of it.<eos> It's big enough to get lost in?
No, sahib.<eos> See, sahib?<eos> The road will hold, sahib.<eos> The road will hold.<eos> It will be here longer than you and I, sahib.
You probably can't stop daydreaming about your future together.<eos> And just think, for the rest of your life, you get to be in a bed with Bullit.<eos> Suddenly not in the mood.<eos> Night after night, you and Bullit making love into the wee hours.<eos> You, exploring his body as it gets older, and older.
I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics until I come across this girl who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.<eos> And we write this song together and then the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.<eos> It sounds so good,<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> And now vocals no, no you see, you have to sing into the microphone, it won't follow you.
Jane...<eos> Salad, some wine, why? There's some slow-acting narcotic in your blood stream.<eos> No wonder you were acting so strange last night.<eos> What do you remember about the nightmare? Um...<eos> It started with my mother, the funeral.
We'll send our people in.<eos> - No, no, he's my lead.<eos> - You're not going alone.<eos> You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator!<eos> I'm going to find out where it is!
I'm really sorry.<eos> I have nothing more to say.<eos> So leave, please.<eos> Whether a person or a thing, fighting is about attitude.<eos> If I'm scared of a knife, it looks down on me.
So leave, please.<eos> Whether a person or a thing, fighting is about attitude.<eos> If I'm scared of a knife, it looks down on me.<eos> If I glare at it...<eos> It hides its tail.
All right, so what made you think you should move in with him in the first place?<eos> The closet test.<eos> Over half of his closet is filled with my things.<eos> I see. And what about your own closet?<eos> It overfloweth with his things, does it?
Water should be warm, and the light should come from above.<eos> No light for a long time can cause lead to a long-term stress.<eos> Great... So my fish has got a depression.<eos> Yes.<eos> It has feelings too, imagine that.
But it's just now that they are most vulnerable.<eos> A short-eared owl.<eos> The petrels are too quick in the air and the owl too big to follow them deep inside their tiny tunnels, so its best chance is to grab a bird coming in or out.<eos> First, it uses its sharp eyesight to spot an entrance to an active burrow.<eos> It doesn't go for a petrel straightaway, but positions itself just outside.
It's a concept called "the divine goddess" by religious historians.<eos> You are telling me that Saunière's last act on earth was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest?<eos> Why?<eos> obviously I can't tell you why.<eos> knows the meaning of this symbol and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
Mainly when he is young because it is indeed when all these things begin.<eos> When one is young, the sin does not seem to be something very important.<eos> It seems something attractive, in fact something likeable, fleecy.<eos> But the sin is planned for destruirte.<eos> And you feed that baby during long time and it is growing in your life until you see yourself in hardships and you do not know how arreglartelas and what it seemed to them very innocent now it controls its lives.
It's too late.<eos> Tabitha. Tabitha. Roman, you must be strong.<eos> Tabitha's soul is watching over us... from above.<eos> Master, a man has arrived.<eos> Who is it?
I'm on a journey.<eos> Everything I've told you here today is true.<eos> I didn't choose it.<eos> It happened to me.<eos> As my journey continues, I don't know where it leads, but I walk it fearlessly.
Well, at least there's one attending around here I can count on.<eos> Ah, the hell with it, Bob. I don't work here!<eos> Have a good one!<eos> I hate this place.<eos> It hates you, Bob.
When Tina and I were talking about getting married, We both wanted to have fabulous dresses.<eos> How come you guys didn't get married?<eos> Tina thought it would be too conventional.<eos> She didn't wanna cleave to the heterosexual paradigm.<eos> Now it's cleaving all over her.
My team, Alan.<eos> I'm back and I'm feeling it.<eos> I've realized a truth about myself.<eos> I just love... power.<eos> Well, it seems to have a thing for you as well.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You've been under surveillance for three months.<eos> Have I really?<eos> We followed a container from mainland Europe back to the UK.<eos> It was supposedly carrying booze, but 12 refugees were also hidden inside.

But if I'm Moishale, who's the Pharaoh's daughter?<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That day was a long time coming.<eos> Then one day it was here.
Exactly one week before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.<eos> That's when a network of stations called the National Broadcasting System in an effort to compete with its older and established cousins, CBS and NBC bought the Addison, gutted it keeping all the original architecture and Art Deco fixtures and turned it into a broadcast studio for radio plays.<eos> The most famous of these was a Sunday night series called The Studio 60 Theater of the Air.<eos> After the war, radio gave way to television.<eos> And the first show here was called The NBS Philco Comedy Hour which no one has heard of because it had the misfortune of being programmed first against The Colgate Comedy Hour and then The Texaco Star Theater.
I'm sorry that happened but if people don't listen, they may suffer the consequences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The British Government are in possession of a document.<eos> It's called Aftermath. Never heard of it. It exists.<eos> What is it?
'Cause I was sad.<eos> How'd you feel afterwards?<eos> Better.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know,'cause it was dead,and I was still alive.

In times gone by, sugar plants... stretched right across the countryside.<eos> Then time took over and swallowed them up.<eos> And time has swallowed up the sugar mills too.<eos> There are those who say that in the end, time always wins.<eos> One day it swallows up the mill, just as it swallows up you and me.
Watch out for your ass.<eos> I'll keep an eye on, you can be sure.<eos> Look good, because I'm out.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - You got a nice ass, but it will not prevent you receiving a good spanking!
You're right.<eos> We've come so far.<eos> Without you I wouldn't be where I am now.<eos> Where is fate leading us?<eos> We will go wherever it takes us.
What I win?<eos> A conversation.<eos> Your perfume was on Melvin Heckman.<eos> I'd rather wait tables than get on that casting couch.<eos> So how'd it get there?
Right.<eos> "Nietzsche."<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> He's a philosopher.<eos> Did you ever hear that expression about looking into the abyss, having it look back at you?
Okay. But you've really gotta step it up.<eos> Beer, "you look beautiful," "let's get naked. " What's the problem?<eos> We've got to get rid of this body.<eos> No, it's too stiff. I gotta make it my own.<eos> This body, we gotta get up and go get it gotten rid of.
Michael's having my sex and I have his brain.<eos> Okay, let's begin. Oh, man.<eos> What went on in there?<eos> You have got to chill out, man.<eos> This body, we gotta get up and go get it gotten rid of.
What?<eos> Circumcision.<eos> They took off too much?<eos> They use, um, some sort of device... to remove the foreskin.<eos> It malfunctioned. Burned him severely.
You know, his music; the freedom to pursue his dream... and that... kiss just made it a lot messier.<eos> I really don't know what to do.<eos> I am... the wrong girl to ask for advice.<eos> You wanna know why I really got the tattoo?<eos> When the scorpion's caught in a fire, it stings itself to death.
You gotta do CPR on him right now.<eos> - Ricky's having a heart attack, eh?<eos> Calls for a celebratory drink, Julian.<eos> - Cut the bullshit, Jim!<eos> , What happened to the man that loves this trailer park trying to make it a better place to live?
Well, what about your period?<eos> It skips all the time.<eos> When I'm stressed out or swimming a lot.<eos> We need to talk about what we're going to do, looking forward.<eos> I need to get it taken care of.

Based on what?<eos> The only hard evidence you've got is a blacksmith's tool and a few golf balls.<eos> I nspector, you told me to follow the money.<eos> I believe this is where that trail leads.<eos> And this is where it ends.
But it gets better, trust me.<eos> I remember when I got my first paycheck.<eos> I'll never forget going to that office to send money home for the first time.<eos> You can't imagine how it feels.<eos> Your heart feels so big... like it won't fit in your chest.
