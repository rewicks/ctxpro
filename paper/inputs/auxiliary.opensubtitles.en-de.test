It was summer camp.<eos> I was a junior counselor.<eos> She was a senior counselor.<eos> Honestly, Renzo, it's no big secret.<eos> Camp does most of the seducing.
Speaking of interpol, - that ever check out?<eos> - What?<eos> In your report, you said this "Saint" set off a homing device alerting interpol to the nuke.<eos> Did that ever check out?<eos> -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It did.
Do you believe that if you don't make this right,<eos> I'll hold you personally responsible?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> And do you believe that the man I hold personally responsible won't be walking around on this Earth for very much longer?<eos> No. No, I don't.
- Get going.<eos> - Sir, I've done nothing I swear, I didn't do anything.<eos> - Do you know Raees?<eos> - l don't know anyone, sir.<eos> - How does he do his business?
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.<eos> This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - No, of course not. His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.<eos> I don't!
No, we have no choice.<eos> Just send me the chopper.<eos> We'll need to get authorisation. Negative.<eos> No time.<eos> Just do it.
Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.
You what?<eos> I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?<eos> - Oh, well, um... she... - We... we don't really...
Who are they?<eos> Oh, the one without the tongue is Vando.<eos> The other guy, I didn't get his name. The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me. Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.<eos> - No, I don't want it. Dad, stop!<eos> I didn't... I didn't...
The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.
- Definitely! - Yeah, one more for our friend.<eos> - One more.<eos> Yeah, on him. He's... - I got it.<eos> Always tastes better when it's free.<eos> - It does, though, a little bit.
Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.
I've been really lucky with... you know, I started three Web sites as well as doing my paintings and everything, I have my auction site.<eos> So I've always got a lot of different eggs in the basket and things to fall back on.<eos> 'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.
You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.<eos> Are you referring to Hannah Baker?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you want to talk about Hannah?<eos> Do you?
Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.<eos> He left.<eos> He didn't leave a note.<eos> He obviously doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.<eos> People say I have an expressive face.<eos> But if not, let me repeat your question.<eos> Why do we need two doctors?<eos> Answer... we don't.
Uh, wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I, uh... I'm not a farmer.<eos> I need some help here.<eos> No, you don't.
That's PJ.<eos> That's PJ.<eos> You only saw him on the holidays.<eos> Hell, I'm not even sure I ever really knew him.<eos> - Maybe nobody did.
She hired me to crack it and get it ready for the market.<eos> Wait.<eos> PJ wanted to distribute this free.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> He did?
Tell me more.<eos> I'm sure you've heard by now that I was the Carlán's maid, and he never married me.<eos> Yes, you've heard.<eos> What people don't know is that my husband, suspecting the anarchists would kill him, married me so our children would be his heirs.<eos> We did it at the monastery.
When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do! - I-
I knew where everything was heading. I-<eos> - I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really-- I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
You gonna answer it?<eos> Oh, I was unable to mention this earlier, but our partners at Mossad came to me when they found out you were in the country.<eos> I said "Leave him alone.<eos> He's got important work to do."<eos> Which I did.
He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking. His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
It only seems scary because of all the mist.<eos> It's Mr. Poe.<eos> From the bank?<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> - How do you do? - How do you do?
Michael.<eos> Welcome to Alterplex.<eos> Can't stay here.<eos> We should keep moving. Look at what they've done.<eos> - And what about what you did, Michael?
When are you seeing him?<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Are you going to bed with him?<eos> Don't do this.
Where's your boyfriend?<eos> We're just a team for the race.<eos> That's all.<eos> - I thought you guys were... - Yeah.<eos> So did I.
Sheriff Leon has me run an EMP device at all times.<eos> Creates a barrier around the town.<eos> There's no power allowed in Red River.<eos> Cars end up just stalling out.<eos> Not sure why it did that to your necks, though.
Look, I don't care if it's just you and me, we'll figure out a way.<eos> But I won't let it come to that.<eos> I've been out recruiting other members from other packs.<eos> Trust me. Plenty of wolves want to eat at the Jade Wolf.<eos> No, they don't.
Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name... Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in central city when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
Let me see if I can get you the address.<eos> Felicity said you wanted me here.<eos> Was it 'cause you wanted me to hear that woman's story?<eos> No.<eos> But since you did...
She says she needs to talk to you.<eos> She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
I know.<eos> And after I bared my heart and soul.<eos> I told you things I've never told anyone.<eos> You looked me straight in the eye and lied.<eos> Magnus, I didn't...
He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
- Okay, that's his signature move.<eos> - That's kind of his signature. Yeah, well, from what I hear, The Flash is the one who's actually saving people.<eos> Sounds like Cecile's Team Flash.<eos> Joanie, my dad would never brag about this, but he knows Kid Flash.<eos> You do?
- Just don't get them wet.<eos> - [clears throat] Your Honor, I, uh... - What? Wh...<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
I have to tell you, I haven't always felt - I belong completely.<eos> - What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did. - Oh, yeah, you did.
Do... Do you have any idea what will happen if this abomination is born?<eos> Mick...<eos> So until then... I say we drink.<eos> Dagon. Hear me.<eos> I do, sire.
It was an accident! It doesn't matter!<eos> The code.<eos> No, hey, screw the code. Don't make this harder than it already is.<eos> Mick, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do!
You're taking her to the sandbox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm ending this, once and for all.<eos> Kelly and her baby have to die.<eos> No, they don't.
How can you even tell?<eos> Am I gonna say "bad dog"?<eos> He can be unpleasant.<eos> Dr. hess says that you have designs on Mick Davies' job.<eos> Did she?
What's the matter, Dean?<eos> Am I too different from the Mary you know?<eos> Or too much the same?<eos> Here she is.<eos> Do your thing.
[Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
- I--i--just--i can't imagine.<eos> - looks like someone left here in a hurry.<eos> Yeah, that, that was a... An unruly guest.<eos> I--i guess raking the gravel is next up. - I thought you said you hadn't had any guests?<eos> - Really, did...
He'd better learn.<eos> He basically married the heroine of his stories.<eos> This city doesn't make a lick of sense to me.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> No one does.
All right.<eos> Oh. No, no.<eos> Just like real marrieds.<eos> They forgot the furniture.<eos> Or we did.
Why are you sending Tana away?<eos> You didn't want to do any of this.<eos> Fine, I'll get it myself.<eos> We have to stop this, both of us.<eos> No, we don't.
Was that a weird thing to say?<eos> Very.<eos> - Thought you might be feeling...<eos> - Guilty?<eos> So... do you?
I talked to the yearbook guy and resubmitted the untouched photo.<eos> I... I just feel like we should be honest about what we like.<eos> - And you don't like armpit hair?<eos> - I do not like armpit hair.<eos> Well, what if I do?
You saw me?<eos> I see quite a lot now.<eos> Bran has... visions.<eos> I thought you might go to King's Landing.<eos> So did I.
You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I... I don't.
like that clock there, but then my father's Rolex went missing, which belonged to his father before him.<eos> It's the only memento I have left.<eos> So when I came in here and I saw the watch... something came over me.<eos> Well, if you ask instead of take, I would have told you that Grandma didn't bring in the watch.<eos> Bank manager with gambling problem did.
- We're okay.<eos> - Don't know me.<eos> Wait.<eos> I like fucking you.<eos> You don't fucking...
It's all categorised as hunting, Donnie.<eos> I know. But specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay, this is dire, Donnie.<eos> He needs some ideas of concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no, I don't, Donnie.
- Now, where's is Helena?<eos> - Er... - In the woods.<eos> - What's her backup plan?<eos> I don't know her backup plan.<eos> - You do. - No!
There are plenty of Chinese restaurants, laundries--<eos> Now who's racist?<eos> No. Because those are places where other Chinese people already work.<eos> They don't speak English, dumbass.<eos> I do little bit.
I like little boys as much as you like little girls... brotha. It says here, Leonard was a... war hero?<eos> I was in 'Nam myself.<eos> How about you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did... two years for it?
That's your bright idea, huh?<eos> Just drive around town, lookin' for a gate that ain't there no more.<eos> Might as well just put that damn noose around my neck myself.<eos> - What the... - Goddamn!<eos> The hell you doing in my truck, you little piece of shit? !
I already have a job when I graduate.<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> When you graduate, you're gonna have to stand before the bar and pass the character and fitness test.<eos> And you think working at your firm looks better than looking at mine.<eos> Yes, I do.
How's it going out there?<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> - I want you to take a look at this.<eos> - Let me get this straight, you want Oliver to petition the court to let Marissa argue his case.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
I watch this show all the time.<eos> I can't believe I can't know of one. It would be like, if somebody breaks a window on a plane, would that create a vacuum?<eos> And they put it to the test.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay. Does it?
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
She's so beautiful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How are you doing? I was... I was so worried that she would look like her father.<eos> Caleb looked like his father.<eos> But she does...
Well, maybe if you did it right, then all the parents wouldn't talk about you<eos> - like you are a steaming pile of...<eos> Let's all stop talking until I can think of what to say next.<eos> Okay, we'll speak to our daughter and make sure she never misses school again.<eos> Because if she does...
See, here's the thing, my friend.<eos> Guardian, he protects the Earth, but Agent Schott? He protects the stars.<eos> I'll see you on the street, James.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I almost didn't.
- No, no!<eos> You've ignored what I need from moment one today.<eos> I asked for privacy and time and you ignored that.<eos> And I asked you to give Jeremiah the benefit of the doubt and you ignored that too.<eos> So I don't...
So you just stay calm and they'll make everything all right.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.
I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
Making a today great for you and a tomorrow great for us.<eos> Custer Jesse.<eos> The Dork The Dork Docs will see you now.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - You did it.
- That right?<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> You spoke for a minute and 12 seconds.<eos> What'd you talk about?<eos> - Well, we didn't.
Well, you're no fucking beauty.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Ain't necessarily a bad thing.<eos> More important is, you know how to tease a man.<eos> Do you?
Wendy?<eos> He asked me if I loved his dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What did you say?<eos> That I didn't.
You're gonna make me cry.<eos> Keep going.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've never felt more alive... ♪ If you have half a brain ♪<eos> ...more honest than I do right now.
- I needed to clear my head.<eos> I'm not sure I actually wanna work at the restaurant anymore.<eos> - So, what is this place?<eos> - Hey, did you talk with Topher?<eos> Yes. No, I did.
For you... it was simple.<eos> Well... whatever it was, Roy... it wasn't simple.<eos> Three of us went out on that boat.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I don't... I don't...
-These women's voices are so scary.<eos> I'll make you...<eos> You...<eos> Women, our husband will hear you.<eos> Don't do this.
And the traction control is off!<eos> This has now been transformed from something that was brilliant... into something that is sensational.<eos> Of course, you'd never drive in race mode on the road, in the same way you'd never take your wristwatch into space.<eos> But it's nice to know that it would still work if you did.<eos> And this does. Boy, this does.
But we do other fun stuff.<eos> Oh, I don't doubt it.<eos> Butkiss was a fun guy.<eos> - You know my dad?<eos> - I do. Well, I did.
Let me have the pistol, son.<eos> You can't let her die.<eos> If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.<eos> But you got to give me the gun.<eos> Do it, Nick.
I know your daughter and him are, uh... courting.<eos> Could they just sneak past the guards?<eos> There's a lot of acreage out there, and Jake does know every inch of it, so it could be.<eos> Well, where should we start looking?<eos> - We don't.
I didn't tell you because I didn't know how you'd react.<eos> And we've been arguing so much, I was afraid you wouldn't understand.<eos> So why tell me now?<eos> Because now I know what I want, Mario.<eos> I do now.
Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.<eos> What can I do for you, Kimble?<eos> You can tell me what the hell's going on in your mind.<eos> You know if you open those markets tomorrow, it'll be a disaster.<eos> No, I don't.
It's all right, Mike.<eos> Agent Wells.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I understand you have some things you want to tell me about Peter MacLeish.<eos> Yes, sir. I do.
Doesn't read.<eos> But assuming that he does read and he's an avid library fan...<eos> If everybody followed that principle, that would bankrupt America. You know what I mean?<eos> Plus, he wants money.<eos> Why does he...
Is there any indication what they have planned?<eos> No, but it can't be good.<eos> I know no one wants to confront the reality of the situation, but the fact of the matter is that it falls to us to act in the best interest of Dreyfuss Enterprises.<eos> We've had no contact with Malcolm for days, and serious decisions need to be made, so...<eos> Yes, they do.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too. Hey.
That's what you think I want... to make you disappear?<eos> Well, isn't it?<eos> After all, that's what Regina wants.<eos> That's because she thinks you're the worst parts of her.<eos> But you don't?
I'll sort it.<eos> How?<eos> How does it get sorted, Vincent?<eos> Eh? Are you going to find 50 grand down the back of the sofa?<eos> Like I always do, on my own.
Hello.<eos> Is Mistress Trixie available?<eos> Mistress Trixie doesn't live here any more, all right.<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?
Ooh, will this be our first finisher?<eos> Let me tell you, he's gonna make it.<eos> He's gonna make it!<eos> He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!
All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I...<eos> I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
What?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I thought it's what I wanted, but... now that I'm here and it's all happenin'...<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Then don't eat it.<eos> Well, it can't be a peaceable household, it simply can't.<eos> The girl is an orphan, after all.<eos> How does one know what one is really getting?<eos> - One doesn't.
- You cried wolf. - I haven't!<eos> I saw the wolf.<eos> The wolf is real. If there is a pandemic, it should have been mentioned online by now.<eos> - Not everything turns up on Facebook.<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
I was under your thrall.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> True.<eos> But part of you wanted to help me, though, didn't it?<eos> Part of you always does.
Oh, man!<eos> This is like being a... hippopotamus.<eos> OK, the clock is ticking.<eos> Having got our first punch, I was hoping the day might get a bit less terrible.<eos> But it didn't.
- Take it easy.<eos> Take it easy!<eos> - Let go of me! Take it easy.<eos> You want to talk to Ravn?<eos> Do you?
-The Blade of Marmora is with you.<eos> -Why are you helping me?<eos> As a fighter and a leader, you give hope.<eos> Hurry! Earth needs you.<eos> We all do.
- I'll just take a blood sample. Have as many as you...<eos> Just drain it all, if you like.<eos> They know you're here now.<eos> But at least she knows I'm alive.<eos> So do the police.
A number of these programs go directly through Congress, totally.<eos> When you start going through these documents, these programs start dropping off the radar screen.<eos> These are all classified programs within the defense budget, but they don't supply any technical information on the program.<eos> And if people think that the Congress and the President actually have a hand on this, they're gravely mistaken.<eos> They do not.
You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood, - even if you win in the House?<eos> - I'm working on that. I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> So does the country.
He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
What is she worth to you?<eos> A lot.<eos> So then here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
You know, after we get this tire changed, do you still want to go to the rally or should we just drop you off in 1950?<eos> - Uh, guys, there's, uh... - Oh.<eos> - You need help with that tire?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, we don't.
You want to tell me how you're connected?<eos> Wait... What did Enger say?<eos> Enough to get me listening.<eos> So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is?<eos> No, I don't.
OK.<eos> - Per... - It has to be this way, Leif.<eos> - What?<eos> - It has to.<eos> It doesn't.
Excellent grip.<eos> - Oh, my...!<eos> - And he makes it!<eos> He makes it!<eos> He does it!
- Here we go, the Ejector!<eos> - Wow. I feel pride to be at the third level.<eos> I get to represent my hometown and my country, and I'm gonna fight.<eos> He has to find a way to make it to the second part.<eos> And he does it.
Yungyung Kim comes into Level 2 with 60 points, and he'll need more than 100 to move on to Level 3.<eos> If he doesn't, Adrian Raya of Mexico will be moving on.<eos> He slams into the second platform.<eos> I mean, he hit that thing really hard.<eos> - Yeah, he does it.
At the fourth jump, he aimed too low.<eos> Woosung Yu having great difficulty right now.<eos> The hands are hurting, look at them!<eos> And after struggling for over two minutes, South Korea's Wild Horse, he pulled off the impossible...<eos> And he does it!
He'd better, because he is a five-time Brazilian climbing champion.<eos> This guy is made for the Mag Wall.<eos> He's got it! He's got it.<eos> He was one of our few competitors to finish Level 1 the first time, so can he do it again in the finals?<eos> And he did it!
He's relieved.<eos> Even he's shocked.<eos> And this is it.<eos> Steven Tucker's fate hangs on this last jump.<eos> He does it!
- No, he doesn't!<eos> Grabs that thing, gets the points on the Point Thruster.<eos> Now he's just gotta get over to that platform, and he's sitting pretty!<eos> He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!
I don't think I've seen it done that way very much.<eos> This is a testament once again to this guy's unbelievable strength.<eos> Great technique.<eos> He's going to be up over the Dreadmill so he can jump down onto them, and there he goes!<eos> He does it!
I don't know about the gun.<eos> There are vestiges of the contagion in your irises.<eos> You... don't have the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> What sort of stupid thing is that to say?<eos> Of course I don't.
So, you understand what I'm saying?<eos> The point is this:<eos> He rapes, but he saves.<eos> And he saves more than he rapes.<eos> But he probably does rape.
And hit men are drive by profit and self-preservation.<eos> They don't take a job unless they know all the angles.<eos> So, to predict their behavior, we need to ask ourselves a simple question.<eos> We know why Cat wanted revenge on Reid.<eos> Why does Lindsey?
-Being in this other...<eos> -Ah, well, that I always had.<eos> No, but having breasts, having...<eos> Not wanting that person's breasts, but wanting breasts for yourself.<eos> Never very much. Clearly, I never did.
We were describing her as a missing person.<eos> He wrote everything down, he left.<eos> The three of us gathered around a little table.<eos> And I said Mass.<eos> We did a little bread and wine, and I did the Mass, a consecration.
That's it, just "no"?<eos> This is disgusting.<eos> This is disgusting.<eos> He's saying nothing happened before me, so... And Charles is saying,<eos> "Oh, no, definitely, it did."
Come on, everybody.<eos> You'll all have to scooch into the back of my car. I hope that's okay.<eos> If it helps I could drive separately.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Oh! Oh, no you don't.
What you do is dangerous. - I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know<eos> - what I do is worth it. - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
Oh, look what I have here.<eos> What was your first trick you learned?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> That's really private.<eos> No, I don't.
What did I tell you right before I left?<eos> Would you like a wafer?<eos> Bathroom.<eos> Oh, God. Do you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> You do.
Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing.<eos> Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
...had I not gone off to Egypt.<eos> Son, are you all right?<eos> Your hand, it's very warm.<eos> Son! I think I could've been a prophet.<eos> Joseph, what do you...
She likes that type of stuff.<eos> Yeah, I can think of seven good uses of a cadaver today.<eos> No, Dr. Frankenstein, we got to turn in the body if there's one in there.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Don't do that.
Hi.<eos> Ozzy rocks!<eos> Yeah!<eos> It's...<eos> He certainly does rock.
Wade?<eos> Don't worry, baby... I'mma get you out of that shit-box.<eos> What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours?<eos> Oh, you never left.<eos> But you did, asshole!
My parents died when I was a little boy.<eos> In many ways, El Toro has been like a father to me.<eos> Just as you will be to all of our people.<eos> This country needs a change.<eos> Yes, it does.
Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.<eos> I do... Please.
Thanks, Poppy.<eos> Thanks to all of you!<eos> Even you, I guess.<eos> I just never thought something like that could happen to me.<eos> And it just did!
We both drop it right and we drop it all the time.<eos> The melody came to me one night... when I was getting super, super, super baked.<eos> Like fuck-a-guy baked.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, he does.
- What you buying?<eos> I'm not buying anything, ma'am.<eos> I just want to know if you've seen this woman.<eos> - No, I don't know. I don't know.<eos> - This woman, does she...
Get to the castle.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> - Over here!<eos> Me! Me!<eos> Me! - I do!
Now get him!<eos> Hey, it's not honorable to fight girls.<eos> Then stop acting like one.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You did not...
Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
Well, nor should they.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> If people want to fornicate, I see no reason to stop them.<eos> And if they wish to lie down with animals?<eos> Do they?
I know about your son.<eos> You know, I wouldn't let you be with Trevor without first doing my due diligence.<eos> What do you know exactly?<eos> Everything.<eos> So does Trevor.
Got an old hardware store that charges twice what home depot does, one restaurant with a rattlesnake for a waitress.<eos> I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?<eos> People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years.<eos> But they don't do it no more.
I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?<eos> People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years.<eos> But they don't do it no more.<eos> Well, maybe your people did.
You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
What you mean, "got tight"?<eos> I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.<eos> I laugh and joke with 'em all. Bono, you know me.<eos> Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.<eos> How you doing, Mr. Bono?
Go on.<eos> I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!<eos> Yeah, he did!
You buzz me up, and I'll give you a free dance on the way down.<eos> How about that?<eos> I'll let you up.<eos> I like Gordon Lightfoot.<eos> Who doesn't?
God damn, I'm pumped up.<eos> Okay, this is a little awkward, babe.<eos> James wants me to go away with him for a couple days on official police business.<eos> I don't wanna go.<eos> I don't.
Target is contained and preparing for transport.<eos> Containment confirmed.<eos> I repeat, containment confirmed.<eos> She thought she was saving the world.<eos> So did they all.
I know what it's like to lose your friends because you're different.<eos> But I also know that one person can change everything.<eos> And you just have to open up to them.<eos> How did you know you could trust the people you opened up to?<eos> I didn't.
It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
Then we'll find out.<eos> We're done here.<eos> So, you know Lars?<eos> Nah, not really.<eos> My daughter does though.
You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
Never saw him before.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> You know the girl?<eos> I mean, not per se, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I bring danger to you all.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we're up here.<eos> They already do.
Why?<eos> Because I don't like to start out with kissing.<eos> Because you won't learn anything.<eos> I want to start from here. Travel down from your stomach and kiss down there first. A hard kiss.<eos> Then do it.
- Hi, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
- What? - What a crazy fucking night.<eos> - I'm in heaven.<eos> - God, I feel amazing.<eos> Hey, hey, he's not feeling anything.<eos> - I don't... - What?
With a murder, that could easily run $150,000.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna do that to you.<eos> I'm charging a flat fee.<eos> $75,000 if it goes to trial, and half of that if it doesn't.<eos> If it doesn't what?
We all better figure it out fast 'cause I don't like it here.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> There was no way they could've known we'd be in this van.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> They did.
I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.<eos> I care about you and him.<eos> I know that, Sam.<eos> And he does, too.
- Defendant, please rise.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
If I knew, I would.<eos> It's good to see some familiar faces.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Angus' death.<eos> I always thought when that wee bastard fell, that you would fall with him.<eos> So did I.
'Cause everybody wants to be the king.<eos> I slapped you like a little bitch.<eos> I'm not the kind of man to use a closed fist on a woman.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I... I didn't...
I have been given an opportunity to do something good, to save humanity.<eos> You sound like my mother.<eos> I have given us all a purpose.<eos> All of us, we play a role in preserving the future, and you should understand that.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yeah.
I have been called by the Ellcrys.<eos> I must go to the Sanctuary immediately.<eos> If you really are a Druid... prove it.<eos> Show us some magic.<eos> I don't do tricks.
I don't want a penny from the bastard who killed Antonio.<eos> What?<eos> You're a little tipsy, let's save the wine for later.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
Akasaka worked out the details.<eos> Requested vehicles have all been prepped. Plus explosives drills have been conducted and quite successfully, I might add.<eos> Forces are execution-ready.<eos> I owe you thanks.<eos> No, you don't.
- Do not use me for your lies.<eos> - Those men respect you.<eos> They respect me because they know who I am.<eos> - They know I am loyal.<eos> - As do I.
Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Well, that is convenient for you.<eos> You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?<eos> Your square jaw, your golden armor.<eos> Tell me, I want to know.<eos> I truly do.
- In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
I'm making these bacon rolls real greasy, Dad.<eos> Bullshit artist.<eos> Am not.<eos> Bullshit. You make this the greasiest feast since that goose you cooked on Christmas.<eos> Done and done, Dad.
Yeah, we all are.<eos> I had a really good time tonight.<eos> I really liked seeing you and Dad happy together.<eos> Do you think that seeing you all over the internet like that makes me happy?<eos> Do you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Can I try again?<eos> Can I try again, please?<eos> No! No fucking way!<eos> No. - I didn't...
Look, until I know what I'm dealing with, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This isn't our town.<eos> We don't even know where to begin.<eos> I do.
I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in.<eos> It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.<eos> "I told you a million times."<eos> --Do the arm thing.<eos> Do it, freak!
You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I don't know, he's way out of range.<eos> ...son of a bitch! Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.<eos> We can't understand you.<eos> Yes, I copy!<eos> Do you?
Like on your postcards.<eos> Or that little smile.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Did they talk to you?<eos> Suzanne just did, right?
Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die.<eos> I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
And then he asked me to marry him.<eos> - No he didn't!<eos> - Yes. - Right out in the field? - Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, Lord, that man might be crazy.<eos> Well, when you gonna do it?
What you saw in that video, that is my job.<eos> I have called in air strikes, bombed villages, I've...<eos> Thrown grenades into houses.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> It doesn't.
- What?<eos> I need to tell them the truth.<eos> No, you don't. Let it go.<eos> - They need to know.<eos> - No, they don't. - Robert.
I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Trainee Chang, how are we supposed to believe that our client killed his sister when you haven't even produced a body?<eos> Because the circumstantial evidence is enough for a murder conviction, assuming that we have excluded all reasonable hypotheses.<eos> Have you?<eos> The FBI believes that it has.<eos> I, on the other hand, do not.
He needs a prime number.<eos> - Something like 607. - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
Enough of this fucking middle man shit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> No problem. I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
That's a nice country beat there.<eos> Okay, let's get clapping.<eos> (Ukulele ♪♪) Here we go!<eos> ♪ Who likes chicken?<eos> Well, I do ♪
Pffft! I'm sick of getting pushed around by you three bitches!<eos> 'kay, Randy, what you going to do about it?<eos> Do you want a fucking piece of this?<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> Julian: No, he doesn't.
Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
That's Irma.<eos> She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
But in his eyes, I saw no shadow of reproach.<eos> I saw only light.<eos> The light of God.<eos> You mean, of the gods.<eos> I do not, friend Gracchus.
Policeman: Will you put out an APB on two Bamp; E suspects running through the woods near Colby Village South.<eos> One's a bigger guy, no shirt on, purple tits.<eos> Uh, the other guy's wearing khaki clothes, bald, and may have pissed himself.<eos> Repeat: may have pissed himself.<eos> He did, for sure.
I wasn't there, Ted!<eos> (Sigh) Sorry... sorry, sorry...<eos> Why the fuck not?<eos> Because I'm not getting paid enough to do the... (Engine ignition) the things that they want me to do to them to keep them out.<eos> Do what things to them?
That went clean through.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, come on, this ain't your fault. It ain't your fault.<eos> How you doing?
Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do.
If they are, they're dead.<eos> I hope not.<eos> We need them alive.<eos> We need to find out more.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
So, what else did she say?<eos> And don't leave out a single thing, okay?<eos> Well, uh, she says we're BFFs.<eos> I think she wants to represent you.<eos> Oh, no, she doesn't.
Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
If you do, the legitimacy of your Khanate will forever be in question.<eos> Your people will wonder why the great Kublai Khan was so afraid to let their voices be heard.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Once again, they do not.
Awesome.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> - Hey. That's my focus puller.<eos> You can't fire him.<eos> And yet, I just did.
Fine, whatever.<eos> But I'm telling you, they would change your life.<eos> Okay. Ruby. Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
That's so much worse! [ Groans ]<eos> Last night might have been just a little too fast, okay?<eos> I'm sorry I took advantage of you like that. "Took advantage"?<eos> Darius, no.<eos> You didn't.
Just grow up, Jefferson.<eos> The future of the world is at stake, and if you insist on getting yourself killed, as terrible as that might be for your mother, or me, who, incidentally, would also die,<eos> I am more concerned with the billions of people who will die because of your... arrogant adolescent ego!<eos> Okay.<eos> Please don't... don't...
No. Not unless I can find a high-quality lens or learn how to make one.<eos> I think I can get one for you.<eos> You can get a telescope lens?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No, you do not. Hmm.
No.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!
Do you want to insult me? Go ahead.<eos> That's also what the prosecutor is looking for. That the arrogant idiot that is inside comes out.<eos> Enough!<eos> Are you are not here to defend me?<eos> Then, do it.
Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
Ok. I might have something.<eos> Now, until the FBI gets their way, smartphones are protected by encryption.<eos> If you don't enter your passcode after enough times, then the device bricks itself, right?<eos> Curtis, I don't even have the time to tell you that I don't have the time.<eos> You just did.
That's where we lost the tether.<eos> It's up to you, Mr. Ramse.<eos> Initiate Spencer sequence.<eos> You can take off the masks.<eos> No virus did this.
Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.<eos> - Yeah, but it was.<eos> - It lasted nine seasons.<eos> Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time, so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.<eos> It did that well.
Get him dressed.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Did you bring me breakfast?<eos> - Christ!<eos> Did you? Here.
I get it.<eos> You'll always protect me, no matter what.<eos> Even if I hate you for it.<eos> You deserve to be free of Klaus.<eos> We all do.
We'll be together and here you can be whatever you want.<eos> Never give up, the important thing is not where the soul goes but how it returns, is not it?<eos> Who told you that, son? Huh?<eos> What's it?<eos> - You did.
You drove right past me.<eos> You didn't say anything.<eos> I screamed.<eos> You didn't scream very loud.<eos> Yes, I did.
I heard you, but...<eos> What's next? Huh?<eos> What's the next excuse, Jay?<eos> Either you love me and you want the world to know it.<eos> Or you don't.
I... I mean...<eos> Now, I count two ankles, two knees, one elbow.<eos> And guess what?<eos> I got five more rounds.<eos> I don't...
It was, "One shot, one kill."<eos> The point is, if I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.<eos> Why... why am I here?<eos> Why did you ask me to stay?<eos> I don't...
I assumed that the stories that I read in the paper about your attacks on the criminal world were apocryphal.<eos> How could one man be capable of such... violence?<eos> But then I saw it... with my own two eyes.<eos> And when one comes across someone with such talent... with such a gift... well... you don't let that go to waste.<eos> No, you don't.
Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
He hired me for a number three special: blackmail.<eos> Slip him a roofie, get naked, whip out a selfie stick, and voilà.<eos> Why would he have any desire to blackmail his own star client, a client he's all about protecting?<eos> Ty's agent told you that Debra killed Ali.<eos> He did, yeah.
Let it go!<eos> It was that or you were a reject.<eos> It's your life!<eos> I shouldn't have helped.<eos> You didn't!
- Please, take Karina.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I said don't do that!<eos> Don't do that.
Excuse me.<eos> You need to get out of here now!<eos> I tr...<eos> I tried to do the right thing.<eos> You always do.
I can't imagine he wants to hear that.<eos> He definitely doesn't.<eos> I mean, you guys don't wanna hear that.<eos> Try and tell you guys... Izzy:<eos> I don't.
Abraham.<eos> I'll be there in a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> We know each other, don't we?<eos> We once did.
It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing...<eos> Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
We have to kill everybody who knows about it.<eos> So... I guess I got to kill you, too.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> You don't, uh...
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.
(CLEARS THROAT) Hey.<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry about your dad.<eos> Brooke, you have to believe us.<eos> We didn't...
Touvier will say that's why he arrested him.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> If we don't find an anti-Semitic intention, Touvier could get away once again.<eos> The execution will prove to be a war crime. His lawyers will play on the prescription.<eos> What about what he did in the synagogue?
You were just sweet.<eos> Do you know if I slept with William?<eos> No.<eos> You don't know.<eos> No, you didn't.
I was up all night.<eos> I needed something, or I'll never finish these paintings in time.<eos> You need to keep a clear head.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> We both do.
But... I've just been swimming in the same pool for too long.<eos> There are new seas out there that I have to go conquer.<eos> Hmm. I need to dive.<eos> Everything is changing so fast.<eos> I do not do well with change.
What's that?<eos> Well, me and Eddie started playing cards one day... Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on.<eos> There was no winner. So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next.<eos> And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on.<eos> How long did it?
Can I talk to Lily?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Do you know who made it?<eos> Do you...
- Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage.<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
Drugs that came from here.<eos> Does this business have something to do with his death?<eos> You don't sound too surprised.<eos> Are you saying that you knew he was thieving drugs?<eos> Uh, yes. We did.
Liar.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> It's for the Belgian ambassador.<eos> They always say it's going to rain when it's hot, when the air gets thick, and you want it to rain, a deep, cleansing rain that knocks the dirt out of the sky and leaves everything clear,<eos> but it never really does.
Hold your breath!<eos> No!<eos> - John, Emily, don't breathe!<eos> - Uncle Frank! No!<eos> No! Don't...
How can I help?<eos> They offered us a deal for him to get out in five years, and Jessica wants to take it.<eos> But I want to fight for him.<eos> Let me guess, she wants to present a united front.<eos> She does.
They're resilient.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Well, Mike, you don't have kids.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> No. I don't.
Oh, my God, it's perfect.<eos> Is it still available?<eos> - An offer went in this morning.<eos> - We have to beat it.<eos> No, Louis, we don't.
I'm not.<eos> I'm going somewhere else.<eos> Oh, look who it is, the man of the hour.<eos> - Did you get my indictments?<eos> - I sure as hell did.
I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.<eos> But if you get out of here and I don't, you should know, I can get to you just as easily out there as I can in here.<eos> And when I say "get to you," you got to remember what I did to make Harvey put me away in the first place.<eos> Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?<eos> No, Rachel, I don't.
That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
Go, go!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
Hand drill gets you into the back seat.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got -- records, money transfers, pictures, videos.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> When?<eos> When do we do this?
It's inoperable.<eos> One of these days, his heart's just going to explode.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know about that.<eos> Everybody does.
Rojon? Rrrrr.<eos> R-R-Rojohn. Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
Look at that.<eos> Views of the whole city.<eos> And a company pool.<eos> You must do well to afford all that.<eos> We do well.
-Yes, yes, yes.<eos> -[Noelle] Yeah, yeah.<eos> Don't fret.<eos> -He wouldn't do it for, like, any, like--<eos> -Don't you do it.
What, some stale milk and an old piece of cheese?<eos> - And it costs £1.8 million?<eos> - Yes. How much is that, Jeremy, in rand?<eos> Ten hundred and 30 million and a million.<eos> But for that it does 0-60 in 2.9 seconds?
Cramps.<eos> Luke and I just split a Beef Wellington and clams casino.<eos> Um, I'm wondering if you'd, uh, sponsor me for the new-members thing tonight.<eos> Gee, I'd like to, but they got rules about relatives sponsoring new members, so...<eos> No, they don't.
She could top herself, but not kill someone else.<eos> - Have they arrested her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You think she did it?<eos> No, I don't.
You got my back, right?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't have hers either.<eos> Wh... I need help getting her to understand.<eos> No, you don't.
All right! First hug, favorite son.<eos> Oh, I don't love you more, Jameson, you know that.<eos> Oh, hear that?<eos> That means she loves me more.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Do you know who this belongs to?<eos> Do you?
So the case had been broken for some time.<eos> Russell was the friend you took to Maui.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> And considering your husband has a memento from the trip, I'm guessing he doesn't know.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
She and The Boy have a close bond, so with luck, she'll lead you to him.<eos> They've been trying, but our initial approach was overly confrontational.<eos> Telling the Firm you wanna meet Mr. Song?<eos> I have a client who's interested in rare-earth metals.<eos> No, you don't.
He is the face of the enemy we must always fight, always overcome.<eos> And if we are the lambs of God, then he...<eos> He is the eternal wolf.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> You didn't.
So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
-So, what's the job?<eos> -Hatton Garden.<eos> The vault, yeah?<eos> I've got it all sussed out.<eos> The ring leader, Brian Reader, did his first break-in at age 11.
But how long will that finger be on your hand?<eos> We have information to suggest the Trollhunter possesses the Birthstone.<eos> They weren't supposed to know about that.<eos> I thought you burned the books.<eos> I did.
Oh, so you think he's playing hard to get?<eos> Or the more likely scenario:<eos> He lost his phone in, like, a fire.<eos> - Yeah, I think he lost his phone.<eos> - Yeah. I do too.
So what did they want to know about Stevie and I?<eos> If I'd seen you commit any crimes.<eos> And drugs.<eos> They think you're selling a lotta drugs.<eos> - Do they?
- Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless?<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did. You did.
- A "CDO manager"?<eos> Yeah, at Harding Advisors.<eos> I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.<eos> We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio and monitor the assets.<eos> I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.
Who are you?<eos> I'm no princess.<eos> I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.<eos> I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.<eos> But if it does,
-What?<eos> I need to say something.<eos> Ben, it's fine.<eos> -You don't have to do this.<eos> -No, I do.
Yeah?<eos> That was your trick, here's mine.<eos> Stay away!<eos> - I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> - Oh, but it did.
Ten days.<eos> Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days ago.<eos> What's that, a coincidence?<eos> Detective on the case, Guerrero, he know about all this?<eos> Of course he does.
What if this company goes belly-up too?<eos> That's not gonna happen, because this company is a lot bigger than Daddy's company was.<eos> And that's better, huh?<eos> They promised us a car, right, babe?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Annie, look at me.<eos> Just do it. Don't think about it. Okay?<eos> Stop yelling at me, Jack.<eos> - Don't think about it. Look at me.<eos> - Don't do it, Mommy!
And then I came out?<eos> Then you came out, yep.<eos> And then they spanked me?<eos> Well, they spank all little babies 'cause they're trying to get them to cry.<eos> - But she didn't?
What do I got to do?<eos> What do I got to do, say it again? - You want me to say it again?<eos> - You want to fight me? Do you want to say it again?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Why do you do this in front of all...
There are no other men like me, and no other women like you either, of course.<eos> You've become some kind of, queen.<eos> No, just a woman who misses her man.<eos> Oh you mean your officer who joined in the glories of war.<eos> Yes, I do.
I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
Yes.<eos> Did I want to provide for my family and for my kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I didn't.
I'm dying, yes.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> All right, what to do?<eos> What to do?<eos> What to do?
I got about a thousand in storage.<eos> No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.<eos> They told me what happened to your colleague.<eos> We don't have to do this now.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know.<eos> What in the world are you doing?<eos> Ma always wanted us to clear this field together.<eos> You and me?<eos> No, she didn't.
- Never again to America?<eos> The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.<eos> I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.<eos> Let's go for a smoke.<eos> I don't.
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
- Thank you for coming.<eos> - Thank you. - Go get the next person, Tony.<eos> Neil.<eos> Sorry, we have legal stuff with Barry, now.<eos> Yes, we do.
The next name is... Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
Let's just give her a minute. This is about her.<eos> You don't have to be here right now...<eos> But she needs somebody to support her through this.<eos> - Uhh! I'm fine!<eos> - No, she doesn't.

- How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we all did.
I haven't really checked yet.<eos> Shouldn't we just go?<eos> Together?<eos> I thought you didn't like the idea.<eos> But I do.
You told me no divorce.<eos> Victor!<eos> Introduce your friend to Rachida.<eos> Everyone knows Victor Mayence.<eos> How do you do.
You want to be my partner?<eos> It's 20%.<eos> You call it whatever you want.<eos> I meet my partners.<eos> Well, I don't.
Rob?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> You've gotta get your circulation going.<eos> Okay, my love.<eos> You do it...
(GASPING)<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> (CAR ENGINES START)<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
Yeah, some bulls are nice like that.<eos> This is... Yeah, okay.<eos> Excuse us, sorry.<eos> So how do you know which one you're gonna get?<eos> You don't.
- Cut it out.<eos> - Let him go.<eos> Let my boss go or I'll whack her.<eos> - Let my boss go, now! - Let him go.<eos> - Do it!
But I'm not gonna let you do it.<eos> I can't let anyone else die because of me.<eos> No one else is gonna die because of you.<eos> Tori's gonna find a way to disable the disks...<eos> And if she doesn't?
A song, ma'am.<eos> I have no voice.<eos> Come on, ma'am, you've got a lovely voice.<eos> I thought we were rather good together.<eos> So did I.
Come.<eos> Dina Tonerre.<eos> And you don't have to look me in the eye.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> - I just do it.
I turn up, they never know it's me.<eos> Do you have quarters? Because it costs 50 cents.<eos> What, I gotta pay?<eos> No, because it doesn't exist.<eos> Yes, it does!
No matter which way I look, everywhere just wasteland.<eos> I have until a week ago not even seen the sea.<eos> Now I swim in it rum.<eos> Only a few days ago a stranger comes up to me and offers me that he helps me, my dream to live.<eos> No shit, how often does something like that before already?
- Make it a good one.<eos> -[screaming]<eos> -[Gale] People always say to us, "Well, you guys must have known you were gonna do sequels<eos> "because of the ending of the first movie."<eos> Well, no, we didn't.
At least the toilet never smells when they're done.<eos> What are they doing in there if not pooping?<eos> How should I know?<eos> -They never even admit that they fart.<eos> No Finni, they don't...
Celal!<eos> Did you let her know?<eos> A slim waist and a good set of teeth.<eos> Celal, did you tell her that you don't want a moustache?<eos> I did.
Hairstyle<eos> Hairstyle<eos> Joining the movies?<eos> - I wanted to<eos> Sure, I did
Grab my tits.<eos> Grab 'em. Feel 'em.<eos> You wanna lick 'em? Uh-<eos> - Shit. You wanna lick 'em?<eos> Yes, you do.
Joy, he's really doing fine.<eos> I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> I'm supposed to be happy.<eos> You just need to rest, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Goodbye, Minnie.<eos> I'm better than you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I always thought I wanted to be exactly like my mom.<eos> But she thinks she needs a man to be happy.<eos> I don't.
I can't guarantee that.<eos> In Washington, 10 of the original 19 subpoenaed began their testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> I do.
Oh, he's always had very powerful legs!<eos> I think he's just bounced himself over the edge! ~ Oh!<eos> ~ Oh! I can't bear to look!<eos> Don't!<eos> Please, don't!
[boy] You don't know anything about sneakers, do you?<eos> Hi. Merry after Christmas.<eos> Hi. What are you doing here?<eos> Remember how you told me you wanted these sneakers and you were gonna camp out?<eos> -I did?
He's a drunk, you know, it's probably not in the report.<eos> He got us all involved in that Evangelical stuff, like that would make things better.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
What?<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Shit, what the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Don't...
Saw you following us and shit.<eos> You have fun?<eos> What the fuck do you want, man?<eos> I want to know who did the drive-by on one of your corners.<eos> Oh, you do?
- That's a good one.<eos> Do another one.<eos> - Okay, okay. - Different pose. - Hold on.<eos> How do we know if Alonzo's even here?<eos> We don't.
I was so insecure, and you saved me, all right?<eos> You rescued me.<eos> Now, I don't know what to do. I...<eos> - You know what to do.<eos> - No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand<eos> - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
This was a gift.<eos> A gift?<eos> Wow. [Chuckles]<eos> Wow. Love is swell... but it is not something you build a life around.<eos> Actually, some people do.
What? Yeah, you know, just, in England, we could find something...<eos> You and me in England?<eos> So now they want you to go to England with me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Of course they do. Yep.
I dance.<eos> What else do you do?<eos> That's it, really.<eos> There's got to be more to you than this place.<eos> What do you...
He arrived just before you did.<eos> And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
- No joke, Jim.<eos> Gordo, Gus, and Wally said they'd stand with us, too.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know you are.<eos> I'll tell you what, if or when I need it, I promise I'll come to you.<eos> I don't care who you go to, as long as you go to somebody.<eos> What I need you to understand is that you and I,<eos> - we do things differently.
Perhaps, but the mason who works there...<eos> - At Monte Morello?<eos> - He's a friend, an honest man.<eos> He says they found it there.<eos> - He did?
I promise I will find whoever killed Charlie.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> No more public displays of rage.<eos> You said you didn't trust me 'cause I'm a drunk.<eos> I did.
Then we lose the crew.<eos> We either have a high chance of killing one person... or a low chance of killing six people.<eos> How do we make that decision?<eos> We don't have to make it, Bruce.<eos> He does.
Or are you rehearsing for a judge.<eos> Look. If your sheriff is anywhere near those interviews, all the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer, you should know that.<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes I do.
Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
Come here.<eos> Bring me that hot ass.<eos> Hey. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> I want this... And you.<eos> I really do.
You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a dui accident, wound up here.<eos> I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, i thought i was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did i.
Honestly, they are old enough to post their own pictures.<eos> Let me make times.<eos> This is the worst train accident in France for 25 years.<eos> Initial reports said there are six dead and dozens injured, nine of them fatal.<eos> More about the circumstances of this drama does Richard Place.
It's not her problem. Okay.<eos> It's...<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> No, it's me. I have a body issue.<eos> - Honey, you don't...
Anywhere there's horses.<eos> It must seem odd to a sheltered girl like you...<eos> Who knows where she belongs.<eos> I never knew where I belong.<eos> I do, now, but... At our farm...
- Thanks.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> Oh, well don't worry.<eos> Some people try for 10 years until they can have kids.<eos> And others never do.
They were out there a while, right? Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.
And running makes me feel better.<eos> I can't forget.<eos> I dream about it.<eos> Being in the forest with them.<eos> I do, too.
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?<eos> No.<eos> It's hard to be a cynic after that.<eos> Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- Not your fault.<eos> They're not really playing with a full deck, those Kettlemans.<eos> - You had to take their case?<eos> - I'm sorry, okay? I tried.<eos> I really did.
- Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
My French and Italian are better, but when I was in grade school, I could reach three countries on my bike from my house.<eos> Yet none of those countries speak Spanish.<eos> The Spanish I learned in Tehran.<eos> They speak Spanish in Iran?<eos> Spanish teachers do.
"Shane looks after me." Shane's his problem.<eos> If we could get him to talk...<eos> If we push him now, Shane's toy solicitor is only gonna scream "undue pressure".<eos> Let's wait and see, and if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't? What if he doesn't?
Take him the ring! He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
At that age, I was really uncomfortable with my body.<eos> I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it...<eos> And then one day it didn't.
They're here.<eos> And you unlocked the door for them.<eos> We can go a little faster, if you want.<eos> I'm doing the speed limit.<eos> Nobody does the speed limit.
Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> - The commander does.
I think it's called bloodroot?<eos> Apparently, it will put a man to sleep, or make him go mad and even kill him.<eos> Who have you been talking to?<eos> Priest Xerxes said the only person he knew who would have some was you.<eos> Did he?
Hmm? Because there's no other reason why he'd get in a boat.<eos> I'm sorry, Daniel, but Stark hates water.<eos> He can't even swim.<eos> Really?<eos> How do you...
Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah.<eos> But you did.
Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious, too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself.<eos> He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.
- Oh.<eos> Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Good for you.<eos> What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
Try the pay phone first.<eos> If he's not there, try the car, where he lives.<eos> Pardon my French, but, Au bon pain!<eos> How do I know you?<eos> You don't.
We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
- We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
What he means is what you got worth taking anymore, Frank?<eos> My associate. His name's Ben Caspere.<eos> He was into that sweet Eastern Bloc pussy you all run between clubs.<eos> So, some of you might have girls that know him.<eos> Daniel here did.
That's $5 million of my money.<eos> Hold it, we were given to understand that our partnership was with Catalast.<eos> Had Mr. Caspere made payment, it would have been.<eos> And your name would have been added to the corporate charter for the development.<eos> But he didn't.
Oh, God.<eos> Hey, look, I don't think...<eos> This wouldn't help you.<eos> It might.<eos> It usually does.
You were right, Yaroslava. - Rights? For what?<eos> Now I understand what is not with the one you love.<eos> You were against the marriage with Igor. Remember. Shit talking, sister.<eos> I did not think love Igor, and that he wants to become a prince.<eos> Do it!
You...<eos> You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
You can't tell stories about people like us.<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Did you know that the bumblebee is unable to fly?<eos> It shouldn't be able to fly with its tiny wings.<eos> - But it does so anyway, right?
- For sex?<eos> - For dinner.<eos> - And sex? - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go to Guy's. No, no.<eos> Do it here.
Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll get it to the House right away.<eos> - Green light on the release? - Yes.<eos> I don't remember giving you my phone number.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Your publisher did.
How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
Doing it is the easy part.<eos> Knowing what it is is tough.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You know what the right thing to do is.<eos> No. No, I don't, Matthew.
BULLOCK:<eos> So, what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is. We need someone close to them. Someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I'd be better off if she had died out...<eos> Hope she rots in hell!<eos> - I never wanted this.<eos> - No one did.
No, not the stone.<eos> The mountain.<eos> It's the loudest thing here.<eos> Well, now take that frequency and see if you can amplify it.<eos> The last time I did something like this,
She does, which is why I don't have a lot of time here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, sir, first, you are going to need ...<eos> - A lanyard.<eos> Yes, I do.
I thought that that might belong to her.<eos> A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn't it?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to her.<eos> I kept hoping that if she was alive, evil would never find her.<eos> Not like it did me.
I'm just curious.<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> You know.<eos> We both know.<eos> I don't.
He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> My dad did.
I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You must really want to be president.<eos> I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.<eos> The way you choose to raise them is your business.<eos> Do I want the best for my kids?<eos> Yes, I do.
It says here we need to expon more food to better our country.<eos> But what's the point, if we Ethiopians can't afford to eat the food we grow ourselves?<eos> That's right!<eos> Looks to me you're eating alright.<eos> What you doing, bumpkin?
You gave me this mission.<eos> You're the reason I'm here.<eos> Now, it's been two years, Cassie.<eos> Please tell me you know who Leland Frost is.<eos> I don't.
Shoot<eos> There is no new order, just the end of everything.<eos> Why are you so willing to die?<eos> I got it coming.<eos> Other people don't.
You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
Brazil?<eos> Why would... Mason move to Brazil?<eos> Apparently there was a girl involved. And he decided to go hike the Amazon with her for a year. You know, live off the grid, write his memoirs or something.<eos> Wow, I guess you really don't know anyone.<eos> - No, you don't. - Hey, baby.
'Have you met my other half? '<eos> Then when you meet that person... .. you know it's true.<eos> You're only really whole when you're with each other.<eos> Never ends well, does it?<eos> ~ What doesn't?
Still looking for secrets, are we, sir?<eos> Or just breaking stuff?<eos> Secrets.<eos> ALFRED:<eos> Why don't I...?
Maybe we can help each other. I need to know more about Nina.<eos> You should come on my podcast, tell me all the stuff that Nina was doing and own your part.<eos> Everybody loves a redemption story.<eos> He is definitely hiding something.<eos> I did some digging into "Mr. Seth Branson."
I think we go public, put his name and face to the media, force him into one place. Keep him still and then... figure out what he does next.<eos> And you think he's rational enough for us to be able do that?<eos> He's delusional, but not deranged.<eos> I mean, the way he sees it, he's just going to do what's necessary to... to get what he needs just to keep going, you know?<eos> How you doing, Ben?
The safe house intel in the game was stolen in a hack of the CIA mainframe three weeks ago.<eos> Details from six other unknown operations and safe houses were taken.<eos> Ralph had nothing to do with hacking the CIA.<eos> I know.<eos> But they don't.
Phil, did you shave your chest? Sure did.<eos> Did you shave yours?<eos> JK.<eos> No.<eos> But I did.
! - I don't know what happened.<eos> I mean, we went down there in the middle of the night, right?<eos> And sh-she was all tied up securely and everything. We woke up this morning, she was just gone.<eos> I thought you said you tied a good clove hitch.<eos> I did!
Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
He excommunicated us.<eos> Me.<eos> No, he said "accomplices."<eos> He didn't mean you.<eos> Yes, he did.
I told Kimberly the reason I couldn't sleep with her was... because I had to serve Jesus instead.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you didn't sleep with her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Someone who just talks about things so openly.<eos> Maybe you could actually help me with some things that I'm going through.<eos> Difficult things.<eos> I... you know where to find me.<eos> Well, actually, I don't.
So I'm just supposed to trust- You.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would you in the future endanger you in the now?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> No, it doesn't, does it?
It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now. Yeah.
Well, I don't understend where this is going.<eos> Mark entered eight tournaments.<eos> You were not an official for two of them, - where he finished 83rd and 95th.<eos> - It happens.<eos> Yes, it does.
She's right, you know.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> I am really angry.<eos> I'm a big bully, and I don't know where it comes from.<eos> You don't?
Aah!<eos> Ow!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We both do.
What happened?<eos> I... I burned it off. To prove my loyalty to the pastor.<eos> And that?<eos> Also part of your cover? I did what I had to to complete my mission.<eos> And you did.
You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
There was no harm done.<eos> Yes, there was.<eos> I actually made Jackie believe that I feel this way about you.<eos> Well, I don't care what Jackie thinks.<eos> Only what you do.
We need to talk.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea. Jason...<eos> We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Maybe it's our turn.<eos> I'm OK now. I can drive.<eos> - You're not even close to fine.<eos> - I'm fine. And you need blood.<eos> We both do.
Shelley?<eos> - Any sign?<eos> - No.<eos> - You said she was here.<eos> - Actually, I didn't.
They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
You are not really here for the funeral.<eos> - Why am I here?<eos> - I think Anton has been kidnapped.<eos> And he is the same perpetrator who took your daughter seven years ago.<eos> What I do?
- You don't waste time.<eos> -Of course not.<eos> Chic!<eos> - You like them?<eos> -I do indeed.
Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way.<eos> I wish you hadn't seen that.<eos> Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man,<eos> Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part?<eos> I do.
I'm gonna count to three.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> One...<eos> Put the money in the bag.<eos> Do it!
What?<eos> The transplant. - How much time left?<eos> - 5 hours.<eos> Know where you're going?<eos> Of course I do.
But we get tested for chlamydia...<eos> How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...
How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.
Are you having sex with Lyndsey while you're sleeping with our social worker?<eos> Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Look, look, this thing with Lyndsey just happened.<eos> A-And, honestly, I-I'm glad it did.
"The King cannot copulate with a woman.<eos> "He has neither skill, nor vigour."<eos> I didn't say... These are not MY words.<eos> I don't own them!<eos> You do now.
We're the police. It's all right, it's all over now.<eos> Look at me, madam. Come here...<eos> Look! There she is!<eos> Do you know her or not?<eos> - Do you?
That wasn't our plan.<eos> - Now we can't go to Mexico.<eos> - Théo, look at me.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I never did.
- Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
- Five minutes after I seek them.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> I'll get help.<eos> Do not move.<eos> Do not do it.
'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.<eos> And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.<eos> No, I don't. Then why?
What did you just say to me?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't say that--<eos> Because you pity me?<eos> Yeah, you did.
I just started there, and they don't kill people any more.<eos> And you believe that, you gullible American prick?<eos> I only took the job because of you, you fucking ingrate shrew!<eos> Fucking Christ!<eos> Why the fuck did I...?
Not everyone can appreciate it here.<eos> All this lovely darkness.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No.<eos> I really don't.
Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
If it was up to me? - Yes.<eos> - I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
Yes.<eos> No. That's fabricating evidence.<eos> The feds want her on the stand, under oath.<eos> Um, maya. Do you swear everything you're going to tell us Will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Calling out to the Mark.<eos> I can hear it like it's alive.<eos> It wants me to use it, but not for good.?<eos> Look, I wanted it to be the answer, too, okay?<eos> I really did.
What's illegal is monitoring her financials - without a warrant.<eos> - Please.<eos> Main Justice wants to shut down our murder investigation<eos> - and we have to play by the rules?<eos> - Yes, we do.
We need the videos from the metro station and the mall.<eos> - Lillian is going through the material.<eos> - I want John to look at that.<eos> I trust that the Danes can analyze surveillance footage.<eos> I don't.
Who knows what kind of damage they're doing?<eos> It wasn't the food.<eos> I mean, it might've constipated them, cancer worst case, but... it wouldn't have changed their behavior.<eos> Okay, but this doesn't just happen.<eos> Sadly, sometimes it does.
You do enough you might even get the possibility of parole.<eos> Julian Powell.<eos> That's who paid me.<eos> A doctor named Julian Powell.<eos> - To do what?
Blow it up!<eos> ♪ Our hearts were pure, we knew for sure ♪<eos> October 14th. Four years ago.<eos> Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened.<eos> Yeah. But we didn't.
Leo Butler, a blackmailing embezzler, invents a bacteria that accidentally creates prisoner eating wolves.<eos> That's what you want me to tell my bosses at the Bureau?<eos> That's a better takeaway?<eos> We want to know what - is driving the bats wild.<eos> - So do we.
- ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again. Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
- What?<eos> Hey, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> But Barbie doesn't.
What we had is in the past.<eos> It should still matter to you.<eos> Look, what I have now with Eva there's no more tension, no more drama.<eos> We can just be.<eos> But do you really...
Well, you should.<eos> Poured my damn heart out to Junior.<eos> It's useless.<eos> Emotion doesn't work.<eos> It does work.
Hektor Martin?<eos> Longer story.<eos> Apparently, he's the real head of Aktaion.<eos> I thought Barbie's father was.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
-No idea.<eos> Is it a positive or negative image of death he's painting?<eos> It's a fucking boring image.<eos> -Please read the rest of the poem.<eos> -Please do it yourself.
That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
Our first baby, on Christmas morning.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Noelle.<eos> You want to see your Daddy?<eos> Do you?
Go on. Do it.<eos> Cut mine out.<eos> Kill the only person who's ever devoted themself entirely to you.<eos> Go on. Do it.<eos> Do it.
Does everyone have to sign in and out here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Fire regulation.<eos> We got pulled up on it last year.<eos> - You done it? - Yep. Yes.
You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Got away from me.<eos> You'restillhere.<eos> Don't.
The VAN just landed.<eos> O'Connor.<eos> Is there someone more important you need to see?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so do you.
What's the file in your... none of your business.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay. We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
Are you defending your own kind? No, I'm not.<eos> I'm standing up for a man who's gonna make a great special agent someday.<eos> Probably a better one than I am.<eos> Don't you mean a better special agent than you're gonna be?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Especially when your game is playing Hoover and Clyde Tolson in the boiler room and Clyde's dad catches you.<eos> Oh, my God. All right, if Caleb's father wanted to bust you guys, you'd be in front of the N.A.R.B. by now.<eos> Well, it just wasn't the intro to the Executive Assistant Director that I had hoped for.<eos> I barely survived.<eos> But you did.
No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening.<eos> And people need to feel safe.<eos> So all these APBs on alien threats... those are to help people feel safe?<eos> Look, the truth is, you don't understand what you're dealing with.<eos> And you do?
It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't wanna talk about this right now.<eos> Well, What if I do?
Joe has no authority to approve this.<eos> If you could just give me two minutes,<eos> - I could explain to you what it is and I'm sure... - Listen.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I don't do fundraisers.
I have been dreaming about saying that for years.<eos> I'm trying to do a few more before the actual event.<eos> I was thinking, um... Maybe I could sketch you some time.<eos> _<eos> Actually, I do it off of a photo.
and get the lunch made and get the sunscreen on and get them in the car and get them here on time, and then you, kind of, add this, um, lunatic wacky hair wrench into the works...<eos> - Sarah, are you okay?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No. I... I'm a single parent now.<eos> - And I don't...
An independent contractor proposed the project, ran things out of a lab complex.<eos> Facility shut down years ago.<eos> Maybe worth looking anyway.<eos> Do we have to guess who it was that funded this independent contractor?<eos> No, you don't.
I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
'Ah, this is where I come in.'<eos> Hello.<eos> I wanted to get out of there.<eos> Immediately.<eos> Of course I did.
I need to see for myself what they will or won't do.<eos> And you still want to counter.<eos> I want to at least try.<eos> Except you don't want to go by yourself, you want me to go with you.<eos> Yes, I do.
We got to find a safe place for her and your baby.<eos> Anything happens to you, that kid is Plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> What exactly are you planning on doing with it?<eos> How we doing back here?
Okay, Dad. Well, tell you what, if I'm being honest, the reason I'm really here is that I've got a dragon problem back on the island.<eos> Dragon problem? What kind of a dragon problem?<eos> Well, you see, we're trying to relocate a new species of dragon and I thought we could handle it, but we could really use your help.<eos> Well, I suppose I could spare a moment, if you really need me.<eos> Oh, we do. We really, really do.
Light's mask.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> Iris shot it off Doctor Light when she attacked Linda.<eos> You know how to use the mask to find Light?<eos> Yes, I do.
I was holding off on signing it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I was wondering why you made changes to seven different addendums without redlining them for me.<eos> They're just signatory pages of a few lists of partners, so I didn't think that that warranted a redline.<eos> You didn't or your partner didn't?
I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
That's her boyfriend Joel Brown or so I understand.<eos> We can go in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, class, what do you say-- whoa!
I wish you didn't have to go through that.<eos> We'll just try again because apparently, like, it's actually... the easiest time to get pregnant is the first six months after you've already been pregnant.<eos> So this is, like, now, and then it gets to be difficult again, so now we should... this is when we do it again.<eos> I mean, not like today.<eos> But we... we do it again.
- Son of a bitch!<eos> - Apo, don't worry!<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Stop it! You son of a bitch!<eos> Don't do it...
- Apo, don't worry!<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Stop it! You son of a bitch!<eos> Don't do it...<eos> Don't! No!
It means that I've often wondered whether or not I did the right thing by not having you arrested that day.<eos> That would have completely screwed up my life. Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.<eos> You want to know what kind of man I am?<eos> ♪ ♪ You wanted to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, I did.
I saw the pain in your face at the museum.<eos> And I saw the fear in your eyes when I said you killed the King. That's how I knew.<eos> The human body has a vast number of "tells".<eos> - You're no exception. - You don't know anything!<eos> Technically, I don't.
I told you, I got about a hundred VHS tapes in here. From Fellini to Capra.<eos> - You want some or not? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Put 'em over there somewhere.<eos> Tío Eduardo, I hear you make a great coffee.<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Miss... - Santanico.
Oh! So I'm the one who gets arrested if this doesn't work out.<eos> - James, you don't have to.<eos> - No. It's all good.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do I do this?
You got good taste, kid.<eos> This is my friend Winn.<eos> You're a Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know... (WHISPERS) I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.
This is my friend Winn.<eos> You're a Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know... (WHISPERS) I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - No, you don't.
You want me to go back... inside Metro?<eos> - I haven't been there since...<eos> - Since you were hooked up<eos> - in a milk bath, I know.<eos> - No. Actually, you don't.
Well, I mean, sometimes dudes from other frats would get pissed because he crushed so hard at pong.<eos> He was just a great guy.<eos> He invented Stripper Car Wash Sunday.<eos> Which sounds degrading, but all the proceeds went to charity.<eos> Dude, no, they didn't.
I'm going to need details, photos.<eos> We don't need details or photos.<eos> Unless you have them, and they're hilarious.<eos> We definitely don't need details or photos.<eos> Yes, we do.
Did you know that before you blew her up?<eos> Blair, honey, whatever they're telling you to do--<eos> Dad, no.<eos> I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do-- You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.
Justin was gonna sell the original painting.<eos> The two of you would split the profits, but when you found out that he was just gonna give that painting away, you got a little pissed.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I-it doesn't prove that I killed him, either.<eos> No, but the hair at the crime scene does.
That's right.<eos> That was him on the phone, giving us another case.<eos> So you admit, then, to servicing Reddington's agenda instead of hunting him down?<eos> We talk to them because it keeps them close, increases our chances of making an arrest.<eos> You do more than talk.
Open it.<eos> We called the police.<eos> We want nothing to do with you.<eos> Get your passports and whatever cash you have in the house.<eos> - Do it right now.
That bastard.<eos> What's all this?<eos> I've got it.<eos> -I'll do it.<eos> -I'll do it.
Then Gibbs will do all sorts of crazy cowboy stuff to protect Mitch.<eos> Thank God!<eos> I finally got to say it out loud.<eos> We got to protect Gibbs.<eos> Yes, we do.
Are you saying I put my baby in the hospital? No.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> She loves you. She'll understand.<eos> Just tell her... do you have any children, Richard?<eos> Do you?
Damn right, I wanna solve it.<eos> So do you.<eos> I can do this here.<eos> You know why it didn't work out with those other guys?<eos> Because it didn't.
I don't want to make her new girlfriend feel uncomfortable.<eos> - You know, intimidated by me. - Mm.<eos> I mean, if she's even bringing her.<eos> I don't know if she's bringing her.<eos> Do you?
Carcinoma. Then deeper tissues.<eos> Her immune system will do the rest.<eos> Biology is so deliciously messy.<eos> How do we stop it?<eos> You don't.
- the day after tomorrow? - Okay.<eos> I come back then.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Why would Milo know anything - about a stolen boat? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
We pulled DNA from the residence and sequenced it.<eos> This allowed predictive facial reconstruction of three people.<eos> A female and two males, twins.<eos> Now, none of these matched any genetic records in the database.<eos> But a fourth sample did.
I need to get you three out of here.<eos> What about them?<eos> Put them in.<eos> What do we do when they wake up?<eos> How about they don't?
Considering the alternative, I made peace with it.<eos> What I don't understand is why your father would tell you what he did.<eos> Both agreed you didn't need to know.<eos> Well, he never said a word.<eos> Then how did you...?
We hate him.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We hate him.<eos> So, um, how'd it go last night?<eos> Ugh. It didn't.
And why is he so calm and relaxed?<eos> He did possess an uncharacteristic degree of relaxedness.<eos> You know, this isn't the first time he's disappeared and come back all happy and... "all righty."<eos> [sighs] Your Majesty, this mystery calls for an investigation.<eos> Yes, it does.
There is nothing going on between Sebastian and I.<eos> I mean, I'm a happily married woman.<eos> I know that.<eos> So, um, what-what's really going on?<eos> I don't...
- Honey. You are successful.<eos> You're a great father.<eos> You have a beautiful, intelligent, tolerant wife.<eos> You don't need this stupid Ping-Pong game to prove yourself.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Those still on their feet retreated.<eos> A cheer went up from the white spectators lining the south side of the highway.<eos> Come on.<eos> You gotta come on.<eos> Please, don't...
I don't know, any of this. Everything.<eos> Everything?<eos> What's the point?<eos> I mean, I sure as shit don't know.<eos> Neither does anybody else, okay?
Do you have any of the centerfold remnants?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I, um-<eos> - I tried to tape it back up.<eos> Did a great job.
Well, what do we want?<eos> You know what we want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think the kids want it too.<eos> Not as much as I do there, schlumpy shoulders.
Raymond Sellars.<eos> I've looked forward to meeting you, Detective.<eos> I really appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Well, we funded this program to give men like you a second chance.<eos> You just do your best today.
Yet, as I was about to explain before I was so rudely interrupted, the Nemean Lion was strong, too.<eos> Yet, he still destroyed it.<eos> And not with a sword or a spear or arrows.<eos> No!<eos> I did it with my bare hands!
And who's more convincing, Cotys or his daughter?<eos> All the gold on Earth is not as convincing as a pair of breasts.<eos> Maybe, but gold never ages.<eos> Which is why I got them to double our price.<eos> Double your weight in gold? Well done.
Gershom.<eos> Gershom, please look at me.<eos> What kind of god tells a man... to leave his family?<eos> If you understand it, I'll understand it.<eos> I don't.
And do you like yourself now?<eos> Excuse me, sir. You cannot have a dog in here.<eos> Dog goes, you guys go, okay?<eos> And I'm telling you... - ... I got guys following me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Oh, no!<eos> - What is it?<eos> What? Dropped the cup on the floor.<eos> You see, that's what you do?<eos> - I didn't do...
- Okay.<eos> By your art, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<eos> The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out.<eos> Oh, I have suffered with those that I saw suffer.<eos> You do exactly that on Friday.
I had to.<eos> For Adam's sake.<eos> He's our son, Chris.<eos> And he loves you very much.<eos> We both do.
And it's...<eos> Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
Now, we can help you.<eos> Just put down the gun.<eos> I belong to the maze.<eos> Just put down the gun.<eos> We all do.
And, you know, curtains and...<eos> We don't really need curtains, 'cause, you know, we have shades.<eos> - Yeah, no.<eos> Decorative.<eos> No, we do.
Security!<eos> Hey, dude, when I tell you last night got crazy...<eos> You remember the slutty chicks, right?<eos> We start doing shots.<eos> We do, like, fucking 16 shots, back to back.
Good.<eos> Then I'll have my car take you back to Dauntless.<eos> Come on! Get her over!<eos> Come on, do it!<eos> Do it!
[ALL CHATTERING]<eos> GUS [IN DISTANT VOICE]:<eos> Judge Palmer.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God'!<eos> [IN DISTANT VOICE] I do.
He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination.<eos> What about that thing?<eos> We don't know what that thing is, sir.<eos> Actually, we really don't know what any of them are.<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
If I was going to kill yöu, Celt...<eos> I would have done it already.<eos> What is yöur name?<eos> We will have to speak at some point.<eos> No, we don't.
Dude... I will whoop your little ass.<eos> You will not touch his ass.<eos> I will hit him.<eos> Don't you fucking hit me.<eos> Don't!
No, please.<eos> Don't leave me alone here.<eos> Please, I'm itching.<eos> I've got this post-nasal drip thing going.<eos> Don't do that!
Talk to God.<eos> I'm not interested in your confession.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't leave the video for him to see.<eos> Don't.
I'd have to be dead to forget that.<eos> Maybe not even then.<eos> I knew you'd do that.<eos> How?<eos> I didn't.
I'm trying to help you.<eos> I know.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Did you know he was dead?<eos> Colette doesn't.
Hardly seems fair that that's a requirement for employment here, Mr...<eos> Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.<eos> All right, Mr Turing, I'll bite.<eos> Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's Government?<eos> Oh, I don't, really.
You know, I think what I'm hearing from the group is that you're fine.<eos> We love it.<eos> There's just nothing to critque here.<eos> You don't need us...<eos> Oh yes I do.
'Cause if any of the teachers at this college had a fifth of your talent, they wouldn't even be there.<eos> Because they're just gonna try and make you sound like some asshole from TV.<eos> Well, I need to go somewhere.<eos> - O, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Because they're just gonna try and make you sound like some asshole from TV.<eos> Well, I need to go somewhere.<eos> - O, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> I do, okay.
-No, I did not. Did I say that?<eos> - I think you might have, sir.<eos> -You sure?<eos> Well, I got a little lost with all their yammering, but pretty sure.<eos> All right, maybe I did.
Robert was my dad's name, I'm a Junior.<eos> He's not around, though, I don't really know him 'cause he left when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah, my dad's not around either, he did some bad things to my mom and so we left and I haven't seen him in a while.<eos> I kinda miss him, though, my Mom's being a jerk.<eos> They do that, man.
Abort.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi sweetie, it's your father.<eos> You didn't forget, which means you probably love me.<eos> Of course I do, Zooey.
More time for me and the pool boy.<eos> - Well, lock up tight.<eos> - Always.<eos> I know you loved your sister, honey.<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.
I don't know, a couple of months?<eos> That's right, because you and Bob are so tight. - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how you do it, Darc.<eos> - Honestly.<eos> - Yeah, neither do I.
Camilla, what about everything you've worked so hard on?<eos> What about Artie?<eos> What about him?<eos> He wanted you to play Sofia.<eos> He always did.
I know I should not ask you this... and you'll probably question my behavior as a mother but...<eos> I really need something to inhibit her nightmares.<eos> I can't bear the fact that my daughter is being so affected by her sleep.<eos> You want her to stop dreaming?<eos> Yes I do.
This is the place.<eos> You'd think if somebody wants to show us their operation, they'd at least be on time.<eos> Look at this crap.<eos> - I do miss the days... - Shit. - What's he doing here?<eos> - ...when people did normal drugs.
Break yourself, fool!<eos> I just got out of lockdown too.<eos> That's right, homes.<eos> Wait.<eos> - No, you didn't.
I just got out of lockdown too.<eos> That's right, homes.<eos> Wait.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It seems that Clinton Davis was not the only good Samaritan in this trial.<eos> Mr. Davis?<eos> I just wanted to wish you all the best.<eos> Yeah, it's like you said-- if I was innocent, everything would work out.<eos> Yes, I did.
Look at him. Be a man.<eos> Look at Ricardo.<eos> The vomiting cobra.<eos> The meat monkey.<eos> - Do it.
That's all you'll have together.<eos> Do I get to talk to him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does my Dad get to talk to me?<eos> Yes, Cass he does.
But what am I gonna say?<eos> It's a young man's game.<eos> I need a job!<eos> All I know what to do is killing people!<eos> And I do that very well!
You know, good memory. Afraid of nothing.<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I don't need a friend.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
When your feet touch the floor?<eos> Or before that, when you're lying there thinking about your feet hitting the floor.<eos> What does that feel like for you?<eos> Do you know what I'm talking about?<eos> No, mate. I don't.
Dino!<eos> Dino, Dino bambino in San Francisco.<eos> You need to see what I'm looking at.<eos> I'm looking at some aerial footage of Tobey Marshall flying across the country with the cops in tow, in a phantom Ford that will make your bowels loose.<eos> Tobey Marshall doing something stupid and reckless again?
It would be so much less of a headache... if we could ship her in her storage unit with our stuff.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> You know, if it helps, my grandmother was in hibernation for five years.<eos> It doesn't.
- I am...<eos> I have...<eos> - I...<eos> Yeah...<eos> I didn't...
Our first mission is just as important as our last.<eos> Each one getting us closer to our final destination.<eos> Sir, please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?<eos> - I do.
Sir, please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters will result in immediate court martial? And if convicted death by lethal injection.<eos> I do.
I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I was worried when we talked last night, your phone cutoff.<eos> We didn't talk last night. What?<eos> What do you mean we didn't talk?<eos> Yes we did!
You do know that April Latimer's uncle is the Minister?<eos> -I don't know where she is.<eos> -Fair enough.<eos> But if her uncle is trying to kick you out of the country, it suggests that he thinks otherwise.<eos> I don't.
I just want to talk to you for a minute!<eos> Tell him, no, he's an asshole.<eos> I didn't say anything yet.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't. Bullshit.
Get away from me!<eos> Give it back to him.<eos> She didn't ask for it.<eos> Give it back to him!<eos> She, she didn't...
Shit, I can't feel anything.<eos> Marianne, send them away. You brought them.<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - Nor me.<eos> - I do. - Me too.
Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
...sublime.<eos> There is room to reform.<eos> - Good night, Zizi.<eos> - Hello, Victoire.<eos> - How do you do?
What did you do?<eos> Norman, you sneaky snail.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Wait a second, did you...<eos> Did you...
Talking exists, doesn't it?<eos> Come on, Hidayet.<eos> How many times did we talk?<eos> How many times did I tell you?<eos> I did, didn't I?
Why?<eos> You want to have kids with me?<eos> The look on your face!<eos> Yes, I want children.<eos> Not yet but, yes, I do.
Oh, you hate to see the game degraded to this level, Bill.<eos> Who started this?<eos> Those girls are crazy, Officer. Uh-huh.<eos> One of 'em threatened to violate my nana.<eos> Uh-huh. Sure, she did, son.
I need blood, you fucking devil whore!<eos> Professor Van Helsing.<eos> - Hematophagy, the eating of blood.<eos> Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.<eos> - Do you?
He didn't have to.<eos> Not when I saw your reaction to Hannah's Wink.<eos> Do you know why he wants us to analyze it?<eos> Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.<eos> Do you?
- It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
I do love the guy.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> I took a bullet for him, you know?<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
Left hand, please.<eos> Raise your right.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Go? Where? My father redirected our fleet to the Alicante 8 cluster.<eos> It is where we hid our brood mates and hatchlings...<eos> Our family... from the Espheni.<eos> Hoping they would escape notice.<eos> They did not.
I know you're not crazy, Maggie, but the minute a mech finds this place...<eos> You want to see something crazy, Ben?<eos> A few months ago, a mech did find this place, just after you were injured protecting Lexi.<eos> I wanted to kill it or run.<eos> A lot of people did.
It'll be a PR disaster.<eos> Peeping Tom Vodka.<eos> I am gonna have to go and talk to Nate and see if he has any additional footage that he hasn't shown us.<eos> I told you we make a great team.<eos> We did.
It's either her, or you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.
Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
Go where?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Don't...
No.<eos> You were mugged, understand?<eos> Big guy with a hoodie. You didn't see his face, all right?<eos> No, please don't leave me.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
It's everything and everyone else around her.<eos> I understand running away.<eos> But to let your friends and family think You're dead?<eos> I really thought It was alison in that grave.<eos> We all did.
You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
"A" killed my car in the woods last week.<eos> What's next?<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> We need more proof.<eos> Do we?
Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mr. Fitz?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.
You're up early.<eos> Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.<eos> Okay, I'll grab my jacket.<eos> No, Dean, you don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wilden was after me. Wait.<eos> You think Wilden was behind that?<eos> Who else?<eos> Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you.<eos> And so does Spencer.
! - Dad, can t you fix it?<eos> Marc?<eos> He s awfully calm.<eos> I know. Me, if my kids get a cold I freak out. Does Toni know?<eos> - Of course he does.
- If what?<eos> Why did Toni get that job, and not you? - They offered it.<eos> I refused.<eos> - You refused?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Are you saying that have killed my mother?<eos> You have killed her, and you did not know it?<eos> - - No, I did not know. -<eos> - You lie, you bastard!<eos> - - You did it!
All her clothes were gone.<eos> May I see.<eos> Carl?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Well done, Henning.
Wait, you said Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects? Yeah.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit. There's David's morn. She's so devastated.<eos> Did you meet her?<eos> - No, I didn't, no.
And there's a way to do it so we don't risk any exposure.<eos> Do we have to talk about this now?<eos> I'm beat.<eos> My brain is...<eos> Yes, we do.
No!<eos> Because, down here, we get to do what we please. Right?<eos> Take him.<eos> Take him down!<eos> - Sarge, I don't...
And tell you what? That I messed up?<eos> No, I knew the deal.<eos> There's no cure so I accepted my fate.<eos> Ate my favorite dish of Egg Foo Young, watched the world's greatest movie, Rocky Ill, and then was ready to eat a bullet when Bess, here, found me.<eos> And how did she do that?
Jealous because people pay him for sex?<eos> When was the last time you heard me call myself an artist?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You say it all the time.<eos> No, I don't.
Here, smoke this.<eos> I'll drive. You can relax, okay?<eos> You brought pot to my sister's wedding?<eos> To meet my family?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Thank you so much for asking.<eos> - You take care of your business. I'll talk to you later. - All right.<eos> Ma'am excuse me, I was about to say....<eos> - So you don't know the individual<eos> - We don't, officer.
Now, our problem is to prevent anything worse from happening.<eos> Right?<eos> We wouldn't want that.<eos> We wouldn't want that.<eos> Do you?
Get moving!<eos> Listen good, it's better for you and me if we say you killed him.<eos> Or we'll be in trouble.<eos> Hear me?<eos> You did it!
You have such a huge dick!<eos> Don presumed his penis to be of an average size.<eos> If his dick had, in fact, been huge, he would probably have heard about it by this point.<eos> You like that?<eos> Do you?
Fuck you!<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> What's important in your life right now?<eos> I don't...
Well done.<eos> It's fine. Talk to you later.<eos> Hey.<eos> We have a meeting.<eos> - What did Gennaro Savastano?
I just wanted to see if you were okay.<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow,<eos> Tell me what happened?<eos> No, I don't.
You're rich. You can buy anything. Give gifts.<eos> But be careful. Why?<eos> You must be wary.<eos> When you have money, people love you.<eos> People already do.
You're leaving.<eos> I have to.<eos> No!<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, I... I do.
- I don't know a Dr. Hvit.<eos> - Doreen talked to him. She...<eos> Talked to him?<eos> Doreen told you that?<eos> No, Major Balleseros did.
No, I'm just kidding.<eos> It's humour, Gloria.<eos> - Do you like humour?<eos> - Humour?<eos> - Do you?
All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.<eos> Someone you went to school with or some client that you spent the night with.<eos> - Those guys would never end up here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. I do.
Spare my house.<eos> Why should I, when my own house has been sacked by that scoundrel Brilhac, who calls himself General?<eos> You're lucky to be alive!<eos> Maurice, tell them, if you know of a hiding place.<eos> I don't, mother.
You can film her, not me. Don't touch the lens.<eos> How about i toss you and your Whole fucking rig down the hill?<eos> Sorry.<eos> She said i could shoot Whatever i wanted.<eos> She did, huh?
Are you angry'?<eos> No.<eos> Will your wife ask any questions?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Does she ever'?
I have let you know me.<eos> See me.<eos> I gave you a rare gift.<eos> - But you didn't want it.<eos> - I did not.
She did.<eos> - Can I just hate her anyway?<eos> - You can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't.
Undo my chains or I'll kill him.<eos> - I can't. You'll kill her.<eos> - She's gonna hurt herself, Jeremy.<eos> - She's totally unraveling.<eos> - Don't do it, Jeremy.
So what am I missing?<eos> Speak.<eos> Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little...<eos> You know?<eos> No. Clearly I don't.
- But they were always home by bedtime.<eos> - What for?<eos> A reputation.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
- Well, look at that.<eos> - You put that there, didn't you?<eos> When I went out to take a piss.<eos> - You lied.<eos> - Didn't you?
When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
Why? - Close 'em.<eos> Open your lips.<eos> Less.<eos> - T.-<eos> - Do it.
Was my best friend.<eos> Anyway, she said...<eos> "Brook, be a grasshopper."<eos> And it just made so much sense, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
But you have sex with me.<eos> Used to, anyways.<eos> That's different. I...<eos> I love you.<eos> So does he.
I know that.<eos> Larry knows that.<eos> But we didn't decide to love each other, Piper.<eos> It just happened.<eos> The way love does.
And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
What do you suppose inspired this revelation, Dr. Hart?<eos> Vivian came to me after your date.<eos> But since I'm not the most objective person on the subject, - ...<eos> I recused myself.<eos> - You did what now?
Harold Cooper.<eos> You think this is a coincidence?<eos> Reddington feeds you The Judge, and I'm next on that lunatic's hit list?<eos> - We need to take it seriously.<eos> - No, we don't.
I can change.<eos> Hey, Johnny, they have tapenade in here, which I love.<eos> I'm getting some on my sandwich.<eos> Do you want some on yours?<eos> Yes, I do.
No one is watching you.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> That's a teaching fellow.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
Oh, I... I didn't look for this.<eos> And I don't want it.<eos> You're different, Mary.<eos> You really want me, don't you?<eos> (I do.)
A mean son of a bitch.<eos> It turns out he has a baby boy.<eos> The kid was covered in his own shit and piss, freezing cold.<eos> And then, well... I just had to call you.<eos> Yes, I did.
And we want to get to know you, too.<eos> Come on. Meet the rest of the family.<eos> Oh, there's more of you.<eos> Come on, that's got to feel good.<eos> Yes, it does.
Just wait till the song's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Come on, Max, show us how you do it.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know you, Phil.<eos> And I knew you before.<eos> You know I'd be the first to go down that road if I thought it led somewhere.<eos> Do you believe me, at least?<eos> - Do you?
His name was Andre Anthony.<eos> Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.<eos> Did you have any other kids?<eos> Rules of the game, my friend.<eos> Did you?
Mia, come on. I love you.<eos> I will always believe you.<eos> Good night.<eos> You think Father Perez can help us?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm- - I'm a bit tied up.<eos> You're not gonna get it just yet.<eos> How do you use the machine?<eos> I don't.
You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
You're going to have to get a job.<eos> If Slade doesn't scare you, that's got to.<eos> Do you know anyone hiring ex-billionaires with superior archery skills?<eos> Hey, why don't I, uh, give you two a second?<eos> Well, you did it.
Where are you taking me?<eos> Man: I said get up!<eos> Man: Tom Neville.<eos> You know who I am'!<eos> How do you do, Mr. President?
- Hi.<eos> - Hey. You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God! - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I... I do.
- You're just gonna take off? - Yup.<eos> - You aren't even gonna help me?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Travis, she wants to kill me.<eos> - Sooner or later, all broads do.
- She wrote the book on viral splicing and RNA binding proteins.<eos> I need her - we need her - to fight this thing.<eos> Alan, we don't know how sick she is.<eos> We don't even know if she can work.<eos> No, we don't.
Helena, what you doing here?<eos> I followed you from Mother's house.<eos> I shot you. You were dead.<eos> - You were dead!<eos> - Yes, you did.
But first, we need to get felix checked by a doctor.<eos> Felix? Felix, honey.<eos> You, we have to get you for the toxicology test. -No, not a chance.<eos> I'm fine. -No, love, we can't be sure what you've had.<eos> We don't...
Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
- Ancitif?<eos> "Ancitif..." "A powerful demon that has been known to jump between bodies on contact."<eos> "First cited in 1647, when it possessed a group of catholic nuns."<eos> So... this is the demon that wanted me dead.<eos> And likely still does.
Um, when you are pregnant, you turn into a cross between creatures from our evolutionary past and a corpse.<eos> You could choose to use your adult cells, but then you'd die someday, so...<eos> You know, honey, just because you listen to a few things doesn't make you Oprah.<eos> - It does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
He rolls by, we'll hit him from here and over there.<eos> Jason will flank the rest.<eos> Yeah, that'll work.<eos> Got to admit, quite a team.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
I finally know what they're doing. It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
- Goddamn it.<eos> - I think it's a - pretty good plan, y'all.<eos> - No, it isn't!<eos> We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is - crocodiles eat, and swim down!<eos> - What do crocodiles
- That's how this all started.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, you-you seriously think I'm the reason you're a control freak?<eos> - You seriously don't?
You always... could always ferret out the truth.<eos> No.<eos> I can't force anyone to reveal the truth.<eos> I can just tell you if they're lying.<eos> You, um, you do a polygraph on this kid for me, off the record?
Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.
First class secretary!<eos> Doesn't know how to relax.<eos> Sir Aaron, may I speak with you?<eos> You know, if it wasn't for him the Housing Trust would have collapsed long ago.<eos> And sterling work your charity does in Kembleford.
- You want to kill me?<eos> Come and kill me, Come on!<eos> You are brave,<eos> You are brave,<eos> What do you do?
Set me free.<eos> You want me to set you free?<eos> Please, I have a son and a daughter.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Do it.
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.<eos> But you're ready for this, right?<eos> I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.<eos> The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Pull a what?<eos> What's that?<eos> Um, she probably...<eos> Um, was thinking about...<eos> I don't... um, she... um...
He's got us.<eos> And I've got a key card.<eos> Be quick.<eos> I thought he'd be healing by now.<eos> So did I.
Somebody lose something?<eos> There were supplies stolen off the truck last night.<eos> Anybody here got any ideas what happened?<eos> Merrick.<eos> Just doing my patriotic duty, Corporal.
Go to your choir or your friend Rebecca and head out together to a club.<eos> Do what you like!<eos> You hear me?<eos> ls that what you want?<eos> - Do you?
On Friday there's chain saw carving and all you can eat.<eos> And on Saturday they roast a pig underground.<eos> I've never had it, but it's supposed to be good.<eos> Oh. I didn't know that you could do that.<eos> On Sundays they do a pie eating contest.
- Yes, Recep? Go on.<eos> Irfantino, I want to thank you.<eos> As the number one contestant I'll be competing at the no. 1 spot. - Yes?<eos> To show goodwill and friendship I'd like Taylan to take the no. 1 spot and I'll compete as no. 2.<eos> Why do that?
Don't be afraid to let yourself feel things.<eos> I feel things.<eos> Just got to be tough about them.<eos> Well, you don't have to be so tough all the time.<eos> Yes, you do.
Captain Redfern?<eos> Thanks for agreeing to meet us.<eos> You bet.<eos> My passengers and crew trusted me to get them to JFK safely.<eos> But I didn't.
(laughs)<eos> - I was just kidding.<eos> - No. Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.<eos> Nick, you don't have to do this. Nick:<eos> No, I-I do.
He went to get nails and then they caught him.<eos> Ziggy, I didn't know.<eos> How could you do this? Ziggy!<eos> Ziggy, I swear, I...<eos> I didn't do anything!
I am familiar with feeling adrift.<eos> And with being let down by a brother I loved. I'm sorry.<eos> Truly, I am.<eos> I know they thought they were saving my life,<eos> Or at least mary did.
You let a man die for your ship?<eos> ! What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay?<eos> ! No, it doesn't.
- Why are you being like this?<eos> - Like what?<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> I don't need your protection.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Okay.<eos> So...<eos> -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use?<eos> It doesn't.
No, she was not.<eos> She was one of the good folks.<eos> Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
Something stiff.<eos> You know, your father and I aren't morons.<eos> We know what it looks like when someone's been [Softly] smoking pot.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> First of all, no you don't.
Also, people are watching me now.<eos> - No one is watching you.<eos> - That's a teaching fellow.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Fara...<eos> Fara.<eos> Night shift's coming out.<eos> I need a bathroom.<eos> Not yet, you don't.
Whoa!<eos> Who's this little dumpling?<eos> Only my niece.<eos> If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.<eos> No, I don't. Yep!
- Come here, little boy.<eos> - Don't!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I really don't.
I'm sure you did not rise to your... position... through sheer luck.<eos> Quite right.<eos> Managing people- that's my talent.<eos> Picking the right person for the right job.<eos> Just as I did with you on this project.
It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.<eos> Now, your brother's friend, was he a Lausenschlange too?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Your mother is a cougar!<eos> Calm down.<eos> I spent my life with a cougar and you want me to calm down?<eos> Your mother's a cougar. She screws young men!<eos> What if I did the same?
I taught you better than that.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> I deserved to die.<eos> Hey! Stop talking like that.<eos> Anyway, you didn't.
Do you need a minute?<eos> Zoe, Look. I'm sorry.<eos> - Hon, look at me.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Don't do that, please.
Tell me.<eos> What do you want, Miles?<eos> Come in.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
No.<eos> Truly dangerous.<eos> Not just to your reputation.<eos> I was warned many girls don't survive.<eos> You did.
Destroyed my father's carving.<eos> - At least it wasn't someone.<eos> - This time.<eos> - I thought you had these blackouts under control.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.
Did you go there to preach and open their eyes?<eos> Did you expect them to start righting their wrongs?<eos> Saving people?<eos> - For them other people do not exist!<eos> - For me they do!
He is like a puzzle that I can't solve...<eos> - Oh, whoopsie!<eos> - If you're gonna do that.<eos> Do you have a coarctation of your aorta?<eos> Do you?
It hurts.<eos> It's actually quite jarring.<eos> ♪ Loves it in the caboose<eos> - I don't love it in the caboose.<eos> - ♪ Yes, he does. Uh, hi.
Not me.<eos> No, I done nothing.<eos> You find me a soul to say otherwise.<eos> But they do say otherwise, Tom.<eos> They do now, leastwise.
Is he ill?<eos> He's not ill.<eos> He's possessed.<eos> Do you not believe in demonic possession, Claire?<eos> Do you?
I know, uh, but...<eos> What, is this an interrogation?<eos> Look, I know, given your relationship with Vincent, this can't be an easy thing to do.<eos> I intended to.<eos> I did, but, um...
Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do. Sure.
What happened?<eos> Um, you got shot.<eos> Go outside, now, okay?<eos> Why?<eos> Just do it.
Glad I'm working.<eos> Art museums.<eos> Just a way for perverts to look at nude babies with wings.<eos> Oh, Peg, the world changes.<eos> You never do.
Are you through?<eos> No. And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.
No. And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> Yes, she does.
He's gonna be fine.<eos> As heart attacks go, this was pretty mild. More of a wake up call to ditch the cigarettes and take up jogging.<eos> I've been telling him that for years.<eos> He doesn't listen to me.<eos> He doesn't...
Please, come, sit down.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Not really, but thank you.<eos> So... you want to adopt a baby.<eos> Yes, we do.
Reginald, you did a great job making it so I couldn't get out of it, but you should have picked a better case to trap me in.<eos> Because we both know that my independent analyst will come up with anything that I want him to say.<eos> Did you hear what he just said?<eos> I sure did.<eos> And if you did, and I did...
The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it? - No.<eos> But he does.
You changed your hair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Kind of needed a change.<eos> Of course you did.
Uh, yeah, I just don't have a racket, sneakers, or talent.<eos> Give me one lesson, and you can start hustling on the doctor circuit.<eos> How about we do business first?<eos> I got the results from the physicals.<eos> Almost everyone did great.
I know.<eos> Last summer...<eos> We had our issues.<eos> Do you think we can ever get back to where we once were?<eos> - No, I don't. - Oh.
It's useless.<eos> Mr Halimi, please.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did?
What about Jeremy?<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> Well, had you seen him recently?<eos> You know how it was between them.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't recognize the U.S. Government, so stop saying it.<eos> Call me Joe Bey.<eos> Mr. Bey, we know that Eugene MacIntosh is an associate of yours.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, I don't; his brother does.
Because of a heroin overdose, a massive heroin overdose.<eos> I know that he was found with a needle in his arm. I know it all.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> It must be nice, knowing it all.<eos> I myself do not.
Remind me to thank your mother next time I see her, will you?<eos> For what?<eos> Well, we made an assumption when we realized that the anthrax was in Eugene MacIntosh's clutches.<eos> That he wanted to kill people.<eos> What if he didn't?
I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Maybe.<eos> What was the something else?<eos> Mike got a job offer.<eos> And you don't want him to do it.<eos> No, I don't.
Not so fast.<eos> We said everra man for himself during the gathering.<eos> Aye, we did.<eos> But ye ken how much I fancy a hen with a bit of meat.<eos> Who doesn't?
One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
I-I-9-9-R-C.<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
There's an Italian guy strapping chains together!<eos> - You don't know what's going on!<eos> - I know! - What do you do?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> What do I do?
But, you know, if you... if you think it's... helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.<eos> It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Mom, I've heard them many times.<eos> - You know them.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know, and George told me not to focus on the information.<eos> - George did?
I mean, you wouldn't happen to have, you know, a horse that counts or a sheep that juggles?<eos> I mean, anything to sell tickets.<eos> Juggling sheep, huh?<eos> See that little goat over there?<eos> He does a pretty neat trick.
- How the hell did it get there?<eos> - That's where I left it.<eos> - You took my car?<eos> - Don't accuse me like that.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Okay, whatever she is, let's not manhandle her.<eos> And since there's no way she's actually Melanie Cross, then we probably shouldn't call her that.<eos> Then what should we call her?<eos> I should know what my name is.<eos> But I don't.
What? !<eos> You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Are you with me, Ashley?<eos> Have you taken that in? I haven't...<eos> I didn't...
Why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
I don't want to deal with it.<eos> To hell with them.<eos> We all know you didn't do anything.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
That's "night," or "black."<eos> Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.<eos> And we're supposed to work up print based on this voiceover tagline, "More horsepower."<eos> And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.<eos> What does?
Who would she have written that to?<eos> What's up, Jason?<eos> I just saw what you delivered.<eos> Your dad asked my mother...<eos> Yeah, well, my mother didn't.
'Cause I think I know where Dani took her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> No, we don't.
So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't. - Right. Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Cora.<eos> You said what you think, and you have every right to do so.<eos> Tell me, does Edith seem very distracted to you?<eos> I'm not sure I'd notice.<eos> Well, she does to me.
But you're not.<eos> So who cares what they think? Hey.<eos> People know who you are, Hanna.<eos> They do?<eos> 'Cause lately I don't.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> What did Molly tell you this morning?<eos> You think she knew about this?<eos> Oh, I think it's possible you did too.<eos> - No. No, I didn't.
Actually, I'm not sure about having children all around us.<eos> How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?<eos> You nearly missed me.<eos> You never told me you were going.<eos> - Who did? - Daisy.
Please don't tell the girls or try to stop me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Say that you were kidnapped again?<eos> Do you think I want to live like this?<eos> Because I don't.
Nothing happens to you.<eos> But...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I like to do it.<eos> Do not do it better.
- They're going to be fine.<eos> - It's not fair! You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Mum, we just had dinner. - Eat!<eos> - I'm fine too, if anyone's interested.<eos> Come on, Mum.<eos> You don't all have to check on me every ten minutes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Has it spread any further?<eos> It's up to my chest now.<eos> - It's hard to breathe.<eos> - We have to get him out of here.<eos> - How do we do that?
Where'd they all go?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> - You look familiar.<eos> - So do you...
- No, but you have to let my wife go, too! - Get him out of here!<eos> No, Sean!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Don't!
Are you gonna cry?<eos> No.<eos> Take that off.<eos> Leave it with Whiting before you go.<eos> MARGARET: How do you do?
No.<eos> Take that off.<eos> Leave it with Whiting before you go.<eos> MARGARET: How do you do?<eos> ARQUIMEDES: How do you do?
My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.<eos> I need you to pull all the prostitution cases north of 110th Street.<eos> You need me to?<eos> Mr. Hodge does.
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I don't make the assignments.<eos> Would it be any different if you did? Yes.<eos> I know you're good at your job.<eos> Mr. Hodge does, too.
I-I have some trouble connecting with this generation.<eos> See, I was at the opera when I... heard the news... with my wife.<eos> [Elevator bell dings] Henry: They were having an affair.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Of course we do.
Okay, H-Henry, let's go.<eos> This is important.<eos> The case depends on it.<eos> Do you take phenytoin?<eos> Yes, millions of people do.
The way I treated Allison, the way I treated you.<eos> But I'm not that person anymore, and I don't want people to think that I am.<eos> And I understand that, but I work for Harvey, and I can't keep things from him that he needs to know.<eos> - He doesn't need to know this.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Jackson?<eos> Hayley-<eos> I see you met my friend Ansel.<eos> - You know her?<eos> - Yeah, actually. I do.
At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm sorry, Julia.<eos> It's my own fault.<eos> When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted...<eos> I really wanted to believe there was a chance.<eos> We all did.
But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.<eos> Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.<eos> Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?<eos> Do you want the fire extinguisher?<eos> Yeah, I do.
But will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do we know we're doing the right thing?<eos> We don't.
I don't want to.<eos> Come on, Darbois will freak out.<eos> - Darbois doesn't give a damn.<eos> - He does. Go ahead.<eos> Do it yourself.
We need to figure out a way around that picture of "A"<eos> at the hospital or we're busted. What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.
What other thing?<eos> The psychic thing.<eos> You think Lydia's psychic?<eos> Do you?<eos> No, I do not.
But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
We gotta do something in this country about gun violence.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> That was Cookie Brown, clearly distraught in the wake of these horrific events.<eos> And while little is known about the night in question, the friends and family of these two talented artists have found refuge...<eos> How you doing, sweetheart?
- I know.<eos> You love him, you tell us about him.<eos> Our words can contradict our thoughts.<eos> Out of family duty, I say I love him.<eos> When you actually don't?
Is it true?<eos> Have I backed the wrong horse?<eos> No.<eos> Doyle?<eos> She doesn't do her own dirty work.
He's Bunny's great-nephew. Harvard Business.<eos> How do you guys know Aunt Bunny?<eos> -We--<eos> -We didn't personally know her.<eos> -Our surrogate dad, Bobby Singer, did.
I guess I am.<eos> A little.<eos> My sister has to stop calling.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Luisa, he really doesn't...
Okay, thank you.<eos> I should go with you, 'cause it's very remote.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be out in a second.<eos> How you doing, David?
Who are you?<eos> Uh, this is Elsa.<eos> We're gonna find her sister.<eos> That's what this family does. We find people.<eos> We always do, because we really...
Couldn't get in touch with my accountant. He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Hey. Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
- You contrive well not on anything now?<eos> - Oh, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> I will not make any trouble.<eos> For you know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Always.<eos> The ones to Alexis and my mother were pretty much the same.<eos> Kate, what did I do?<eos> Mm. I don't know.<eos> I don't.
It's no fun just fixing problems all the time. Exactly.<eos> You want to create.<eos> You want to express yourself.<eos> You want to break out of who you are and try new things.<eos> Well, I do too.
He kills her.<eos> In the end.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'm interested.<eos> How does he do it?
Okay.<eos> Now I'm interested.<eos> How does he do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why does he do it?
If you put me through the effort of finding out on my own...<eos> I might have to exact a price from whoever it is you're protecting.<eos> My sister is Merlyn's daughter.<eos> And that is the reason he came back to Starling City.<eos> Because she did.
Yes, you do, and I'm guessing you didn't like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't. Because I don't think that he deserves to be fired.<eos> That's funny, because I think you both deserve to be fired.<eos> - What do you...
I can't remember the last time this firm faced prosecution.<eos> I can:<eos> Ava Hessington.<eos> And after that, we said it would never come to this again.<eos> How the hell did it?
That's enough.<eos> Stop typing.<eos> We're done here.<eos> - To answer your question...<eos> - Don't...
- You know what I think?<eos> - What?<eos> I think we both could've used a better lawyer in that deposition.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> - No, I don't.
It wouldn't be a bag of money, because if it's untraceable, he wouldn't have leverage over Woodall.<eos> That's great, but we can't get access to Woodall's bank accounts.<eos> We can't.<eos> But Cahill can.<eos> Okay, what good does that do us, huh?
Blood and urine.<eos> This one's for you.<eos> Evan, have a seat.<eos> Listen, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Just one more semester.<eos> Nice.<eos> - I Googled you. - Oh? - Mm.<eos> - That couldn't have gone well.<eos> No, it didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to take cover from the fog.<eos> #Bellamy.<eos> No, we don't.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Clarke.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Did anyone else make it here?<eos> Yes. 6 of you did.
Maybe...<eos> Oh, my gosh, stop...<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Hey, Carter family.<eos> How you doing today?
Right.<eos> Which one of these is good?<eos> Like I said, white shirt with a black tie with a slim-cut grey jacket.<eos> Classic, timeless.<eos> I don't usually do jackets.
That's not what I meant.<eos> Look, until someone puts Ali away, we're doing what we have to do to survive.<eos> I'm sure you and your friends understand that.<eos> We think she killed Mona.<eos> We do, too.
You trying to kill me?<eos> You're alive?<eos> Damn straight I'm alive.<eos> We thought you were dead.<eos> Well so did I.
- We need to do this now.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Yo.<eos> - I could have handled him.<eos> - I did.
Selfish little bastard.<eos> We need to split up and look for food and water.<eos> Oh, if we can find a two way radio or even like a satelite dish, I can trying contact that Citizen Z guy.<eos> That's good.<eos> Okay, you and Mack do that.
Here, watch this.<eos> Hey, Tayyar.<eos> Make an ugly face.<eos> Hey, don't! I told you.<eos> Don't do that.
She's so sweet. So feisty.<eos> I love her to bits.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> She doesn't seem that keen on you.<eos> Not to you she doesn't.
You ask a holy type, and they'll tell you... the soul is the purest expression of God's love.<eos> The spark of creation.<eos> Every time the First takes a soul, he's exacting revenge, paying back the Almighty for casting him out.<eos> I do want to hear you.<eos> I do.
You and me are the only guys on the force that know what's really going on.<eos> And we need to keep it that way... So nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And The Flash?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Xiu, what fortune?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Sir Zhao.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Who doesn't in this town?
Anybody?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Later.<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing, Lieutenant?
I didn't think you'd want me to.<eos> We're gonna need it as evidence.<eos> - When did you find it?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Rosalee did.
The bodies of Massachusetts senator<eos> Christian Ward and both his mother and father were identified by police tonight in what appears to be a murder-suicide.<eos> A partially destroyed tape found in the fire is believed to be the senator's confession.<eos> I wanted him dead!<eos> I did!
How about the new guy?<eos> British people love doing stuff, right?<eos> No, I don't think... - British guy... doing stuff!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> British guy doing stuff!
No, I don't think... - British guy... doing stuff!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> British guy doing stuff!<eos> I'm telling you they don't like to do things.<eos> - Doing stuff!
- Miss Sparrow's so fun and creative.<eos> Yeah, today, she gave us yarn, and we did whatever we wanted.<eos> I don't want to play with yarn.<eos> I want to read and learn math.<eos> We do math.
Couldn't just leave and take you to a baseball game.<eos> Don Larsen pitched a perfect game in game five.<eos> Do you know how often that happens in the world series?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Ever? Do you?
a temple inside the city.<eos> - Any idea where this temple is?<eos> - Glad you asked ...<eos> No. But it's in the city, and we now know where that is.<eos> Even better, HYDRA doesn't.
Ugh. Which means we're dead in the water.<eos> Which means I could be dead in the water.<eos> If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric, we need to figure out who it was.<eos> Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too, they're not gonna talk.<eos> Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.
Vampires murdered my wife.<eos> I'm gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies.<eos> Need any help?<eos> If even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me, then stay.<eos> Not doing so great, Damon.
I have to say good night to my hostess.<eos> Hailey, I know you can't believe anything I could say right now, so...<eos> Did you really wanna learn the oboe?<eos> Or was this all just about...<eos> No, I did.
You did it.<eos> He looks like Lance, doesn't he?<eos> I-I'm not imagining that, am I?<eos> No.<eos> No, he really does.
Not a word.<eos> But it's not all on her.<eos> I mean, she didn't know what she was signing up for.<eos> Neither did you.<eos> Neither did any of us.
A damn saint.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Say good-bye, Elliot.<eos> More like "Smelliot." Alan.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ You doing okay?
We both bring it home.<eos> It affects us in ways that aren't exactly healthy.<eos> You're the one who signed up for this...<eos> - working for your fiancé.<eos> - We both did.
I mean, when Jake was a kid, he thought Charlie was the cool one.<eos> When you moved in, Jake thought you were the cool one.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> Louis thinks I'm Al-Al Cool Dad.<eos> No, he doesn't.
He is not usually like this.<eos> I'm surprised you're not more worried about him.<eos> Were he my responsibility... I would be.<eos> We had been told that Chief-Elder knew everything.<eos> Things no body else did.
Uh-huh, that's what I thought.<eos> I knew it from the first time I met you.<eos> You are a kind of pervert!<eos> But it's true, you want it?<eos> Yes, I do!
I did not come to steal from you O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy.<eos> I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.<eos> To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.<eos> I did not believe them.<eos> And do you now'?
All right.<eos> I got a great table, let's go.<eos> Flame retardant.<eos> He surprised me.<eos> How you doing, sir?
We danced...<eos> Well, it was more We bumped into each other. It was as if we were In a bubble.<eos> Sorry, I should spare you.<eos> Of the details. No, no, continue.<eos> On the contrary, this does well.
Guess I cut out the wrong brother's heart.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> You boxed in law school.<eos> What the hell?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.
It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know it doesn't make any sense.<eos> You seriously have a problem with me not drinking, after what happened?<eos> I don't, but King Arthur does!
What do you think?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, if that's what you want.<eos> I think it'd be good for us.<eos> I really do.
Oh, sweet girl.<eos> Sweet Barbara my heart breaks for every time you felt pain.<eos> I wished I could've shielded you from it, but if you think you can fathom for one solitary second the pain that man endured in his natural life, you got another thing coming.<eos> You know where your father lived from age four till about ten?<eos> Do you?
I need money...<eos> -...real bad.<eos> - What?<eos> My wife and I, we wanna go West.<eos> Oh, your wife does?
[WHIMPERING]<eos> [PANTING]<eos> BIG FALLON:<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Well, do you?
Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> That...<eos> - Did I tell you, or what, right?<eos> - You did.
Hey!<eos> Hey, this is silk!<eos> - Oyster?<eos> - Thank you. - Thanks.<eos> - How you doing?
Man on speakers'.<eos> Liftoff! We have a liftoff!<eos> Kind of homey, actually.<eos> Where do you plan on sleeping?<eos> I don't.
So why are you feeding the cat?<eos> So it doesn't starve to death. - But why can't Chantry feed it?<eos> - Because she flew to Dublin.<eos> She flew to Dublin?<eos> Yes, of course she did.
Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.<eos> What did you get?<eos> Weapons mostly.<eos> I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.<eos> At this point, nothing really does.
This mortal you think you love? You can never be together.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever love me, mama?<eos> You know, i don't remember.<eos> No mother does, really.
He must be, to make me feel the way I feel.<eos> Not you, too, sister?<eos> He said we would rule Oz together.<eos> He said I would be his queen.<eos> Did he?
The guys that made this game saw your HBO special.<eos> They loved it.<eos> I loved it.<eos> Did I tell you?<eos> I really did.
I like it.<eos> You're looking like new money in there. Ha, ha.<eos> All right.<eos> I thought you were his trainer, Dad.<eos> Yeah, buddy, so did I.
It's very hard to find.<eos> It's very hard.<eos> He lied to me, Frangois.<eos> Oui.<eos> People do that.
Come on, Chug, we have a jet to catch.<eos> New York City.<eos> Finish line, here we come!<eos> Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?<eos> Probably best if I don't.
No.<eos> You gotta do the "motherfucking."<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - Do it.
I don't think so.<eos> We are not done here.<eos> You need to show me what you got.<eos> Let's get down.<eos> Do what I do.
You can't go with them?<eos> Nothin' I can do.<eos> Nothing you can do.<eos> Okay. I think that's bullshit.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Hasnat, I asked about your feelings.<eos> I love you.<eos> But do you want us to be together in spite of all our problems?<eos> - Do you want to make this work?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Wendy.<eos> - Fiona.<eos> - I don't know the words.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Come on.<eos> It's just, Carmine wants Rosalyn to come.<eos> I don't care. You weren't listening.<eos> I don't care if Rosalyn comes.<eos> Just do your job, okay?
So what can I do?<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Don't cry!<eos> I don't!
I've just never had a guy try to sneak out of his own apartment.<eos> The bank got a judge in California - to shut down our site.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought the Americans put free speech up there with mom and apple pie.<eos> So did we.
Think she'd want you to die here, alone, lonely and miserable?<eos> I am not lonely, and I am not miserable.<eos> And if you'll excuse me, there is someplace I have to be.<eos> Dad, we have to talk about this.<eos> No, we don't.
Should I call the police, monsieur?<eos> I'm sure that's not necessary.<eos> I'm gonna wait for him.<eos> You want to go in?<eos> Do you?
Just, you know, call me Amanda.<eos> Do that. Amanda.<eos> I thought you were Sheriff Fowler's wife.<eos> I need to call Sheriff and let him know what we're doing.<eos> No, you absolutely do not.
Here's daddy, you motherfucker!<eos> Got to get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Fuckin' do it already!
Come on, do it. Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, fuckin' do it already!<eos> Come on, get up!<eos> Oh, goddammit, do it already.
Hey, what about Max?<eos> You know he wants to bone you, right?<eos> Oh, my God, Autumn.<eos> Stop it, that's disgusting.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I don't want to leave him alone with my mother.<eos> Steve just doesn't understand that.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to protect your mother.<eos> Every daughter does.
Can't you see? See what?<eos> We are assassins.<eos> I know we're all assassins, Sum, but what does that have to do with anything?<eos> We do all people's dirt. Yeah, well you know, I know.<eos> We do people's dirt.
Son of a bitch.<eos> He came from the future to fuck us all up the ass.<eos> Marc Delgado.<eos> I'm sure you know why I'm here.<eos> Yes, we all do.
He wanted to give us everything, but, uh... Of course we couldn't accept that.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> - You need the car key.<eos> - No, I don't need the car.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
He's with a TV production company:<eos> - Q-Entertainment.<eos> - So he's a big shot?<eos> - So he also fires people?<eos> - He hardly ever does.
Properly.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - Good night, Candace.<eos> You know, Peter thinks you're a hero, Dalton.<eos> That does everyone here.
- You're not so great yourself.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> - Yes. - So tell me!<eos> - You fart in your sleep.<eos> - I never do.
It's for our photo shoot. "Skin Meets Vegetables".<eos> Art.<eos> I love art.<eos> Do you know the art section at Ikea?<eos> Do you?
N-woo.<eos> N-woo.<eos> - N-woo.<eos> - Look, Flint, they came here to help.<eos> We all did.
Oh, did you ever find out who ratted you out at the McDowell's party?<eos> Who else?<eos> Deputy dickhead Carl. - Yeah.<eos> But you know the new girl, Julie?<eos> Yeah, who doesn't?
I loved my husband, monsieur.<eos> But I realised some time ago that my affection was no longer reciprocated.<eos> Last night I learned for certain what I had suspected for some time, that he... that he...<eos> That he and Madame Olivier were conducting the love affair?<eos> How did you...?
I didn't even know what a Mary Poppins was.<eos> But then she gave me one of your books, and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.<eos> Absolutely on fire.<eos> And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.<eos> I do. Yes.
And a spoonful of sugar.<eos> You don't intend for this film to be a musical?<eos> I absolutely do.<eos> Mr. Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.<eos> Yes, she does.
- I want you gone.<eos> Ginty.<eos> Sweet thing, what are you doing here?<eos> You said today was ice cream day.<eos> Ice cream day. Yes, I did.
She died in anguish, you know.<eos> My mother.<eos> She knew that after she was gone, all that was left for me was this.<eos> She never understood.<eos> But you do.
The last Targaryen.<eos> I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.<eos> - I didn't sit on the small council.<eos> - No?<eos> Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally--
My king.<eos> It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.<eos> Their Lord Commander is dead.<eos> Took a ranging party north and never made it back.<eos> One lad did, though.
When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.<eos> The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.<eos> - How'd that turn out for us?<eos> - He had no way of knowing.<eos> We do now.
Is that how you lot do your fighting?<eos> You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?<eos> Most of the time, yes.<eos> How do the men holding the banners fight?<eos> They don't, really.
What would Constable make of this lot, eh?<eos> I cannot believe that I've dreaded rejection from this bunch of pansies.<eos> - I rather like this one.<eos> It has something.<eos> You do, do you?
He was going to put the find in some museum for others to look at.<eos> But he had betrayed the wrong person!<eos> The wrong person!<eos> -The police know I'm here.<eos> -No, they don't.
A deer!<eos> Okay.<eos> Daddy, I left the front door open in case any animals wanted to come in.<eos> - You did, huh?<eos> - And one did.
About half of it I would like to forget.<eos> I'm not sure if I follow you.<eos> What is it you would like to forget, for instance?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Sure I do.
But there's a time to be nice.<eos> And then there's also a time when you have to say, "Enough is enough."<eos> And stick your foot so far up a prick like Phil's ass that he chokes on your fucking shoelaces.<eos> And I think now is one of those times.<eos> I do, too.
Sleeping in her dad's bed impedes her development.<eos> If she wants to, she can sleep there.<eos> That's the way it stays.<eos> You're restricting her independence.<eos> - In Sweden, every kid does it.
Yes, I may.<eos> So, it was you painted these,<eos> The lines? Oh, not me.<eos> Alvin did most of them. I just started working for him.<eos> How many'd you do?
My daughter would have been very proud of you today, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's a long shot, but Emily would have tried.<eos> "Get out of the lab, Felix"!<eos> "Do some field work"!
- You lose yourself.<eos> Yeah, just... goodbye.<eos> - And that doesn't happen when you have sex.<eos> - I wish it did.<eos> Sure, don't we all?
- Wait a second.<eos> You know about this?<eos> - Well, I think that I do.<eos> - You know what's in this?<eos> Do you?
I've never asked it because I wanted to maintain some sort of dignity.<eos> A sense of dignity or a sense of self-esteem, but tell me, how many got notes?<eos> Just wanna know. Just curious.<eos> -You don't want to know that. Not really.<eos> - No, I do.
Regarding?<eos> An extramarital affair.<eos> - Oh, my.<eos> - Mm. I know my husband fucks around on the road.<eos> - You do?
That's coming from someone who wakes up in the morning, and first thing on their calendar is regret.<eos> And that's not a good feeling.<eos> Anyway, I should go.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - But before I do...
I can't watch anymore.<eos> I just can't watch anymore.<eos> Uh-uh, you ain't done yet.<eos> I had no idea you was a squirter.<eos> Neither did I?
Yeah?<eos> Nice.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We do, yeah.
Warm? Put the radiator on if you want warm.<eos> And, um, good with kids.<eos> So was Michael Jackson. Look at that marriage. It didn't last.<eos> Yeah, but I love her.<eos> - Love. - Well, I do.
Across the great sea to a place called England, where countless riches await us.<eos> How would we steer across the open sea?<eos> We have discovered a way.<eos> You want us to join you in the boat?<eos> Yes, we do.
Are you trying to rub this in or something?<eos> Please believe me.<eos> You should be in the White House.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I never did.
- You know psychology.<eos> For 1806 Euro per session you could do something useful.<eos> Ask her questions.<eos> Common.<eos> Do your job.
No, not really.<eos> I've been kicked out my flat.<eos> And I got nowhere else to go.<eos> Do you know where Horsey is now?<eos> No, I don't.
This the woman I am supposed to have slaughtered?<eos> What if she is?<eos> If I could see a way of clearing myself of this, would you grant it to me?<eos> Not if it involve you leaving this room, Captain.<eos> It does not.
- Hey, um...<eos> - Rebecca.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> I think you should go home.<eos> No, you don't.
- Very virile.<eos> I don't know you well enough for this to feel comfortable with me.<eos> Bobby, thank you so much for this delicious food.<eos> If you want, I can set up an examination.<eos> - I don't.
I know what she wants.<eos> She wants a family.<eos> And I just don't know if I if I'll ever be a good...<eos> I know, I know, I know it will make you happy.<eos> But I don't...
Your girlfriend's not the only one to beat out now.<eos> The legend himself?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I thought you guys were pals?<eos> Yeah, so did I.
Good afternoon, Tom.<eos> Legal?<eos> Did you say it or didn't you?<eos> To you and to anyone who asks...<eos> Yes, I did.
I think you should tell Kate.<eos> She was just here.<eos> So...<eos> If she wanted to know, it's all right here.<eos> She doesn't.
Hank, I- - I...<eos> I think maybe...<eos> Maybe I need a lawyer.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, you don't. I-
Give me my baby.<eos> Skyler, we are not leaving without her.<eos> Give me my baby right now!<eos> Marie!<eos> Do it now.
And, frankly, people are pretty upset about it.<eos> Well, I've been tasked with the job of investigating the mole, and, frankly, I could use someone with experience.<eos> I'm not sure if busting a couple of small-time drug dealers qualifies me for espionage work, Dr. Manchester.<eos> Besides...how do you know I'm not the spy?<eos> Well, I don't, actually.
"U" and "I" are in the word education.<eos> But education with a capital "E"...<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Yes, you do, Marty.
Well, let's not focus on the ashes.<eos> We don't want people to think Peter was a disaster.<eos> No, no.<eos> We focus on the positive.<eos> A "fresh start" and a "clean start" both did well in focus groups.
Oh, man.<eos> I wanted to bid on the Cuperbergs' condo in Maui and now I can't.<eos> Jeff, you don't wanna stay at that condo.<eos> It sounds repulsing.<eos> Yeah I do.
I'm McKenna. It's nice to meet you.<eos> - When I got out of college, I, uh-- I majored in journalism, but I kinda couldn't get my shit together, so I ended up working at this PR firm writing press releases about Calista Flockhart's buttery choc highlights.<eos> Guys, who wants to try the new bar method place with me?<eos> Oh, is that open?<eos> Yeah, me I do.
Where are you from?<eos> Different places.<eos> Where'd you sit?<eos> Roscoe.<eos> I did eight years at Allenwood.
James, just put on your big-boy pants and meet your father at a bar of your choice so we can mumble, like men, over a beer.<eos> No.<eos> This is where they lock up the pain pills.<eos> - We need a bolt cutter.<eos> - No, we don't.
I'll put you two together. That's all.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is with you and Dr. Pryce, but he is the closest available scientific authority.<eos> You really gonna make me ask Olivia...<eos> - You know what he did.<eos> - No, I don't. None of us do.
That's what he told me.<eos> In the journal entry, he said he promised to meet Alison when she came back from her grandmother's.<eos> At was the same night she died.<eos> Maybe he agreed to meet her at a different time.<eos> No, he didn't.
I can't, okay? I can't.<eos> Not alone.<eos> - Julia, you tried to hurt him.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
Fine, Clark.<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> So, referencing our meeting this evening... obviously, you understand it's been classified Top Secret by the the Internal Affairs Division of the Committee to oversee United States' counterintelligence agencies.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, - et cetera, et cetera?<eos> - I do.
Tell me what you want next. Oh.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about... this?<eos> Oh, I... oh, I don't know.<eos> I don't... oh!
This time?<eos> Steve, have a seat.<eos> John?<eos> Arthur, I don't want to.<eos> Yes. You do.
He's the world's greatest salesman, he cons everyone.<eos> In no time he'll get you to spend every penny on whatever he's selling.<eos> You always flatter me.<eos> Just because I express myself well doesn't mean I'm always working!<eos> - What do you do?
What was once paid in full is now only half.<eos> Next time bring 500.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You might find this hard to believe because of how welcoming my country can be, but some of my colleagues in the legislature believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica.<eos> Me doing damage?
My name is Mariam Lass.<eos> I'm actually just a trainee. She was a very brave young woman.<eos> Jack, it's Miriam. I don't want to die like this.<eos> The Chesapeake Ripper kills in sounders of three.<eos> He did his first victims in nine days.
Pedro, please let me get by.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - Julián, please... Alyssa, please.<eos> Let me get by.<eos> No, don't. No.
What about truth, power?<eos> I think a pictures is a lot more powerful than a word.<eos> Really?<eos> How many think that?<eos> Don't you?
- Go into it!<eos> - Go for it, Chrissie!<eos> Go, keep going. - Keep going!<eos> - Go on, Chrissie,<eos> - do it!
- Go for it, Chrissie!<eos> Go, keep going. - Keep going!<eos> - Go on, Chrissie,<eos> - do it!<eos> Do it!
Happy Christmas, Fido.<eos> I want your cock.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> I want your cock.<eos> No, you don't.
They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.<eos> This one officer, pretty-boy type guy, had some issue with me.<eos> Thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew. And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.<eos> Then they tried to shoot me, after I beat the shit out of all three of them.<eos> Or one did.
- Hell, yeah!<eos> I ain't seen he got paid none.<eos> Well, he probably saves it 'cause he's smart.<eos> Buying this GMC off of me.<eos> Doing what?
My real name is Kara Jenkins. And uh, this is my interpretation of what's it like to have sex with a penis the size of a toothpick.<eos> This is gonna be exciting, folks.<eos> Hit it!<eos> So then, you've, so you've performed...<eos> Well, in a living room, I did, yeah.
And then everything will be normal again.<eos> With you it's never normal, right?<eos> But maybe you do not want that, otherwise you would not do on Ibiza holiday.<eos> Then you would be flown safely to a desert island.<eos> That did not Elza.
I should tell you...<eos> I bought some night tables.<eos> You did?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll kill you.<eos> Oh, no, don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody about this.<eos> Good.<eos> God, I want drugs!<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
Please tell me about the story of my grandfather.<eos> It seems as if you have matured a little.<eos> You said that your own grandfather is a coward right?<eos> I thought I have nothing to say to a guy like that.<eos> Did you do more research after that?
Fine.<eos> You have condoms, at least?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What?<eos> We do the lessons at school, in study hall.
He said she burst into tears.<eos> She's never this late.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> You hadn't told her you were pregnant?<eos> You did?
Marie-Anne?<eos> Hold on, please.<eos> I'm staying here tonight.<eos> Why did you hang up?<eos> She did.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Why do I not know who Simon Larkin is?<eos> That would probably be because the FBI knows more than you do.<eos> Anything happening in my neighborhood I have a right to know.<eos> No, you actually don't.
H"s like: "The Monkey King".<eos> What?<eos> "King Kong". The film where the big ape rapes the young journalist.<eos> He doesn't rape her.<eos> Yes he does.
Is this thing on?<eos> - Hello, America!<eos> - Hello, America!<eos> All right, we came here expecting to find a bunch of ghosts, and guess what?<eos> We did.
I said he's a wild animal.<eos> He's a killer. Get rid of him!<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Maud, I'm not kidding.<eos> Do it at once!
Slut! You did it on purpose, you bitch!<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Hurry up, this stinks.<eos> It sure does.
Silly me.<eos> Francis smokes these on special occasions.<eos> But he'll share, won't he?<eos> And you can smoke inside.<eos> My husband did from '71 to 2001, so the smell...
Did you see something out there?<eos> Come on.<eos> Back to bed.<eos> We're not allowed to do this, are we?<eos> - To do what?
Look, my job is to introduce your headphones to a huge, drunk, male audience.<eos> And it's not about my work, it's about making a great ad.<eos> The association not being with Vietnam, but with a laugh, a smile, that all comes from your headphones.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> But I do.
In those last months, he seemed more peaceful than I'd ever seen him.<eos> And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No one did.
Jesus Christ.<eos> The coppers told everyone Arthur had agreed to it when he was arrested.<eos> They said the Peaky Blinders had cleared out to the fair to let them do it.<eos> I never said nothing to that copper about smashing up bloody houses...<eos> All right... which pubs did they do?
If she really meant to kill herself, she'd be dead.<eos> I hereby call this meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee to order.<eos> Mr. Berenson, in accordance with the practice of the committee, would you stand and be sworn?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Mr. B's a hottie, though.<eos> Fuck, I know.<eos> Right? Too bad he wants to get it in with April!<eos> I know.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Two weeks at a grand per, then we talk about what comes after.<eos> You carpetbagging me. I'm treating you square.<eos> I always do.<eos> I want Fletcher Henderson up there.<eos> Who doesn't?
It may of course also be, that I'm completely wrong.<eos> Yes, but if it is as you say, then it is still worth the risk.<eos> In terms of career, that would be a great opportunity.<eos> I hope that I am right.<eos> -I honestly don't.
14301 South Figueroa.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you don't know... who this belongs to?<eos> No, I don't.
I was trying to help. By running around with the Russian mob and a murderous drug dealer?<eos> Are you out of your mind? !<eos> Mom, look, the real reason that you're upset is because I told Thea the truth about dad.<eos> She never needed to know that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Her knight in shining armor.<eos> It made me feel like...<eos> - I could have done it.<eos> - I know you could've.<eos> - She didn't.
It made me feel like...<eos> - I could have done it.<eos> - I know you could've.<eos> - She didn't.<eos> - Of course she did.
Toni...<eos> - What?<eos> - Do us a favor.<eos> Nip down to H-4. Martha owes me rollies.<eos> Do it yourself.
There's no standout suspects.<eos> Makes your life easier.<eos> Takes the heat off. Especially with today.<eos> Well, no. I want to know what happened to Meg.<eos> We all do.
You'll be right. - No, I won't.<eos> - You will.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Look at me. Every time I talk, I open my mouth, people laugh.<eos> - No, they don't, Boomer.
Because I was there when I told him.<eos> You have until 10:00 a.m. Then I'm calling Dallas.<eos> And Mark may not take your call, but he'll sure as hell take mine.<eos> How do I know you're not going to turn around and get him to pay more?<eos> You don't.
I don't wanna run from a fight.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I win, you don't fire me, you back me for managing partner.<eos> You want to take down Jessica.<eos> Yes, I do.
Every time I focus my energy. Stuffs shoot out.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> When I tell you to, punch me in the stomach.<eos> You don't know how to do it.<eos> Why didn't you...
Second time she's called.<eos> Did she say what it was about?<eos> Yeah, she said it was personal.<eos> I assumed you knew her.<eos> I don't.
I know a safe place we can go.<eos> The woods.<eos> Your safe place is in the woods.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> I don't...
Then break fucking thoughts, or fall from presence.<eos> His trench stands barrier enough to halt escape.<eos> Why see it coupled with impossible fortification?<eos> To keep our eyes from what lies beyond it.<eos> Or what does not.
And?<eos> You're definitely going to want to hear this.<eos> Mrs. Bennett... the night Ruth disappeared, did your husband strike her at all?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
He could be after the VP nomination.<eos> That doesn't make sense, though.<eos> The VP slot is on the table because Russo tanked.<eos> Underwood wanted him to win.<eos> Unless he didn't.
He said I'd want you.<eos> Well, war or no war,<eos> Nixon doesn't think he's running against Johnson.<eos> He thinks he's running against the ghost of Kennedy.<eos> So does Johnson.
What can I tell you?<eos> It's SOP.<eos> You know what just a half pound of semtex can do to a building like this or the people in it?<eos> - No, but I got--<eos> - Well, I do.
Shoot him, Debra.<eos> You have to end this.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Stop!<eos> Do it, Debra.
Shoot him.<eos> Stop!<eos> Do it, Debra.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Do it!
I am as clearheaded and as focused as I have ever been.<eos> There's a clarity to my thinking that's... frightening.<eos> I didn't help you stay sober so you could become a murderer.<eos> Well, you didn't realize that's what you were doing.<eos> Nor did I.
Do you have an address?<eos> No.<eos> I think I know how we can find one.<eos> Anybody ever tell you you punch like a woman?<eos> Yeah, a woman did once.
Trent's contract has the same problem as Louis's.<eos> He's got a non-compete.<eos> They couldn't get him to run the company unless they bought his.<eos> Now Louis wants back in.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- And I don't need any more tranquilizers or...<eos> - Belle...<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Why does everyone keep calling me that?<eos> I don't...
When he saw that crop of red hair?<eos> He walked out of the birthing room and?<eos> when he came up he held her and said: "She's mine.<eos> "She's mine. We'll never talk about it."<eos> And we never did.
If it were true, they would start by eating you. There's more of you to eat.<eos> No!<eos> You go fish with Quujuq.<eos> You go in the woods.<eos> Do it.
No!<eos> You go fish with Quujuq.<eos> You go in the woods.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
You go fish with Quujuq.<eos> You go in the woods.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it.
You go in the woods.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
Where were we?<eos> talking about serious matters!<eos> Ah, yes. America.<eos> There, the hawks think they understand the world.<eos> But they don't.
On one side there's spirit, vision, on the other, oil, vested interests, the neocons.<eos> You've read Tintin comics?<eos> You read Tintin?<eos> Remember them?<eos> Why do you?
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.<eos> You will never find us.<eos> But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> Did you see it happen?<eos> No, but she did.
What are you doing?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Go on, do it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Do it.
I'm invited.<eos> Look, we have nothing against you or homosexuals.<eos> But stay away from our son.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> -No, you don't.
I can't say no.<eos> Don't think for a minute that I'm ever gonna forget that you were planning to murder someone on my watch.<eos> And don't think that I'm ever gonna really trust you again.<eos> You don't need to trust me to benefit from my intellect, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
Doesn't mean I should.<eos> There are some inconsistencies...<eos> Stop.<eos> Once in a while, like today... I wish I could work it like the other side does.<eos> Like the other side does?
Well this is a frickin disaster! I know.<eos> When Ron said we were going on a cruise, I almost vomited blood. No.<eos> Nobody's doing their peer reviews!<eos> Pam, the word "disaster" implies it's something that actually matters. It matters to me!<eos> Well, but you don't.
Thank you, but I... I'm fine.<eos> I think I am. M...<eos> Mr. Gold's, uh, getting me discharged.<eos> He believes he can help me remember who I am.<eos> Does he now?
It's as if no time has passed for you.<eos> Monthly juice cleanse. Does wonders for the skin.<eos> You could have come to me, Owen. You could've told me who you were and why you're here.<eos> I think you know why I'm here.<eos> I honestly don't.
The time for what?<eos> Steal back the beans.<eos> Use them to get everyone back into the Enchanted Forest before Storybrooke is gone.<eos> How? We don't know where Greg and Tamara are.<eos> Well, I do.
- No! Stay back.<eos> You used me!<eos> You wanted to kill my father!<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Hey, I don't mean to ruffle your... very attractive feathers, it's just that I wanted this to celebrate.<eos> Oh, yeah, what are you celebrating?<eos> You having dinner with me tonight.<eos> (laughs):<eos> Ho-ho... You did not just...
Come.<eos> This is my first time at a fortune teller.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> He knows everything, right?<eos> - Of course he does.
I want to apologize.<eos> One of my jobs as your therapist is to help build your trust.<eos> And in this case, I feel like I might have taken advantage of it.<eos> So you want me to come back, I guess.<eos> Yes, I do.
Phase 1: Evacuate all.<eos> Phase 2:<eos> Locate and repair the damage.<eos> What does that mean, "locate and repair"?<eos> What do you do, specifically?
Hmm? First. And last, Gus.<eos> - Helena?<eos> - I'm looking for my father.<eos> I figure if anybody knows where he is, it would be his attorney.<eos> I don't.
You know, the ice is like a giant freezer.<eos> Everything keeps.<eos> - What if the ice melts?<eos> - It doesn't melt.<eos> - But what if it does?
Oh, my God.<eos> Well, you can forget about the huge decision I made that you know nothing about because I just unmade it.<eos> What was that all about? Heh, heh.<eos> Oh, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Do you?
Well, good news.<eos> We're not stranded here.<eos> I just got off the phone, and according to my new boyfriend, Captain facelift, your new boyfriend, the brit, is flying us hg tomorrow on a commercial flight. Coach.<eos> What?<eos> I don't do coach.
Grease under your nails.<eos> If your truck was really broken down, you'd know how to fix it, right?<eos> Seriously, man, all I know is that I was supposed to meet my girlfriend an hour ago.<eos> How many?<eos> Dude, I don't...
Our grant.<eos> About that blackmail thing...<eos> I was just trying to get my message across.<eos> I don't want anyone to know.<eos> But since you do...
Catherine, the things that I said about the way that you see me, it was wrong, okay?<eos> It's my issue.<eos> I just, sometimes I wish so badly... I wasn't what I am.<eos> Catherine, I know that I can't be with someone who doesn't know everything about me.<eos> She does now.
Tell me, Phil, you trust your wife, hmm?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you love your wife?<eos> Yes, I do very much.
Let's get started.<eos> I don't wanna walk in late like I own the joint.<eos> Okay, Sam.<eos> Go put on your fancy going-to-church outfit like we do every Sunday.<eos> - But, Dad, we don't...
God, you may break.<eos> I'm really sorry that I came late, I promise I'll improve.<eos> Then.<eos> Erik did not know the worker, but then he meets his daughter- and asks if she knows who he is.<eos> Why did he do that?
You didn't do anything wrong, Con.<eos> - I said it was okay.<eos> I sanctioned it.<eos> - Doesn't know what sanctioned means.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You've probably seen them.<eos> But I always end up at Saks.<eos> And I come home and Herb always says the same thing.<eos> How much damage did you do, Peaches?<eos> We always do some shopping.
What on earth makes you think that young man's prepared to take on this kind of responsibility?<eos> He's my son.<eos> I know what he's capable of.<eos> And he's my student.<eos> I do, too.
And then I'm this poor sucker running around trying to fix this mess that you all made!<eos> You don't!<eos> You do not want to get into whose responsibility this is.<eos> You don't want to get into who's responsible for all of this.<eos> You don't!
Wh... wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You told him?<eos> That he might be getting fired?<eos> Of course I did.
I would've actually tried to save the man.<eos> Cristina...<eos> Do you think that I would make a decision that is not in the best interest of my patient?<eos> I just want this kid to see his dad again.<eos> I do, too.
d d [Upbeat Pop] d d [Man Vocalizing]<eos> d d [Ends] Hey, Ted.<eos> What's this I hear/remember... about you not wanting to see Robots Versus Wrestlers?<eos> Yeah, it's just that I don't want to see it.<eos> - You don't...
I gave him my word I'd protect him.<eos> Well, that's very nice of you.<eos> It was completely delusional, but it was very nice.<eos> Now, you know damn well that if you do anything with this report... Anything at all... There'll be nothing stopping me from taking Ken down.<eos> I do.
You too have a way with words.<eos> Words betrayed me.<eos> Homer, tell them one of my adventures, in your words.<eos> He alone understands me.<eos> But you, my dear friend, you no longer do.
Mama's giving a house party next month.<eos> Why don't you come?<eos> Then you can blend in and look around without anyone asking too many questions. And Mama won't mind.<eos> She likes you.<eos> But your father doesn't.
- Okay, I got to go to court.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> You sure?<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
I know that we're all scared.<eos> And... sad... and, um, angry, and it's... it's easy to focus all of that on the obvious person.<eos> But is that really fair?<eos> I don't know if Danny did this or not.<eos> But do you?
I don't--<eos> No, it's about Malcolm.<eos> He wants to level the Glades.<eos> And how does Malcolm propose to evacuate an entire section of the city?<eos> He doesn't.
You know, I don't want to leave our kids with somebody you forgot about.<eos> Well, she's the alternate.<eos> Well, it's a disaster plan.<eos> Most disasters don't happen.<eos> They do to us.
Some die under torture, others talk.<eos> No one really trusts Meisner and the methods he formulated during his vagabond days in vienna.<eos> What he wants is to strengthen his own position, never mind ours.<eos> We need Meisner.<eos> At least, until we don't.
She would not be removed. And so he carried her.<eos> Which is when she screamed. In the street. You tended to her?<eos> Your sergeant, all others to bear witness?<eos> What cruelty could possibly merit so public a humiliation?<eos> What did you do to her, Inspector?
Just me.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't-- you don't get to come back.<eos> You don't get to come back from things.<eos> You don't...
Make your move.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So I think there's some stuff you and I need to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do, but first...
You know, this is probably not gonna help my negotiating power, but...<eos> I kinda can't believe how perfect this house is.<eos> And how much is little Otis gonna enjoy this doggie door?<eos> How do you... know my dog's name?<eos> I don't.
When I examined that nail today, I noticed that the tip was slightly charred.<eos> Carbon scoring from where it struck the bullet.<eos> I was right.<eos> I always knew it, you see? I always knew.<eos> I just didn't...
It's not something you forget.<eos> Look, I think a little alone time would be good for the angels.<eos> At the very least, it would s--<eos> It would stop the fighting up there from spilling out down here, which will happen.<eos> It always does.
Do you... do you know what you're saying?<eos> I mean, she's with, you know, and he's... he's been very clear about... You know, and we just can't... you know.<eos> I don't think we have a choice anymore.<eos> I mean, she knows just about everything except that.<eos> She does?
And according to Officer Grasso's<eos> PBA rep, he's gonna fight any charges, which means a department hearing.<eos> I suggest you let it go through the proper channels.<eos> Let it go through the proper channels.<eos> I don't do drugs.
That is indeed an honour.<eos> Lucrezia?<eos> I am... surprised and honoured.<eos> So, she will reside in Naples?<eos> She already does.
It's like an incubator.<eos> Your son probably got vaccinated when he went to college; so did my family.<eos> So, we're okay.<eos> Yeah, I got mine in the military.<eos> Yeah. Well, what about those who didn't?
Linda, Freddy's death was an accident.<eos> He got shot on my watch.<eos> It's my responsibility to tell Rusty.<eos> I just... I just don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What if the temperature starts dropping?<eos> My family is already out of propane.<eos> Listen, I give you my word: nothing like that's gonna happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
Really?<eos> Because all I see is a worn out piece of junk from the future with no potential.<eos> - I'm gonna go now.<eos> - Good idea!<eos> Why don't you?
I could work for the police, and if I hone my gift, and talk to the dead, I could be on talk shows...<eos> So, this is going to be your career?<eos> It's going to be difficult at first, but... yes.<eos> Jen, you really think you have psychic abilities?<eos> Yes, I do, 'cause...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm going to sleep.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> We don't do sleep.
Before you go any further, I'd like to remind you you called looking for my help, not the other way around.<eos> Right you are.<eos> Will you help?<eos> I'll consider everything that's on the table.<eos> How you doing, Ricky?
It's impossible.<eos> The Falcon created an unhackable bank account.<eos> Not even Carrion could break the code.<eos> I never said that it was gonna be easy, only that I need your help.<eos> More importantly, that Emily does.
He won't.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> You told Emily? She's practically a Grayson.<eos> I trust Emily with my life.<eos> So did Amanda.
You have many clients today?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I don't have a single appointment the whole week.<eos> Viviane come on Friday, but she doesn't pay.<eos> She doesn't?
No, why?<eos> Garza said something about my purpose.<eos> Did she say anything about it to you?<eos> Kiera, I wouldn't hide anything from you, you should know that by now.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Tell him Hamza.<eos> - What?<eos> - You split with that chick.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
- $300.<eos> It's a piece of crap.<eos> But it was a gift from my father.<eos> And you know how important family is in our culture.<eos> Again, I don't.
I'm here to tell you he's recusing himself from the case.<eos> So he appointed a special prosecutor.<eos> I win, you back me for managing partner.<eos> You want to take down Jessica.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Well, ask her to come in.<eos> The doctor came at the same time, sir.<eos> - Did he go straight into my room?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - How do you do, Nora?
The doctor came at the same time, sir.<eos> - Did he go straight into my room?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - How do you do, Nora?<eos> - How do you do?
My dad's the bad influence.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> - Pipe me, bitch.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it.
In a minute. Could you take Katia's bag, Dad?<eos> In you go.<eos> 6In Lucie's room<eos> Lucie is 22 and lives at home.<eos> Well, she did until fairly recently
You have to listen to me.<eos> I know where I left my phone and it's... It's not there anymore.<eos> Somebody moved it.<eos> You have to believe me! Okay.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay, I do.
Oh... I'm telling you. Look at you.<eos> I-I wanted to call you anyway.<eos> You know, my sugar's up, but my pressure's down.<eos> You been good?<eos> Yeah, how your people doing?
We'll find it.<eos> Your mother is staying with Cailin.<eos> - Do you think that's okay?<eos> - Do I think it's okay that my mother is babysitting a grown adult?<eos> - No, I do not.
You evaluate your target options till the last minute.<eos> And then you go with the best one.<eos> We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?
We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?<eos> How do we know the Volm won't turn it on us after they've used it against the Espheni?<eos> We don't.
What we need to know is the only way to get Henry back is cooperation.<eos> With her?<eos> With him?<eos> No, Emma, we have to do this the right way.<eos> No, we don't.
But if you want to talk to someone you can trust... who was there, you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who does?
I was finished with The Chemist, so you saved me payment for services.<eos> And for that, I thank you.<eos> But...it did make me wonder what else you know.<eos> What else do you know?<eos> I don't...
- who is from?<eos> - North Dakota.<eos> Hungary, just like Milos.<eos> Ev, what did I say about deviating from the plan?<eos> - Not to do it!
- North Dakota.<eos> Hungary, just like Milos.<eos> Ev, what did I say about deviating from the plan?<eos> - Not to do it!<eos> - Not to do it!
- Just in case.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I don't like it, but--<eos> - We have to protect her.<eos> Yes, we do.
What do you want with his dad?<eos> Go back to sleep, Milhouse.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I didn't.<eos> But I do now.
- Harker!<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want the same thing you do, justice.<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, good, you didn't bring up the mattress yet.<eos> We still have to paint.<eos> Way ahead of you.<eos> - What are we laughing at?<eos> - I don't...
I can't believe you would do this for me.<eos> You know I have children, too.<eos> I know that's not why you're doing it.<eos> And I hope-- well, I hope you know that I was just frustrated with you.<eos> I do now.
And for what?<eos> For this?<eos> You are treating me like a fucking traitor again.<eos> But you didn't die, though, did you?<eos> One of my people did,
Same as at the prison.<eos> We fire at 'em, get their blood on us, breathe it in.<eos> We didn't come all this way to get sick.<eos> How do we know the ones in there aren't any different?<eos> - We don't.
What was the last thing you said to him?<eos> Probably something kind.<eos> No, you said...<eos> "Fuck you, you fucking loser." - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Shut up!<eos> Why would I...?<eos> Why would I care what Jess thinks?<eos> Cos I fucking...<eos> I don't.
And...<eos> [Nina] But what about the fact that most of the world doesn't have all this stuff.<eos> - I mean, do we need so much stuff?<eos> - But you don't...<eos> No, you don't.
And... when he was home, it was not always pleasant.<eos> When my mother told me he had died,<eos> I felt, "I should cry now, but I don't really feel like it."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So, I didn't.
We are faking the relationship!<eos> Well, I don't want her to know that.<eos> Wade, Carter Covington is the first truly eligible bachelor I have met in a really long time.<eos> Do you know what you're asking me to give up?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And not just because Lavon would break my kneecaps.<eos> But... I'm not the guy for you.<eos> I'm going to wear you down, George Tucker.<eos> And sooner or later, you will ask me out.<eos> - I don't...
Before they left, your parents said that they should miss a contact time to give you this.<eos> Thanks anyway. Already have one.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> So does the story of me and my parents.<eos> Neither do this one.
Please, Lennart... go out in the garage!<eos> Good morning, beloved Matilda!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Tell it to go out in the garage.<eos> Do it yourself.
Yeah, amongst other things.<eos> You told her to stick with the lawyer she picked in the first place?<eos> More or less.<eos> Harvey, listen, I told you, you don't have to trust me, okay?<eos> But Darby does.
More or less.<eos> Harvey, listen, I told you, you don't have to trust me, okay?<eos> But Darby does.<eos> And Darby wants this win.<eos> Therefore, so do I.
This.<eos> That is a good button.<eos> Hey, have you decided if you're gonna come with me to Comic-Con this weekend?<eos> I really don't think so.<eos> I don't do well with that crowd.
Is there something going on that I don't know about?<eos> Charlie Goodson?<eos> You must be Kent.<eos> Thanks for coming by. I'm hoping you and I can have a friendly dialogue.<eos> Oh, did you? Yeah?
Well, if you're going to Comic-Con, we might as well drive down together.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You go to this thing?<eos> No, I don't go.<eos> The mutant king of planet Nuru does.
- Oh.<eos> - Where'd you want it, Vanilla?<eos> - Where it is.<eos> Frankie said he'd give us $200 bucks to move it.<eos> - Did he?
Yes...<eos> It's my turn.<eos> No. I'm playing until I beat him!<eos> - Write: "Big Max is a cheat!"<eos> - No! Don't!
He'll hook you up!<eos> - What does he want?<eos> - He wants you.<eos> What?<eos> No, he don't.
He's compelled me to forget everything as soon as I leave.<eos> That way, I'm too busy agonizing over whether or not I'm losing my damn mind to realize I'm playing spy for an immortal egomaniac.<eos> You compelled her to go out with me, didn't you?<eos> And I thought you really liked me.<eos> So did I.
This guy's got a bunch of cryptic numbers on his phone.<eos> Orders to keep you away from a predetermined target.<eos> All from dummy numbers with the same 305 area code.<eos> What part won't I believe?<eos> Okay. The part that I don't.
Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To save our son.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> No, we don't.
I betrayed Harvey once.<eos> It's never going to happen again.<eos> Okay, well, then I'll just have to hear your side of the story at your deposition.<eos> Ms. Scott, to your knowledge, did Harvey Specter want this merger?<eos> - No, he didn't.
But Simmons gave me the authority to pull your card anytime I want.<eos> What ya think, Jerry?<eos> Should I earn myself a new partner?<eos> You don't even know who you are yet, son.<eos> Do you?
Yes.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Who is this?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> So you do?
I know.<eos> She stared at me, too.<eos> But the way she stared... felt... really, really good.<eos> You know?<eos> Actually, I do.
I have seen you both naked a hundred times!<eos> Just open the door, so I can take a shower!<eos> We really need to get out more.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Uh, yeah, why?<eos> We're working on a case.<eos> We've got two dead bodies, and both of them ate at the Raven Rose in the last few days.<eos> All right, do you know Ned Klosterman or Stephanie Robinson?<eos> Ned, I do, yeah.
I just think that we probably got off on the wrong foot.<eos> Your feet were not the issue, dear.<eos> - I know how it looked.<eos> - I'm quite sure you don't.<eos> No, I really do.
I'll make her talk.<eos> How?<eos> You don't want me to answer that.<eos> How do I know you won't use what she says to get Seth for yourself?<eos> You don't.
Yes, you can, you stupid girl!<eos> No! Do it! And feel my power flow into you!<eos> I know, because I was standing where you're standing!<eos> Stop yelling at me!<eos> Do it!
No! Do it! And feel my power flow into you!<eos> I know, because I was standing where you're standing!<eos> Stop yelling at me!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
Well, for starters, we could do a lot more than flip the lights off.<eos> Two of our men burst into flames just outside of Willoughby.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You don't?
Let's make sure that never happens again.<eos> All of us here can live with that.<eos> I'm not sure everyone at your table feels the same way.<eos> We all want the same thing, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
What you need to understand, Jake, is that this here is a safe space.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> So, why don't you start at the beginning and tell me the truth.<eos> - You want the truth?<eos> - I do.
Good.<eos> This has no weight without the signatures of both parents.<eos> I know.<eos> And, uh, you think Jax will sign it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Madison's already spent more time with us than any rehab facility she's been sentenced to. She's a special case.<eos> Did she give the impression of being a particularly powerful witch?<eos> I mean, she's a movie star.<eos> So she's got that thing, you know?<eos> No, we don't. What thing?
I am closing in.<eos> Over there is a nice store, where do you get baking ingredients.<eos> If your ambitions you in the direction.<eos> As you know, Maggie, I'm in Paris one summer at Cordon Bleu College studied.<eos> I did not.
It's not possession by demon, it's not mutation, and Daniel has been cured.<eos> You're a Grimm.<eos> You should know better.<eos> I need to see the boy.<eos> No, you don't.
Now step away from my partner.<eos> Brother...<eos> He's decapitare.<eos> - He knows what we are.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Just hear me out.<eos> I'm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.<eos> Oh... I loved those.<eos> I did them every year there.<eos> We did them at Princeton, too.
You were trapped in a safe and tossed in a quarry.<eos> Water flooded in.<eos> You tried to scream, you tried to escape, but all you could do was drown over and over and over again.<eos> The only thing keeping you sane was that one day one of the two people you loved... Would come rescue you, but they didn't.<eos> I did.
Shut up, Bob.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, Cleo, I hear your parole hearing didn't go so well.<eos> No, it did not go so well.<eos> No, it did not.
But she's on our side.<eos> Fiona Goode has been on the same side her whole life: her own.<eos> Now, I don't know if you are the next Supreme, nobody does, but if she jumps to that conclusion, right or wrong, she will slit your throat just like she did to Madison.<eos> Nobody knows who killed Madison, not even Madison.<eos> She doesn't, but I do.
Because of one merman.<eos> He knew the war was wrong so he took the trident and locked it away in a chamber where it could never be found. Till I did.<eos> Then I used it against you.<eos> Until you realized what you were doing. Then you locked it away again.<eos> Just like he did.
If it stands up to pee, I'm banging it.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Let me introduce you to Luke's parents.<eos> Nathan and Mary, this is my mother, Bonnie.<eos> How do you do?
- Oh, hi.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We do?<eos> - Yes, we do.
The satellite's picking up another reading.<eos> It's coming from the firehouse.<eos> That humming noise... you hear that?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Ok.<eos> Thank-<eos> Well, my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.<eos> I need to get back to Central City if I still want to be employed.<eos> Which I do.
No, he couldn't.<eos> But I know someone who can.<eos> Ra's al Ghul.<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> Well, I didn't.
I need to move on.<eos> So you admit it.<eos> I do know what I'm doing.<eos> To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.<eos> Well, Stefan... sometimes I don't either.
- Of course.<eos> Listen, I don't know how things are done in France, but you do have an assistant to handle this stuff.<eos> - Uh, clear this wall, please.<eos> - I'll get on that. Only I know what my father likes...<eos> And more importantly, what he does not.
He was the best.<eos> It's hard for me to share memories from my past, Daniel.<eos> It's even harder for me to trust.<eos> You know, people... Think that because I lost my family, I never knew what real love was.<eos> But I did.
- Well, it's just that purple might be a little bit bold for --<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You think I'm an idiot. - No.<eos> No!<eos> - No, we don't, Pepper.
- you have misunderstood this whole situation. - Have I really?<eos> I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> I guess it's just the stress of the wedding.<eos> And God, Victoria-- she constantly t-- treats me like I'm not good enough.<eos> - Oh, she does that to everyone.
I like the unicorns.<eos> Giving you up when the curse hit was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. - I know.<eos> - Every time I look at you,<eos> I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't had to.<eos> I do the same thing with Henry.
A fresh coat of paint.<eos> It'll be like nothing ever happened.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> You understand that?<eos> I do.
I feel like I never get to see you anymore, Vanessa.<eos> You were the best staffer I ever had.<eos> A sacrifice of higher office.<eos> You wanted to be vice president.<eos> No, I didn't.
They're already running it.<eos> I mean, I tried to talk to Ross, but he said Dr. Yang isn't even interested in having...<eos> - Nurses' station.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We really don't.
I mean, I tried to talk to Ross, but he said Dr. Yang isn't even interested in having...<eos> - Nurses' station.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We really don't.<eos> - No, we do.
Listen, ma'am, I was telling Vincent, I can't apologize enough for...<eos> Trying to kill me?<eos> I didn't mean you any harm.<eos> It was really just all about survival, you know?<eos> No, I don't, actually.
Yeah?<eos> Really?<eos> Holmes and Watson are coming to you.<eos> Bell says our guy wants a polygraph.<eos> Innocent people often do.
It was pretty good.<eos> I'm down for that again.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> I bet that seemed sexier in your head.<eos> It really did.
I bought it.<eos> You're dying inside, aren't you?<eos> There's still two seats left in the gallery.<eos> Who wants them?<eos> - I do.
She would've known what she was entering into.<eos> We've been engaged since you were a child.<eos> Obviously you couldn't offer marriage.<eos> Which is... n... not to say that I don't understand why you want to help her.<eos> Of... of course, I do.
Cynthia, I know that I made it hard on you, always being gone.<eos> I just want you to know I'm sorry.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> You know, if you would've told me that a year ago you would still be living in this house.<eos> I do now.
Yeah.<eos> Brooke.<eos> Why don't you just call her?<eos> No. No. I'm the girl that gets called.<eos> I don't do the calling.
That's kind of how I felt about my old neighbor, Carla.<eos> I mean, she didn't take care of me, but when I was a kid, she used to let me drink out of her hose.<eos> The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards.<eos> Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?<eos> 'Cause I only do it in my car.
Sure.<eos> Cool place.<eos> Won't you please sit down?<eos> Look, man... if you don't want to be my sponsor, it's all good.<eos> I do.
Cool place.<eos> Won't you please sit down?<eos> Look, man... if you don't want to be my sponsor, it's all good.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
And they listen to that music.<eos> And everybody knows they...<eos> I heard from a bunch of people that they been hearing that they been, you know, worshipping Satan and killing clogs and things like that.<eos> You think the way they dress had something to do with the...<eos> Absolutely yes, I do.
So you okay lately?<eos> I've been worried about you.<eos> Thanks, Annie, I'm fine.<eos> You know what I'm doing on this case?<eos> Sure, I do.
The whole time, I kept thinking some maniac has escaped from Broadmoor and was gonna leap out of a hedgerow and strangle me.<eos> - Or worse.<eos> - Dolly.<eos> Obviously, that didn't happen.<eos> Nothing ever does.
- Tell the vicar we're on our way. - Yeah.<eos> The door jammed!<eos> Didn't anyone hear my knocking?<eos> Of course.<eos> We all did.
I watched from 200-seaters... to a thousand, and then I saw 80,000.<eos> I saw a hundred thousand.<eos> We tore up Europe. We played to, like, maybe two million people in six weeks.<eos> We broke everybody's record over there. The Rolling Stones...<eos> He did a concert in Tokyo... 4,000 people.
That's why you have the big house and the security clearance, right?<eos> That's why they're trying so hard to kill you, because you don't know anything.<eos> I know my job, which is science.<eos> I don't know what you do when you leave the lab.<eos> - None of us do!
I should have fought, find a new violist, stay together, despite all the sadness. Instead of being weak and scared and lazy.<eos> Don't make that mistake.<eos> Be brave.<eos> I got a second chance.<eos> Not everybody does.
Goodbye piss-ants.<eos> I did it.<eos> I did it!<eos> Did you see me, Struensee?<eos> Yes, I did.
Absolut no outsiders.<eos> So wipe that Smirnoff your face and Popov!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You gotta do one cat a solid. Cat to cat.<eos> Do a solid here, buddy.
It was the night of the Lemon Prizes, Amidst all that forced joviality, I recall a moment of introspection.<eos> Why. Why would anyone in their right mind choose to be a publisher?<eos> This was the precise moment that Dermot found me.<eos> – Oy Timothy. – Aah, Dermot.<eos> Bad news inexorably does.
What, to be executed?<eos> If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden.<eos> I couldn't allow that.<eos> And what if no one believes this truth?<eos> Someone already does.
Alright, let me get this straight, okay?<eos> She sees you, all right, she throws herself in your arms, says she loves you and she never forgot about you. Yeah. Yeah, maybe.<eos> Okay, then, since you're starting to burn up, you tell her you love her too, but you really have to go, and if you don't get caught or shot, maybe you'll see her again in 10 years.<eos> Besides, what... You really think she, uh, she just waited for you?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - You do?
Wait. She has amnesia?<eos> Yes, since her accident.<eos> - Will you cut these too? - Yeah.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, I did.
Which is why it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.<eos> It is you who has to choose reality.<eos> You shoot her Doug and I promise, you would gasp awake... you find me sitting in the room beside you, turn and you'll see your beautiful... loving wife.<eos> She wants you back, Doug!<eos> We both do.
Thanks a bunch.<eos> Hey, are you here to rescue him?<eos> How did you know?<eos> I wish somebody would come and rescue me.<eos> We all do, honey.
- What?<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - Just allow it to happen!<eos> - It happens all by itself you mean?<eos> - Does it? - Yes.
Yeah.<eos> That's why I don't take them bitches too seriously.<eos> They come and they go and they come and they go.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> How you doing there, Yard?
It's just the way it works.<eos> You shouldn't go anywhere you don't want to go.<eos> Who says I don't want to go?<eos> Why do you have to go?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Or rather:<eos> Most drink in this city more than the Chancellor.<eos> (Small laugh, cell phone rings)<eos> Excuse but I think I have to, uh...<eos> What did he do?
By definition, it is motion that never ceases.<eos> There is no summit.<eos> And thus no reason to reach it.<eos> You see?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Don't talk to me about God. And I worked harder than you!<eos> I doubt that.<eos> - When I'd had enough, couldn't stand it anymore, found it too silly, I took curare. And God, of whom you like to speak, saved my life in what was doubtless one of His most idiotic miracles.<eos> I don't know why He did it.<eos> You don't?
Never mind.<eos> Sleeping isn't really my fortie.<eos> What were you thinking, with your eyes open?<eos> - If you'd call.<eos> - I did.
This is not a negotiation.<eos> It's 10 million.<eos> You'll get the file, and if the money is not in the account by 3:00 PM, I'll take it to another buyer.<eos> How do we know that you won't do that anyway?<eos> You don't.
We might need something a little more recent.<eos> Do you think?<eos> Do you have something that's a bit sexier?<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Did you...
We're leaving, and we're taking Rachel with us.<eos> No no no.<eos> He's doing what he has to do, okay?<eos> He's doing what he has to do to keep the people that he loves alive.<eos> And the people he doesn't as their food!
Apart from the septic epistle.<eos> How did the reunion go?<eos> I didn't quite know what to expect.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> I just didn't.
I thought I was the one going crazy.<eos> Now I feel like you're the one going crazy, but I'm here to help you.<eos> I am not crazy.<eos> I'm not crazy either.<eos> Well, I don't...
I miss him.<eos> What is that tea?<eos> It's so good.<eos> I suppose you want to get back to the kids.<eos> I do, actually.
What I need you to do is marry me.<eos> Yes, I will. I will do that.<eos> I will marry you, because I love you.<eos> I love you to the edge of the four corners of the Earth. I love you to the edge of the Seven Seas.<eos> - Really? - I do!
Will it get me out of here?<eos> Depends on what you tell us, sugar.<eos> The Chief's ancient Apache warrior mask was stolen by bunch of Elvis impersonators.<eos> And he knows where it is.<eos> I do not!
You love him, don't you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Does Heidi Hawthorne live here?<eos> Do you perhaps mean Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact I do, yes.
Brother, don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna let them score.<eos> Brother, I didn't let them score.<eos> I didn't let them.<eos> Well done, my brother
Åh se that!<eos> Svetlana, came her.<eos> Take one.<eos> All.<eos> Do it.
It's getting worse.<eos> Whose fault is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But just for the record 95 % of all runaways return home within the first six hours.<eos> That doesn't do you any good right now.
You think they'll let him return?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> What an idiot I am to ask you.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No one does.
Remember when I first asked you out, I said,<eos> Trust me when they're going to pay off.<eos> Then you told me you had a boyfriend.<eos> I never said that. -Yeah, you did.<eos> No, I didn't!
Line up!<eos> Line up for murder!<eos> Come on!<eos> Who wants to be killed?<eos> I do!
- Yeah. Well, I was speaking to Vince...<eos> - She's lovely!<eos> - And Carol can't have kids.<eos> That's a kid whose mother doesn't want it, bruv.<eos> She does, man.
I don't know much about relationships.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I definitely don't know anything about love.<eos> I can't believe I talked like I did.<eos> I don't.
Were you going to?<eos> Were you going to?<eos> Kevin knows.<eos> He's red-lighted me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Finally the day of the ball came.<eos> The slepsislers left for the castle, and Cinderella felt so very sad.<eos> When they had gone, she burst into tears.<eos> Why can't the prince find Cinderella?<eos> He does, in the end.
Just go into the corridor<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You still want to spit?<eos> Do you?
Have you read the newspapers today? Writes about Aaron Wiesel and controversial stem cell research.<eos> I know.<eos> And you think they are wrong?<eos> And you believe him?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Been waiting a week till we were gonna do this.<eos> I just wanna talk.<eos> - We don't need to.<eos> - We do.<eos> No, man, we don't.
We bury her with your stepmom and your stepbrother.<eos> And then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - lthought I'd find her.<eos> - We all did.
Hey, look at that.<eos> That'll work.<eos> You gotta understand, we can't stay out there.<eos> - You know what it's like.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Will you work for the traffic control?<eos> Do you want to work for the traffic control?<eos> Out.<eos> Who else?<eos> Do you?

And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.<eos> And there, Broomhilda shall remain.<eos> Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.<eos> Does a fella arise?<eos> Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.
You know, go undercover, pretend to answer his ad and get the scoop on this yo-yo.<eos> 991 Mallory.<eos> This is definitely it. What a piece of shit.<eos> AII right, I'm goin' in.<eos> How do I Iook, Arnau?
When you choose a partner, you have to have compromises and sacrifices, but it's the price you pay.<eos> Do I wanna follow my every whim and desire as I make my way through time and space? Absolutely.<eos> But at the end of the day, do I need someone when I'm doubting myself, and I'm insecure and my heart's failing me?<eos> Do I need someone who, when the heat gets hot, has my back?<eos> - So, do you? - I do.
So I don't have your address.<eos> Oh, 108 is my P.O. Box, and you can figure out the rest, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I also... I put my number on the inside of the case.<eos> Yes, you did.
Like a sit-up, but crusted and a little more...<eos> Something special.<eos> He can do this thing where he bangs his head right against the wall, and he doesn't get hurt.<eos> Watch this. - Oh my God!<eos> Kaspar, do the 'Headbanger'.
Why do you keep coming here?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> I like this job.<eos> - Is that a problem?<eos> - No, no. We... We all do.
I hope so.<eos> By the way, before I forget, you have to meet Master Chang at his office between 2:00 and 3:00.<eos> It's very important.<eos> But how do you know Master Chang?<eos> I don't.
Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...<eos> Eating somebody's brains.<eos> Brains?<eos> I want brai- Mm-mmm.<eos> No I don't! No I don't!
Meaning... What about my side of the street?<eos> What are my issues that I have to deal with?<eos> After all, I picked an addict, that says something.<eos> Yeah, so, I mean, it's pretty much self-sustaining, you know?<eos> The fish, they do their thing in the water, and that...
Uh, you guys hungry? Yeah?<eos> I know someone who works here ... so I might be able to get you a table.<eos> You work here.<eos> Yeah, I guess you're right.<eos> I do work here.
I'm not lying.<eos> My wife may be alive.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> See if the screen says "redirect".<eos> Yes, it does.
We can help each other, you and I.<eos> Go on.<eos> You don't want Louis.<eos> That's clear.<eos> But I do.
From your reputation, I'm assuming you didn't, Mr Holmes.<eos> For God's sake, she's the one who knows the code, ask her!<eos> Yes, sir, she also knows the code that automatically calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm.<eos> - I've learned not to trust this woman.<eos> - Mr Holmes doesn't...

Stop it.<eos> Tyler switched drinks, thought it would be funny to watch him get drunk.<eos> Jesus, that kid really is a young me.<eos> You want me to go after him?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, hey.<eos> Bates!<eos> You snuck out on me, you tricky little dicky, you!<eos> She knows my name, Hank.<eos> Yes, indeed, she does.
He said he would.<eos> Well, he said he'd be at your wedding.<eos> He lies.<eos> Whatever makes you think he'll change?<eos> You did.
Hey.<eos> I know you.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - He doesn't.
- Don't know her.<eos> - That why you killed the receptionist?<eos> - Kill?<eos> - Yeah, you heard what she said. "Kill."<eos> - But I didn't.
Take yourselves- both- away from our sight!<eos> Clean him up.<eos> Bring him back to life as if he were our own Lord Jesus Christ.<eos> Yes,Eminence.<eos> Do your work.
Why do you wanna keep it all here anyway?<eos> Listen, Daddy, I am sorry, but she is not coming back.<eos> Not ever.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What happened?<eos> What's going on?<eos> No one asked you to get involved, to save me, to save anyone.<eos> What? Did you ever think that maybe I loved being possessed?<eos> Did you?
It's friggin' Woodstock. Everybody's hopped up on the brown acid.<eos> We don't need the song and dance. Give him a little prick.<eos> This is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'll take it!<eos> Decisions, decisions.<eos> I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys.<eos> Yo hombre, you think you're cool enough to sit way in back with us college toughs?<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay, I'm gonna turn off the rest of the lights.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You can't get in?<eos> S.A.R.A.H.'s on lockdown. Did you try overriding the circuits?<eos> - Did...
Or I could just be dreaming.<eos> I could be in some awesome NREM dream cycle.<eos> We're gonna get you to talk to Allison. Okay?<eos> Allison. Allison saw the dragon disappear.<eos> Yeah, she did.
What if it was a command that her neural processor was responding to?<eos> So, you really think others are controlling Holly?<eos> Zane and I saw something.<eos> Hands, like someone was trying to get out.<eos> What if they did?
Zane said the Z-bomb fit in his pocket.<eos> So, if he and Parrish were taken, maybe he could still have it.<eos> So, we just need to find out where they're being held and activate it.<eos> Except we have no clue where that is.<eos> But someone does.
Hi, I'm Jessica Day.<eos> I spoke with your supervisor on the telephone.<eos> Um, are you bringing the stripper?<eos> 'Cause I really wanted to see her jugs first, you know, just so...<eos> um, I do right by my bro.
Ready to admit you were wrong?<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Nick, and I like eating crow.<eos> - That man wants to sleep with you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I couldn't wait to see you.<eos> - How are you, gorgeous?<eos> - Let me look at you.<eos> You look fabulous.<eos> So do you.
- I'm not crying.<eos> - I didn't think that.<eos> What, we're all suddenly interested in each other's lives?<eos> I know for a fact that Jaguar's not going to happen.<eos> And he probably does, too.
- No. I'm better.<eos> Listen, just forget I brought any of this up.<eos> It's just--<eos> It's been so hard, you know.<eos> I do.
You gonna make me?<eos> Maybe...<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Goodness, Craig, what did you do to our kitchen?<eos> I didn't do anything to the kitchen.<eos> You left an oven mitt on the stove.<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> - I didn't.
- Not for the big one, no.<eos> - No?<eos> I'm not sure whether I'm going to go with a bay or not.<eos> I suppose I could commit to where they're going right now, - I mean, if we really need to.<eos> - Yeah, we really do.
No!<eos> It's not what your mother would want.<eos> You haven't even heard what I have to say!<eos> Besides, I'm not so sure she even knows what she wants anymore.<eos> Yes, she does.
Mr. Morrison, this office does not have the resources to spend to teach people the fundamentals of how to build.<eos> They either know how to do it or they hire someone who does.<eos> You've seen my report.<eos> You know what needs to be done.<eos> Yes, I do.
You think he's dead, but... He's everywhere.<eos> No matter how many times you kill him, he's everywhere.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
Not quite, no.<eos> I don't wanna put a curse on it, but I have a feeling about it, you and Natalie.<eos> I think it could be good for you.<eos> - Am I allowed to say this?<eos> - You just did.
Bob throw you out, or you walk out on her, too?<eos> Your father came to me.<eos> He needed me. Told me you needed me, too.<eos> He lied.<eos> We don't.
The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.<eos> Loras wants revenge.<eos> He blames Stannis for Renly's death.<eos> And Margaery... Wants to be queen.<eos> Yes, she does.
A Detective took you to dinner?<eos> Me and my brother.<eos> He's trying to find out what happened to Steven and Kevin.<eos> I know you probably don't remember them, but... Anyway, Steven's dead now, so he's trying to find out, uh, if we know anyone else who got jobs.<eos> Well, do you?
You'll receive $50 a day for food and whatever else he needs, but let's just say,<eos> I'm not going to be making any surprise visits.<eos> Father, I've...<eos> I've... done a terrible thing.<eos> I don't...
- Let him go.<eos> - The little shit broke in.<eos> - Wait, he's not the dad.<eos> - He knows.<eos> The fuck I do.
To catch the President in Tunisia. Need preparing food for the twelve personalities that will be part of the entourage.<eos> We will receive confirmation of flight soon at night.<eos> Where do you got?<eos> For more than two hours that are behind you.<eos> What time does the plane?
Moment, we'll make.<eos> How much are the potatoes?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why did you shoot your wife?<eos> I do not movies.
5 years with me.<eos> She bounced.<eos> I'd have done the same.<eos> Are you nuts? Don't talk like that.<eos> A real man doesn't.
Welcome to the mines!<eos> Where can I sign up?<eos> What?<eos> I want to volunteer to sell candles.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, I do, but how do we stop this?<eos> Break the curse.<eos> I'll try, I promise.<eos> But I got to save Henry first, and I need your help.<eos> No, you don't.
- All water under the bridge.<eos> - Knock off the cliches.<eos> Road not taken.<eos> I want you home, Lip.<eos> We all do.
You're graduating.<eos> I didn't and I still regret it.<eos> Who's stopping you?<eos> Debbie, Carl, Liam, you.<eos> Hey, don't do me any favors.
Why do you work in our kindergarten?<eos> Well, that's because I was a teacher at your big brother's old school.<eos> And then it closed. - Do you remember that? - Uh-huh.<eos> My dad says that you are sad because you live in a big house all alone.<eos> - Well, does he now?
Hello, Mr. Walker.<eos> I'm Dr. Arthur Arden.<eos> I run this institution.<eos> - I thought Sister Jude ran this place.<eos> - So does she.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> I'll leave you two to get him upstairs.<eos> And, Dick, you need an ID badge.<eos> Whoa, indeed I do.
I forgive you.<eos> We done now?<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> I want to.<eos> I really do.
We're only gonna be gone for a few hours.<eos> I don't want to be alone in this house!<eos> You bitch!<eos> -What'd you say?<eos> -What did they...
I had to give all that up.<eos> Bad for my health.<eos> What about you?<eos> Where you from?<eos> What do you do?
Yes. Why?<eos> Well, I can tell you how to get to sleep if you tell us who you think killed your son.<eos> Who says I know?<eos> Well, you said you were wasting your time with us, so I assumed you already knew who was responsible.<eos> Do you, Mr. Porchetto?
How about the boat?<eos> Ready to go.<eos> Now, look, we need you all to just calm down.<eos> See, we-we-we all want the same thing.<eos> No, we don't.
I mean, so I hear.<eos> I just started it.<eos> Who reads?<eos> Elaine says you might come with us.<eos> She did?
I promise you, I will take care of it.<eos> You don't know what it's like to have to go to a place that you hate every day.<eos> As a matter of fact, Grace, yes, I do.<eos> Do you think I want to go to work?<eos> No, I don't.
These Quantum Bay guys, they know what they're doing.<eos> I've never seen a cute girl in HR.<eos> Then all of a sudden, I'm at my exit interview, I'm talking to Jessica fucking Rabbit.<eos> You want to look at your severance check?<eos> Do you?
Come with me.<eos> Don't want to explain this twice.<eos> You're letting in the flies.<eos> And she needs an LVAD.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Reduced fine motor control.<eos> Add that to inattention and liver flap.<eos> It does make sense.<eos> We have to talk to Foreman.<eos> No, we don't.
Look, he's a good kid.<eos> He did some drugs a while back, but he's straightened out.<eos> He couldn't kill anybody.<eos> Anybody else in here know him?<eos> Well, most of the guys do.
You said you didn't wanna be Lemon for a night.<eos> Well, this is your chance.<eos> Lemon, we're in Fairhope.<eos> Nobody knows who you are.<eos> They don't?
- Dr. Hart, I don't know what to say.<eos> You are an angel sent from heaven.<eos> - In one little package.<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> Yes, you did. You did everything.
It's all politics to get back at me.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I wanna be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
Somebody in the E.R. just got 22 stitches from trying to open a bottle with a lighter.<eos> - It's really dangerous.<eos> - They must've done it wrong.<eos> You need one of these bad boys.<eos> - No, she does not.
- It's really dangerous.<eos> - They must've done it wrong.<eos> You need one of these bad boys.<eos> - No, she does not.<eos> - No, you do not.
Like why you even think it's there to begin with ? And why you think bin Laden might be there ?<eos> I took this off of a guy that obviously can't read anymore.<eos> - No question that this is Intel on the militia camp.<eos> But who's there is anyone's guess. Even we're guessing.<eos> You guys do that a lot.
- It's not like that.<eos> - I don't want you to see him!<eos> Why can't you just tell Bay no?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - No, I don't.
Carolyn?<eos> Mr. Bynes, is everything all right?<eos> Well, Mrs. Bynes isn't picking up, I thought I'd check on her.<eos> So did her daughter.
My Matty secret wasn't the only one I was keeping.<eos> My mom and I were still harboring her secret that she wrote the letter, and I figured she should be the one to bust it out.<eos> Mom, do you want to tell him?<eos> Why not?<eos> Lacey, what the hell did you do?
I know.<eos> And who said having you around was a bad idea?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I don't know, Tucker.<eos> Who did?
It's all soft and furry.<eos> Look at me little furry Virginia.<eos> Oh, it's like a little squirrel's gone in there.<eos> Give it a stroke. I want it to become my friend.<eos> I don't...
Miss Fisher?<eos> That's me.<eos> I don't understand, Miss.<eos> I thought Jane's mother was dead.<eos> We all did, Dot.
Why?<eos> He pissed me off.<eos> Then I pissed him off.<eos> You know how these things go.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't mean to be melodramatic.<eos> I was getting ready to go back to Philadelphia for the week and I just wanted to be sure...<eos> Well, oily rags and all that.<eos> I found him in my garage.<eos> - Doing what?
Loui ?<eos> I'm going to bring Bavaria to bloom.<eos> I'm going to go this way to get my Bro ..<eos> Go<eos> How does a king?
Now finally tell you what!<eos> How many times have we errtert?<eos> Now get out!<eos> It's that simple!<eos> Yes, only do so on.
No.<eos> That just gives it more power.<eos> The less we make of it, the better.<eos> Let's just pretend like it never happened. Okay.<eos> Yeah, maybe it-- maybe it didn't.
Let me guess.<eos> You're here to ask how I'm doing?<eos> I'd ask.<eos> But you already know the answer to that question.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's using you to get her into the open.<eos> What if he's already onto Carla and he's--<eos> Waiting for us when we get there?<eos> I hope he is, Michael.<eos> I really, really do.
Did-did he say "Oops"?<eos> Dr. Bailey.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> - The man said "Oops."<eos> - I didn't.
As you were, Avery.<eos> Y... you-you don't want a little more suction, Avery?<eos> Dr. Bailey, while I'm always glad to hear your perspective, I'll instruct the resident.<eos> But your instructions result in oops.<eos> We don't oops in my O.R.
Well, has anyone talked to Charlie, ask him to take a second look?<eos> No. Charlie went home sick Tuesday, and I haven't been able to get in touch with him.<eos> Well, I saw Charlie Tuesday.<eos> He seemed fine.<eos> Did he, now?
That was awful!<eos> It rained the whole time.<eos> Well, staying indoors has its benefits.<eos> Those maids kept asking us if we needed turn-down service.<eos> - Strange we never did...
I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy.<eos> I was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.<eos> Well, it's not really a great time.<eos> Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.<eos> No, we don't!
And I am your brother. And all I'm trying to do is help.<eos> I know.<eos> But you need to back off.<eos> You want to see me, boss?<eos> Yes, I did.
I want a cart, a vendor, or a vague sense of danger, that the hot dog might be made of anything.<eos> Okay, well, I think I saw some cats lurking out behind the truck.<eos> Stop trying to make me feel better.<eos> All right, street meat, you wanna talk about what just happened?<eos> No, I don't.
She thinks Warhol's cool.<eos> You think, "A can of soup's a can of soup."<eos> You want to be the docent.<eos> Listen, if you guys think that's best, I'm happy --<eos> We don't.
Whatever you need.<eos> I'm sorry, what's your name?<eos> Jessica Holt.<eos> Do you know what you're saying, Jessica?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You can't do this. You can't...<eos> It's done, Walter.<eos> The final piece has been set into motion.<eos> I couldn't stop it now if I wanted to.<eos> And I don't.
- They'll be taken prisoner.<eos> The officer says you have beautiful eyes and asks if you're a Jew?<eos> If you were a Jew and knew Yiddish, the officer would have a job for you.<eos> So think hard if you know Yiddish or not?<eos> No, I don't.
And then I just kind of landed on this.<eos> Hey, Tuck.<eos> As the newest member of the Wheeler clan, any way I can talk you into taking my mom's car out to Jersey tomorrow to pick up the costumes?<eos> Oh, you know I don't really drive.<eos> Oh, I do!
Charly!<eos> You randy bitch!<eos> Today wishes may come true. Have you all made a wish list yet? As of today it's not only raining water, but also stars.<eos> - I don't want to listen to that crap.<eos> - Do it yourself.
Hello, darling.<eos> Hello, darling. Are you okay?<eos> Has something happened to you?<eos> No, we have it so nice.<eos> No, we do it well.
Where you going, Schmidt?<eos> Sorry.<eos> This way.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey. - How you doing, kid?
Who, like me, lost his mother.<eos> It is not fair of you to expose a child to your life... choices.<eos> You have to decide!<eos> Your desires or--<eos> No, I don't.
At dinner the other night, when we got called away, I should have sent adalind some flowers.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Hank, don't you see what's going on here?<eos> She's calling.<eos> Hey, baby, how you doing?
You indicated to Dr Hines that there were other deaths.<eos> Remember when we were kids?<eos> Sorry - if I could just explain... this is why I could never hurt you, and why it's important to me that you should understand that.<eos> There were so many times when I could have, if I'd wanted to, killed you.<eos> But I didn't.
Do you know what that means?<eos> It means she's planning to forgive you or she's desperately trying to find a way to forgive you.<eos> And it doesn't matter if it was just sex.<eos> She didn't want me to know, okay?<eos> And now I do, so don't.
I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it.<eos> Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.<eos> - We've got Kane by the balls. - We?<eos> Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.<eos> I did not.
All he'll want to do is follow Cody around.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I wanna be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
Every time I think I know exactly who you are you tell me something worse.<eos> Being with Hannah is worse...<eos> -...than being a killer?<eos> No.<eos> I don't...
You got pictures?<eos> Come on, I gotta restock my spank bank.<eos> - Angel, know about Dexter's girlfriend?<eos> - Hannah McKay?<eos> - How did you--?
We are all here because we care about you very much, and we feel like you are on the verge of losing everything.<eos> We know about the pills.<eos> And the flush.<eos> We know about the car crash.<eos> But no one else does.
The next day, I got another room, so I left Miss Blanchot's, but I forgot my perfume bottle in her bathroom.<eos> Tell me if I'm speaking too quickly for you.<eos> Since then, I tried to get it back, but I was told Miss Blanchot had left.<eos> I was a bit surprised, she would have told me.<eos> But she didn't, not a word about it.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> If you have to think about it, you have not felt it.<eos> And you're absolutely sure you'll find that someday?<eos> Of course.<eos> Everyone does eventually.
I have to get back.<eos> Just wanted to check on Carl.<eos> Rick, we can handle taking out the bodies.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - No, I do.
Well, the good news is, we don't have a copy of that memo.<eos> I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but the accusation here isn't that you have it, it's that you buried it, so we should probably move forward.<eos> To what?<eos> We need to put them on the defensive.<eos> - No, we don't.
Wendy came by the hospital today.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> We have to tell him the truth, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
Let's go to stupid sports camp.<eos> No.<eos> I'll go to macramé camp.<eos> - You need this more than me.<eos> - I really do, Malik. I really do.
- Together.<eos> - That was your plan?<eos> Claes wasn't getting any younger.<eos> Maybe in time, when he was tired of running after women who didn't understand him...<eos> The way I did.
- The painting is the real deal.<eos> As real as the love Alice and Ruben shared.<eos> He didn't sign it... not when he painted it.<eos> And Alice didn't dare have his name on it, in case her husband, Einar, ever found it.<eos> Which he did, seven years later.
I'm not worried, Gus.<eos> How long do you think this is going to last?<eos> Don't you think I'm any good?<eos> The business you're in.<eos> You don't, do you?
- Come on, it's 15 grand.<eos> - I don't know Magaddino.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I don't know him, Charlie.<eos> All right. Well, I do.
What?<eos> What?<eos> I hope you're not upsetting my prisoner.<eos> Where did you find him?<eos> We didn't.
- Stop it.<eos> Silence! Look, I know that things started out sketchy with me and Quinn, but I really like her, so please.<eos> Do you,<eos> Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby, swear to uphold this Broath?<eos> I do.
Truth ... they are doing a package on the Hawks' most illustrious package.<eos> Cameras or not, it's gonna be hot in the spotlight, and the pressure's officially on.<eos> So get out there, and don't forget who you're here to impress ... me!<eos> Cameras in camp ... we like this idea?<eos> Unfortunately, our G.M. does.
He's old-school.<eos> Would coach have told you to wine and dine Noelle if she were a man and not this gorgeous woman?<eos> She's gorgeous?<eos> Didn't notice.<eos> Well, none of my business if you did or didn't.
- So, what do we do?<eos> One answer. Elaborate heist?<eos> Elaborate heist?<eos> We'll need disguises.<eos> I do a great swami.
We'd walk into the park, call "next". And we'd sit and we'd wait.<eos> And we'd hoop, get up, go to another borough, get on the train, and that's what we did all day.<eos> Then go back home, go to sleep, get up, do it again.<eos> When we was young, I didn't have all that Atari or PlayStation.<eos> We did basketball in the rain.
You have to do this for me.<eos> I need a chance to redeem myself.<eos> So, go have sex with her.<eos> You don't need me there.<eos> Yes, I do.
But I know who did.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Tommy, Ashley?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
Get on your feet.<eos> You said I'd be out of here.<eos> You said the charge was bribe receiving.<eos> Yeah well, now it's murder in the second degree; will you get up?<eos> I-I didn't do it.
I'm not getting married.<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> You see, I can't read you.<eos> He wants a baby.<eos> Before, I didn't.
You both like the fantasy of a girl in distress?<eos> - How about I put you in a cab?<eos> - I take the subway.<eos> - Why do you think I need prot--<eos> - I don't.
Really?<eos> I drive like a gee--<eos> Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Bullshit you ever did donuts.
And when we're done, you're gonna admit to me what you did.<eos> Oh, I've done a lot of things, Harvey.<eos> Well, I want to know why you settled.<eos> You know damn well why I settled.<eos> No, I don't.
I spent years trying to get back to my boys.<eos> Years.<eos> I walked across the country. And then up and down the East coast.<eos> You'd think I could find one damn ship to take me home.<eos> But I never did.
I was wondering...<eos> Who said you're not the first one I called?<eos> Schwimmer's an asshole!<eos> I never said you were an asshole!<eos> No, I did not!
His, erm, crotchal area.<eos> I don't think that's what...<eos> Oh yes, it is.<eos> Are you guys seeing it too?<eos> I didn't at first.
You got two minutes.<eos> Tall men in your life-- I'd like a list.<eos> Amy was a good person, but if you're here because you think I had something to do with it...<eos> Dr. Mantlo said that you'd made a pass at her at a holiday party last year.<eos> Actually, no, I didn't.
The only thing Batman signifies is an aberrant psychotic force.<eos> The man's a danger to every citizen.<eos> - Hardly as dangerous as the criminals, is he?<eos> - Batman knows exactly what he's doing.<eos> His kind of fascist always does.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I got it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
The safe that the Nomads stole when they broke in, they gave Clay back all the legal shit.<eos> That's gonna prove Clay is a traitor and a murderer.<eos> Wendy came by the hospital;<eos> we have to tell him the truth, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
It has to be about you.<eos> Even when you're not there.<eos> You're the only one.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Do you?
- I didn't steal no wallet.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Do it!
Pardon the boardinghouse reach.<eos> Okay, buckle up.<eos> You like to drive fast.<eos> I like to drive, period.<eos> I did Paris-Dakar.
But none of you are.<eos> You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.<eos> Enjoy the rest of your evening.<eos> The principal wanted to see me?<eos> No... I did.
Wouldn't hold your breath, though.<eos> Yeah, about that. Sonya came by to see how I was doing.<eos> Whatever she said to you, it is a lie.<eos> Everyone thinks they know what happened between us.<eos> They don't.
- No one's called me that in a while, Speedy.<eos> Worst nickname ever.<eos> What, always chasing after me as a kid?<eos> I thought it fit pretty well.<eos> - Maybe it still does?
Where does a 16-year-old runaway get all that money?<eos> Jose Barilla, currently serving 17 life sentences for drug trafficking and murder.<eos> The money was electronically transferred out of his account.<eos> You did say this Root woman was good with computers.<eos> Yes, I did.
No, he was a good man.<eos> It was just a mistake.<eos> How long did he know Hanna Frey?<eos> Hanna?<eos> He didn't.
- What?<eos> Lev is asking for your number.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> You did just break up with Dan.<eos> Today. Just do it.
We know about the affair, Reggie.<eos> Can't imagine your wife would be too happy if she found out, so you made sure she didn't.<eos> What are you talking about, affair?<eos> Yeah, I knew Mandy.<eos> So did my wife.
His name is Daniel.<eos> The man you were supposed to marry.<eos> Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.<eos> Yes.<eos> He did.
Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And I'm...<eos> Regina.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Handled something Peter calls his "Executive Private Account""<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Secretary?<eos> What did Fowkes say your name was?<eos> He didn't.
- Where's your mom now?<eos> - He said she went on the bus.<eos> Is ... is that why you've been riding the bus?<eos> I just wanted to find her.<eos> And then I did.
Don't you have a fraternity to pass out in?<eos> Is there anything else you need for your procedure?<eos> Um, I think I'm supposed to have ice cream.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Actually, I don't...
What?<eos> It's evidence now.<eos> Now get your [Bleep] back to headquarters.<eos> Captain Connors is gonna need to interview you.<eos> Since when does the head of internal affairs do interviews?
I always return things I borrow.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> Maybe you lost it.<eos> You do lo things.
I got to take this.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You made it. Come on in.<eos> I got you an orange cranberry scone, but I got hungry.<eos> How you doing?
- Scott!<eos> - Dad, break his face!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We want blood!<eos> No, we don't!
- Oh! You got beer on her, man.<eos> Did I do that?<eos> Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your mom does your laundry?
Spoken like every man who's ever lived to the women he had no intention of proposing to her.<eos> Oh, no. I... I definitely want to marry her.<eos> She doesn't?<eos> No. She...<eos> - She doesn't.
Oh, no. I... I definitely want to marry her.<eos> She doesn't?<eos> No. She...<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> - She does,
She doesn't?<eos> No. She...<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> - She does,<eos> I do, just not at this moment.
Stop! - Good-bye, Belle.<eos> Yeah, that's him, all right.<eos> Do you remember turning a butcher into a pig?<eos> Can't say that I do.<eos> Why? Well, he does.
Oh, I think there's a very good possibility of that, yes.<eos> Okay, don't freak out.<eos> Oh, I love it when you start that way.<eos> You know how you're supposed to separate the whitwh and the colors?<eos> Well, I do.
Well, you are in luck, my friend.<eos> Because Lemon is not working tonight and I am.<eos> And there is a whole crew of lady beach volleyball players passing through town.<eos> Can you say, bump, set and...<eos> You do the spike.
Oh, I wish you'd let me talk to Mr Carson.<eos> I don't want to be a sick woman in his eyes for the next two months.<eos> Or a dying one, in the months to come after that.<eos> I know it'll be all right.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah.<eos> And I know I'm not a very religious man, but I did go to Sunday school, and I was taught that God sees everything.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It is.<eos> And he does.
Shall I tell you how I look at it?<eos> Every man or woman who marries into this house, every child born into it, has to put their gifts at the family's disposal.<eos> I'm a hard worker, and I've some knowledge of the land.<eos> Matthew knows the law and the nature of business.<eos> Which I do not.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry about your friend.<eos> Dr. Whitehead.<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> No one else did.
I mean, he and I were practically the same age.<eos> Didn't we celebrate your 40th Birthday for the 5th time last...<eos> Shut up Wood!<eos> So you guys found him this morning?<eos> Well, Reggie did.
Who is it?<eos> Is it someone you know?<eos> My mom.<eos> Your mother?<eos> She does that sometimes.
And we may be down in votes, but I know that this town will come to its senses, and we will win this thing.<eos> (Grunts)<eos> Sometimes I feel like you believe in me even more than I believe in myself.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you, Lemon Breeland.<eos> I really don't.
Here comes your Twitter ghost.<eos> T.K. says, "Does the Minefield want the king of pain to go boom on his candy ass again?"<eos> You tweeted that!<eos> Yeah, I know -- I just said I tweeted that!<eos> You did it!
- Is there any other way... - ( Scoffs )<eos> Don't you have to take tests?<eos> Yeah, I do, but it's not a problem.<eos> ( Scoffs ) Maybe I should just go.<eos> No, no, no. Don't, don't.
And we'll be nearby in case anything goes wrong.<eos> And we won't be seen.<eos> It'll just be our team, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing, Sloan?
Well, it's Halloween.<eos> Of course your parents have to work.<eos> Other parents don't.
And with all due respect, Detective, I have no knowledge of the whereabouts of the attacker.<eos> Okay, well, Father Ainsworth might.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> I don't know where he was sent to next.<eos> Yeah, of course you don't.
Very true. Very true.<eos> And it actually did feel good to have myself out there.<eos> You know, just trying.<eos> Just got to put yourself first sometimes, I guess.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Please don't tell them that I'm telling you this.<eos> I don't need any more bad blood with the Graysons. Don't worry.<eos> I'm very good with secrets.<eos> And as far as the Graysons go, they'll get what's coming to them.<eos> People like that always do.
Okay, embarrassing.<eos> That is my job, kiddo.<eos> So, who's this handsome fella?<eos> Yeah, he's a good boy!<eos> How you doing there?
They were everywhere.<eos> I was surrounded! Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you really think you could get away with this?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did, yeah.
Just because I didn't give your geriatric boyfriend a seat doesn't mean that you had to tell Sage to sabotage my show!<eos> Save it, Blair.<eos> You were so upset that I care more about Steven than your show that you had to destroy my relationship.<eos> I didn't tell her to take off the dress. You did.<eos> No, I didn't.
How the hell do you know Otto?<eos> He wore a wire for me before, okay?<eos> Can you...?<eos> This guy Otto-- you get your stuff off of him?<eos> All the dealers on campus do.
I didn't lose my family today.<eos> I protected it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother wanted me to choose between being a wolf and being a human.<eos> Granny did, too.
Oh, gosh.<eos> Now I got to go wipe this down.<eos> You know, I was going to wear this for my audition.<eos> And that's gotta go well.<eos> Yes, it does.
You've had your arms crossed for 13 of the 15 minutes that we've been here.<eos> It's a classic self-comforting posture, an attempt to neutralize the distress signals being sent by your limbic system.<eos> Of course, it is possible that your stress is subconscious and you really do believe that you're fine.<eos> But given that your eyes are doing that thing they do when you lie, I sincerely doubt that's the case. - I'm not lying.<eos> - Doing it again.
By the time I got to the party, Chuck was already gone.<eos> I didn't even see him.<eos> So you, uh, missed the outburst where he accused his father of trying to kill him?<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Do you?
When he gave his first order, Çağatay and Genghis Khan's sons probably gave him strange looks.<eos> Because this tactic, worked in steppes and deserts with a few cavalrymen.<eos> Not in woods or battlefields against knights.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> You don't.
I can't think of anything that would make me feel worse.<eos> Isn't that strange?<eos> We think the enemy is like us only when he's dead.<eos> You have no control over your mouth, Bekir, I swear.<eos> - As if you did.
It's too valuable.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I can get it back.<eos> You need me.<eos> No, I don't.
You know what's great about Lompoc?<eos> You get a little glimpse of the surf when you're sitting in the prison yard.<eos> I want to talk to Sonny.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I do.
The symbols in the vines are your map, which you obviously no longer need.<eos> When this mark is complete, it will contain the spell that we need to dig up Silas.<eos> And where did you say he was buried?<eos> Oh, I forgot.<eos> You didn't.
Well, I-I came here 'cause, um, I have another case for you.<eos> It is always work, work, work with you, Zalanski.<eos> Yeah, well, look, I was out walking, And, I saw this guy heading into his brownstone But he reeked of blood.<eos> Was he injured?<eos> No, he didn't
Trotting Ashley out, considering Salvador's penchant for exotic women.<eos> I would think he'd have better self-preservation instincts, seeing as his wife holds his fortune. Ah.<eos> Conrad.<eos> We need to discuss your son's future.<eos> No, we don't.
Look, guys, no sweat.<eos> You were just looking out for your friend.<eos> That makes you kings in my book.<eos> So, now, who wants Martinis?<eos> Me. I do.
Seeing you at work will change his mind, I'm sure.<eos> You think?<eos> I promise.<eos> My mom thinks so.<eos> - She does? - Yes.
The newspapers will ask,<eos> "Why risk enraging the Confederacy" "over the issue of slavery" "when they're here to make peace?"<eos> We'll lose every Democrat we've got, more than likely conservative Republicans will join them, and all our work, all our preparing the ground for the vote laid waste for naught.<eos> The Blaire promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people.<eos> Oh, the Blaire promise, do they?
You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed.<eos> I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself.<eos> Though I wanted to, Mary.<eos> I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault, with his coffin.<eos> And I still do.
You were following me.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> In the dance, you went from pataka... which means the forest.<eos> And then you did... samputa... which means something that is hidden.<eos> And then you did chatura.
India won't let their babies out.<eos> We could go Ethiopian?<eos> What do they have, like a menu?<eos> So I did some quick research.<eos> Of course you did.
He's hunting down criminals that all look the same... like he's got some sort of personal vendetta.<eos> But he's not protecting innocent people, Mr. Parker.<eos> Let's get some air, Peter.<eos> - Dad, we need to talk.<eos> - Yes, we do.
A pig's cell?<eos> It's much stronger than ours.<eos> You're insane!<eos> You know the application of transgenetic therepy... in humans is completely forbidden!<eos> Yes, I do.
Raping a 10 year old girl.<eos> But he denied it in court.<eos> Are they ringing any bells?<eos> DJ? 1989, I was high a lot.<eos> I don't much recall...
This is, as they say, your party.<eos> I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.<eos> So it's true then, sir?<eos> A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?<eos> Did.
That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?<eos> Yes.<eos> And here comes Alan Marsh.<eos> Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?<eos> - I don't.
Find another door!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> What the hell is going on, David?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> - How did we just do that?
What do you think?<eos> Is it shiitake?<eos> He can't understand you.<eos> STU:<eos> He just did.
The game-'s at fever pitch.<eos> In daylight, this looks a lot smaller.<eos> It looks kid-size. An average person can't fit in there.<eos> Of course an average person can fit in there.<eos> I do.
Can I get you something?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you about something.<eos> I already know what you're gonna ask, Miss Skeeter.<eos> Minny and Aibileen already did.
- The others?<eos> - I'd like to do so much. So many things need to be changed. I'd like...<eos> - So, you work.<eos> - Yes, but... no.<eos> What do you do?
This is actually a pretty damn good idea, dude.<eos> Just roll up your window.<eos> Please, I can't...<eos> DALE:<eos> Do the finger-flage.
That Zahira!<eos> That's right, with that Zahira!<eos> She scares me.<eos> She disturbes me.<eos> Yes, she does.
What do you have in mind?<eos> Maybe we could play a game.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you like games?<eos> I do now.
- Has it ever occurred to you that maybe it's because you don't have God in your life? - No.<eos> - Never?<eos> - Look, Joe, when I was a kid,<eos> I totally believed in God. But, you know, you grow up.<eos> Well, I did.
You can tell him yourself.<eos> I'll leave you.<eos> He's in shape these days.<eos> - I'll put up more flyers.<eos> - Well, do that.
No, because we neither the murder weapon or body.<eos> It may be Karin, too. We know that she threatened Elin.<eos> Who saw Jari come out of the woods?<eos> -We do not know. Damn!<eos> We do not even what Elin did up there.
The police will investigate, Fl will investigate.<eos> It'll go to court. Maybe he'll go to prison.<eos> You think?<eos> Probably not.<eos> These guys never do.
Nice, Turk.<eos> The fuck? Run, Turk.<eos> Run.<eos> - Freebo didn't deserve this.<eos> - None of us do.
Never.<eos> There's one room for the kids and another for us.<eos> So how come Mrs Vilanelle heard you spend the night with children and say: "Pyjama's on!"<eos> What is this? A bad joke?<eos> So what if I did?
- What are you gonna do now?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's for you to do something, not me.<eos> I don't have to tell you again that I love you, do I?<eos> You never did.
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?<eos> Hey!<eos> Was she so special to you?<eos> I never thought anyone could understand how much.<eos> But you do.
The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people, look it up.<eos> One man dies, another man makes money off his coffin.<eos> One country culls all their chickens, red meat goes into higher demand.<eos> I'm not the first person to make money off the fact that our immune system is a work in progress.<eos> The pharmaceutical industry do it every quarter.
No, it hasn't.<eos> But sometimes, in acute situations such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.<eos> Sam will step up.<eos> Oh, I know he will.<eos> But if he doesn't...
If you prefer.<eos> Go back to your architect.<eos> What a bad film!<eos> You didn't like it? Too bad.<eos> - You did?
You know, if you don't... if you don't like me, you should just say so.<eos> What?<eos> Otherwise, what's the point of me doing all this for you?<eos> Do you like someone else?<eos> - Do you? - Yes.
Oh! I don't understand this relationship, Emma.<eos> Hey, Emma.<eos> Doing this show, it feels like we've become like a little family, huh?<eos> You mean like you're my brother?<eos> No. N... no, I don't.
- Don't lie to me.<eos> I know who you are, Sam.<eos> I know what you do.<eos> What?<eos> You do?
Ben won't even talk about it.<eos> This is the worst time in the universe to talk.<eos> Can we do this later?<eos> You shoved my kid, Dean.<eos> How about we do this now?
You're worried about the test results, aren't you?<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I just, you know...<eos> I don't...
Well, it wouldn't be the same without you being here.<eos> I just wish I could freeze this moment in time forever.<eos> Me too.<eos> Unfortunately, the limo is here, so we should go.<eos> Oh, but before we do, a toast.
Permit me to introduce myself.<eos> I am... the Great Raymondo!<eos> I was once the most famous illusionist in the world, performing for pashas and potentates, Grand Dukes and Grande Dames...<eos> Who wants to hear an old man go on about bygone wonders?<eos> I do, I do!
They're next!<eos> Right now I'm gonna cut your damn head off!<eos> Drop the robot!<eos> I thought I told you,<eos> I do the cutting around here.
Well, congratulations.<eos> And I'm telling you I didn't do it.<eos> Now tell me why you're really here.<eos> I want a two-way race.<eos> I do, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Tell Kalinda why I quit my job.<eos> Oh, I don't think she wants to hear any of that, hon.<eos> Sure, she's a reporter.<eos> Of course she does.
Tell Kalinda why I quit my job.<eos> Oh, I don't think she wants to hear any of that, hon.<eos> Sure, she's a reporter.<eos> Of course she does.<eos> - Of course I do.
- Good.<eos> Okay, wait, wait.<eos> Look, we're not trying to pick your pockets.<eos> We just need to show the judge a hint of movement.<eos> - No, we don't.
That he was just coming to New York to explore his options.<eos> What a crock of gas.<eos> You fly across the country to explore your options? Please. I don't think so.<eos> Exactly! Please, I knew I had him the second he got off that plane.<eos> - Oh, did you, now?
He's back.<eos> Who is back?<eos> You know who.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, son.<eos> Yes, you do.
But I thought it was because of me.<eos> Because of us.<eos> I thought that I was bringing out a different side in you.<eos> But it was never because I wanted to be with her more.<eos> Because I don't.
It means that he's human.<eos> Okay, and you have a chance, if you want, to get to know the real him...<eos> the good and the bad.<eos> What if I don't want to?<eos> You do.
I wanna know his endgame before I kill him.<eos> But I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met.<eos> Okay, so tell me about this big witchy plan you've been cooking up.<eos> We don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to.<eos> No, we don't.
I know you love Stefan.<eos> And it will always be Stefan.<eos> But I love you.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.
Marc has something .. .. To tell me.<eos> - Alice searched in your phone?<eos> - This is because of my book.<eos> - Come, let's talk.<eos> - But we never did that.
- That's a lie.<eos> - We don't lie when we're alone.<eos> - Biggest lie ever.<eos> Nine out of ten lies occur six inches away from the bathroom mirror.<eos> We do most of our lying alone.
So contract it.<eos> Stop saying "suh-mores" unless you "can not."<eos> Guys!<eos> We need to stop fighting.<eos> No, we don't.
- Just don't do this.<eos> Kevin!<eos> Please don't do this! Come on.<eos> Get in the fucking car.<eos> Please, please don't do this.
- What did he say?<eos> - Nothing. Think he wants to be your boyfriend?<eos> We're going to write love letters to Jørgen and Einar.<eos> I don't think Einar wants to be my boyfriend.<eos> Sure he does.
I did not touch her.<eos> Was Claire shocked when you grabbed the knife, Zach, huh?<eos> Did she scream?<eos> Did you stand there and watch her bleed?<eos> Did you?
You know you want to go!<eos> Well, you know you do!<eos> Like a sex machine?<eos> Moving it?<eos> Doing it?
Well, you know you do!<eos> Like a sex machine?<eos> Moving it?<eos> Doing it?<eos> Doing it?
I got this.<eos> She is just my kind of psycho.<eos> I'm gonna get a ride with Ben and Karen.<eos> Traitor.<eos> Don't do that.
-So what happens next?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> We'll have to keep in touch.<eos> I don't know how much of a father you think you can be, but...<eos> No, neither do I.
Spread your thighs.<eos> - Go on, spread them.<eos> - No!<eos> I need to see inside your sex to paint you.<eos> Even to do your face.
But he's not really stupid.<eos> The village keep me all for a thick skull, fürjemanden who always wants to be right.<eos> What?<eos> Will you?<eos> Of course I do.
We said: "No gift",<eos> Why did you do it anyway?<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's OK, but now I'm ridiculous. What?<eos> People usually do it anyway.
Is it yarrow? That's it?<eos> I love that.<eos> It reminds me my childhood.<eos> Sorry, but I think we don't know you.<eos> Do you or not? - We don't.
It's a Kappa, a Kappa!<eos> Hey, I saw a Kappa!<eos> I said I saw a Kappa!<eos> A Kappa, everyone!<eos> I really did.
You've earned it. Hiring you to be her friend was the best money we've ever spent.<eos> Please, Mr. Hanover, I can't.<eos> Jo, I'm sending it right back to you.<eos> I'd give a bonus, if I gave them.<eos> Which I don't.
Of course I'm scared of bats.<eos> They have herpes or rabies.<eos> You know what we should do?<eos> Get a cat. Cats eat bats.<eos> That cats do not.
Really complicated...<eos> worse than algebra.<eos> What happened when you left the barn?<eos> We all wanna know.<eos> You already do...
Anyway, hanging in there.<eos> Glad you stopped by.<eos> Listen, I'm- - I'm sorry about all this.<eos> That guy-- he just came out of nowhere.<eos> Yeah, actually, he didn't.
So go ahead.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead.<eos> Put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.<eos> Do it!
Go ahead.<eos> If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead.<eos> Put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it.
Put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Do it.
Do it!<eos> Do it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.
Right.<eos> But,I mean,you... you'd be buying the house anyway?<eos> Right?<eos> Even if there was no "us"?<eos> Okay,what do you mean,"no us"?
But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up.<eos> man: I just phoned you.<eos> Jack: Yeah, I just got it, actually.<eos> I was about to phone you back.<eos> man: How you doing?
Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity, but this is my home.<eos> - Very glad you enjoyed the book.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I didn't much like your book.
She knows she's not supposed to use her cell phone in class.<eos> My real concern is what she's using it for.<eos> I know these types of web sites are out there, but a 12 year old looking at paparazzi photos of a dead body?<eos> - You see why I find that disturbing.<eos> - Actually, I don't.
She had seen her father waste away from the same disease.<eos> She always said she didn't want to die like that.<eos> And before you go digging him up, uh, he died in a hospital surrounded by doctors almost five years ago.<eos> Who actually found Nikki?<eos> I did.
Then I thought about it, there must be an April Fool But we have already mid-July.<eos> Geddit?<eos> This is your comeback.<eos> Are you happy at all?<eos> Why does the just me?
Did you do something to Tom's pants?<eos> Lynette.<eos> It's just a thing I do whenever I find out he slept with one of my friends.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have told you about us.<eos> But you did!
I'm calling the NBA.<eos> That was awesome!<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Three in a row!<eos> I certainly did.
This is Josh. - He's new.<eos> - Welcome to Terra Nova.<eos> I'm Tasha.<eos> That's Hunter.<eos> How you doing, fresh?
Chris...<eos> Stop it!<eos> - Shut up, lady!<eos> Do you know what you're good for, Peg?<eos> Do you?
There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!<eos> "Oh, wait, here comes the next plane from Newcastle.<eos> Sorry, you do realise I'm not playing along with the joke.<eos> I do genuinely have a Greek waiter boyfriend called Nicos.<eos> No, of course you do. Brilliant. Nicos.
No surprise there, then.<eos> -What? What? So he's just picking up where he left off?<eos> -What?<eos> -Oh, come on, you know.<eos> -No, I don't.
Maybe he didn't like him.<eos> If he didn't like him, he knew him.<eos> So do you know who shot you?<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Well, do you?
Someone should report to home-world command, explain what's been going on.<eos> Well, you go ahead, and when you're back, you can explain it to me.<eos> They must think we're all dead.<eos> It didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Deniz, go out...<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I love you!<eos> -But, I don't love you!<eos> -You do!
What do you think you're doing?<eos> I love you!<eos> -But, I don't love you!<eos> -You do!<eos> -l don't!
I love you!<eos> -But, I don't love you!<eos> -You do!<eos> -l don't!<eos> -You do!
Do you think Malcolm has to watch a lot of mad cunts, cut chunks of flesh out of their own body? Get a lot of that, does he?<eos> No, wait, how about if he had some junkie, who's smacked out of his head, who's trying to bite a fucking chunk out of Malcolm's throat?<eos> And on top of that he's got some spineless governor slap him under investigation.<eos> Do you think Malcolm would like a nice fucking day at my office?<eos> Do ya?
Candy cane wants to play.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Tickets are on top of the fridge.<eos> Flight's at 9:30.<eos> I do.
She lied to her mom about her costume... And her Fabrizio Bianchis.<eos> There's no way she could afford these.<eos> We're looking at 2gs easy.<eos> How do you even know that?<eos> How do you not?
Thanks for meeting me, Nathan. Yeah.<eos> Gwen tells me you, uh, had all the e-mail accounts checked.<eos> Nothing was sent to the record yesterday. I checked twice.<eos> How about Gwen, Jamie? You check their accounts?<eos> Um, I-I didn't.
That's the little boy that's missing. Where did you see him?<eos> On Grand.<eos> I just passed him, like, five minutes ago.<eos> Well, we have to call that in, Kev.<eos> Yes, we do!
You and Kate and Scott... you guys all want me to have a picture up here, but I didn't want to tell you...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> I don't have one single photograph.<eos> I don't have a truck.<eos> I don't...
I don't have one single photograph.<eos> I don't have a truck.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have a Boris bear.<eos> I don't...
The paintings she painted, you know?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I see.<eos> She did not want to be a painter.<eos> She did it like that.
I'm a dirty whore!<eos> Good.<eos> What's this...?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't do that!
Oh, God...<eos> - Who's doing this?<eos> - I told you, but you didn't listen.<eos> Come on.<eos> They never do.
So what's cooking?<eos> This is the last of the dry rabbit that we're treated for... and we got two more of these mystery suckers left.<eos> Guys.<eos> We need to find more food.<eos> No we don't.
Yeah.<eos> Look, I feel like I really rushed you into this whole thing, so if you're feeling any doubts, I mean any doubts at all, like the tiniest, smallest of doubts, like, even if you hear me say the word "doubt,"<eos> you don't have to do this.<eos> Todd, does this look like doubt to you?<eos> I don't...
What is trying to do?<eos> ... Slowed ... Do not do it<eos> Let off<eos> Let it<eos> Please do not do it
I... don't know.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> That's fine.<eos> Did he see something or not?<eos> - No, he didn't.
Yeah.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You smirked.<eos> Do I look like I'm smirking?<eos> You did.
That was the start of the journey of him being sober.<eos> The evidence proves the fact, 'cause he hasn't drunk or abused for over five years now.<eos> I'm clean, I'm sober.<eos> I don't smoke. I don't do drugs.<eos> I don't do alcohol any more.
I didn't want it back so soon.<eos> I didn't want it back ever.<eos> Do you remember the last time we sat together?<eos> Very well.<eos> I did my time.
Uh, Sergeant Batista-- at the police station-- where we work.<eos> We, being the people that protect you in case something bad happens.<eos> Sergeant Batista's daughter went here and he recommended the school.<eos> I remember Angel.<eos> His daughter did very well here.
Bet ballistics finds a match.<eos> It's nice to see you're recovering, bud.<eos> Doctor says you'll be out of the wheelchair in the next couple days.<eos> It builds something.<eos> What does?
- Hello. Welcome. How lovely.<eos> No problem...<eos> - I know her.<eos> I know her.<eos> - Everyone does.
I can't.<eos> Because of Shane?<eos> Was it that obvious?<eos> No, no, I don't think anyone knew.<eos> I didn't, not for sure.
He told me.<eos> No, Rick's gonna work something out with your dad.<eos> - Okay? I had to tell them.<eos> - You did not.<eos> No, I did.
The point is, I don't have troubles.<eos> You know how I managed that?<eos> By staying a million miles away from my brother Rory.<eos> And for the millionth time, I don't know where he is.<eos> Well, maybe your old man does.
They're waiting for me.<eos> I must go to that school.<eos> Dominik!<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> You don't.
Well, here's the thing.<eos> I-I know I said I was going to buy advertising...<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I told Rose about how well you're doing for me, and now she wants in.<eos> She does?
Come on, come on, pick up, pick up.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Lip and Ian have just been arrested driving a stolen car.<eos> Did they get it from you?<eos> Did they?
You'd have to go back to your apartment and pack, say goodbye to your mother.<eos> The last guy got shot.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> Of course I don't.
The wife snuck him a cheeseburger and fries before surgery.<eos> So this thing with Callie...<eos> I mean, you know it's a bad idea, right?<eos> You don't want to be Callie's baby's godmother.<eos> - I don't?
- Oh, so she's unconscious now? - I don't know. I warned you!<eos> Gwen!<eos> Can you hear me? - It's back.<eos> - Are you all right? - Oh no. - Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this, Gwen?
I must catch him before I go.<eos> So Lady Sybil got off all right in the end.<eos> I'm afraid we have to admit she knows what she wants.<eos> Yes.<eos> She certainly does.
Because you're insecure, so you overcompensate and come across as...<eos> As some kind of snob or...<eos> Arrogant. I get it, Anka. Ja, exactly.<eos> You know, Archer, I think you and I are a lot alike.<eos> I don't do that.
I'll put some music on.<eos> What is it?<eos> A group from my youth.<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Only natural. No one does.
Too proud and honorable?<eos> This is a war!<eos> I'll go ahead with my daughters.<eos> Get them ready.<eos> Do it yourself.
- No, I didn't get fired.<eos> I know that's disappointing to you.<eos> My trial is about to disappear.<eos> You really want to act like I'm the bad guy here?<eos> - No, I don't.
The Sforza armies are at your service.<eos> May the union between our families bear every fruit.<eos> Please, God.<eos> Most worthy Lord, do you agree to take the illustrious Lucrezia Borgia, here present, to be your lawful spouse?<eos> I do.
Most worthy Lord, do you agree to take the illustrious Lucrezia Borgia, here present, to be your lawful spouse?<eos> I do.<eos> Most illustrious Lady,<eos> do you agree to take the most noble Lord Giovanni Sforza, here present, to be your lawful spouse?<eos> I do.
Only to meet his General, surely? Not back to France?<eos> But he must go back one day, and I can't stop thinking about what I'd do if anything happened to him.<eos> I know he'll be all right.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of us do.
You dead?<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Should I put him out of his misery?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you, though.
Krieger?<eos> And the damn thing is spreading!<eos> To every computer in the office!<eos> Do you think this is funny?<eos> ! Do you not?
What's the story?<eos> Fran the man's misses is after topping herself.<eos> Didyouhearme?<eos> Yeah. So he's going to be coming out of whatever hole he was hiding in.<eos> What did she do?
You have no right.<eos> Who do you think you are?" Stuff like that.<eos> It kinda sounded like he was her boyfriend. So that was Amber's dad.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about a boyfriend.<eos> Neither did any of the other girls.
What's that prove?<eos> I'll tell you what it proves.<eos> It proves everything that Margaret is saying-- that you wanted to be with her and you wanted to have Lance's money, too.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> Do you?
-No, it is not corked.<eos> It's from a box, OK?<eos> I think I know what you need, Bente.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yes, I do.
- the A stands for awesome.<eos> - Did you get a receipt?<eos> Of course, I did.<eos> Obviously...<eos> I did that.
You saved my life.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I want to be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
They were gonna take me away.<eos> We need to get you some help. I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> We know what happened here.<eos> No, you don't.
3, 4, 5... 6, 7, 8, 9 Ten!<eos> "Kaneko Loans"<eos> Sumida!<eos> You have the money?<eos> Well, do you?
We need to start your treatment before it's too late.<eos> No.<eos> You're either suicidal or you know we're wrong.<eos> And the only way you could know for sure what wasn't killing her is if you knew what was.<eos> And you do, don't you?
Perhaps even later.<eos> But even if we can't capture Rhodes right away it would be good if we start stirring things up from the inside.<eos> If you can't beat them, frustrate them?<eos> I am not saying that.<eos> Aristotle does.
And plenty of money.<eos> Then I want to go to the baker... in Kalverstraat... for some currant bread.<eos> I want to go tomorrow... in Amsterdam.<eos> Tomorrow...<eos> We all do, Oene.
You never photograph people?<eos> Hardly ever.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I worked all day.<eos> What do you do?
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means, if we still had our savings, my being laid off wouldn't be such a big deal.<eos> No, we decided on that together.<eos> We both wanted that wedding.<eos> No, we didn't.
Jimmy went up against the Kaiser for two years.<eos> Oh, that's a rough patch of road.<eos> That was only war.<eos> This is Atlantic City.<eos> Well done, boy.
Oh, that's a rough patch of road.<eos> That was only war.<eos> This is Atlantic City.<eos> Well done, boy.<eos> Well done.
Then you're fired.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - No no, didn't I tell you in your office?<eos> Nobody fucks with Dice.<eos> Dice does the fucking.
He looks at the clock and things like that.<eos> There.<eos> He sees something or someone and goes out of the picture.<eos> - When does he come back?<eos> - He doesn't.
-Actually no, James.<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> Did you see my wife this morning?<eos> Oh, I didn't work this morning.<eos> Uh, David did.
-without giving us a dime...<eos> -You're fucking with me, right?<eos> No.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> We do the fucking.
-You're fucking with me, right?<eos> No.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> We do the fucking.<eos> Me and you, Drama, we do the fucking.
Me and you, Drama, we do the fucking.<eos> -Let's talk to our people.<eos> -You know what?<eos> First we talk and then we walk.<eos> Drama, we do the fucking!
Maybe even today after school?<eos> We could take Tessa to all of Dalia's favorite shops.<eos> Oh, she will love it.<eos> And she'll love Dalia.<eos> Everybody does.
I thought it might tell me where he lived or worked.<eos> Yeah, I tried.<eos> I tried blowing it up, but it just got all blurry.<eos> You don't know how to enlarge the image and, like, sharpen it, do you?<eos> You do?
Yeah. But you see... honestly... I think Labradors represent moviegoers pretty well.<eos> It's pretty big, yet short at the same time.<eos> You see?<eos> - I could have said a poodle.<eos> - But you didn't.
Not really.<eos> Look, look, look, I know.<eos> Just, just get behind Clay on this cartel, man.<eos> He wants you there.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I am married.<eos> Hey... It's only a cover.<eos> Be nice to give her some variety.<eos> Unless -- Guys, guys, unless, you know, you need permission.<eos> I don't -
Louis knows what?<eos> My dirty little secret.<eos> You're Canadian?<eos> He knows that I didn't go to Harvard.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Get up.<eos> Now!<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Do it!
Only because she writes about people like you.<eos> Think about it.<eos> If you and your friends are the main reason people care about Gossip Girl, and starting tomorrow, everyone can read about you straight from the source, that would make "Gossip Girl" irrelevant, wouldn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
There's a guy I want you to meet.<eos> Okay, I'm giving you cash right now.<eos> He's divorced, he has a daughter Nicky's age, looks like the guy on Mad Men.<eos> Ooh, poor girl.<eos> No, he does.
What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just got to lock down a truck for the next shipment.<eos> You got to do it now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Homecoming's right around the corner.<eos> Well, then maybe I'll ask Mikael when we wake him.<eos> Heh. You're bluffing.<eos> You don't know where he is.<eos> No one does.
Ah, thank you.<eos> Yep.<eos> Where's Bobby?<eos> - He take off? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Sam, how you doing?
"If." A big "if."<eos> Why do I bring up the past?<eos> To see if he feels like dog food about it.<eos> People want to be judged.<eos> They really do.
Well, yeah.<eos> Seeing as they were fresh out of... "thanks for saving me from liver-eating surgeon" cards at the store.<eos> Oh, that. Just doing my job, which nobody pays me for.<eos> Right.<eos> How you doing, Bobby?
Make an example of me to deter other criminals.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Take her in.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Yep, did the crime, doing the time.
You did this without even talking to me.<eos> Well, you wouldn't have agreed.<eos> Damn right.<eos> We need Garland back.<eos> No, we don't.
It is illogical.<eos> - I bet.<eos> - What does this mean?<eos> What is an agent Linko the service of SD.<eos> And here, what else does?
Because you want to think so.<eos> Anna, you must prepare for the worst.<eos> I'm not saying it will happen, but you must prepare for it.<eos> I know it could happen.<eos> I do.
I'm only grateful his mother went first.<eos> She couldn't have borne it.<eos> No, but she would have had to face it, wouldn't she? Like you.<eos> We all have to face the truth, don't we?<eos> We do, lass.
That he wanted to see me.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> I texted him and I told him I wasn't interested.<eos> We've got to tell him.<eos> No, we don't.
And what did you do?<eos> I texted him and I told him I wasn't interested.<eos> We've got to tell him.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant for any of this to...<eos> I know what you wanted to do for me.<eos> - But...<eos> - I do.
I didn't know she was on the island.<eos> Who'd have thought?<eos> He always seemed like such a nice man.<eos> Mm.<eos> He did, didn't he?
Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Oh, Leonard, good. There you are.<eos> I need you to check my head for chair lice.<eos> I did it last night, I'm not doing it again. Just his head, right? I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Yes, I did.
Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think<eos> (plays glissando)<eos> I'm sorry, Mommy.<eos> Don't be mad at me.<eos> Don't do that!
He buy the man a drink first, that's what I hear.<eos> He buy the man a drink, take him out and goes savage as a meat axe on him, you hear me?<eos> He didn't kill Johnson.<eos> They was gonna hang him.<eos> They didn't.
You may want to close your mouth.<eos> Meg, what's wrong?<eos> Eli's father, Ezekiel, said that I can't see him anymore!<eos> He said I was trying to corrupt his son!<eos> He did, did he?
Or three.<eos> All right, swanky or hole-in-the-wall?<eos> I don't like the word "hole" anymore.<eos> Right.<eos> But I do like a good dive.
You'll get through it.<eos> All you got to worry about is when you run out of booze and you run out of company<eos> and the only person left to judge you is your...<eos> You don't know me, James.<eos> You never did.
If you're into it, send a dick pic back.<eos> I'm gonna have to sleep on this one.<eos> Moran?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't!
Sons don't kill themselves.<eos> Club's gonna vote him out.<eos> No one's gonna trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> But you do?
Yes, do it.<eos> Finish the mission.<eos> - Finish the mission.<eos> - Shut up. Finish the mission!<eos> Do it!
♪ When they speaking my name ♪<eos> - Oh, Ohh... yeahh! - No.<eos> Shit!<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Actually, we don't.
- Huh? Huh?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> The badge says to serve and protect!<eos> No, it doesn't.
Oh, nothing.<eos> I'm, uh, just looking.<eos> An espresso machine would be nice.<eos> Oh, hey. The release went well?<eos> It did.
So just try to get some rest, okay?<eos> Oh, well, I'm gonna stay the night and make sure, uh, he's got some company.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> I-I-I don't need the rest.<eos> A-and I do?
Hm. And the barroom debate was dead.<eos> You guys are idiots!<eos> Okay, not completely dead. You are seriously telling me you don't want to open that envelope and find out if you're having a boy or a girl?<eos> Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us this in case we wanted to know.<eos> But we don't.
- No, I don't want to.<eos> Come on. It's near here.<eos> It doesn't take much time.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Please don't.
- Well, who told you you didn't get this?<eos> - The hiring committee.<eos> They called.<eos> Well, there must be some sort of mistake, because I haven't decided yet.<eos> No, they did.
And whose fault was that?<eos> Yours.<eos> Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore.<eos> We have to have a different relationship.<eos> No, we don't.
"Where the heck did that come from?"<eos> "Maybe I shouldn't have eaten" "that pepperoni pizza before bed."<eos> Or maybe you say to yourself,<eos> "I feel so guilty about what I did."<eos> I-I-I don't...
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't live like this.<eos> You'll regret it.<eos> I wish they weren't hurt...<eos> I really do...
Well, at least he doesn't walk up to strange women in bars and tell them they're under arrest for disturbing the pants.<eos> Why are you so interested in my love life all of a sudden?<eos> I just think the right woman is out there for you, Carl, but she's not hanging from a pole or lifting her shirt at a bears game.<eos> Hey, your bachelor days may be dead and buried, but don't grab me with your zombie hand and drag me into your sad-ass grave.<eos> Hey, Molly, how you doing, cutie? Hey, Carl.
All I'm saying is, you still got a lot to offer.<eos> I am good with people.<eos> You do have a gift.<eos> Hey, do you need any help around the police station? No!<eos> We do not.
Dad, can you take the boys out for a while?<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> Thanks for spending so much time with us, Dad.<eos> Who wants to go the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?<eos> I do, I do!
And, Alicia, uh, let's talk when you get back.<eos> O-Okay.<eos> Well, I do hope you consider moving back to the neighborhood.<eos> I'd love to, but you know civil servant pay.<eos> Oh, my goodness, I do.
- Yes.<eos> So, what did you tell them?<eos> I said, my secretary disappeared in a perverted Jane Austen world.<eos> Sure, you said that.<eos> You did?
Heyyy.<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - It's not the first time I drive people here.<eos> You won't come in there with this bottle.<eos> But I do.
What are you doing here?<eos> I want my child.<eos> Sita chose to raise him with me!<eos> Sita didn't choose!<eos> Her father did!
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?<eos> Now he fucking owns us.<eos> I got a tongue like... Like a towel. Want a beer?<eos> Do I want a beer?<eos> No, I do not.
Join her? What's she going to do?<eos> Where you going to go?<eos> We can find them.<eos> He knows where they are.<eos> No, I don't.
- It's nice of you to have come.<eos> - I came to ask the duchess if the Princess of Guermantes had truly invited me.<eos> It's too late!<eos> We no longer wish to get involved in their guest list. I don't even know if we shall attend.<eos> Do me a favor: not a word to Oriane on this subject, please.
What's going on, Lisa?<eos> Because maybe the bus driver is completely devastated as it is, and I'm just gonna be this rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience.<eos> What does your being rich have to do with anything?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
- Rach, we're back here. - A bit short.<eos> Do you wanna sit down?<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I thought that we were having dinner alone, Darce.<eos> - Right. - So did I.
"so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor<eos> "to human missions.<eos> "Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable,<eos> "and Laika had always been intended to die."<eos> But she didn't, did she?
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.<eos> -Will you be surprised?<eos> -Not if you tell me.<eos> But now you've brought it up, you have to.<eos> -No, we don't.
Great!<eos> Saved another life?<eos> Asshole!<eos> Are you crazy? You want to die?<eos> How do we do this?
Where are you two going?<eos> What, nobody around here believes in comebacks?<eos> Winn, I owe you something.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I never did.
I got cables. I don't need the cables.<eos> I can put a trickle charger on it, though, for you.<eos> I mean, if you got the coin.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, I do.
What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?<eos> - Leni. - I thought you'd left.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.<eos> How do you do?
Did yours break your heart?<eos> From what I remember.<eos> Women always win in the end.<eos> They forget us more easily.<eos> Mine certainly did that.
Well, you know, I asked him to do a piece on Trump.<eos> And he actually picked up my Diet Coke and hurled it across the room.<eos> - Wow, he picked it up.<eos> - Just missed me.<eos> He did.
I'm too scared to watch.<eos> You'll soon be doing this yourself.<eos> I'd like to see our old house before I die.<eos> Why don't you go see it?<eos> Why don't you?
'Kill time.' - How did you get so wet?<eos> 'Kill time.' I want to 'kill time.'<eos> - What?<eos> Abdul Workshop asked me to go home and 'kill time.'<eos> How do I do that?
Or when Hindus in India cut our women and children to pieces with their swords.<eos> That's when my blood boils.<eos> Doesn't your blood boil?<eos> Answer me. Doesn't your blood boil?<eos> - It does. It does.

Who taught you to fight?<eos> - It's a gift from God.<eos> - Sure, God.<eos> Want to work?<eos> - Doing what?
You, if we had sex.<eos> Okay, then who's the second?<eos> A guy I met at this gallery thing.<eos> You slept with him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah. I was always good at making things, so...<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Beth, I made you that bed. Don't you remember?<eos> It was why we were going to buy the mattress to begin with.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's actually a pretty fun party.<eos> Man, I can't!<eos> All right. I got to go.<eos> We wanna hear AC/DC!<eos> Don't, okay?
I know, Matthew.<eos> I know this wasn't your fault.<eos> You tried to help me.<eos> I did.<eos> I really really did.
Uhh...<eos> Of course!<eos> I like Dorothee.<eos> But if Amber really wants me, then ... yeah.<eos> Yeah, she does!
Baseball bat.<eos> Which is very good for hitting knees and stomachs.<eos> It's also good for hitting balls.<eos> Know what else we do? We don't do them individually.<eos> We do them all together.
That didn't last long, less than a year.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> You can cry if you want.<eos> The thing is I don't cry.<eos> - You don't?
- One more heal.<eos> - It's not happening. No.<eos> I'm sorry. It doesn't always happen.<eos> Doesn't always work. - Doesn't always work.<eos> It doesn't...
You make that much running card games?<eos> Cards, hijacking.<eos> He's a fucking dope peddler, too.<eos> Did six months for pushing heroin a couple years back.<eos> But he only did six months?
- We don't wanna miss the movie.<eos> - How about no movie?<eos> How about I am taking you to dinner in the city?<eos> - We don't have to do that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Let's just get this done.<eos> - Get what done?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know what we want.<eos> - We don't actually. We really don't.
- Ow. Shit!<eos> Skinny Faddeev, The boss of the Russian mob, Los Angeles.<eos> - Don't be an asshole.<eos> - We know who Faddeev is.<eos> Of course you do.
All right, but check the roofs, boys.<eos> There could still be an ambush.<eos> Careful, careful with that.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Easy does it.
She was obsessed with the things.<eos> Studied them, painted them, took courses on them, and then one day, poof.<eos> No more dragonflies.<eos> Yeah, I didn't even know she liked dragonflies.<eos> Well, she doesn't, Sam.
Tell me, Hadil, do you want to leave the school, marry your cousin and move to Egypt?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> Look, she is shy.<eos> What do you say, Hadil?<eos> No, I don't, Mama Hind.
No, Mr. Feder said that I must study for the big final<eos> - What final?<eos> - You tell me! He just keeps handing me books<eos> did you pack the adapters for Italy?<eos> Yes, I did In L.A.
I don't know.<eos> So why to the vet?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm supposed to drive him there.<eos> So why don't you?
I might need a day or so.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look.<eos> Hey, who are you?<eos> What you doing here?
I had them when I was knee-high.<eos> Oh, she had a line at her table.<eos> She said she's gonna make you a batch for when you're out of there.<eos> - She said that?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
It's either me or Santa.<eos> I suggest Santa.<eos> It's Piiparinen.<eos> Pietari, do you read?<eos> I do.
Tommaso, come here!<eos> No, here.<eos> - Who's out there? - Nobody.<eos> - People know what happened?<eos> - No, they don't.
Listen...<eos> I want to ask you something, something personal.<eos> Tommaso has told me that you're very close friends.<eos> Did he tell you about Antonio, about what happened?<eos> - Yes, he did.
You set us up.<eos> He led us into that death camp, then hid and waited for that thing to strike.<eos> We were bait.<eos> I needed to know who we were up against.<eos> Now I do.
Come on. Do it.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it now.
I bought myself a bottle of champagne.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you finish it?<eos> Yeah, I did. Huh.
- Leena speaking.<eos> - Hello, Leena...<eos> It's me, your mother.<eos> - Do you give up?<eos> - Do you?
And neither will I, as long as you let me pursue this.<eos> So now you're blackmailing me?<eos> You forced my hand, now I'm forcing yours.<eos> You don't want to be doing this, Bauer.<eos> No, I don't.
I think you'll have to stay at my place.<eos> Do you have a guest room?<eos> We can work that out.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> Yeah, I did.
It is not the time, little flower. Give me some more of yourself. Give me some more of your life.<eos> Wait.<eos> In love stories, there isn't just love.<eos> Sometimes there is not a single "I love you"<eos> Yet, we do love.each other.
We will make sure that does not happen again '. But we...<eos> - No, I want to leave.<eos> - Come on, Beth, do not overdo.<eos> What's up '?<eos> What do we do?
Just a businessman.<eos> Sounds good. 'cause I'm looking to do some business.<eos> I'm looking for a crew.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I did some driving up north -- amateurs.
I found out the number to this phone.<eos> - How?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> I figured it out and you didn't.<eos> Because I didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's good that you and I don't know - if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.<eos> Yeah, that's a good point.<eos> OK, so what... what do we...
I feel sorry for you, mate.<eos> You think you're happy.<eos> You think you got it all.<eos> This... your life.<eos> But you don't.
My time is over.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is your time over?<eos> It has to be you, Jacob.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Where are we, dad?<eos> that you all made together so that you could find one another.<eos> The most important part of your life was the time that you spent with these people.<eos> That's why all of you are here.<eos> Nobody does it alone, Jack.
And so are you, and so is Hurley.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who d hen who does?
- Time to be better.<eos> - Starting with?<eos> How do you think people would react If they knew that terror mom's house hadn't been searched Because of bureaucratic red tape?<eos> - I don't think they'd be very happy.<eos> - I don't either.
I won't let you do this.<eos> Sweetie, please.<eos> Use your gift.<eos> -l don't know how.<eos> -Yes, you do.
Second there's something you need to see.<eos> You want me to stay here?<eos> I feel weird leaving you all alone.<eos> I'm a vampire, Sookie. I don't need- l don't need a babysitter.<eos> -Of course you don't.
Son of a bitch.<eos> - If this don't check out...<eos> - What are you gonna do? You gonna kill me?<eos> Find him, Carlos.<eos> Do it fast. Do it alone.
I don't know, I just...<eos> I have this terrible pain.<eos> The truth is, no one knows who survived that tragic plane crash...<eos> Tom, I think there's something wrong with the babies.<eos> ...or more importantly, who didn't.
So you think your husband describes you as a bitch?<eos> Doesn't he?<eos> What Tom says in this room is private.<eos> Which means "yes."<eos> Well, obviously it does to you.
I mean, how could it not be?<eos> He's abnormal.<eos> I mean, sometimes when I'm alone, I get this feeling in my gut that he's watching me.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Carole has just left!<eos> What do I do? Christ, I don't know!<eos> I rush into the kitchen.<eos> I go to the fridge.<eos> And what do I do?
He blamed his dad for king his mom.<eos> - And Carson wanted him dead.<eos> - Not at first.<eos> But Rachel worked on him.<eos> And in the end he did.

There wasn't any mom.<eos> I remember.<eos> Mom spoke German.<eos> - I remember, too.<eos> No, Mom didn't.
You be at that airstrip in four hours. I'll figure something out.<eos> Okay. Check the desk.<eos> Look for work schedules call logs, anything that might have Hank's name on it.<eos> How do we know they haven't destroyed everything that has his name on it?<eos> We don't.

So,today,when you're tempted to blurt out how you're a mom now,you can read that instead.<eos> What,uh,wh-what is it?<eos> She wants me to lie and say that I was never pregnant in high school.<eos> People want the truth.<eos> No,no,they don't.
Oh,an-and the bong and the sheep,the cab,the driving.<eos> You're actually trying not to get approved.<eos> Admit it,you're in over your head.<eos> You don't want to be a parent.You don't want a kid,admit it.<eos> Like you do?
- What the hell was that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Gemma's a fugitive.<eos> We got to call it in.<eos> No, we don't.
You had something to say and you said it.<eos> Right.<eos> I...<eos> This town needs Charming PD.<eos> Yes, it does.
Is Nate taking all this stuff?<eos> No.<eos> Gemma wanted to pack up all the sentimental objects and valuables, put them in storage.<eos> The rest goes to the church.<eos> You doing okay?

Because he can be very persuasive and you two have bonded lately.<eos> That doesn't mean I trust him.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everything he's done.<eos> I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.<eos> Then don't.
Oh.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Are you gonna tell my parents?<eos> What, that we were stupid enough to fall for your little prank?<eos> Not if you don't.
No one's ever done anything like this for me before.<eos> You're gonna be the belle of the ball, Miss Luli.<eos> - What are you wearing?<eos> - Something I made myself.<eos> - You do that?
Meaning what?<eos> Meaning...<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> It means you're just special, I guess.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Everybody says it was the two of us shooting at Bory.<eos> What if I confirm it.<eos> You ain't gonna survive the can, man.<eos> -So start talking.<eos> -I didn't do anyone.
You were pale.<eos> Apparently, I had passed out from dehydration, and when I came to, there was Jackie...<eos> sitting there like an angel.<eos> I thought I'd never see her again.<eos> When I did...
- Yup. And then I freak, 'cause I, I realize how beautiful she is.<eos> - It still gives me goosebumps. - Yeah.<eos> We were born in the same town, Silverton, Oregon - less than 10,000 people - within a week of each other.<eos> We travelled nearly a million miles to find one another.<eos> And we did.
I swerved to avoid him.<eos> I wrapped my car around a telephone pole.<eos> Technically, it was my fault.<eos> And your fiancée, she- she died in the accident?<eos> We both did.
Please.<eos> Stop doing this.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Please, don't- don't do this.
How come you didn't tell me 'bout this gun?<eos> Like I told ya...<eos> Like I told ya...<eos> I'd have to kill any man who took my guns from me!<eos> So he did.
You have a baby upstairs.<eos> And I almost killed her.<eos> You can't force me to have this surgery, can you?<eos> I think we'd all like you to want it.<eos> Well, I don't.
What do you think?<eos> Well, I say if you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly.<eos> But this, my friends, is a Kodiak.<eos> Bo thinks I ripped him off.<eos> Didn't you?
Okay, everyone, time to pull two lucky names... Wait, Lux, please, Lux, wait.<eos> I do. I understand.<eos> No, no!<eos> I do understand.<eos> No, you don't.
It was for Tasha.<eos> No, this is for you.<eos> Don't act like this isn't what you wanted this whole time.<eos> To be with my kid?<eos> Yeah, Cate, yeah, I did.
You don't need anybody's approval.<eos> But for what it's worth, you got mine.<eos> Look, I don't care what bridges are still closed. We can book it to the coast and get married.<eos> I want that.<eos> I do.
Okay, but I think you're wrong.<eos> Okay.<eos> They were on a shelf in the bedroom; hidden in plain sight.<eos> Obviously, the cops never bothered to actually look At the tapes when they searched his place.<eos> My people didn't, either, the first time through.
One or two months ago.<eos> Army gives me pills, but they don't do squat.<eos> What, the little white one?<eos> Listen, I know- - I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
Who the hell is Johnny Carson?<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> Gloria and I are from different generations. And I won't lie- It isn't always easy.<eos> I mean, last week she thought Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.<eos> No I didn't.
Jules, I would kill to have all this back.<eos> How is that funny?<eos> Well, it's not funny "ha ha." you know, it's more whimsical.<eos> Uh, bobby- you just said that all a woman wants to hear Is how a man really feels. Well...<eos> I did, didn't I?
Lots of dancing.<eos> Last night, we partied on Rock Band for hours.<eos> I mean, up until her bed time which is a strictly-enforced hard 10:00.<eos> No snacking after 9:00.<eos> Do you... do you Rock Band?

From right here.<eos> I used to ride my bike over.<eos> I'd watch you and Andrew and Danielle.<eos> I wanted to understand why my father would choose all of you over me.<eos> And I did.
He was right there, I swear!<eos> Don't you dare not believe me.<eos> Please. Please, believe me.<eos> I swear he was right there.<eos> I do, I do.

- Me too!<eos> - Dude, what are you doing keeping rabies in your drawer?<eos> Before big games I shoot rabies.<eos> It gives me the edge I need and it's undetectable.<eos> Only idiot losers do steroids anymore.
You know what they're capable of.<eos> Imagine a single soldier robot fighting for your cause.<eos> The cause that your parents...<eos> Hey, hey! You know frak about my parents!<eos> No, I don't.
It was one little single-alarm fire At his old house the week his father ran off. He was angry.<eos> He just- Stacked 20 of his dad's suits on the driveway, Added some top-shelf cognac and lit 'em up?<eos> In a way, but we all need<eos> - To let things out every now and then.<eos> - No, we don't.

-What?<eos> They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.<eos> Burnett has Marlboro already.<eos> I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.<eos> So did I.
I'll make the arrangements.<eos> No need.<eos> She left her body to science.<eos> She said she wanted to go to UCLA Medical School tuition-free.<eos> Of course she did.
I want to know the truth about the case against him.<eos> I want to know why the sergeant thought it was odd.<eos> I want to know what Mr Bates isn't saying.<eos> Because you don't believe him to be guilty?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't want S-11 harmed, all right?<eos> And we always do what Daddy says, don't we?<eos> Relax, I've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece.<eos> We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works.<eos> Yeah, it does work.
The woman wanted to turn herself in, but she was pregnant.<eos> So the agent convinced her to run away with him.<eos> And he'd raise the child as his own.<eos> So they escaped from the terrorist, hoping and praying he would never find them.<eos> Unfortunately, he did.
Which, uh, we're gonna do together.<eos> I am petrified to do this with Mitchell.<eos> He built a couple of theater sets in college or something,<eos> And now he thinks he knows everything about building.<eos> Well, he doesn't.
But you had something, were building something.<eos> I need you to go. You're a hunter.<eos> You know your brother's there. Things are different.<eos> -You don't wanna be here.<eos> -Yes, I do.
You're just pruny from the water.<eos> You're not falling apart.<eos> Oh, yeah, says the man in perfect health Who's carrying me like a fireman in his prime!<eos> I don't have perfect health.<eos> Yes, you do.

- I found it. - No!<eos> - Give it.<eos> M'hijo, leave your sister alone. - Why? - Come on.<eos> Baby, the more you fidget, the longer it takes.<eos> - So don't, okay?
Anything else happen to you over there that you'd maybe like to talk about?<eos> A little something something?<eos> I like the set of her chin. Right?<eos> Does Dr. Brennan know?<eos> Of course she does.
The trick is gonna be the essay questions, and talk about personal interviews later...<eos> I think I've already decided where I want to go.<eos> Your top choice?<eos> That's great.<eos> Why don't we do this in tiers?
What happened?<eos> The dead body is Harriet Soloway!<eos> My god!<eos> I thought she was at the cocoa bean symposium in Baltimore.<eos> So did I.
You knew, didn't you?<eos> We didn't.<eos> No, I was surprised.<eos> They knew.<eos> They didn't...
- Castle?<eos> - It's clear.<eos> He's gone.<eos> I'm fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.<eos> No, I don't. Hey.
Is that laurie?<eos> I overheard kyle-- that douche-y sigma chi Who's always wring the jester hat-- Say that he hooked up with missy here,<eos> Even though he dates a kappa. Missy, did you?<eos> Wow.<eos> She totally did.
I know, but I'm proud of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Put your noose back on.<eos> - Yeah. Mom wants to get some pictures of the pastor and the football star.<eos> Do... do up your top button.
If anything ever happens to Hetty, anything, we will come for you.<eos> I have no reason... to harm her.<eos> The book... does not exist.<eos> That's a good boy.<eos> It never did.
Case is closed.<eos> I mean, we catch him the second we find that glove.<eos> But there is no glove.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Maybe neither does the killer.
The one person who can ID them is doing her best to disappear.<eos> Okay, so let's assume their target is in Long Beach.<eos> We don't know where.<eos> We don't know when.<eos> Yes, we do.
Not intentionally.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> Donna, I'm not...<eos> I'm not domestic. You think that's what I wanted?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're not changing your position on capital punishment.<eos> You know that Alicia's working on the Carter Wright appeal, don't you?<eos> You know, some industrious reporter is going to point out the contradiction.<eos> They're going after family, because they see you lose your cool when they come after family.<eos> So don't.
You keep repeating it!<eos> I think you're lying!<eos> Don't bully him, please.<eos> Listen, Mr. Amazon. Do you know that my brother didn't really trust you?<eos> He didn't?
Don't worry about them.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> We're clean.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I didn't.
Is he American, from New York?<eos> All I know is he came to Paris from, uh, Prague with my niece.<eos> Well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.<eos> I-I need to talk to him.<eos> He doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.
But we all know that you're not katherine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, it's anna.<eos> Jeremy, we have to talk about this.<eos> No, we really don't.
It's just...<eos> I do understand where he's coming from.<eos> He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just... He's trying to protect it.<eos> They do want revenge.<eos> Or at least they did.
You compelled me.<eos> So none of my feelings were real.<eos> Believe what you want, Stefan.<eos> But I know the truth.<eos> And deep down, so do you. STEFAN:
Don't.<eos> What?<eos> Don't act like this is one-sided. Like... Like I'm some kid that has a crush on his sister's friend.<eos> You could have died today.<eos> And you almost did.
He told me you'd say that. Please.<eos> You kids are gonna make it.<eos> They are so done-zo. You do realize<eos> That it doesn't matter where travis goes to college? I know.<eos> Except it totally does.
I will.<eos> Shh.<eos> The NFL has a prestigious reputation.<eos> What you say and do can affect mine.<eos> Don't.
- See you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Pussies.<eos> We don't need them.<eos> No we don't.
Yeah? Yeah. Too bad.<eos> Hey!<eos> Did I come from a vagina?<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> Did I?
I don't want to make things harder for you.<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> Look at me. I want you there.<eos> What?<eos> - I do, I really do.

What happened?<eos> A fight?<eos> What else?<eos> Who beat him?<eos> I did
Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> You want to know something funny?<eos> Do you?
Do you think the financial services industry... has excessive political influence in the United States? No.<eos> I think that every person in, in the wo... in the country is represented here in Washington.<eos> And you think that all segments of American society... have equal and fair access to the system?<eos> Yet, you can walk into any hearing room, uh... that you would like.<eos> Yes, I do.
Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis.<eos> And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform.<eos> The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants.<eos> Business school professors don't live on a faculty salary.<eos> They do very, very well.
Excuse me, can I help?<eos> - No, no. Go away.<eos> Come in.<eos> He hasn't taken his pills in two days.<eos> You didn't?
You're Gibbs.<eos> No one needs to know the truth about the Hernandez investigation.<eos> I am willing to do anything for you.<eos> I just need you to tell me what to do.<eos> No, you don't Abbs.
I've only ever needed you to do one thing.<eos> My job.<eos> But it's different this time.<eos> I mean it has to be, right?<eos> No, it doesn't.
They don't have any rights.<eos> Oh, I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> They attacked the ship, they threatened us.<eos> And now we have to live with them.<eos> No, we don't.
That's weird.<eos> What?<eos> The computer's using a ton of memory running a program I've never even seen before.<eos> Maybe some kind of auto diagnostic?<eos> I don't...
So I was there.<eos> So what?<eos> How's he know I wasn't answering a call?<eos> Because he knows, Eli.<eos> Everybody does.
What's wrong with that?<eos> It's just weird.<eos> I mean, he hasn't even filmed me yet, and I'm your boss.<eos> Which reminds me, who said you could have the night off?<eos> Uh, Lucas did.
Teach me.<eos> The science, I mean.<eos> Well, you got 8 years, have you?<eos> I want to shadow you. I want to watch what you do.<eos> How you do it.
Why did you come?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm not going back to the mountains.<eos> I don't want to go back either.<eos> I don't.

The lady's not supposed to be there.<eos> She's only there sometimes.<eos> But what about that, the E...<eos> But that's the button for the internet, Roy.<eos> I don't...
I don't know.<eos> I still don't believe you.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I really don't.
You know?<eos> But... you can't quit the team.<eos> We need you.<eos> The kids need you.<eos> No, they don't.
I'm not married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> About your late husband Gerald Bradley?<eos> You knew Gerald?<eos> No, I-I didn't.
Just...<eos> I thought I could... Controlled.<eos> Where is he?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Like hell you don't.
I brought my black case for just such an occasion.<eos> It's in my car.<eos> Go get it for me.<eos> I don't work for you.<eos> I do work for you.
I'm not Jones, okay?<eos> I'm always gonna be there, always, no matter how many babies come into the picture... and trust me, I am not anticipating that many.<eos> No one will ever replace you to me.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do now.
You are going to get me involved.<eos> Right?<eos> I have devoted my adult life to studying this beautiful language. and these beautiful people;<eos> I want to help.<eos> Really, I do. Thanks.
So, somebody switched out the CIA's marked money with the Brit" clean currency.<eos> Laundering.<eos> Malloy had access.<eos> How do we know he wasn't involved in it?<eos> We don't.
- I think you should fuck me.<eos> I...<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying if you need to relax, then you can fuck me because I know how to calm them nerves.<eos> Yes, I do.
How is the old boy?<eos> Now, that must be Whitman's source inside the IRS.<eos> Yeah, we need Hardison.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.

Just kill me now.<eos> Please!<eos> Harry's right.<eos> I need a plan.<eos> How you doing, Lopez?
Oh, yay. Thanks.<eos> You see how the I-back goes in motion?<eos> They always come back...<eos> Marty, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
- Yeah.<eos> And Paul was wondering if you would be interested in selling the place.<eos> He's willing to make a very generous offer.<eos> Lee, I never kicked your ass for renting our house to that guy 'cause you didn't know our history.<eos> But now you do.
Euthanized with your view?<eos> - No.<eos> Jo- se- phine<eos> wanted to.<eos> She did?
I didn't take her away.<eos> She didn't want the carny life.<eos> She hated it.<eos> She wanted to get out.<eos> We both did.
How much time, Kent?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> 15... 15, 20...<eos> What? I don't... 15 minutes.
Consensual, huh?<eos> What does that look like?<eos> How do you get a nice girl like Kate to do both of you in the same night?<eos> She liked it.<eos> What did she like?
What?<eos> I mean, you said she liked it.<eos> But what?<eos> What did she like? You know, man.<eos> No, I don't.
What's this about, officer?<eos> We know about the Dark Man.<eos> You caught him?<eos> You know who it is.<eos> No, I don't.
Move!<eos> Don't do it! Whoa!<eos> Are you crazy? ! Wait!<eos> Wait a sec!<eos> Don't do it, Amelia!
- Are you offering?<eos> - Where were you earlier, Duke?<eos> - Oh, did somebody take care of my little problem?<eos> - Just answer the question.<eos> - They did?
Yes, that's true.<eos> But where others would be bitter, you've moved on.<eos> Now you're a nanny.<eos> Clearly, it takes a man who is totally secure In his masculinity to take on a job like this.<eos> Actually, it does.
Who says I want to fit in?<eos> I don't want to fit in, I want to look like<eos> I'm from the mainland.<eos> Okay? I got 87 homicide cases under my belt looking like this.<eos> Not in 110-degree weather, you don't.
Oh, great.<eos> Listen, we got off on the wrong foot the other day.<eos> What do you say I help you out, huh?<eos> I don't need any help, kid.<eos> Yeah, you kind of do, Charlie.
Oh, I do consider it.<eos> I consider it a no.<eos> - Why can't we get the Internet?<eos> - We don't need Internet.<eos> Well, I do.
Which means this is smallpox.<eos> Right!<eos> 'Cause there are only two diseases in the whole wide world-- what else could it be?<eos> There's got to be something.<eos> No, there doesn't.
You know, Charlotte and Cooper don't seem to care.<eos> And... and Sheldon's more excited about the fact that there's a cookie drawer up here than a possibility of a 2-shrink practice.<eos> I...<eos> Did you expect more resistance?<eos> I don't...
Mine was never in doubt.<eos> Do you want to come in?<eos> - Not really.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
And that's why they call it the buddy system.<eos> Okay, let's get out there and find those sloots.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> Hey, Joe! Joe!<eos> How you doing?
Who's Sonya?<eos> - My nanny.<eos> - Nanny.<eos> Well, Sonya wants to know if you want a magician for the party.<eos> Of course you do.
- Obviously, you've been talking about the barrel girls case.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> We found some new evidence.<eos> You and Detective Morgan.<eos> She did. In the file room.
I-I understand. It can be a big adjustment,<eos> But sometimes-- and when dell died and I took betsey in, I did it because it was the right thing to do.<eos> But I can't keep her.<eos> Is it wrong that I want to punch aunt monica?<eos> On several levels, but so do I.
Uh, bright lights don't do much for georgie.<eos> But she likes being talked to.<eos> See?<eos> You can say it's just a reflex.<eos> All the other doctors did.
I don't know how this happened.<eos> It's pretty clear how it happened.<eos> We've never had a problem like this here.<eos> We screen every staff member.<eos> We do background checks.
Yeah? From who, Pablo Torres?<eos> Yo, everybody knows about Pablo.<eos> Why you gotta ask me?<eos> Because he came to your fruit stand gunning for Louie Suarez.<eos> Nah, he don't.
- I'm-- what-- what-- need?<eos> What? What do you need? What-- what do you need from me?<eos> You want to screw?<eos> Let's screw.<eos> Y- you don't?
Somewhere around Maryland.<eos> He pulled over by the side of the road, said he couldn't go any further till he told me his secret.<eos> And then he kissed me.<eos> It was one of those kisses, you know? Yeah.<eos> Afraid I do.
Look, this will all be over soon, okay?<eos> I've a pain in my hole.<eos> I get the cage rage, you know? With them little rich kids. Strutting around like he owns the place.<eos> He does own the place.<eos> He does in his bollix.
What? Not for your little brothers?<eos> Not for your paraplegic mother?<eos> At the interview you said you're saving to open a nail salon.<eos> You spit out lies as easily as you breathe, you bitch.<eos> No, I don't...
It's so good to see you.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Been a long time.<eos> So I believe we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Use them. - No.<eos> I will not use that sword or anything that they give me!<eos> So we'll just continue to die.<eos> I can't become like them.<eos> If I do this, I do it as a man.
Okay.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Who wants to hear some good news?<eos> I do.
- Calm down, Wally, it's lice.<eos> I did not say leprosy, okay?<eos> Would you please not Wally this into a situation worse than it already is?<eos> Hang on, did you just use my name as a verb?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
He owns a boat.<eos> He takes it out every day to go fishing for sharks.<eos> And he knows a lot.<eos> Did you know that sharks don't have bones?<eos> No, but I do now.
That was high!<eos> - He's getting juice. - You want any cake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do we have cake today?<eos> - Yeah, we do. - Yes.
My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.<eos> Wow.<eos> You didn't tell me that.<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> Only your grandmother did.
Water teaches us acceptance.<eos> Let your emotions flow like water.<eos> Aang?<eos> They want you to be their Avatar, Aang.<eos> We all do.
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!<eos> Push! That'll burn all night, lads.<eos> Don't let them put it out.<eos> These pricks will smash through in the morning, take all the credit.<eos> Well done, Jimmy boy.
♪ It's all right ♪<eos> ♪ Hey, open wide Here comes original sin ♪ You look nice. Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like your tie. Wow!<eos> Hi. - How you doing?
It's biological.<eos> Everybody, get back.<eos> - Leave her out of it.<eos> That's my nan. - I thought she was on a cruise.<eos> Yeah... So did I.
The point is, he set her free.<eos> He gave her wings.<eos> It's much too big for just us.<eos> But we don't care, do we?<eos> We do not.
Listen to me.<eos> - We let you do your thing. - You don't interrupt.<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - You don't...
Please. You just cut it out and sew him up.<eos> She's right, actually.<eos> Finish up.<eos> Look, Carla always says that making love with you is perfect.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
God it's like heaven up here.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> Since I've broken up with Greg, things seem different somehow... more colourful, more real.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> Do you?
Not yet.<eos> We can never let this happen again.<eos> Not ever.<eos> No one can know about us.<eos> They already do.
December 28th, 2000, Adam Blue is born.<eos> The next day, he disappears from his hospital bed in Albuquerque.<eos> Remains with his wrist ID end up near the Mexican border six months later. The authorities assumed the kidnappers escaped across the border.<eos> Well, they wanted a closed case.<eos> The Feds'll do that.
You remind him that I'm a man and he's a dog.<eos> And I'm not about to have this or any conversation with a dog.<eos> So my answer is still no.<eos> Junkyard says thank you.<eos> Did he, now?
You don't Want to do it anymore?<eos> That's it? You don't want to do it?<eos> Νo.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Νeither do I and neither does Kate.
I don't want to end up like you!<eos> Lisa, go to bed.<eos> You both disgust me!<eos> You're right. I ruin everything.<eos> Don't.
Lisa, go to bed.<eos> You both disgust me!<eos> You're right. I ruin everything.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't.
What about the murders?<eos> You don't give the fuck about them no more?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Now look at you.<eos> I never did.
Oh, that is the one.<eos> Yeah, it would be, but she's not going.<eos> What do you mean I can't go?<eos> You're the one that promised Lorelai that Hannah would be the guest of honor at the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.<eos> - Actually, Lilly did.
You want to come here... and to buy all the land?<eos> Kill him!<eos> I can not kill.<eos> - Kill it, Vlad!<eos> - Do it yourself.
-Back to bed, it's a surprise.<eos> Have I forgotten my own birthday or what?<eos> I know how hard it is for you to leave everything here.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Okay, perhaps I don't.
- You asked me first?<eos> If I told you I loved you, would it make any difference?<eos> If you told me or if I believed you?<eos> I love you.<eos> I really do.
God, it smells like diarrhea in there.<eos> Look at the munchkin lady.<eos> That guy's wearing a diaper.<eos> God, I never want to get old.<eos> No one does.
No.<eos> No, she knew something.<eos> Come on, get real.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She doesn't!
Oh, Jesus.<eos> Jesus, honey.<eos> Damn it.<eos> We have to talk about last night.<eos> - Do we?
- My God ...<eos> - I had you right tackle.<eos> Do not you know better than to messing with a spirit board?<eos> Come on Gus, it's just a game. It does not.<eos> They do it!
You saved my life.<eos> Μy pleasure.<eos> We narrowly avoided a catastrophe.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> You definitely do everything well, Ηubert.
You are always working so late more than anyone else.<eos> I guess I'm not so good at sitting still.<eos> And not so good at boast, neither.<eos> Well, your father seems to think I have potential.<eos> So does someone else.
What about?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I wouldn't worry.<eos> Apparently bad dreams cure you of real life stress.<eos> As indeed does champagne.
Okay, we've done a complete search and we have alibis from all staff present.<eos> - And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I think it's time to have another talk with detective Lassiter.<eos> Don't you, chief?
We need to do a gun residue swab to make sure that it wasn't you who fired the weapon.<eos> We're just making sure.<eos> Fine, but I am telling you you are wasting your time.<eos> - Chief, we need to speak.<eos> - No, we don't.
- No, we don't.<eos> The spirit world is abuzz and my psychic vibes indicate, nay... insist that lassiter did not shoot chavez.<eos> I mean, we all knew that he would shoot somebody someday...<eos> Oh, so you think he's capable of it?<eos> No, he doesn't.
A little bit each day.<eos> Look, Lieber. Tom.<eos> I never forgot that.<eos> How wonderful for you. We think you may be in grave danger.<eos> No, we don't.
Look, Lieber. Tom.<eos> I never forgot that.<eos> How wonderful for you. We think you may be in grave danger.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
Okay. I get it.<eos> We have to make nice with the Chief.<eos> Why do you think I brought along this peace offering?<eos> You really think that one container of fries cuatro quesos, dos fritos is going to fix everything?<eos> Yes, I do.
And Mélanie's coming.<eos> We've brought a great Bordeaux!<eos> We'll talk tonight.<eos> See you in a moment.<eos> He did some tests.
- Dress who?<eos> - Dress Mom. In her coffin.<eos> [laughter]<eos> - This is no time... - I missed a lot.<eos> - I didn't.
- Just give us some advice and tips.<eos> - Of course, will do.<eos> No problem.<eos> - Tell me, does Hans read that?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
It's so unbelievable. I'm alive because I happened to be out.<eos> And you better wake up by yourself if you want to stay alive.<eos> What did you say?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Of course I did.
- and you're not telling me? - A little bit. Angie, you cannot do that.<eos> 'Cause it's the fucking mold in these walls. That's what it is. You know it is.<eos> It gets to your asthma. It goes into your lungs. No no no, baby.<eos> I'm calling Mrs. Vincent right now. Sal, I don't need anything.<eos> I really don't. Just you, babe.
-Danny?<eos> Come on!<eos> -Danny, we gotta go.<eos> -Told you it was some crazy bitch.<eos> -Yes, you did.
Stupid pet tricks.<eos> Who's murdering the angels?<eos> How are they doing it?<eos> You think I'm gonna tell you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you saying that--?<eos> Did you see a ghost?<eos> I was freaking out.<eos> The guy penciled his damn neck.<eos> You did, didn't you?
I know how you feel. Hal.<eos> I told you to shut up.<eos> Hal! Can you hear me?<eos> I mean I know how you feel about your missing son.<eos> No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.
I heard the gunshot.<eos> You know what that's like for a little boy?<eos> To find the bodies of his parents, his guardians, still warm, lying in a mess of their own blood?<eos> Do you know what it's like to be six and realize, for the first time, that you're alone in the world?<eos> Do you?
And that guy you met he's not my dad.<eos> You're not gonna kick me out, are you?<eos> Because I actually really like it here.<eos> I don't make it my business what you do.<eos> So long as you don't do it here.
- I'd better call Saul!<eos> Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.<eos> Did you know that you have rights?<eos> The Constitution says you do.<eos> And so do I.
She's a painter.<eos> You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?<eos> No, is that bad?<eos> - Boy, you need some educating.<eos> - Yes, yes, I do.
Know the girl who works next door?<eos> - Chapulina.<eos> - Does she still work there?<eos> Go to bed, Betty.<eos> Does she?
Her sexual indiscretions will not go unpunished. Honey?<eos> Is there anything you wanna tell me?<eos> Did he call?<eos> Did who called me?<eos> - He didn't? - Who?
That facility is storing a large amount of something at the temperature we were tracking.<eos> Let's assume we're right, and the existing formula is there.<eos> I'll go, add your bacteria to the fluid... and get out before anyone knows I was there.<eos> I wish I could go with you.<eos> I do, too.
Look,we may not like it,but we're just gonna have tosit tight until help comes.<eos> - Here's another thing.<eos> - About the baby?<eos> You can't delay laboronce it starts.<eos> So,if the baby comesbefore help does?
You're right.<eos> We still don't know anything for sure.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He wanted Andy to move in with us?<eos> Yeah, he did.
She said she left.<eos> She couldn't be my mother anymore.<eos> But Sarah didn't write the letter.<eos> Remember?<eos> - Cassidy did.
I'll call you.<eos> OK, so she's kind of adorable.<eos> You've always been a sucker for cute and smart.<eos> - We wanted to sabotage you.<eos> - We did.
Wow, Shannon, that was awesome. You so rule.<eos> She, uh, got lucky.<eos> - Shannon!<eos> Mom! Mom, did you see me? Did you see me?<eos> I sure did!
I already have ...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could I perhaps Also use the "Wide Chest Press"?<eos> You sit here so dreamy.<eos> And I still did not today. ..
And you?<eos> How is it?<eos> Do you have a relationsh...<eos> Ah. ..<eos> Did you also. ..
They're probably stupid.<eos> But eventually, he came to be known as...<eos> Food Guy!<eos> Who wants some pulled pork?<eos> Of course you do!
He's at peace with it.<eos> That's why we were conducting the cleansing ritual.<eos> Brad knows the difference between the world of magic and the real world.<eos> He understands I didn't kill his brother.<eos> Because, in the real world, Brad did it.
How's Michael?<eos> - You heard about that little girl?<eos> - What little girl?<eos> - Hazel Atkins.<eos> - Yeah, oh, yeah, I did, yeah.
I could have saved them.<eos> I could have.<eos> - It's not your fault, Michael.<eos> It's not your fault. - I told you.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.<eos> - I told.<eos> And you said for me not to say. You said.<eos> - I said if you told them, that you would never see your mum again, didn't I? I said if you told them, you'd spend the rest of your life in prison.<eos> - You did.
Never found her neither. - No?<eos> Didn't they?<eos> - Hear them wheels.<eos> - They never caught no one.<eos> - Never do, though, do they?
Aren't they?<eos> Daddy bought them for mommy--<eos> He doesn't know it yet--<eos> Because he has a wonderful new job.<eos> He doesn't that yet either.
- So say something, stand up to him.<eos> But stealing?<eos> Honestly, Orson, why would you do something like that?<eos> I don't know, Bree.<eos> I don't.
- Why would you do that?<eos> I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you.<eos> You don't want to go?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
"These distances..."<eos> "It has happened." "Even on an empty road..." "...you were by my side."<eos> "Once after meeting you..." "My heart returned..." "But empty-handed."<eos> "It has also happened."<eos> "Like it did just now."
We've got to take this chance.<eos> Listen!<eos> What we talked about down there, the dream, it can be our dream, our reality...<eos> - Isabella I like you.<eos> I really do.
Yeah, go skip some rope.<eos> You want me to skip something?<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'll skip your drunk ass off this marble floor.<eos> Okay, okay. I need to, um, speak to Nate alone.<eos> Yeah. You do that.
All she did was roller-skate.<eos> Every Sunday she asked me to go with her.<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> Why not?<eos> I just didn't.
You're perfectly safe but I think aliens are using you to speak.<eos> What do you think?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> How do we know that the 456 will keep quiet?<eos> We don't.
How's things?<eos> Terrifying.<eos> Uncle Jack!<eos> Steven!<eos> Hey, soldier, how you doing?
They said on the news that we should send them back to school tomorrow.<eos> D'you think it's safe?<eos> Well, I don't know any more than you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't.
And your boy, Ray, he lived up to his end, but Moscone didn't.<eos> For that, there's not a court of law in this world this lady can go to.<eos> Which is exactly the kind of case we take.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't...
Dismissed.<eos> Hey, I like this.<eos> So, uh, about this weekend. Yves? Would you turn the sauna up as high it'll go, please?<eos> Yeah? Look, I don't really think Allyson wants me up there with her, all right?<eos> Oh, yes, she does.
Um, no. No, it's old. It's really, actually, I think it's from when I was in eleventh grade or something.<eos> Hmm. It's still good though.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well done, huh, young man?<eos> Well done.
She's going to buy the jury.<eos> Not if we steal it first.<eos> Who plays chess?<eos> I play.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
Hail Aragorn!<eos> Hail Aragorn!<eos> By the valour of the Lord and his Rangers, the Dúnedain had a measure of peace.<eos> Seems but yesterday that your son Halbarad was Aragorn's age.<eos> It does indeed, my lord.
Mushrooms.<eos> Fair price.<eos> Psychedelic<eos> Ah, we don't deal, chief.<eos> Then neither do we.
- What do you want me to do, ask...?<eos> - Find out.<eos> Ask whoever's in there.<eos> Clay said your task is to be my bitch.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
I had a passionate conversation with her in the elevator.<eos> This is my livelihood!<eos> Do you have any idea how hard I've worked to get to where I am?<eos> I get it.<eos> Do you?
How many times do I have to say it?<eos> Could you hold that still, please, or I'll bash you.<eos> Why?<eos> Drugs.<eos> The drugs did her in.
- Thanks, mel.<eos> I mean, you would have to earn it, of course.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't insult you by giving you charity.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> Do you guys... do massage?
Good night.<eos> Night, night.<eos> Night, everyone.<eos> Look, Paul, I know how hard you're trying.<eos> Really, I do.
Um, this was a mistake. i...<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> Of course.<eos> Why would you want to stay?<eos> Daniel certainly didn't.
I don't know.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about him.<eos> Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
We wouldn't hurt a fly, we promises we'll be very nice.<eos> Let us out<eos> Gollum, you need to answer me truthfully.<eos> I know you were looking for something.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Your father tried to bring a factory to Frostburg when he was mayor, and he couldn't.<eos> Is that how you found out about the methane?<eos> I never thought anything like this could happen.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I didn't.
I threw myself into work so i wouldn't have to.<eos> Was this recent?<eos> Recent enough.<eos> Then you understand.<eos> I do.
People working for the machines monitored by other people working for the machines.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I need to know what they were building in that plant.<eos> I need to know who owned it, and i need to know right now.<eos> I don't...
He missed it.<eos> - Who was in the shop, anyways?<eos> - Reverend Samuels.<eos> - Who wants pancakes?<eos> - I do.
-Shut up, you asshole!<eos> What about your father?<eos> He died when we were still in the North.<eos> -She said so?<eos> -Yes, she did.
-Yes, she did.<eos> What did she tell you now?<eos> That he died in Albania, when I was one-year old.<eos> -She said so?<eos> -Yes, she did.
- What?<eos> - No, honey.<eos> I mean, seriously, do you think he was trying to get out of marrying me?<eos> - No.<eos> - No. No, I do not.
And what is gonna happen?<eos> You tell me, Jack.<eos> You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.<eos> Did you know that Locke killed himself?<eos> No. No, I didn't.
I'm not gonna do anything.<eos> Except get your prints on it.<eos> .38. Just like the gun that put that bullet into Roy.<eos> I never knew she had that gun.<eos> Yes, you did.
I looked at every cadet, and I chose you.<eos> I was gonna get that Tom Seybolt a little dirty so you would have to help him out.<eos> Now, that family was not supposed to die.<eos> You were not supposed to go to jail.<eos> But they did.
I was gonna get that Tom Seybolt a little dirty so you would have to help him out.<eos> Now, that family was not supposed to die.<eos> You were not supposed to go to jail.<eos> But they did.<eos> And you did.
How do we do this?<eos> Easy.<eos> I just need you to tell me one thing.<eos> I need you to tell me why you want Rayborn.<eos> Because I do.
Now, I must do my job, mustn't I?<eos> Rayborn told the brass you saved his life.<eos> Got you a promotion.<eos> You know why he did that, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
Son of a...<eos> They lay one hand on my mama, and I swear on my life...<eos> She's in a state home.<eos> I thought we were working with these people.<eos> So did I.
So... as long as she was in a relationship with you, she never had to drive lead.<eos> Is that right?<eos> - Sergeant Scott.<eos> - Is that right, Sergeant Scott?<eos> - Sergeant Scott, don't.
She wrapped her car around a tree. Her friend got away without a scratch.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Rachel.<eos> Once you lose a child, all this striving seems kind of ridiculous, you know?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately I do.
What the fuck?<eos> Look at it!<eos> Look at it! Look at my fucking car!<eos> You saw that, didn't you?<eos> Did you?
I might have to go and see that nurse. Right!<eos> Bugger off then.<eos> - Cheers, Kieran.<eos> - See if she can laser Jordan off them.<eos> Right, how the fuck does this...
- Dad, will you sing to me?<eos> - No, I don't have time.<eos> - Dad can't sing. - Sure, I can!<eos> - He used to sing Video Video ...<eos> - Nah. - Yes, and do this with my arm.
I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.<eos> Why should I?<eos> You owe me one, remember?<eos> Do you want to cash in for this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo. And I can do whatever I want.<eos> Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me.<eos> Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park.<eos> - Oh. Do you?
Now go and set the table.<eos> Listen,<eos> when Yayan came back from "Merantau," (Wandering) we were discussing the trials and tribulations of life<eos> which might have hurt his feelings.<eos> But we do this out of love and our responsibilties as your elders.
- Yeah it's a thing you stir your drink.<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> What a rip-off!<eos> This looks just like myliving room.<eos> Of course it does.
That's quite a statement.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, she doesn't believe a word she just said.<eos> Ms. Sando, do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Let's go.<eos> Mrs. Park?<eos> Hi, I'm gillian foster.<eos> This is cal lightman.<eos> How do you do?
Oh, I'll let history worry about that.<eos> Now, I know why those two felt that way.<eos> The question is... why does the best man?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Bill should probably have told you.<eos> Jeez, you think?<eos> Here's some tissue.<eos> Look, I don't know if it helps at all, but I think I kind of know how you feel. - At least a little.<eos> - No, you don't.
Just in case.<eos> Here.<eos> Please, go ahead.<eos> I never eat Friday nights.<eos> You don't?
- What are you doing?<eos> - Looking for my kid.<eos> - How did you get in?<eos> - The doctor gave us keys.<eos> - Really? He did? - Yes!
Gabriel, hit me up with the shrimp.<eos> Are you out of your fucking mind, April?<eos> My goddamn fiancé is missing.<eos> Kenny, I admit it. That I have feelings for you that I can't ignore.<eos> Something about you that does something to me.
You're under arrest.<eos> I thought we'd worked through your doormat issues.<eos> Tell Cho to squeeze him a little.<eos> He knows things.<eos> - No, I don't.
My pleasure.<eos> - Oh, great. The gang's all here.<eos> It's only fair that a son should see the results of his father's labor.<eos> Of course, if this doesn't work I'm afraid I have to go back to that bit where I kill everybody.<eos> - What if it does work?
- Oh, great. The gang's all here.<eos> It's only fair that a son should see the results of his father's labor.<eos> Of course, if this doesn't work I'm afraid I have to go back to that bit where I kill everybody.<eos> - What if it does work?<eos> - Lf it does work?
Sir, Colonel Young's body needs time to recover.<eos> Give me something for the pain.<eos> The body feels pain for a reason.<eos> I would rather not mask it.<eos> Just do it, Lieutenant.
Linc?<eos> I'm sorry about what's ever happening to Linc.<eos> And I know you have to protect your family, I understand that, but, Michael, what are we going to do about the rest of us?<eos> What are we going to do about my wife?<eos> Alex, I don't...
"Goodbye"?<eos> What do you mean, "goodbye"?<eos> Sometimes we can't outrun our destiny.<eos> But I thought you were invincible.<eos> So did I.
I would like to present those changes to you.<eos> - My lawyer advices against this.<eos> - Is he there now?<eos> - Can you speak freely?<eos> - I always do.
He got greedy.<eos> He tried to shake you down.<eos> He threatened to tell the world the truth about how you really won this.<eos> You knew if you paid him, he'd eventually want more.<eos> They always do.
We're divorced.<eos> You look good.<eos> Handsome.<eos> Man, I always knew you'd be successful.<eos> Even if Dad didn't.
Kidney failure?<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> They're good kids.<eos> They understand that family comes first.<eos> Do you?
Who knows what else we'd find here.<eos> But how can you keep these here, uncle?<eos> These are stamps from 1936 when Antioch was under French rule.<eos> This album alone is worth a fortune. You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
- Go drink a nice glass of milk.<eos> - Because I feel good. - You're all wet.<eos> I feel good. We're good.<eos> I love you so much!<eos> So do I darling'
Maybe she's trying to be constructive.<eos> I hate him? That's constructive?<eos> - I hate when people tell me they hate me.<eos> - I didn't even ask her to sleep over.<eos> - She just did.
When am I gonna end up in a landfill?<eos> I haven't decided.<eos> Decide.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.
- OK, a quick question. - Sure.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - I don't like chatty.<eos> I don't do chatty.
How can I walk?<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> You know you are Six.<eos> Please, I'm nobody. I don't know anything, please!<eos> But you do...
LETTIE MAE: It's not my fault!<eos> She forgave me!<eos> Let her go!<eos> LISA: Sam, did you know my daddy?<eos> Uh, I did not.
Bloodthirsty hooligan got here faster than I expected.<eos> - We need to move now.<eos> - No. - I'm gonna teach the son of a bitch... how to breathe through the top of his skull.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Do the math.
Yeah.<eos> This is Pete.<eos> It's Erik Luna.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Damn right we do.
- Thank you.<eos> - Can you imagine walking by your kid's empty bedroom, not knowing where he is?<eos> - No. I can't.<eos> - How does a guy like this make a dead body just disappear into thin air?<eos> - The gulf stream does the trick for me.
Better see to that drip, son.<eos> You don't want this place going to hell.<eos> You need it too much.<eos> - my own little vacation spot.<eos> Hey, how you guys doing up there?
I'm here with my colleagues in L.A.<eos> My God.<eos> Uh, I know why you're calling.<eos> You want to know what I saw.<eos> - We all do.
When are you damn kids going to learn how to hold your drugs?<eos> Boris' concierge doctor.<eos> Start with some Oxy, then a little crystal, rip a few lines, and chase it all down with champagne.<eos> "Heaven salad" you kids call it, right? What?<eos> April doesn't do drugs.
There's something wrong with you, all right. Thank you.<eos> I think he's being facetious, babe.<eos> Do not patronize me, Tucker. Are you guys really only 16?<eos> I told her she doesn't have anything.<eos> Actually, she does. What?
I don't know. A lot?<eos> Twice that.<eos> At least.<eos> Do you know how much these things run?<eos> I don't.
Notify CCU they're coming in.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Dr Marshall made a mistake with the dosage.<eos> - How did that get by you?<eos> - Well, actually, it didn't.
- Get in there, buddy!<eos> - Kiss her. Kiss her.<eos> Come on! - Mom. Mom.<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Do it!
- Okay then, Mrs. Botwin.<eos> I've got your discharge paperwork all set up for you.<eos> Just need a few scribbles on a few dotted lines. Hi, there.<eos> I'll get you a wheelchair up here.<eos> No, I don't...
No.<eos> I did.<eos> For hesitating even one second before I said yes.<eos> You are a grown-up... an adorable grown-up, who I want to grow very old with.<eos> I do, Jonah Miller.
I did.<eos> For hesitating even one second before I said yes.<eos> You are a grown-up... an adorable grown-up, who I want to grow very old with.<eos> I do, Jonah Miller.<eos> I do, I do.
So, you going?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> The man has 700 sports channels.<eos> You want to see what he's got under his bed?<eos> No, I do not.
All right, he's not what the sport's about.<eos> Eliot, this "sport" is about two guys beating the crap out of each other.<eos> MMA fighters act with more respect than any other athlete I've seen.<eos> - Yeah, they're "braveheart." I get it.<eos> - No, you don't.
You good?<eos> where's the cellphone?<eos> What cellphone?<eos> I<eos> - I don't - - I --
No, you weren't. Gossip Girl said you'd returned.<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> Well, you've seen me.<eos> Now you can go. We need to talk.<eos> No,we don't.
- That this is about Vince.<eos> - You're very insecure.<eos> - Not usually.<eos> Look, I want Vince.<eos> Who doesn't?
You just wait for the right moment.<eos> You'll know.<eos> So the Blur trusts you, right?<eos> I mean, how do you always know the right thing to do?<eos> You don't.
- Nice.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> He'll be as good as he can be.<eos> Don, I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
Well, then, that's done with.<eos> We needn't be involved.<eos> Bert, you know that's not the way the marketplace works.<eos> A man comes through your door, he knows what he wants, he's got the money to back it up,<eos> - you do your best.
- We know that.<eos> - But as we studied your indices, we realized that they're not flat everywhere.<eos> In fact, among negroes, sales are actually growing.<eos> - We know that, too.<eos> - You do?
- I have a martini waiting next door.<eos> Let me make this quick.<eos> You know we have this German au pair working for us?<eos> - No, I didn't know that.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- What was that?<eos> - You don't want to know.<eos> - I think I do.<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> Now I really do.
Yeah, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.<eos> I don't trust her around men.<eos> She's like one of those herpes from mythology.<eos> You mean harpies?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
- Then quit.<eos> I mean, that's what I'd do, but don't ask me, I'm stupid.<eos> Just ask Brooke.<eos> - l'm sure she doesn't think that.<eos> - Mm, she does.
I was in the house when it happened.<eos> Didn't even see it.<eos> For argument's sake, say we believe you.<eos> - Why?<eos> The cops didn't.
We should figure out what this is.<eos> Yes, we should.<eos> Or.<eos> Okay, now, we have to figure this out.<eos> Yes, we do.

Does Ystad count as southern Sweden?<eos> -Should I be honest ...<eos> -We would assume so.<eos> -Such a things should not take place<eos> -They do.
Us, not you.<eos> And since we don't disagree, you can save your fight for another case.<eos> How long do I have to be hooked up for?<eos> Four to six hours a day until we see an improvement.<eos> What if you don't?
Thanks for calling, by the way.<eos> It was great to hear from you... When you called me.<eos> - I only called you because I needed a favor.<eos> - Right.<eos> - How we doing?
Look, don't freak out.<eos> It's over.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Now I have to tell your mom!<eos> No, you don't.
-What did you get up to?<eos> -I said teeth.<eos> -But Jojje hasn't brushed his.<eos> -He'll have to brush twice tomorrow.<eos> -You never did your teeth just then. -I did.
- well, i don't know either, But i think that thanksgiving dinner was just his way<eos> Of letting claire know that she has a family That loves her.<eos> Nothing wrong with that.<eos> - i thought you gave up all this.<eos> - yeah, so did i.
What are you doing in here?<eos> I'm sorry. I... I didn't think anyone was...<eos> I'm looking for George Sutton.<eos> He doesn't live here anymore.<eos> No one does.
Did you see the incident?<eos> (WHISPERS) Did not Mr Dixon save Jane Fairfax's life?<eos> Oh, er, yes, yes, it was the talk of the town.<eos> - She said it was nothing.<eos> - Oh, did she indeed?
- You {\guys }are the best.<eos> - Right back at you!<eos> For charades.<eos> How do we know you two won't hurt us again?<eos> You don't.
- Are you doing drugs?<eos> - Why are you saying that to me?<eos> Because you're in the bathroom with some stranger, you're pacing around like a lunatic, and there's cocaine on your makeup mirror.<eos> It was Makenna.<eos> She does it.
This is false.<eos> I'm not gonna play "True" for someone who's false.<eos> He doesn't even know the band.<eos> He's not a fan.<eos> Of course he does.
Then it's Lily's problem, not yours.<eos> But if I said that to her, it would only lead to a fight, so...<eos> You fight.<eos> See, Robin and I never fight.<eos> - Of course you do.
Hell, one of us may even be dead.<eos> yeah, and with your cholesterol...<eos> Oh, yeah, it'll be me.<eos> look, i say we act like men And we bury it under a mountain of denial so deep That no one can make us believe that it ever actually happened.<eos> Already done. free and breezy.
A Jewish standup comedian, that would be new.<eos> Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.<eos> No, I was just - Because - Never mind.<eos> Look, Howard, this is our third date, and we both know what that means.<eos> - We do?
I hate wearing this so much.<eos> (groans) he said, "you put that on you," and he was yelling.<eos> And I was like, "okay, don't get mad."<eos> But I don't want to wear it.<eos> I don't.
You know, and now he does this?<eos> Ugh. I mean, right under Bizzy's nose.<eos> And now they're here in my house.<eos> Uh, I need a drink.<eos> - No, no, no, you don't.
-No, sir.<eos> There was a struggle.<eos> This is not a good sign.<eos> Luminara's lightsaber.<eos> Poggle didn't do this.
Great.<eos> Find out everything you wanted to know yet?<eos> No, wait, I want to see how it works.<eos> I don't think Luminara wants to see how it works.<eos> No, I don't.
Liquorice, bicarbonate of soda..<eos> And the base is syrup anyway.<eos> Hold it, I'm not with you.<eos> They really invent cola?<eos> Sure they do, but..
Sit, I insist, don't get up Sit back down<eos> I'm taking them, you just rest<eos> Fucker!<eos> Do you have any smokes?<eos> Do you?
Listen, this needs at least 10 more spoonfuls.<eos> I will put three.<eos> Three?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> In the small pan, we do it with three spoons.
I feel it's the place to be tonight.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> -No.<eos> -Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.<eos> or Felix does.
That's the best I can do.<eos> Oh, I love it when you boys talk all nasty Nazi to me.<eos> I get all crazy inside.<eos> - Now, who wants a little head?<eos> - I do, I do, I do!
Why do we have to right their wrongs?<eos> Sometimes, one must be sacrificed.<eos> No!<eos> You did it!<eos> No, I didn't.
The last mortal.<eos> Now, Doctor, no trace of his identity has been found on the National Records.<eos> Nothing about his past.<eos> We do not know who Mr. Nobody is.<eos> Neither does he.
Why are you here?<eos> I was at the dentist I thought I'd meet you.<eos> You smoke?<eos> I didn't know you smoked.<eos> Yes, I do.
My dad is the general at the base.<eos> I could tell him, and...<eos> - Don't tell anyone!<eos> - Why? You want to live? You want your father to live?<eos> Then don't!
Yes<eos> Hey Honey? I think the universe trying to tell me something.<eos> Hey Sherlock, the wood needs be drier than that.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> We did that at school.
If you weren't such a stick in the butt and had come with us, you'd still have a body.<eos> Besides, we actually had a really good time.<eos> Speaking of which, your sister and I want to tell you something.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I vote we go.<eos> Great.<eos> That's me and you.<eos> I mean, we don't really know what Anders would vote.<eos> Yeah, we do.
But the war ends here.<eos> You leave humanity in peace... and give up the pursuit now and for all time.<eos> Agreed.<eos> How do we know we can take your word for it?<eos> You don't.
Just as the earth lets grow things of use and of no use, the feet of man carry them to deeds of use and of no use.<eos> When man does good deeds, the elements have their proper path.<eos> But when he does bad deeds, he turns the elements against himself in punishment.<eos> Do you believe that the elements can turn against us to punish us?<eos> Yes, my child, I do.
Probably a puppy.<eos> You're just mad because their stories match up perfectly.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - You don't suppose...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Was that Riley?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> Your mother told me to keep an eye on you.<eos> That doesn't mean you have to go everywhere I do.<eos> Yes, it does.
It's my mom's subconscious way of trying to keep me a kid.<eos> The minute she took off, out came the paintbrush.<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> -You don't wanna know.<eos> -Yeah, I do actually.
No, I don't.<eos> Hey, do you know a girl named Jody? Do you know someone named Jody?<eos> WOMAN 2:<eos> No.<eos> WOMAN 3: We don't.
We don't know what they mean or why it continues to respond this way.<eos> What we do know is that when we run performance tests on the Al its computational time is increasing. The optimality of its outputs is decreasing.<eos> It's taking more time to do less.<eos> Yeah. I mean, you could say that, yes.<eos> I just did.
Not that you'll need to.<eos> Ed,it's time.<eos> Code of silence been lifted?<eos> - Yeah. - So how'd it go?<eos> - The way they do.
It's very dramatic.<eos> Well said.<eos> I just want to work in a regular lab,you know?<eos> So,you want that ride or not?<eos> Yes,he does.
-What are you talking about?<eos> . -That guy's guilty.<eos> -Hey, we don't know that.<eos> -I know what he is.<eos> What? . What do you--?
Who do you think she's fantasizing about?<eos> Who is she having sex with?<eos> - You don't wanna know that.<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Thanks.<eos> I confess, I never really did get to the end of it.<eos> - Ahab does die, doesn't he?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But so does the whale.
You should take this a little more seriously.<eos> When I was this big? I was in a detention camp for two years.<eos> - You understand? - I underst...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Do you, A, share the food or, B, keep the food for yourself?<eos> - B.<eos> - See?<eos> It works.<eos> It does work.
Sometimes it helps to pretend it's real.<eos> How did you get them to listen to you?<eos> I just told them that i would do the same for them later.<eos> Yeah, great, but how do you keep them from coming back?<eos> You don't.
Yeah, me, too.<eos> We should get going.<eos> I can hear my mom swearing from here.<eos> - Do you know where Kyle is?<eos> - No, I don't.
No mistakes.<eos> Allright.<eos> I want Ope pulling the trigger on this.<eos> I want to make sure he's really back.<eos> We all do.
Alex, stop.<eos> He's asking for you, and you're gonna be too late,<eos> And you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life!<eos> You really want to live with that, huh?<eos> Do you? Alex!
You know, I think he's quite smitten with you.<eos> Really?<eos> Uh, I'm not so sure.<eos> Well, he told me that he took you to the Cloisters.<eos> He definitely doesn't do that with just anyone.
Chuck, I want you word that you will not mention anything<eos> About the girl I used to be. I just got aaron to myself, And if the one thing I have to do to keep it that way<eos> Then that's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I get it. you lied to him.<eos> N--no, I didn't.
Since when are you having a party?<eos> Since it became clear that Marcus does not think I'm worthy of meeting his family.<eos> Obviously, I have some more work to do.<eos> - B, you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Laurel believes in her interns paying their dues.<eos> MODEL:<eos> You must really want this.<eos> Why? Because for three months I've put up with midnight coffee runs 15-hour days, cleaning up after the two in-house bulimics all so that Eleanor Waldorf will spend five minutes looking at my designs?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I really, really do.
Charlie, you're a genius.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Delilah's father called.<eos> Apparently she had a wonderful time with you this afternoon.<eos> Well done.

I'm alive!<eos> What's happened?<eos> Merlin, stay there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> No, don't.
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?<eos> I'm going to snap your neck like a twig.<eos> My cactus.<eos> Whatever that was cannot exist.<eos> But those things outside do.
This isn't the band "Family Help", is it guys?<eos> Does it say "Salvation Army" on my back?<eos> No... -Well look again.<eos> You can read, can't you?<eos> No it does not.

Oh, there's pus!<eos> It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,<eos> - not from my body.<eos> - It smells!<eos> Yeah, it does.
I had the first past behind me.<eos> Since I had time for that.<eos> I hope I feel better after one year. And that I am sitting next to you while you read this.<eos> But if I'm not there, is not because I do not love you.<eos> Because that I did.
Jack?<eos> Smoking kills.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You do.

Yo, was that Van Sant?<eos> You know what?<eos> I ain't answering, any questions until this motherfucker apologizes for making my phone into soup.<eos> You know how long it took me to put those numbers in that phone? Huh?<eos> Do you?

I paid a visit to her school where she is now the principal.<eos> And I found there a woman full of emotion about a child who had been abandoned, and a man who had deserted them both.<eos> She never gave up hope that he would return.<eos> Or that a letter would arrive asking her to go out and join him.<eos> It never did.
You know what?<eos> I think I do.<eos> So do I.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you, too?

As if she did something wrong, but she never did anything wrong.<eos> Did you yourself on any of these occasions do anything to Sylvia?

Wait a moment, it moved, Move it another 10 degrees west.<eos> So these are the live ratings.<eos> With 500 boxes we can manipulate<eos> Only the one channel, so far. No more.<eos> Do it then!
What about Adria?<eos> Still on the ship.<eos> Alright, here's a question.<eos> How do we know it worked?<eos> Well we don't.
- Let go of him!<eos> - Don't come any closer or I'll cut his throat!<eos> Eve! ...<eos> Open the door!<eos> - Eve! Don't do it! Eve!
Me a daddy seahorse with you in my pouch. I don't like seahorses!<eos> They're ugly!<eos> - I don't want you to swallow me.<eos> - But I just meant I love you.<eos> I don't.
Is she well?<eos> My word!<eos> Yes, she's fine.<eos> Did she tell you?<eos> Of course she did.
Alice, I've never felt this way, for about anyone.<eos> Okay, listen, I don't wanna do this with him inside.<eos> Really, it's not right.<eos> I think I should go.<eos> I really do.
- No, I didn't.<eos> - Does she know we're coming?<eos> - I think so.<eos> How do you know she wants to see us?<eos> She probably doesn't.
- Thanks.<eos> So what should I tell Geslow?<eos> Buy me a week.<eos> He wants closure on this.<eos> Not as much as I do.
The hospital first!<eos> For 8 million, we'll find the cop first.<eos> She's in danger!<eos> - When you have no choice...<eos> - You do the right thing!
Fayed has the ressources to detect our surveillance.<eos> As part of the deal, we gave Fayed monitoring access to our satellite coverage, radio frequences and air corridors.<eos> He won't give us anything until he's free and clear with Jack.<eos> How do we even know he'll do what he says?<eos> We don't.
It's the emotion.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do you know you sleepwalk?<eos> You sucked Zima's breast.<eos> - I did?
Have you told her how you feel?<eos> She has a six-year-old daughter.<eos> Women with daughters can still fall in love.<eos> I know.<eos> Because she did. With my brother.
Pegged you for more of a John Cougar Mellencamp guy than a John Cougar guy.<eos> So, uh, maybe want to hang out sometime, talk a little more evolution of Mellencamp?<eos> Tonight good? - I'm meeting some friends at Sully's.<eos> - Maybe I stop by?<eos> Maybe you do.
- Seaweed.<eos> - Don't go there. Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> So therefore, next check-in is in just under six hours.<eos> Good. Muscles, that means that we have time to go to the party.<eos> No it does not!
Why him?<eos> Why did you call Chad?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Think, there must be some reason.<eos> I don't...
Now you need to go back home, and forget about your real parents.<eos> The groomer missed one of Mr. Muggles' nails.<eos> I'm gonna run him back by the shop before they close.<eos> Don't want you scratching up my wood floors.<eos> No, we don't.
At least, in CID, you have a chance to make a difference, and you do.<eos> -Do I?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And...<eos> To me, you do, too.
- Where is she?<eos> Freya... where is she?<eos> - I don't know where she...<eos> - You told her, didn't you?<eos> - What if I did?
Then if you want to go, you can go.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> What? "Let's call this what it is." Jesus Christ...<eos> - Stop...<eos> - Don't.
Actually, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> How about you?<eos> -Do I have a girlfriend?<eos> -No. -No, I don't.
A new case?<eos> The big score? The mother lode?<eos> The one you've been waiting for?<eos> - Humor me.<eos> - Don't I always?
- What was it like?<eos> - Like talking to a lunatic.<eos> No, no, no, not her. The forest.<eos> - You're not saying you believe her?<eos> - You don't?
I mean, can't you do that?<eos> But... I mean, you were seeing images of yourself as a small boy.<eos> If that's not a Freudian meltdown, I don't know what is.<eos> But certainly, they have to see that.<eos> No, they don't. They don't.
It's the most important invention in the history of the world.<eos> And all you think about is chocolate.<eos> Calm down, Mike.<eos> I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You know, she's my other half.<eos> Without her, I'm not whole.<eos> You know, the thing about meeting your other half is... you're walking around, you think you're happy... you think that you're whole.<eos> Then you can't go back to being a half... 'cause now you know what it's like to be a whole.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And I was wrong.<eos> And my daughter, she'd be lucky to have you.<eos> I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.<eos> I think I know that about you.<eos> Theresa doesn't.
He is a madman.<eos> Do you think he's gonna make it on his own?<eos> Who cares?<eos> I don't know why you care anymore.<eos> I don't. I don't.
She looks so pretty.<eos> Let's just eat.<eos> I think you look really beautiful.<eos> Did Daddy tell you that my mommy died?<eos> Yes, he did.
No, who... who told you that?<eos> Charlie did.<eos> There is no Charlie.<eos> Who said it?<eos> Charlie did!
What brand do you use?<eos> - An ordinary one.<eos> Have you ever seen one of these?<eos> Do you speak Finnish?<eos> - No, no. What sort of shampoo do the kids...
- I saw you. - What'd you see me...<eos> - I was in the tunnel, and I saw you!<eos> You were with her, dead, and you took the body!<eos> I saw you hide it!<eos> Yeah, I did.
Who are you going with?<eos> Hi, um... D'you wanna hang out tonight?<eos> With you?<eos> Yeah, you know, get something to eat.<eos> - Maybe do a movie or something.
Just got sore heads.<eos> Those were good times.<eos> I like writing too.<eos> It's hard to make a living by writing.<eos> I just do it for fun.
Don't go to the front.<eos> Fight with us for peace. Forthe People's Front. Forfreedom, against the Nazis.<eos> The People's Front."<eos> Does that ring any bells?<eos> Does it?
Have you seen the Davies family this evening?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.<eos> - No, Mother. I don't need a doctor.<eos> Yes, you do, dear.
I love you.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Do you...?<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I really do.
What are you doing?<eos> You like my perfume?<eos> Smell it.<eos> - Actually, I've been a little stuffed up, feeling nasally.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Look at these two hot chickens.<eos> Finkle wants some dinkle. Give it to me, huh?<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Lay it on right here.<eos> Do it.
I love it. - Hi.<eos> Can I get you two a drink?<eos> - You sure can.<eos> Johnnie Red neat, OK? Do it.<eos> Do it.
- Let's smell it.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> Come on, pop the trunk.<eos> Seriously. Do it.<eos> Do it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> Come on, pop the trunk.<eos> Seriously. Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.
In Paris, Lucille Paré presents her new creations.<eos> I thought you might change your mind.<eos> Guy tells me I'm very stubborn.<eos> - l assume he doesn't know where you are?<eos> No one does.
If you believe that because of your great wealth and power you can intimidate any member of this committee, I want to advise you that you're mistaken.<eos> Now, submit your questions.<eos> Now, I'll put this very simply.<eos> On February 1 2, at the Mayflower Hotel, did you or did you not tell me that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am that this entire investigation would be called off?<eos> No, I did not.
I was frightened.<eos> Robots don't feel fear.<eos> They don't feel anything.<eos> - They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.<eos> - I do.
There she is.<eos> There.<eos> Tsu, Kien wants to talk to you.<eos> Tell him he solves it by himself<eos> - Do it yourself.
I want to see him.<eos> I've waited three days.<eos> He says none, not even you.<eos> - He needs me.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Stay behind the security fence.<eos> It's great of you to come see me, but I've got somebody waiting, very devoted, almost crippled.<eos> No, please, don't cry.<eos> I know what it's like to be unloved.<eos> Well, you do.
When I put my flag out, I can't allow it to touch the ground. Because I know the lives that were lost and the blood that was shed so that I could be here and have a flag.<eos> - How often do you put the flag out?<eos> - Every single day. Every day. I started when my daughter was in Desert Storm.<eos> I had the same flag flying on my front porch and the same yellow ribbons. Praying and hoping every day that my child would come home safe. And everybody's child would come home safe.<eos> - And she did.
This would have been an amazing speech.<eos> It's not just that you wanted to win it's that you absolutely refused to fail.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> You deserve this fellowship, Jane.<eos> You really do.
Self-defense.<eos> - I won't kill anybody.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> - Stop it, CJ.<eos> Don't do this.
Was he the man who tried to buy the Uranium from you, Vlenko?<eos> Will you testify to that in a court of law?<eos> Only if she don't do more beat-ups.<eos> Do you, Admiral Theodore McKee, without any mental reservation... or purpose of evasion, solemnly swear to defend this nation... against all enemies, foreign and domestic... and swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America?<eos> I do.
Why don't we just leave her out of this.<eos> Would if I could but I'm starting to think you ain't gonna leave me that option.<eos> You want to wake up from one of your stupid naps and find Amy nailed to your garbage bin?<eos> Or turn on the radio some morning and hear she came off second-best in a match with the chain saw you keep out in the shed?<eos> Do you?
Three days, I'll be back, mija.<eos> And you don't want to fuck with me, muchacha.<eos> Cicatriz.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
That's why they're full of sick people.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I've got to take my pills now.<eos> I only take them... so the nurse doesn't feel guilty.<eos> I do it for her, not for me.
- This transfer is under control. - I'm hot.<eos> FBI Travel Link climate control.<eos> I don't understand your command.<eos> I don't understand your command.<eos> I don't under... I don't... I don't...
I don't wanna talk about this right now.<eos> Can we get back to the campaign and focus on something..<eos> Raymond, you don't actually believe his story?<eos> No.<eos> But he does.
Can't you hear the bells a-shouting?<eos> Maids, go do your chores<eos> And now, to end our little show, if we all give her a shout-out, Her Majesty may sing us a song.<eos> Thank you, no.<eos> Queens rarely do karaoke.
- I can't do that.<eos> That's my boss.<eos> - So?<eos> - I need my job.<eos> - No, you don't.
Let's go.<eos> Why did you have to spoil the fun? - When?<eos> - Let the others deal with it.<eos> Tell them all that the deal is a dream... and that the Purifiers are history.<eos> Done. John, John.
It's just a picture.<eos> No.<eos> It's because you don't know how they died.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Em... I'm not sure exactly which it we're talking about.<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> We should save what every little money we have left<eos> We both know what the test gonna say<eos> -No,we don't
Joe Monroe doesn't have to die.<eos> The Anagress works.<eos> All we have to do is get him back on the medication.<eos> - Anagress doesn't work.<eos> - Anagress does work.
-Good evening, ladies.<eos> How are you? -How are you?<eos> Hello, Maya.<eos> You look gorgeous.<eos> You both do.
It's... because nobody understands. I do understand. Do you?<eos> Do you really understand me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you want me to talk to him?<eos> Of course I don't.
- That's not a euphemism.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - What were you doing in New York?<eos> - You know.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
Tell me.<eos> - No, no!<eos> - I haven't taken anything.<eos> - Did you sleep last night?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Stay there a second, please.<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> You've ruined my clothes.<eos> - You hardly notice it. I can't see it.<eos> - Of course you do.
- Yes, of course.<eos> You know the bank, right ...?<eos> You know about the robbery?<eos> Michael wanted me to go and see the lady and apologize.<eos> Of course he did.
Show us again, slowly this time.<eos> Let him go.<eos> And give him water.<eos> He needs water.<eos> We both do.
In accordance with God's wishes, we never lay together... as man and wife.<eos> Yes it is true, and I beg you that you believe when I tell you...<eos> I've never lain with any man at all.<eos> Do you believe me, Joseph?<eos> Do you?
So he raised you to be a punk<eos> Tell me<eos> Did your old man teach you to fight at school?<eos> Did he?<eos> Did he, asshole?
If I cannot become one during this lifetime, ...I will never be a happy ghost!<eos> Hold on, don't let go.<eos> I don't want to die so young.<eos> Don't worry, we won't die.<eos> What if I did?
- that your daughter could...<eos> - Yes.<eos> I accept that.<eos> Maybe not yet, but I do accept that.<eos> - And you don't.
That's the nicest compliment I've ever been paid.<eos> -Coffee?<eos> -Yes, please.<eos> I don't forget everything that I don't write down.<eos> You don't?
Don't drink so much water.<eos> Two or three liters a day tops.<eos> What is that needle?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You don't.
Then behave like a human being.<eos> Do you behave like human beings?<eos> I loved him and you people gave me to him like food.<eos> And then killed him.<eos> You did.
Sit down<eos> Got an electric shock Little girl, how do you plug this in?<eos> How come you unplugged the wire?<eos> Can you cook?<eos> Usually Big Sis and I do the cooking
Lilly!<eos> - Joshua!<eos> Take care of your mother.<eos> I take that one, I know the way.<eos> - The drivers do as well.
What? You scared? Hey!<eos> - Just do me a favor.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> Don't come any closer!<eos> I don't No, No!
Just look at what features these have<eos> I beg your pardon? I do want to sleep with him<eos> I have nothing against that, in principle<eos> No I meant the other thing you just said<eos> What did I do already?
I can't go like this.<eos> Why not?<eos> Go.<eos> Tim, I'll make it up for you if I've got a son.<eos> But I don't.
Guaranteed hilarity.<eos> So the police officer's the butt of your joke.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> No, I didn't.
Such a woman does not exist!<eos> Tell him, Pilgrim, you who have traveled the world, tell him!<eos> Such a woman does not exist!<eos> Maybe she does not exist,<eos> but maybe she does.
How did you know that?<eos> Hazama's wife came to my house last night.<eos> She said she was going to see you.<eos> Yes.<eos> She did.
- It could make a lot of difference.<eos> Julia, stop it.<eos> We can't.<eos> - Do you think of me?<eos> - Don't do this.
Jack, we got some readings off the incubator.<eos> That was Ryan.<eos> The virus has been released at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.<eos> There are 11 other vials. We don't know where they are or when they're gonna be released.<eos> He probably does.
More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.<eos> Just what I deserve.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> No I did.
Thanks.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> I was thinking maybe we could talk about it again.<eos> I'm sorry, Knox but you have work to do.<eos> I do.
Angel?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> Listen, I want to apologize about the way I treated you this morning.<eos> - Look, Angel, I understand.<eos> - Pretty sure you don't.
You agree?<eos> What do you know about my ruts?<eos> Well, um, i know you gave some great advice to "lost in los altos" about finding new love, but, uh, you gave the same advice to "dumped in daly" last year.<eos> shut up. i did not. are you kidding?<eos> Oh, my god. I did.
Must be that orbing thing you guys share.<eos> He looked up and said, "da-da."<eos> Really?<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
I'm actually thinking of selling the club because I have a new mission in life.<eos> And it's all become very clear to me.<eos> Would you care to elaborate?<eos> Do you guys know that Wyatt called me "Mama"?<eos> - He did? Oh, his first word.
- It worked, didn't it?<eos> Not yet it hasn't.<eos> Not until the witches come after you.<eos> They'll come.<eos> - They always do.
Listen, about last night...<eos> I don't have any regrets, if that's where this is going.<eos> It's not.<eos> But I'm glad you said that.<eos> Because I don't either.
I mean, really, one bad experience with magic can't outweigh six years of good, can it?<eos> Hey, Paige.<eos> Hey, Darryl.<eos> Uh, I thought you were on your date.<eos> Yeah. So did I.
Fine, and F.Y.I., I like strawberry frosted the best.<eos> In addition to eating my groceries, you might want to start providing them.<eos> You need to earn your keep.<eos> I-- all right!<eos> All right... I--I'll do some chores.
Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.<eos> And if something had happened, I would've felt like I'd failed her.<eos> I know that sounds stupid, but...<eos> And she knew right then, neither she nor Edie would be laying claim to his heart any time soon.<eos> No, it doesn't. Not at all.
Oh, we shouldn't!<eos> We should tell each other this stuff!<eos> - It helps, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It really does.
Look at him.<eos> Stop doing fucking yoga, man.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> - She thinks she's his trainer.<eos> - So do you.
Well, I'm hot.<eos> Okay, how about this for a plan?<eos> You go take a shower... and I will order some food, and I'll start to clean up...<eos> - Hey, I can't do this.<eos> - Do what, shower?
It's my job.<eos> We even made a little joke earlier.<eos> "The baby has a meeting today."<eos> - I love this.<eos> - We do, too.
You say "elbow grease".<eos> Do you use chemical cleaners?<eos> Ah, non.<eos> Absolument.<eos> And chefs don't do the cleaning anyway.
THEY'RE COMING!<eos> EGGROLLS IN THE HOUSE. OH, AND GOOD NEWS. CHEF MING HAD THE BABY.<eos> BRIAN. HOL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?<eos> CARRIE INVITED ME OVER.<eos> DID SHE?
NOT AT ALL.<eos> I KNOW I CAN BE OPINIONATED SOMETIMES.<eos> I TALK BEFORE I THINK, AND I-<eos> CARRIE, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.<eos> REALLY. YOU DO? YEAH.
I never licked it, OK?<eos> For the last time, my head was in that trash can because I was looking for my six million dollar man thermos top!<eos> Look, you licked it, you didn't lick it, what's the difference?<eos> There's a big difference! One way, I licked a trash can!<eos> The other way, I didn't!
Hey, man. Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> About what?<eos> Trish?<eos> Yeah, well, look. Trish needs support right now. She doesn't need to be chewed out in front of the whole team.<eos> Yeah? Well, I don't, either.
Don't curse us all.<eos> Tina and I left your dinner party because we didn't wanna be any part of it.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You didn't know it was already going on then?<eos> Tim, I didn't...
Yeah?<eos> Like this?<eos> I think it was a little bit faster.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You had no choice, Danny.<eos> I mean... you were being overrun... and you absolutely had no choice at all.<eos> Why don't you just go and take a shower and clean yourself up?<eos> Did you ever have to do what I had to do?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Someone had to take responsibility for it.<eos> It would've never lasted!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> It's been six days, and we're all still waiting... waiting for someone to come.<eos> But what if they don't?
Any idea who, boss?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You think he knows more than he's telling us?<eos> Come on, Kate, this is Gibbs we're talking about.<eos> Of course he does.
Agent Todd, if Ryan's innocent, how did my man end up handcuffed at his cabin in the first place?<eos> I'll get you your evidence. How?<eos> Any way I can.<eos> Your boss is playing a dangerous game. - He doesn't play games.<eos> - Well, neither do we.
- Not very.<eos> You were his commanding officer.<eos> Commander Julius was a bit of an odd duck,<eos> - if you know what I mean.<eos> - I don't.
You know, him and his buddies were the only ones had cuts like that.<eos> Are these the buddies that were with him?<eos> Yep.<eos> - Do you remember what time he left?<eos> - He didn't.
What's going on?<eos> Look, I left Newport to make life easier for everyone.<eos> It seems like all I did was make everything more complicated.<eos> That's funny, I thought you left Newport to be with me.<eos> I did. All right?
You don't get this rush at a normal job.<eos> You don't, you don't, you don't.<eos> - Know what I'm saying?<eos> - You're saying you don't.<eos> Well, Per, sometimes you do.
- Not in the mood!<eos> OK, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.<eos> - Dream come true, right?<eos> - Do you really think I want this suit?<eos> Well, I do... but not from you!
- Don't pretend you don't even know me.<eos> You weren't that drunk.<eos> If the only reason last night happened was because it happened, don't knock it, all right?<eos> At least something did.<eos> It did for me.
- Maybe that's your job but I don't like it.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> - You're not even listening.<eos> - He's talking to me.<eos> No. You and me, we do most of the talking in here.
He don't wanna see you.<eos> I told him watch his mouth.<eos> These things happen, T.<eos> That's why I don't like to talk politics.<eos> - You did?
That's tremendous guilt to carry.<eos> He went to Nam, I was 4F.<eos> And that's the way our friends look at it.<eos> And that's why you favour Tony uncle AI...<eos> And those 1 7 years, I did so good.
- (Leda sobs)<eos> Search the house.<eos> (soldier #2) There's no one else here, but we found men's clothes and boots.<eos> - (soldier #1) Who else lives here?<eos> - My husband did.
This girl was messed up.<eos> Maybe she has father issues, I don't wanna know.<eos> The point is, she was asking for it, okay?<eos> And you know what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't.
We filed a report, but the police didn't pay any attention.<eos> It makes them ideal victims, doesn't it?<eos> The homeless.<eos> - No one deserves to die like that.<eos> - No. They don't.
And what about post-traumatic stress?<eos> He was given full medical and psych evaluations in Ramstein.<eos> But sometimes that can set in later.<eos> How well do you know him, Capt. Meyers?<eos> I don't, actually.
If you don't find that baby, Terri's not gonna make it through.<eos> Not with all that guilt she's got.<eos> No, you have to listen to your mother.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because you do.
Let him go!<eos> - On your knees!<eos> You like water?<eos> - Tastes good, doesn't it?<eos> - Don't!
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.<eos> The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.<eos> And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do what?<eos> - You know the answer to that question.<eos> But do you?
- The Oracle.<eos> - You saw her?<eos> - Just before the sentinels found us.<eos> - What did she tell you?<eos> - The same thing she always does.
Tell Fuller it was me who pulled this off, yeah?<eos> I'm not gonna let you get away with this, Gamble.<eos> Well, you ain't got a say in the matter, do you?<eos> Suspects wearing tactical clothing and have automatic weapons.<eos> T.J., don't do this!
Kendall said he was burned by a phosphorus grenade.<eos> Dunbar never saw the body.<eos> Hey, look, I apologize.<eos> -You saw West's body?<eos> -Of course I did.
A bank draft.<eos> This is made out to him.<eos> Hey, you want it made out to you?<eos> No, but, uh...<eos> What do I do with this?
Come on, baby, you've been good so far.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I thought this guy was a chump.<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> Everything Vegas doesn't.
Les will be back in a minute<eos> He's always late<eos> You scare now?<eos> Do you think he knows?<eos> Of cause he does
That doesn't mean he didn't love you.<eos> What was he, really?<eos> What did he do?<eos> You gotta come off it, kid.<eos> You really do.
Please raise both hands.<eos> Do you swear not to repeat what you see, hear or smell tonight?<eos> - Smell? - Keep your hands up!<eos> Yes, smell.<eos> I do.
Good morning. - Goodbye.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> No, we have an audience. Don't look.<eos> No, I don't... no.
- Evan Lewis is dead. - Yeah.<eos> I've been getting calls all morning from everyone who was on the on-ramp.<eos> We're meeting tonight at my apartment. Wait, so...<eos> you believe all this Death stuff?<eos> Well, at first, no, I didn't.
Man, shut up.<eos> Hey, Zero.<eos> Why'd you dig my hole, man?<eos> You didn't steal the sunflower seeds.<eos> Yeah, but neither did you.
It was a whirlwind and right away, we were living together!<eos> I think we'd both benefit by some time apart.<eos> I don't need time apart.<eos> I know I love you.<eos> Well, I do!
Like what?<eos> Invite him out for a drink, and then after about 20 minutes, casually drop into the conversation the fact that you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.<eos> You know that?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so does Karl.
But he has made many sacrifices for his family and put away many dreams.<eos> Where did he put them? He put them in a drawer.<eos> And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them.<eos> But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer.<eos> He does.
I do. I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies. - I do. -I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies. I do. I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies<eos> I do!
Max over here is potty-trained now, okay?<eos> - I don't miss.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And Becca learned how to read.<eos> - Yes, I did.
You have one image of your father... and it'd be wrong of me to change it... especially this late in the game.<eos> My father talked about things he never did... and I'm sure he did a lot of things that he never talked about.<eos> I'm just trying to reconcile the two.<eos> The first thing you have to understand... is that your father never meant to end up here.<eos> Yet he did.
Your boy can help put that fire out!<eos> Look at the bubble...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Serious. Ray, you're making me lose money.<eos> Don't do that.
And Karl started on him, talking weird stuff like how Erwin owes him money.<eos> Then Karl smacked him one.<eos> Now Erwin's doing Karl's shift at the Einfall.<eos> But what happened?<eos> Why did Karl do it?
They said that everyone who signed up would get a horse.<eos> A horse?<eos> Yes, a Døla horse.<eos> Dala horse.<eos> And you did.
That I'm beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Then why won't you?<eos> Because crime doesn't pay?<eos> No, it does. It does.
What's this?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Is he your friend?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Do you?
-Very.<eos> -I hope it gets where it's supposed to go.<eos> -Me too.<eos> -These days you never know.<eos> -No, you never do. -Goodbye.
Yes, mistress.<eos> Got it.<eos> I win again.<eos> No, we are drawing.<eos> - Well, I do.
You show me.<eos> It's obscene.<eos> Why don't you paint me?<eos> Because you don't understand!<eos> And she does?
- Want some more?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Does my drinking surprise you?<eos> Men usually find it strange that women drink<eos> like men do.
- I just haven't seen that.<eos> I get to see movies for free.<eos> And I can also go bowling.<eos> - But you don't know how to bowl.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Mom!<eos> Remember my rich friend I told you about?<eos> She wants you to teach her son for three months.<eos> All you have to do is making him study for two hours.<eos> Do your best.
Did he tell you that, too?<eos> She said you built her, Mama.<eos> - Did she?<eos> -She says she loves Mama.<eos> As much as I do, maybe more.
What am I?<eos> A joke?<eos> You think you can just show up like this and cause all this ruckus and I'd go with you?<eos> Il-mae, I love you!<eos> I really do!
You got it.<eos> You got it, Shane.<eos> Come on, Shane.<eos> I did it!<eos> I did it! I did it!
Yes, all right, I did come back.<eos> I didn't want Elinor to know. You see, I'd decided to ask Mary to marry me.<eos> And you saw her?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Did that help?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I think it did.<eos> OK. Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer you back to CTU for further debriefing.<eos> But the truth is, I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.<eos> No one does, except for you.
- Describe it.<eos> - What?<eos> - The timer.<eos> Describe it.<eos> I don't...
- He said no. It can mean the end of Sloane.<eos> Sloane's with Ahmad Kabir.<eos> I need to know where Kabir operates.<eos> They need to be stopped.<eos> Not by my husband, they don't.
Make her despise you. Because your kindness tortures her.<eos> I can see it, what it does to her.<eos> And I won't have it.<eos> You and Vaughn's wife work together?<eos> - Okay, how the hell did that --
If I tell the truth, at the least, they'll remove me as your case officer.<eos> But despite what we did, how stupid we were, I know we do good work.<eos> We need to stay together.<eos> I agree.<eos> We do good work.
Perhaps it is your thing.<eos> Do you know what he drives?<eos> A sedan, armoured, of course, with a protective detail.<eos> Sydney, if you want to stop that car, you will need backup.<eos> No, I don't.
FAITH: Wes...<eos> Faith.<eos> See? Brits know how to say goodbye.<eos> Angel here wanted to hug.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Oh, thank God.<eos> - What?<eos> - Demon. - Huh?<eos> - D'Hoffryn says you die.<eos> - Of course he does.
Do you remember?<eos> We were naive to think we could change anything.<eos> - To stop him.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Or at least you didn't.
Every other job, someone's wound up needing my help.<eos> - I just don't know why I didn't see it.<eos> - Well, maybe you weren't meant to.<eos> No, I was.<eos> I just... I didn't.
Even worse, when I tried to save him, he wound up saving me.<eos> I just wish I knew what was going on.<eos> Why they were after Larry in the first place and how he knew they were coming for him.<eos> - What do you mean, he knew?<eos> - He just did.
You run, bitch!<eos> Run!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you gonna tell him?<eos> If you don't.
First you have the great idea, the master plan.<eos> You make the prototype and you start mass producing.<eos> Billions and billions.<eos> They don't last forever.<eos> Nothing does.
But it wasn't a dream, Captain.<eos> It was as real as I'm sitting here.<eos> They told me you can try it... anyone on the crew.<eos> Who told you?<eos> They did.
- Yeah, I liked it.<eos> But my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches.<eos> - You didn't watch the tape.<eos> - What?<eos> Of course I did.
- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.<eos> - You lied again.<eos> - I watched it.<eos> - keep going, Pinocchio.<eos> - I did.
- We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.<eos> - I'm not running from the cops.<eos> - Then why are you here? Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?<eos> Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here.<eos> Well, so do I.
This black eye screwed everything up.<eos> Next time I go to your grandmother's, I'll try not to have one.<eos> - Next time? - Next time.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - I don't...
What happened?<eos> I thought you turned him down.<eos> - You turned him down?<eos> - I thought about it, and I reconsidered.<eos> - What did you do?
And we're back at the opera.<eos> No, no, no, no, no! Deac, call me on your cell phone. Leave a message.<eos> The light will flash again and both messages will play as new. I don't want to get in the middle of this.<eos> I'm kind of fond of this area.<eos> Fine, then, Danny, you do it.
Excuse me.<eos> Uh,<eos> - Yeah. Uh, by any chance, were you in, uh, Mr. Philby's room?<eos> - Yeah. So when Miss Landow died, you heard the car alarm go off?<eos> Everybody did.
Anything, sir.<eos> You'd be willing to give us a sample of your DNA?<eos> Someone put that box in my locker and that key on my keychain.<eos> How do I know that you don't have my DNA on something else they planted, too?<eos> You don't.
Nasser arrived in June from Afghanistan.<eos> Yes.<eos> Insists he was picked up by mistake.<eos> Weren't they all?<eos> Agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject.
What are you doing here?<eos> Ah, well, my flight's not till 9 in the morning.<eos> Since I'm here I thought that, maybe...<eos> You know how to do a database search? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why are you so sure it was the flu?<eos> It's the same symptoms major Kerry had.<eos> Did you work together recently?<eos> No.<eos> Well, if you didn't workwith him, then how?
- What message?<eos> - I called, told some guy who answered the phone that the sitter was late.<eos> He promised to pass it along.<eos> Promises don't mean a whole hell of a lot in Oz.<eos> Well mine certainly does.
Tell me about it.<eos> Lighten up, slut!<eos> What now?<eos> I think relationships can be defined by big moments that don't happen.<eos> Or by the little ones that do.
But I guess I meant fun.<eos> Debbie seems really nice.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think so.<eos> So, does Robert...
- I charge a commission.<eos> I have a 100% recovery rate.<eos> - 'Cause your buddies are the ones doing the kidnapping.<eos> - No. Because I understand how to negotiate with these people.<eos> The Salvadoreans do not.
The sleeping girls.<eos> Why are they like me?<eos> - My daddy said I can't remember because I had an accident.<eos> You don't remember anything because you didn't write that.<eos> A different Emily did.
-I'm gonna go with 47.<eos> -Do me a favor.<eos> Frank, you been fair, I ain't saying otherwise.<eos> It's just there's 60 checkers above me with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.<eos> Do me a favor.
Her father was raking leaves in the front.<eos> He got there a few moments later.<eos> - That's what he said.<eos> - You suspect something else?<eos> Did you?
She came in about a week-and-a-half ago with her boyfriend.<eos> It feels like it's beating out of my chest, and I can't catch my breath all the time.<eos> I can tell you there's nothing wrong with your heart, Natasha.<eos> - What you're describing is a panic attack.<eos> - So what do I do about it?
Well, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but you were better than your husband.<eos> You weren't upset about that, were you?<eos> I mean, he...<eos> he said you wouldn't be.<eos> He did, did he?
Morph, we are so out of here!<eos> Jimbo! Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?<eos> Get back!<eos> I like you, lad, but I've come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.<eos> Oh, no, you don't!
I met my wife in my third year and have not looked at another woman since.<eos> I was referring to the first two years... sir.<eos> Where you received highest honors in English.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, in that case, so do I.
But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.<eos> And the other man is so fast.<eos> There was so much love in this house.<eos> I want him back so bad.<eos> So did she.
No she didn't, I liked her.<eos> Didyou see the way she looked at me?<eos> She wanted me.<eos> You're dreaming.<eos> She did!
-Oh, I'm a loser?<eos> Yeah, you're a loser.<eos> You've always been a loser.<eos> You think I'm some small-time jerk-off?<eos> -Yeah, I do.
Dude's incredible.<eos> Why can't he get here on time with the bagels?<eos> It's just been one of those days.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> MATT: Yes, I do.
No.<eos> We both lose, don't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And now you wish to trade your life for theirs?<eos> Yes, I do.
And the men are literally holding their breath.<eos> Holding their breath for you. Hear that?<eos> I turned to my buddies and I said...<eos> I will not leave France without her.<eos> And I didn't.
I turned to my buddies and I said...<eos> I will not leave France without her.<eos> And I didn't.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I didn't.
- You're a bad puppy!<eos> I can still take you! Put them up, you mangy mutt!<eos> Is that all you got?<eos> Hey, Daph!<eos> - We did it!
Let me come get you.<eos> I'm gonna go away for a while, okay?<eos> Don't do this, you'll regret it.<eos> A kid needs his mother.<eos> -Don't do this.
There's this friend of mine who's really cute, and I want you to meet her.<eos> I was thinking about bringing her tonight.<eos> Yeah, I don't wanna do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I just don't do stuff like that.
- I don't understand You're a liar<eos> Turn it off<eos> You're not my mother<eos> Turn them off<eos> Do it for Dad
Sorry.<eos> - What do you mean, what?<eos> The crying.<eos> She sits in the house all day, crying.<eos> She does it in the mornings, too.
You leave a trail everywhere.<eos> Especially when your best friend rents your room with her credit card.<eos> I had to do that since someone froze all my accounts, right?<eos> -We need to talk.<eos> -No, we don't.
About a year ago.<eos> She came to a signing here in Nightmute.<eos> She hung around afterwards and we chatted about my writing and how she wanted to write.<eos> Then we started talking and she asked if she could visit and talk about books.<eos> - And she did?
Ginger, Ginger.<eos> Relax your throat when you're eating.<eos> Yeah, Ginger.<eos> Mm-hmm? You knew my wife before I did...<eos> Actually, before all of us did.
- It's called peer pressure.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> You read it in your precious book?<eos> Please don't pretend like you know me, okay?<eos> But I do. I do.
I'll tell you if you'll leave me alone.<eos> She asked me to keep quiet and she gave me 10.000 francs.<eos> Which I regret, little bimbo. -What?<eos> You sleep with everyone don't you.<eos> -You don't? Even with the same ones.
That should be enough.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Somebody will pay for this.<eos> Somebody always does.
You get one card.<eos> Don't let anyone look.<eos> You answer "yes" or "no" to the question on it.<eos> How do we know who answers what?<eos> We don't.
I've drawn my pistol many times, but I've never had to shoot.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> But you did save Uncle Jose's life once.<eos> -Who told you that?<eos> -He did.
When we catch the Tooth Fairy... that print plus his teeth will burn him.<eos> You did that, Will.<eos> That evidence was there, Jack.<eos> - It was there for anyone to see.<eos> - But nobody else did.
- What's that got to do with anything?<eos> - It has a lot to do with things.<eos> It's very interesting because your father was the one who got you the white hat.<eos> He was in the Mob, but yet he wanted you to be a hero.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Want I jam this in your ass and break it?<eos> You want a go? Come down here.<eos> Whoa, wait, wait, oh. Not too fast, not too fast.<eos> Hey, I just want to talk.<eos> Eh, eh, you do that there, man.
Get off my back! Look at me, Marcus.<eos> - You know Guillermo Nuñez?<eos> - No. - You don't know him?<eos> - No. You know who does?<eos> Nobody does.
Stewie, it's freezing.<eos> Help me, baby. I'm going down!<eos> Help us, anybody!<eos> Oh, God, no!<eos> Don't you do this to me!
Hagrid.<eos> Hello, Hermione.<eos> - It's so good to see you.<eos> - It's great to see you too.<eos> What did you do to your glasses?
My twin brother died and took our mother with him.<eos> Rawiri.<eos> Everyone was waiting for the firstborn boy to lead us.<eos> But he died.<eos> And I didn't.
- Yeah. Your mom's been calling me.<eos> - Did you speak to her?<eos> - We're playing phone tag.<eos> She said you could show me what you do here.<eos> She did?
- Yeah.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause all of this is bullshit.<eos> I don't want to live anymore.<eos> Yeah, you do!
- What?<eos> Close your eyes. - What for?<eos> - Please, close your eyes.<eos> - What you going to do?<eos> - Nothing special, just do it.
Damn it. Look at this asshole.<eos> Your hair's wet.<eos> Sharing the same room?<eos> I just did what I was told.<eos> Did it with Soo-jin or not?
- Did you wait for me? - For years.<eos> Forgive me for asking, but did we fight a lot?<eos> You really don't remember much, do you?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> We did.
That's no way for a lady to talk.<eos> What are you doing with these two, Simona?<eos> Let's talk about something else, shall we?<eos> That really disgusts me.<eos> What does?
They're doing the Cold War at school now.<eos> Stine will have to pay for that plate, won't she?<eos> Joachim?<eos> Remember this?<eos> Do you?
- Yes, it can.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> You do?
- That doesn't matter.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There's nothing here. That day, my father swore he never wanted to see my brother again.<eos> Let's go, Felipe.<eos> And he never did.
That's the rule.<eos> We want the boss' money.<eos> Everyone keep calm.<eos> Open the cash register! You want us to go?<eos> We do too.
Knockout Ned!<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> It hurts, man.<eos> Easy does it, kid.
-'Bye.<eos> She wants to talk.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> You wanted to talk too.<eos> No, you did.
- But he really liked her!<eos> - Me too!<eos> So much that you already dumped her.<eos> She didn't want me anymore. If she did...<eos> She didn't?
You killed her, not the fire!<eos> L'm not guilty!<eos> L finished what was already done!<eos> - You're guilty!<eos> - Just because I did it, right?
I always thought he was strange<eos> I never thought he was a fighter, though<eos> Maybe we shouldn't be calling him 'Sir Twilight'<eos> You think he knows?<eos> Sure he does
And you want me to get it?<eos> Yes.<eos> And report back to me.<eos> - We both know what it's going to...?<eos> - Yes. We do.
Just take it one task at a time.<eos> Right now all I need you to do is open up a couple of sockets.<eos> And then get to the conference room, all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi, Tony. How you doing?
Orders from the DCI.<eos> I don't care.<eos> If the NSA know something, I should, too.<eos> We should, sir.<eos> Unless you already do.
Two years, and I quit.<eos> And now you sing?<eos> Yeah, TV jingles.<eos> I was a blues singer for about six years and could not make my rent.<eos> On New Year's Eve, I did these jingles as a lark.
Will he be a good father?"<eos> She neglected to ask herself...<eos> ... " Willheconfusemyhead for a soccer ball?"<eos> 'Cause that could never happen.<eos> But it did.
I bought it because it's beautiful... ... andit'ssomethingIcancommitto.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I also, I admit, find some joy in the fact that I was able to buy it... ... youknow,withmoneyImade, you know, that I earned.<eos> I didn't need a husband to take that step, and I didn't need his income.<eos> I did it.
I don't know.<eos> I think you should.<eos> Look, I've been blinded by my hatred for... .<eos> Your mother would have wanted this.<eos> And so do I.
Yes, it would apply to vomit.<eos> I didn't send for a plumber.<eos> Look, Maddie, it isn't very interesting, okay?<eos> You're testing her because you're not convinced she wants you.<eos> Well, she does.
- I don't know.<eos> I know what I'd do, but Angel will deal with Holtz in his own way.<eos> GUNN: No way.<eos> He couldn't have heard us.<eos> He did.
- I wanna talk to the Conduit.<eos> - We are the Conduit.<eos> The gateway, the all-times, the ever.<eos> It wishes to speak to us.<eos> Yes, it does.
The visions.<eos> When that one hit me last night, it hit me.<eos> In Pylea the visions were to pass to Groo if we did the com-shuk.<eos> - How do I know that won't happen here?<eos> - You don't.
[GRUNTING] What you're being called to do transcends love.<eos> - You've become a higher being.<eos> - Me? I know somehow it's all gonna be all right.<eos> - You murdered my father.<eos> - I didn't.
And that's what Connor's given to me.<eos> Keep her safe.<eos> If it makes you feel better, I would have chosen you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But no, it doesn't.
If I had your head for numbers, I'd be counting cards.<eos> No. I mean about Lorne acting weird with us.<eos> The guy's on some old star trip, man.<eos> Who needs him?<eos> Angel does.
Angel.<eos> God, look what they've done to you.<eos> If I could just get you in that room, maybe...<eos> Oh, think, bubblehead.<eos> How do I...?
Do you believe that?<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> I'll dance, I'll wait here and then I'll dance again.<eos> That's all.<eos> A hundred years, doing the same piece every night.
He thinks I let him go.<eos> Do you wish you hadn't?<eos> I wish things were different.<eos> I'm not trying to...<eos> I don't...
I have to do this.<eos> Just let me go.<eos> I can't.<eos> I love you.<eos> No, you don't.
- l don't know. lt's late. I'll miss my bus.<eos> - l know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around.<eos> So you need to talk to me.<eos> Now. Believe me, if I knew anything, I'd tell you.<eos> I just don't.
- Wait. What kind of team is this?<eos> - Hi.<eos> We met once before.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
I know he does.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Did he tell you?<eos> He doesn't have to tell me he loves me.<eos> Well, actually, he does.
There's a good answer, I just can't tell you what it is.<eos> But it's good.<eos> Let me get this straight. You're a friend of Mylie's.<eos> I've never met you, never even heard of you, and you know more about her than I do?<eos> No, not more about her than you do, just a little secret.
- I'll be with you in a moment.<eos> - Okay, Doctor.<eos> I'll provide you with a full report when I've finished treating the crew.<eos> - You wanted to see me, Captain?<eos> - I did.
Now, really.<eos> I should go powder my face.<eos> - I think you look beautiful just as you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, we really shouldn't be shooting each other.<eos> We didn't come here to rob you guys.<eos> Hell, we didn't know there was anybody on this rock.<eos> We're not your enemies, we know who you are.<eos> - You do?
- Who's that?<eos> - McManus has been working the phones...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought he didn't want her.<eos> Tina didn't.
You cannot sit down!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Did I tell you you can sit down!<eos> Did I?
I love the way the rain smells.<eos> If this were a French movie, we'd fall in love and get married.<eos> No, I was just pointing out how romantic this would be in a movie.<eos> I don't want to marry you.<eos> OK, I do!
I fucked you for three hours when we came home.<eos> Why haven't you hung the hearts?<eos> It's been laying there for days.<eos> - I'm not sure it belongs here.<eos> - Or I don't?
- Home, 73rd and...<eos> No.<eos> We have to celebrate this.<eos> - l want to tell him.<eos> - Oh no, I don't...
I think it's going to be super fun and sexy.<eos> We sit here and pick how many men out of 100 we would sleep with.<eos> No one's asking to fuck every guy.<eos> We're a weekly paper.<eos> - No, we don't actually...
You might as well be pulling the trigger.<eos> Tell me the truth!<eos> - I am!<eos> - He doesn't know anything.<eos> Yes, he does.
I guess I'm just looking for something to hold on to.<eos> I'm supposed to preserve this monument to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You're a teenager, Lana.<eos> Mercurial doesn't do you justice.
No.<eos> I'm not being fair to you.<eos> I mean, this was your special day and you're buying me presents?<eos> Did you not like the socks?<eos> Of course I did.
- between a Tok'ra symbiote and its host. - So do I, Major Carter.<eos> Still, your theory seems to be based on just intuition.<eos> I won't argue with that, but it's not without reasoning.<eos> - I know that's where Colonel O'Neill is.<eos> - As do I.
Missile away.<eos> Sierra-1 destroyed.<eos> Attempting to acquire Sierra-2.<eos> How do you know those are the only emplacements guarding the gate?<eos> - We don't.
Oh, Colonel Grieves, of course.<eos> He asked that he might see the Sentinel to learn its mysteries, so that one day your people might be protected as we are.<eos> But to do that... that would be against our highest law.<eos> No one may see the Sentinel, except its Caretaker.<eos> Yeah, well... They did anyway.
Cedric.<eos> He knows about the money, Marla.<eos> He's known for a long while.<eos> Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised if it's why he picked me for this case.<eos> What does he....
You lay it in right, you can build on it.<eos> You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.<eos> We ready?<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the affidavit is true... and accurate to the best of your knowledge?<eos> -I do.
You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.<eos> We ready?<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the affidavit is true... and accurate to the best of your knowledge?<eos> -I do.<eos> -I do.
- Don't shoot me, please.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> - Where's the child?<eos> - I don't have her.<eos> I never did.
If it were true, these symbols wouldn'tjust be words.<eos> They'd be the very word of God on the surface of an alien spacecraft.<eos> It'd mean that everything mankind believes in... is in question.<eos> And you believe this?<eos> I didn't.
What you can see they did to me was a failed attempt to turn me into one of these alien men.<eos> I was a guinea pig, a test subject.<eos> And now I want to expose their evil plans.<eos> What plans are those?<eos> To do this to you.
–You got scissors?<eos> –What do I need scissors for?<eos> Got your aid kit?<eos> Right, well, you don't need this.<eos> Not yet. I do.
Most of them were qualified parachutists.<eos> They had to be.<eos> A lot of them were awfully green, and we knew that.<eos> We hoped they could keep alive.<eos> A lot of them didn't.
He gets to make some cash.<eos> Lets me know when big things happen.<eos> Big transactions.<eos> -You trust him?<eos> -Damn right I do.
Then why even try it?<eos> Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.<eos> If we can't bring the final spirit here we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> And how do we do that, exactly?
- Hey, please, i get it.<eos> Come here.<eos> I missed you.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes, i did.
As for blonde or dark it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> I do remember she casually asked if you had a girlfriend.<eos> And? I said you weren't interested, right?<eos> You didn't!
That's just what I do.<eos> Now follow me and don't fall behind.<eos> All roads lead to Rouge!<eos> Don't they say that, hey?<eos> Don't they just?
Now what you're about to witness... are some of the biggest secrets of movie-making.<eos> So I must ask that all of you swear not to reveal anything you witness here.<eos> Do you swear?<eos> Uh, just say, "I do. "<eos> - [ All ] I do.
- One.<eos> - One? - Yeah.<eos> One casino?<eos> That is really lame, if you ask me.<eos> Well, I didn't, did I?
You wanted to show off, so you nearly get us all killed.<eos> I can see your lips moving, but I can't hear a word you're saying.<eos> It should pass in a day or two.<eos> Your father says it will pass in a day or two.<eos> Does he?
Gimme a zip.<eos> Hey, ain't you in ladies' wear?<eos> Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?<eos> I don't work here.<eos> My wife does.
As you well know.<eos> But then I went and found the pansy.<eos> Oh, you got nothin' to say?<eos> Well, you know the story.<eos> I didn't.
So, then, Rabbi Rothstein says, "Sim, sim, sim, sim, ata..."<eos> Hey, McKinley.<eos> Did you take that shower yet?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Did you?
Ceci wouldn't be able to betray me.<eos> She wanted to tattoo my name on her tit.<eos> - But her mother didn't want her to.<eos> - I took Ana's cherry.<eos> - She only does it with me.
- So even with good behavior...<eos> -5, 10 years?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler, I'm sorry. - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
They'll retaliate against innocents, even harder than they did last time.<eos> They suffer anyway.<eos> They die of disease, starvation and worse and you negotiate as if Germans are reasonable?<eos> - Yes, I do. I try to minimize the harm.<eos> - So do we!
- How will you get them out?<eos> Are you with me or not?<eos> We have no chance without the guide to take us in the sewers and out.<eos> Do you see a guide?<eos> Do you?
What about the government?<eos> They usually get involved.<eos> -No government.<eos> I know those people.<eos> -You do?
- Have a coffee with me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I'm late for dinner.<eos> According to the theory of relativity, time doesn't exist as we know it.<eos> Yeah, but my father does.
You ashamed of them?<eos> They ugly like you?<eos> I don't get along too well with my babies' mommas.<eos> - I'm sure you understand that.<eos> - No, I don't.
It's a long story, and we don't know each other.<eos> - So many secrets.<eos> - I'm really an arms dealer.<eos> - I've never known an arms dealer.<eos> - You do now.
Good.<eos> I didn't want to work for Andy Unger anyway.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know who Bishop was after.<eos> - Well, so do we.
- Don't defend me.<eos> What?<eos> No, she's right.<eos> So how do you sleep, Elizabeth?<eos> Actually, I don't.
Let me begin by saying we have a full agenda.<eos> I admonish those here to view testimony today to keep order... or this chamber will be cleared.<eos> The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.<eos> Do you swear the testimony you're about to give... will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
You are out of order!<eos> People like Luke Trimble... and all the sons of Lawson, California.<eos> STAN: Damn right.<eos> And they deserve better than this.<eos> All you boys do.
You know I quit.<eos> I don't want it anymore!<eos> You don't tell me when you're gonna quit! I tell you! You don't tell me what you want!<eos> I tell you! How long will it take for a fucking junkie like you to betray me for a lousy fix? I won't betray you!<eos> Please, don't!
People bad-mouth sociologists, and often with good reason.<eos> There are some...<eos> I don't recall who said,<eos> "The social workers are part of the problem."<eos> But in the work that we do...
- You make a deal with him?<eos> - What? That's what I would do.<eos> Go to you.<eos> - He knows what you're capable of. - Listen, man.<eos> - But so do I.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Forceful is one thing but this is mad.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
I'm sure, but don't you ever think that for both your sakes that you ought to get rid of Arlena?<eos> Do you mean, divorce her?<eos> Of course.<eos> Arlena's my wife, and that's all there is to it.<eos> "'Til death us do part."
Can you tell us where he is?<eos> No. - Mr. Schulz. I'll read you Section 184, agraph 4 of the Criminal Code.<eos> If the offender acts for gain or as part of a group, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of 6 months to 10 years, in addition to your probation.<eos> Are you scared of Mr. Valentin's testimony?<eos> I didn't do anything!
I thought Miss Johnson might be up here.<eos> She's just going out to the dig.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I'll try and catch her.<eos> How you doing there, Richard?
I...<eos> Why a nurse?<eos> Well, there is an answer, in fact, there can only be one answer... that you did not truly believe that your wife, she was in danger.<eos> God help me.<eos> I didn't.
Mademoiselle Maitland, when you arrived at the dig, did you see anyone?<eos> None of the expedition members, no.<eos> There seemed to be no one there but the Arab foreman. Shufta Mr. Carey?<eos> You did not even see Monsieur Carey?<eos> All right, yes, I did, for a few moments... near the dig.
Got their addresses after all.<eos> Dexter will be here tomorrow to confirm that.<eos> But don't worry, it doesn't end here.<eos> Whoever he is, I'll find him.<eos> I always do.
I was hoping to be able to tell Janet that story.<eos> S-She would have enjoyed it.<eos> S-She would've laughed...<eos> Anna Karenina... Tolstoy, you know... went on her way to the station to throw herself under a train... sees something funny which she thinks to tell Vronsky, her lover, about.<eos> We all do it.
What's the matter, Herb?<eos> I can't go on. My air supply has run out.<eos> I swear to you that I'd like to but I can't.<eos> We knew that this moment would come, didn't we?<eos> Susana, didn't we?
Do you help me?<eos> Do you support your husband?<eos> Do you help the children?<eos> Do you help us?<eos> Do you?
Think you can stand it?<eos> Say yes. Want me to kill your girl?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You want me to kill her.<eos> Don't you?
Mr. Cool, even you can't fly.<eos> Step aside, watch me.<eos> Careful.<eos> Go do your own thing.<eos> Do your own thing
And grab him if there's a chance.<eos> Notify the firemen.<eos> Sure.<eos> Don't curse!<eos> I didn't!
I didn't expect you to be him.<eos> I guess I got a little carried away.<eos> But, all I wanted to do was make you happy.<eos> - You did.<eos> - I did?
Slurping soup like an idiot!<eos> You sleep around for 2000 yen.<eos> You thought your daddy loved you.<eos> But he actually despised you, right?<eos> Why do you.?
He'll be there.<eos> - You cannot tell him the truth.<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - That's my point.<eos> - But I do.
I think I prefer the Lamborghini.<eos> You are the birthday girl.<eos> Could you do something with this?<eos> He doesn't sing in the car or in the shower.<eos> He doesn't even the national anthem at baseball games.
I was talking to Francie.<eos> I need to do something that's not job-related.<eos> So maybe the four of us should go to Lake Arrowhead for a few days next week.<eos> - I've got a trip tonight.<eos> - Of course you do.
- I'll lose my edge. - No, you won't.<eos> Now he knows I'm trying to offset his rhythm.<eos> He said that you could never beat him.<eos> Not on this case or any case.<eos> Oh, he did?
Never.<eos> This started two weeks ago when you decided you loved Ally.<eos> What did we agree to do?<eos> Declare your feelings.<eos> You didn't do that, did you?
To her when I got older.<eos> The truth is, I can't listen to music right now.<eos> You know, Malcolm, you're so smart and--<eos> You know tragedies happen to good people.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sex dance, makes us better lovers.<eos> Remember, your idea?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Listen if you really, really want to turn a woman on...<eos> - Do you?
- She said an errand.<eos> When you say you "think she went out" you mean you know she went out because you spoke to her.<eos> - Well, I suppose that--<eos> - Suppose? - I did.<eos> Yes, I did.
- So?<eos> We are talking about the same Cordelia Chase, right?<eos> Correct.<eos> - Knowing her...<eos> - But you don't.
- Actually, it's funny.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> - What do you mean? You said it did.<eos> - I did.<eos> - But it doesn't?
Desert me? Abandon me?<eos> Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?<eos> - I don't want to leave.<eos> - So don't.<eos> Please, don't.
I just don't understand. I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack.<eos> And I don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The magic, I thought I had it under control, and then...<eos> I didn't.
Okay, could you just stop looking at the book for a second?<eos> No. It's my book too.<eos> If you lived here, you could look at it all the time.<eos> I understand why you guys are asking me.<eos> I really, really do.
- But I don't know who.<eos> - We might.<eos> Frank Pirelli runs Luxiron.<eos> But he doesn't want a big merger to happen.<eos> And the Brotherhood does.
Pretty wack.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> - Talking.<eos> - But I don't hear anything.<eos> Oh, I do.
I was conducting research into how to accelerate osteoregeneration.<eos> Research that's allowing me to help your friend here.<eos> I transferred out of Manticore. I couldn't take it any more.<eos> Went down to El Salvador, or what used to be El Salvador before the invasion,<eos> - and did charity work in the countryside.
You two are from the same province?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't mean to be evasive.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, it's like this.<eos> Could you put down your fork for a second?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay. You know Max?<eos> - No, I don't.
Look, we're just trying to go to Disney world.<eos> Oh, that is so great!<eos> See? Get him a hat.<eos> [Exhales] You really... You really want me to sign it?<eos> Yes, we do.
Kelso said it would make us role models.<eos> I just assumed...<eos> Everybody assumes that I'm a good athlete, or that I grew up poor, or that I love Sanford and Son.<eos> But you do love Sanford And Son.<eos> We both do.
Why wouldn't I wanna go to the symphony?<eos> - l didn't mean anything by it.<eos> - You meant something.<eos> - We've got to do something.<eos> - No, we really don't.
Could we not have the strap-on conversation now?<eos> This night is hard enough as it is.<eos> - How does it work?<eos> - What did I say?<eos> It doesn't.
I can adjust my bra straps by myself.<eos> Please get your hands off my breasts!<eos> I'm not being fresh.<eos> I think I know what's best.<eos> No, you don't!
He saw me naked.<eos> Your boyfriend saw me naked on the floor on a bath mat!<eos> - Did he tell you that?<eos> - No, he's a gentleman.<eos> Well, he did!
- You know what, Ginnie?<eos> That is absolutely an inspired idea!<eos> Okay, ladies, let's get to bed.<eos> Because if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 a. M Derek doesn't let you in.<eos> So these tits do nothing for you, huh?
Let's get back to Gloria.<eos> She never wants any money neither.<eos> And you like this about her?<eos> She's, you know very independent-minded.<eos> That I do like.
- You wanna talk to your father?<eos> He's outside. - Burning a cross?<eos> I'm not sure I know what you're driving at, but I know now is not the proper time.<eos> - Here, your brother wants to talk to you.<eos> - No, I don't.
You said you wanted us to spend more time together.<eos> This isn't what I had in mind.<eos> Maybe... if we get back to the ship, we could try socializing a little more.<eos> This really isn't the place to be talking about this.<eos> Besides, I don't do a lot of socializing.
Right, trips are set.<eos> Take the nine mil.<eos> If we get into it, make every shot count.<eos> - I cannot let you do this, Colonel.<eos> - Do what?
It was also used to make her pregnant with the first organic version of that same supersoldier.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Help us catch him so we can put him down, before he finds her.<eos> - You assume I know where she is.<eos> - Who does?
All the sacrifice, the blood spilled.<eos> You've given nearly a decade of your life.<eos> Where the hell is it all gonna end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it doesn't.
- l'm trying to figure that out.<eos> - He's here with Agent Crane.<eos> - How the hell does he know Agent Crane?<eos> Damn good question.<eos> He doesn't.
- Do you dance, Mr. Del Valle?<eos> - Do I dance?<eos> I salsa, I rumba, I tango.<eos> Sometimes, I lambada.<eos> And once, at a bar mitzvah, I did the hokey-pokey.
You're going to give your recollections of the accident at the corner of State and Main.<eos> Would you please swear him in?<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
I don't see why you just don't quit.<eos> Because I want to fit in.<eos> Williams' party.<eos> I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace since I'm positive we won't have a decent table.<eos> But we do.
Just loose your grip up a smidge.<eos> -A man's grip is like a--<eos> -That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> -I know.<eos> -No, you don't.
Furthermore, Colonel Childers testified... that he never shoots unarmed people.<eos> My witness has an important perspective on that statement.<eos> I'm gonna allow the witness.<eos> Do you swear or affirm... that the evidence you shal I give in this case... shall be the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> Yes, I do.
Thank you.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Very sexy, you know.<eos> We never got it on, but.... I want you, Cleo.<eos> I really do, Cleo.
About you and Francoise.<eos> Whaddaya mean... me and Francoise?<eos> I mean, Richard,... - .. that I want her to be happy. - Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course.<eos> - We all do, right?
To be, or not to be?<eos> To be...<eos> So oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them or by some habit that too much o'er leavens the form of plausive manners, that these men carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<eos> their virtues else be they as pure as grace, shall in the general censure take corruption.<eos> How does my good Lord Hamlet?
A promise which he kept.<eos> While your visit seems heartfelt, I'm sure you will appreciate it will not change or interfere with this institution reaching a fair and proper decision in this case.<eos> There's one more issue here.<eos> Those words that I read today I didn't write them.<eos> Jamal Wallace did.
About busting the top people, the rich people.<eos> White people. Hey. - White people.<eos> I know, I know. I don't think she's in on it, man.<eos> She knows Arnie Metzger.<eos> So does half of San Diego.
Clearly, Darryl doesn't hear "no" much.<eos> I can't live here!<eos> I hate you!<eos> - William hates you.<eos> - I don't.
Take care of yourself.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Jimmy told you.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't, did he?
Anywhere there's action.<eos> In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> You don't seem to understand.<eos> So what if I don't?
Tobiah film has failed.<eos> He knew that my good because he worked as a sound recordist.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not involved in your movie, these fake suicide psychiatric.<eos> Sam did it.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.<eos> What I am saying is, we don't have a smoking gun that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.<eos> Something that proves that prior to 1987 PG and E Corporate knew the water was bad there and did nothing about it.<eos> - Erin, I thought you took a sick day.<eos> - So did I.
How's it going, Cherie?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think we should adjourn to the ladies' room.<eos> - But I don't have to go.<eos> - I do.
It's mayhem!<eos> It's chaos!<eos> Nobody saw anything!<eos> -You see anything, Matthews?<eos> -No, sir. I did!
No, you didn't.<eos> - I did.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Sure I did.<eos> - Anna, you didn't.
He's here somewhere, I promise.<eos> Yes, tell your ex that I'm available.<eos> That'll be quite difficult. Yes.<eos> No one wants me.<eos> Of course they do.
You and I made out. - And if I may, it was--<eos> - Sexy as hell. God.<eos> That's just what I was about to say.<eos> But I think I said it first, I think.<eos> - Oh, no, you did. - Oh.
-Am I hearing this?<eos> Look, you're really smart.<eos> If you send your application now, you could get into a good college.<eos> I don't want to go to college. I want to dance.<eos> Well, so do a lot of people.
- She's married?<eos> - Widow. One son.<eos> A sniveling, obsequious weasel of a human being.<eos> - You know her son?<eos> - So do you.
Everybody goes home.<eos> Go have fun somewhere else.<eos> The law...my ass!<eos> - So you guys resigned.<eos> - I did.
He won't have to worry for a while.<eos> That doesn't bother you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Why should I be bothered? Perhaps I have too many scruples.<eos> And I don't?
- This way.<eos> - No, the walk tired me.<eos> - Shall I? - No, stay.<eos> Your mother wasn't to go out.<eos> But she did.
No.<eos> - You didn't notice?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> - What did I do?<eos> Why doesn't anybody...
The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the right leg... in the form of a spiral fracture.<eos> There were 14 breaks.<eos> It simply shattered.<eos> They call me Mr. Glass.<eos> - Who does?
-The guys said you're interested in UFOs.<eos> -Yup.<eos> -Do you think they land here?<eos> -No, but they fly close to here.<eos> Do they?
Thought I was pretty convincing.<eos> We gotta do it! We have to do it!<eos> Think how sad Tigger's gonna feel.<eos> Oh, but we don't really know how to be a tigger.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Why do you hate my purity?<eos> - Your purity?<eos> You're such a sanctimonious hypocrite.<eos> I hate you Ramallo.<eos> - No, you don't.
For the life I never had.<eos> A life in your shadow. They created you.<eos> And they rejected me.<eos> Do it. Kill him, Fanny.<eos> Do it!
It's not optional.<eos> Now, go make an appointment before you do any more work on this case.<eos> Expect to see me come out in handcuffs? No.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you do somethin' bad?
But I can't see that it's important.<eos> It is completely unimportant.<eos> That is why it is so interesting.<eos> These shoes match the marks on the window sill precisely.<eos> Of course they do, Inspector.
It is completely unimportant.<eos> That is why it is so interesting.<eos> These shoes match the marks on the window sill precisely.<eos> Of course they do, Inspector.<eos> Of course they do.
Are you sure that's necessary?<eos> Yes, I think it is.<eos> Lola and I have been talking things over.<eos> And? I think we both know what I'm talking about.<eos> - We do, don't we? - Yes, we do.
His skull can't be as thick as we thought.<eos> It was like swatting a fly.<eos> The worst is over.<eos> He found out what you're made of.<eos> So did I.
What?<eos> You told me.<eos> Remember?<eos> "Something has to be done, Serge. "<eos> You did, didn't you?
I don't know, God illuminated me and I said,<eos> "Mess with me, you pay for it."<eos> He said, "Can you do that better?"<eos> I said yes, and in take two<eos> I did it the same way.
Not proof, only the memory.<eos> But believe me... that's enough.<eos> François, you and I are materialists.<eos> Don't tell me you no longer believe in hard evidence.<eos> - Of course I do. - Good.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Cause you'd get pissed off.<eos> No, why should I?<eos> You should know.<eos> Well, I don't.
Why d'you ask?<eos> Scared that you'd make us split up?<eos> Or that you wouldn't be able to?<eos> I would if I wanted to.<eos> But I don't.
If I were running it,perhaps I'd try to sustain his residency.<eos> But I'm not running it --neither are the three of you.<eos> From what I've seen,this falls within Mrs. Taylor's discretion.<eos> If she believes the welfare of the other residents iscompromised by his being here ...<eos> I do. ...
Finally, I went to a doctor.<eos> He tells me thatI have a fetish for wearing women's clothes.<eos> You see, this here is a medical thing.<eos> Did you tell Mr. Schoefieldthis was a medical condition?<eos> Yes, I did.
- What's the plan?<eos> - We want him dark, not dead.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - You stop. God doesn't want you.<eos> But I still do.
- I have to.<eos> If this enemy persists, our society crumbles.<eos> - Here, you'll have another enemy.<eos> - You don't understand, human.<eos> No, I don't.
Right. Yeah, I could see that except for the cars, the buildings and the, you know, everything else.<eos> It's not so different.<eos> People moving through their lives.<eos> I wonder if anything changes.<eos> Sure it does.
I don't care.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - I need it.<eos> No, you don't.
Maybe I have been blaming him.<eos> But how do I get past it?<eos> What if it's too late?<eos> What if after all this he doesn't want me any more?<eos> He does.
I have something for you too.<eos> Although not nearly as romantic, but still a good thing.<eos> Your first paycheque.<eos> Or cash, rather. I thought it'd be easier.<eos> So did I.
I have a feeling it's not gonna be that easy.<eos> I overheard some doctors talking.<eos> There's others here infected with the disease.<eos> - But I thought it wasn't contagious.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.
Don't you wanna sign Dad's birthday card?<eos> Why?<eos> He never sends me one.<eos> She's right.<eos> He doesn't to any of us.
That sounded much better in my head.<eos> They gave you our books, and you thought you'd drop them by.<eos> That wasn't so hard when you said it.<eos> I actually need the ones I bought, so if you don't mind, I...<eos> Of course you do. Okay.
No.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It just seems like whenever I get close to you you pull away from me.<eos> Why do you do that?
Does you ? thinking Patrick?<eos> I don't know, I'll ask him.<eos> That is the single lamest attempt anyone has ever made to get me to go out with him.<eos> Sally, how do you fancy coming with me at Susan's new boyfriend's ex's aunt's funeral?<eos> - I don't do funerals.
I work for Aamco.<eos> No, I'm not kidding you. I do.<eos> -Of course.<eos> He's terrific.<eos> -He does work for Aamco.
You know what?<eos> I have some pull there.<eos> -l used to know the governor.<eos> -Your daughter knows the governor?<eos> We both did, yes.
As his butler.<eos> And makes him do crazy things like bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That sounds a little familiar.<eos> Did they already do that?
This right here is where I keep the pizza.<eos> And that's where the napkin is.<eos> -What's that smell?<eos> -I know!<eos> I don't...
What the hell are you doing?<eos> What the hell am I doing?<eos> You just broke my fridge!<eos> What?<eos> How do..?
It's a relief to meet you, Amy.<eos> It's hard adjusting to all the strange stuff of the future.<eos> I'm from Mars.<eos> I feel so out of place. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.<eos> Because he didn't in your time.
No! I said "Doug," and then the "I love you"<eos> just slipped out right behind it. So call him back.<eos> I can't. He was calling me from the plane.<eos> Well, it's noisy in there, you know. Maybe he didn't hear you or understand what you said.<eos> Well, what if he did?
Doug?<eos> Yes?<eos> Did you just say you were gonna tell me you loved me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Some cultural reading, eh?<eos> What, all of a sudden you wanna be my yaga yaga?<eos> I asked around.<eos> People say you're cool.<eos> Do they?
I'm meeting Big for lunch and I didn't think you'd approve.<eos> - You're meeting Big?<eos> - He called.<eos> - He sounded upset and needed to talk.<eos> - Since when does Big talk?
- Go down there, make a left.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I do. I like all of it.<eos> Your writing is brilliant.<eos> I really do.
Whatever seems to be dominating your thoughts.<eos> I got pussy on the brain.<eos> I always do.<eos> I want to fuck you.<eos> I always did. "Do. "
I almost believed you.<eos> Continue.<eos> Stay.<eos> Voyager needs me. So do I.<eos> No, you don't.
- I mined.<eos> - No, what did you do?<eos> I remember shovelling ore into a cart.<eos> And?<eos> I did that a lot.
And... that is still the case.<eos> Clearly, we must gain your trust.<eos> They're transmitting visual.<eos> Now you can see foryourself that we are kindred.<eos> - We do.
It's just we've been worried about you.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> I just wanted you to express that to Mulder.<eos> - He's standing right here.<eos> Why don't you do that yourself.
So what do you think happened to Mulder?<eos> What's your theory?<eos> What's my theory?<eos> My theory is you don't know Mulder at all.<eos> You never did.
Do they come back to help?<eos> No, they're not coming.<eos> [SPEAKING IN ARABIC]<eos> said [lN ENGLISH]:<eos> Do your Army...
But it was cancelled!<eos> We never saw if you made it!<eos> Well, then, let's find out together!<eos> We did it! We did it! We did it!<eos> We did it! We did it! We did it!
You're playing somewhere else tonight?<eos> They only get started around 2.<eos> In the Village?<eos> Believe it or not, I don't actually know the address yet.<eos> You don't?
She doesn't let me get away with anything.<eos> It's the same for me.<eos> Except it's my dad.<eos> Know what would happen to an operator who got his sleeve caught in the press?<eos> Do you?
Have you ever done this before?<eos> Never.<eos> You're my only.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
And because you were curious?<eos> I suppose.<eos> Why did you ask me?<eos> Because I was curious also to see whether you'd come.<eos> And you did.
I know you're upset about the car, but you can't come in here.<eos> his is a patient's private session.<eos> You know me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, you don't.
- I heard it.<eos> It's not important now, but I did not betray you.<eos> I had a wire, but took it off because I think I can help.<eos> I don't want to know what you think.<eos> Yes, you do.
It doesn't work.<eos> It keeps them focused on something.<eos> The strong take it from the weak every time.<eos> And the rest of them focus their anger on the ones who take it... and not on the guards or medical staff.<eos> It does work. For us.
- What sort of danger?<eos> He went into Casanova's. He didn't come out.<eos> To the rescue!<eos> - It doesn't work.<eos> - No, it does.
Free my mind.<eos> What if he makes it?<eos> - No one's ever made their first jump.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But what if he does?
- Fuck off.<eos> Watch out I don't slit the fucking tires on your shitty car!<eos> - Shitty car!<eos> You speak German?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Your wife said that-- Your ex-wife said--<eos> Mister, I've been through all this before.<eos> The government, the police... and writers.<eos> People wanted to believe it was political... some conspiracy, some group.<eos> Happy and I did too.
- Get up!<eos> - Grab what you can!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Get up, man!<eos> - Just do it now!
We got John Sherlock Holmes in here.<eos> You've been fucking around too.<eos> Only after I found out.<eos> So, Zack, do you know who your girlfriend's fucking?<eos> No, Adam, I do not.
- Good luck, Doc.<eos> Please stand.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> WIGAND: I do.
- Take it easy.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Heard you did your husband.<eos> He probably deserved it.<eos> Mine did.
-Jeanne, look behind you!<eos> -Never look behind.<eos> Only ahead!<eos> Do you know how to count?<eos> Of course I do!
Of course it works.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't know how to install it.<eos> I don't know the credit union's software well enough.<eos> Yeah. But Samir does.
The pennies for everybody.<eos> Oh, for everybody.<eos> OK. Yeah. Well, those are whole pennies.<eos> I'm just talking about fractions of a penny, OK?<eos> But we do it from a much bigger tray... and we do it a couple of million times.
He'll keep liking me.<eos> Keep him right next to me.<eos> And you don't care what that makes you.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Do you really?
I got here right when you were being rushed to the hospital, you know.<eos> And when the cops left, I went up.<eos> Cos Amber had given me her key and told me where she had always hid her money.<eos> She always had some money set aside for her funeral cos she always knew that she was gonna die young.<eos> And of course, she did. Poor baby.
I said I wouldn't take PAC money.<eos> - That's when we didn't need it.<eos> - What do I say now?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth?<eos> I do.
45 what?<eos> Emmet, put that shit away.<eos> Wanna go to the dump, shoot some rats?<eos> -Shoot some what, man?<eos> I do it all the time.
Shut your fucking face Uncle fucker<eos> You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucker<eos> Okay, children, let's take our seats.<eos> We have a lot to learn today.<eos> We sure do, Mr. Hat.
... tobetheone thatbest depicted how we viewed the world.<eos> I remember some people picking books by the great thinkers...<eos> ... likeKierkegaardandplato.<eos> Some kids chose the bible.<eos> I did my paper on Harold and the Purple Crayon.
He's fuckin' exaggerating'.<eos> The kid was there lookin' like Night Of The Living Dead.<eos> My customers get nervous just from lookin' at him.<eos> So I go over and I ask him very nice... Come on! It didn't happen like that.<eos> - No, it fuckin' didn't!
You had some calls.<eos> Three shots, two massages.<eos> The names are by the mail.<eos> I try to be useful.<eos> Everyone does.
This guy named Jimmy Fordo.<eos> There's a basketball fix.<eos> I know the case.<eos> I think I understand where you're leading this.<eos> Do you?
- Rubin did it all himself, you know.<eos> Hey, Les, we didn"t feel sorry foryou.<eos> We met you and got to know you and realized you could accomplish some things... and, like a lot of us, you could use some help.<eos> I"m sure that Hurricane Carter had some help along the way.<eos> - None of us does it alone. - Hey.
I"m sure that Lesra wants to know what"s happening with your case too.<eos> My case is doing what it"s doing.<eos> I have to focus on the fact that I have to do the time.<eos> I do that by not allowing myselfto want or to need... anything.<eos> How do I do that?
Want to go in?<eos> No, I just stand here a second, Phil.<eos> Hey, wake up.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> How do we do this, then?
The whole thing was just... just a misunderstanding.<eos> Deliver the device to me, or I will destroy your ship.<eos> You know, um, we'd like do that, but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know what it is or even where it is.<eos> You have ten seconds!<eos> I don't... Ten seconds?
What do you have to say for yourself?<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> Do you have anything you'd like to confess?<eos> I didn't sneak out.<eos> No, I don't, but um...
No, but it's easy to find out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoever you are... I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.<eos> I can't drive.<eos> Nina does the driving.
It's the listless routine of the living dead who don't even know if they're living or dead.<eos> Don't fear the worst, enjoy the best.<eos> Maybe you're afraid of being dumped.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Good.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Where's Lardy Basto?<eos> - Chef left this morning, remember?<eos> - Damn, so he did!
Thank you, mother<eos> This Red Sword is my family's heirloom<eos> I am handing it over to you now.<eos> Take it<eos> And do well in your training with Master
We're not asking you to strangle her.<eos> What then?<eos> How much longer do we have to stay here?<eos> What if the event never occurs?<eos> And what if it does?
No.<eos> - Have you been christened?<eos> - I have no religion.<eos> Does that mean you don't believe in our one and only God?<eos> No, I don't.
Did you hear me?<eos> Sahane, Sahane!<eos> Melek, Sadiye, come here.<eos> Melek, I'm calling your mother, why doesn't she come?<eos> -She doesn't.
I wanted to get the best value out of whatever association we had with Giger.<eos> And so I was very specific about what I asked him to design.<eos> And he said he will give me $1,000, if I design the "face hugger" for him.<eos> And he described me this egg, and it was a big egg and I thought in this big egg must be a big beast, ja?<eos> So I did quite a big alien face hugger.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> It just took me three flights to get here.<eos> I don't know what to do, Dana.<eos> No one else does either.
I don't deny that.<eos> I like to feel attractive.<eos> And, truth be told, your "rule" about dating men at work... the word is, you kind of use that a little to make guys think:<eos> Ah, but for that rule, they might have a chance with you?<eos> Yes, I do that.
Objection.<eos> Sentimentality shouldn't go unpunished. Move for cause.<eos> - I think I'll overrule that.<eos> - Your mom told you about the souls?<eos> No. But he did.
Ah, here's the address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Great!<eos> Good, I'll, I'll see you tonight.<eos> I did, I just, uh...
I might just give up and start going after Billy.<eos> Kidding.<eos> Just, you know, for my own education what exactly do you see in her?<eos> I married her because she's beautiful.<eos> - So do many men, Mr. Goodman.
My case says, "Don't trust passion because even when you think you've found love it's temporary, even after nine years because the statute of limitations never runs out on his right to rip you into shreds. " Do you think?<eos> You know, that's exactly what I've been stuck on.<eos> This woman thought she had it. She's a smart woman.<eos> - I thought I had it with Billy.<eos> - You did.
She's being prosecuted for fraud.<eos> Because she married somebody who wasn't the man of her dreams.<eos> We'll have to build more prisons if we start arresting people for this.<eos> I suppose the real fraud is this mind set ingrained in us since childhood that people get the person of their dreams.<eos> Most don't.
Come on, take your coat off.<eos> John?<eos> - So that's not the case here?<eos> - Did you want it to be the case?<eos> Maybe I did.
This big dope thought he was exempt because he got enough idiots to vote for him.<eos> I' m not lit well.<eos> T o Ling and The Biscuit. We' re on a roll!<eos> - I told you I'd win, didn't I?<eos> - Yes, you did, Ling.
Farewell, Angel.<eos> Who knows when our paths will cross again.<eos> Wesley.<eos> - Do you know where you're headed?<eos> - Rogue demon hunters rarely do.
Is there something that you always wanted to say to your mother but never could?<eos> "Will you marry me?"<eos> Kate, you'd like to share something?<eos> We'd like to hear it.<eos> - No, I don't really.
Just let me talk to Giles.<eos> I swear...<eos> We're not bringing anybody else into this.<eos> Keep your head. This will blow over in a few days.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Me? I like it here.<eos> One thing I learned about Buffy.<eos> She's so cute when she's sleeping.<eos> Hey, I know a way to make investigating the Mayor even more boring.<eos> - On second thought, no, I don't.
- Now that's not fair.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Cos I'm doing the best I can, and it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.<eos> - And I see how you could feel that way.<eos> I do... - No, you don't.
- Whatever.<eos> - Say her name.<eos> - Dorkus.<eos> - Bite your tongue.<eos> - Do it for me.
I'm here because I'm worried about you two, in general.<eos> What happened before, when I changed, it won't happen again.<eos> That's not all I'm concerned about.<eos> I don't have to tell you that you and Buffy are from different worlds.<eos> No, you don't.
Don't love you?<eos> I'm sorry. You know what? I didn't know that I got a choice in that.<eos> I'm never gonna change. I can't change.<eos> I want my life to be with you.<eos> I don't.
Thanks.<eos> Hey. Don't forget your dress.<eos> Aren't you wearing it tonight?<eos> As much as I hate to admit it, I haven't finished paying for it yet.<eos> - Well, somebody did. - What? Who?
- Where's Phoebe?<eos> - Upstairs.<eos> But you might wanna knock.<eos> Phoebe, we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
- What's the matter, are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Brent, when they took you, were you wearing a sweatshirt with jeans and black high-tops?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I think I was.<eos> How did you...?
Thanks.<eos> Okay, this is a potion to induce sleep.<eos> This one is to repel an evil threat.<eos> And that one puts out a fire.<eos> - What kind of potion does that?
Yeah, what else is new?<eos> We'd better figure out a way to get the book back from Abraxas.<eos> If we don't, we're dead.<eos> But how? We don't know where the astral plane is.<eos> Yes, we do.
Show us the killing skills that made you a media darling.<eos> Do it! Kill them before they bring down our society!<eos> -Do it!<eos> -Do it!<eos> ALL: Do it!

And, Paula, let me give you a little advice, hide your laundry money.<eos> But seriously, Todd and I have been through a lot together:<eos> Bio class, the big games, keg parties at Phi Delt. Todd never touched the stuff.<eos> Oh, excuse me, I ordered the steak.<eos> No, sir, you didn't.
Help me out. I've been working very hard this year. I want a tan.<eos> Doug, tell him to do this.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> Richie, go do it.<eos> But, moose-- do it!
I wouldn'tjump to that conclusion.<eos> We've got Millennium Group symbols all over the place, and Peter Watts sneaking around.<eos> What conclusion would you jump to?<eos> I never had reason to doubt your commitment before, Rachel.<eos> - You still don't.
- Peter Watts.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He was in Seattle during the outbreak.<eos> He survived the virus. His whole family did.<eos> So did Frank, so did Jordan.
- I like when they cheer.<eos> I'm not scared anymore.<eos> That's good, Cyril, but you don't have to fight all the time.<eos> - I don't? - No, you don't.<eos> But, Ryan, you do.
- Yes, he does.<eos> - He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> To a psychiatrist?<eos> He does not.
- He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> To a psychiatrist?<eos> He does not.<eos> He does too.
In case you change your mind.<eos> -You know he's right.<eos> -Nothing will happen.<eos> Wake up, Tony!<eos> It already did!
Your men should have planted the bomb at the secondary plasma relay.<eos> The ship was still destroyed.<eos> The intercooler was the obvious choice for sabotage.<eos> Their security could have found the bomb before the ship left orbit.<eos> - But they didn't.
I'm telling you they're identical. I think.<eos> Do I have to throw you off this transport pad?<eos> One thing's for sure, their personalities aren't identical.<eos> How do we know the Regent will keep his word and send Zek back?<eos> You don't.
They're blocking our scans.<eos> We've lost them.<eos> They're gone now, Tuvok.<eos> I told you you'd be safe.<eos> Yes... you did.
We need to know how the link was created.<eos> But our memories are...<eos> Fragmented, disorganized.<eos> We hoped that you would know.<eos> I don't.
- He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?
- Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> - What if they don't?
It doesn't quite track with Linea's nickname.<eos> - Destroyer of Worlds.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That one.<eos> Well, actually, in sort of a sick way, it does.
Know that you are a great leader of our people, and you are most welcome.<eos> I sense we knew each other well before my memory was lost.<eos> Did we?<eos> No.<eos> No, we never really did.
- l won't be coming back.<eos> Who's there?<eos> - lt's me.<eos> - You came.<eos> I almost didn't.
I can't even remember a time when I did.<eos> This is...<eos> This is all I know... to do.<eos> You know I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Faye: Hold on! Spike:<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> She said she'll be waiting there.<eos> She said you'd know what she meant.<eos> Well, I don't. Sorry.
I was mortified.<eos> Thought you were an epileptic, so I went home and told Mama you had a seizure in my mouth.<eos> I was over the moon for you back then, Birdee.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I miss all that.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> You know, it's so easy to believe him, but you know what?<eos> I think it's me.<eos> I do, because...
- Can't get through the mud!<eos> - Keep going! Help me, you assholes!<eos> Hey, you kids, stay right there, now.<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - We didn't do nothing!
- Yeah, I'll call Bob.<eos> - No, he works for Wei.<eos> Everybody works for Wei.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wantsomeone who doesn't.
He made it happen.<eos> We better not piss him off.<eos> It's not that different from a child, right?<eos> A child imagines that what it's imagining happens.<eos> But it doesn't.
Look, Truman. The happiest day of our lives.<eos> - Look!<eos> Jean, Jodie, Joanne...<eos> - Doesn't she look beautiful?<eos> Well, she still does.
As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> How can you be certain to find them?<eos> And if you find them, are they really the one for you or do you only think they are?<eos> What if the person you're meant to be with never appears?<eos> Or she does, but...
You want me to follow him into the city?<eos> Yeah, we both will.<eos> - Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.<eos> - I already made a mess of everything.<eos> Yeah, you really did, Audrey.
I want to talk about something else.<eos> Yeah, but this interests me, so tell me.<eos> You want to know?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> Yes I do.
-I don't think so.<eos> I don't have her address or telephone number.<eos> If she wanted you to have it, she'd have given it to you.<eos> Sometimes girls forget to...<eos> No they don't.
What point?<eos> Phillippe is right.<eos> We haven't given him a reason to do what we ask.<eos> I understand your reason, Athos.<eos> You do?
That's where we're goin', Simon.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is that you, Art?<eos> I'm a United States marshal with the Witness Protection Program.<eos> How do you do?
And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.<eos> Well, I think Ping and I can take you.<eos> - I don't wanna take him anywhere.<eos> - Ping, we have to fight.<eos> No, we don't.
That might prove to be easy by comparison.<eos> It woυldn't sυrprise me in the least.<eos> - So yoυ shut off the heat already.<eos> - You know how this works, Danny.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It says 8:25.<eos> Don't mind that clock, it always breaks down.<eos> No offence, but do you really think we can make San Malina in two hours?<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - You did last night.
-Emile, the guy you used to work for?<eos> He gave me your number and where you live.<eos> I'm looking for an assistant.<eos> Can I speak to you?<eos> You did work for Emile?
The reason you're here and you don't know why is because I sent for you.<eos> When I was a little girl I worked a spell so I would never fall in love.<eos> I asked for qualities in a man that I knew couldn't possibly exist.<eos> One green eye, one blue?<eos> But you do.
I'm right, aren't I?<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> Why don't you do what you do and I do what I do and we'll see where we end up.<eos> Curses only have power when you believe in them.<eos> And I don't.
Really? I'll have to take your word for that.<eos> Oh, no. I'm sorry.<eos> KAYLEY:<eos> It means he knows where Excalibur is.<eos> Sure he does. In Camelot.
No, no, my mistake.<eos> Just hot air.<eos> [Sticks twitter]<eos> Kayley, I must tell you, I knew your father.<eos> You did?
You don't think I'll kill you, a priest.<eos> You're seriously misjudging me!<eos> You want to kill me, you go ahead!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> I don't.
Sometimes it's like I'm driving down a winding road.<eos> suddenly, I feel I've no control.<eos> Someone else controls it.<eos> Maybe the illuminati don't exist.<eos> Maybe they never did.
I mean, I'm standing here with Mary Jensen.<eos> No, no.<eos> Now it's Mary Matthews.<eos> Oh.<eos> Did you...
- Not long enough, apparently.<eos> How much longer before he gives up the other cells?<eos> - He can't, if he doesn't know where they are.<eos> - He knows.<eos> He doesn't.
- Hub, I'm here.<eos> No shots, Frank.<eos> Samir.<eos> - Do you wanna die?<eos> - Do you?
You're not ready.<eos> I'm fond of industrial architecture.<eos> I find that in this area it blends very well.<eos> The two stacks of the Tricastin power plant, they don't bother or shock me.<eos> They do me.
I don't want to shock you, but I wanted to love you, and I'm frustrated.<eos> OK, stop this nonsense.<eos> I'm suggesting you love someone who's very available.<eos> I can see why you're hurt, but if it works you won't have wasted your time.<eos> And if it doesn't?
No, it's true.<eos> We always know what the other one is thinking.<eos> You know what I'm thinking now, don't you, sis?<eos> Not really.<eos> Yes, you do.
We always know what the other one is thinking.<eos> You know what I'm thinking now, don't you, sis?<eos> Not really.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Where are the glasses? Where is Michelle ?<eos> With Kim.<eos> Everybody sleeps in the wrong bed.<eos> Not us, ey darling ?<eos> We don't do that.
A boy that cleans car windows on the streets was brought here...<eos> He was run over by a bus on the boulevard.<eos> I already told you it's forbidden.<eos> Listen, the coroner knows me.<eos> Does he?
He had never asked about it.<eos> For the first time in a long while, Jack thought about his mother.<eos> She'd left when she couldn't take it any more.<eos> His father had said, don't worry Jack, oh, she'll come back.<eos> She didn't.
The woman thinks I'm gonna marry her.<eos> But you know me.<eos> Well, it's a shame that things never worked out, but we saw you all right.<eos> You didn't gamble the ten grand, did you?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I did.
Hey! Trying to kill someone?<eos> That's not a sword!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Nobody does.
No, enough.<eos> There is a thief out there.<eos> Hide in darkness, and one day the dark will reveal you.<eos> People should trust each other.<eos> But we don't.
Yes.<eos> - How sweet.<eos> Why did you lie at college then?<eos> Actually boys don't go to the temple. So!<eos> But you do...
- Stools are the main assets o f a bar.<eos> - To hell you will.<eos> He may open, he may close, he may go bankrupt.<eos> - What happened? - I'm leaving.<eos> Well done, Ay la.
- You'll hand him Tupperware?<eos> Metal isn't allowed. Plastic is okay.<eos> Who gets to burp it?<eos> - Why does it bother you?<eos> - It doesn't.
Absolutely.<eos> Wonder why I went down a one-way?<eos> - I was going one way.<eos> - Have you been drinking?<eos> No, I don't...
Not what I meant.<eos> I am very, very happy in the bed.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth?<eos> - I do.
They' re not entitled to take him from the game. It's their duty.<eos> A fiduciary duty to their shareholders who put their trust in T amarack Mosely.<eos> He's being fired not for anything he did but because of his belief in something supernatural.<eos> - Because he says he saw it.<eos> - Maybe he did.
It's irregular, but I'll let him ask a few questions.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Why do you say you love her?<eos> - Maybe because I do.
Talk about a legacy.<eos> Loving somebody forever.<eos> That's a legacy.<eos> You want his world to go on, Sam.<eos> So does he.
All right, I know that you have this great idealism about marriage, but...<eos> - And please don't shoot the messenger.<eos> - What?<eos> Married couples, they don't talk.<eos> - They don't?
The mundanes.<eos> We weren't supposed to fight each other.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I truly don't.
I was stationed at an Earthforce base near a mining company a few years ago.<eos> A rogue telepath was messing with my people.<eos> First, cheating them in the casino and later he killed two of them because they found out what he was.<eos> We couldn't find him.<eos> Bester did.
If you will not tell me, why am I here?<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Night-night.<eos> Let's get what we came for, dears.<eos> Bottom line is, even if you see 'em comin.... ..you're not ready for the big moments,<eos> No one asks for their life to change, not really,<eos> But it does,
- It doesn't matter what I feel!<eos> Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!<eos> Will that help?<eos> Is that what you need to hear?<eos> I don't.
- You don't care any more? Is that it?<eos> - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter what I feel.<eos> - Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!<eos> Will that help?<eos> I don't.
- It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter what I feel.<eos> - Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!<eos> Will that help?<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't!
It doesn't matter what I feel.<eos> Then tell me you don't love me!<eos> Say it!<eos> Is that what you need to hear? Will that help?<eos> I don't.
Then tell me you don't love me!<eos> Say it!<eos> Is that what you need to hear? Will that help?<eos> I don't.<eos> - I don't.
Buffy, I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you keep a level head.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom.<eos> I know how hard this is for you.<eos> OK, I don't.
Her eyes did.<eos> Begging "Let me go. "<eos> And did you?<eos> She found the other plane.<eos> And so did I.
She was sent here to tempt me with a question about...<eos> - About the Millennium Group?<eos> - About my life.<eos> And I didn't know until this moment that she didn't have the answer.<eos> Do you?
Female, 26.<eos> Librarian at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.<eos> - She's the victim.<eos> - Just because she uses the computer?<eos> No. Because he does.
- Commander.<eos> - Ensign.<eos> The engine room reports that we have power spikes cropping up all through the start-up routine.<eos> - l thought we had that under control.<eos> - l did too.
I know this is hard for you to believe but the entire time you thought I had disappeared on P3R-233 I was experiencing an alternate reality.<eos> And you were there and you were there, and there's no place like home.<eos> As a matter of fact, you were there!<eos> Daniel, it's not that we don't believe you...<eos> - So you do? - No!
But I'm right, aren't I?<eos> Your name is Martouf.<eos> It is.<eos> - How do you know me?<eos> - I don't.
I'd prefer you address me as Dr Langford.<eos> You were wearing a remote device.<eos> You had SG-1's code.<eos> How did you obtain it?<eos> How did I...?
Just... Just slide across.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Thor shook the beam!<eos> He wants me dead!<eos> - No, he doesn't!
They carried along small, more portable sources with them.<eos> I expected them to come home, I waited.<eos> This is home, after all.<eos> But they...didn't.<eos> And the rest did not except the gift,...
Can ya dig it?<eos> They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> Talkin' 'bout Shaft.<eos> I did not.
- How long did you know him?<eos> It was two months and two days.<eos> Why wait when it's true love?<eos> - You never know how long you have.<eos> - No, you don't.
A man was also found in his bathroom with all his soft tissue removed.<eos> Well, if he's dead, there's nothing you need from me.<eos> Sir, my name is Mulder.<eos> You know that name.<eos> And so did Edward Skur.
Ma'am!<eos> Mr. Vash.<eos> A lot of people say that!<eos> I see.<eos> Do they now?
The show's over.<eos> You were trying for a ricochet all along!<eos> But it's too soon for the curtain call.<eos> the fate of the dying.<eos> Don't!
That's why this competition is a problem. It sure is!<eos> You can be proud of her though, us too.<eos> Top in maths in France.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> But 3 days in Brussels, I don't...
... shehadneeds.<eos> She didn't want to go behind my back.<eos> She suggested the chair.<eos> She hoped I might get to like sitting there.<eos> I didn't.
To make a statement, as must we.<eos> But Christ lost.<eos> - You, I think... - No, sir, he did not.<eos> Or, at least you, Mr. Joadson, want to win, don't you?<eos> - Yes. - I certainly do.
Please . Call me Richee<eos> Miss Fagina . Your boss, Number Two...<eos> I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't, baby.
They're gone.<eos> I'm 1 00% sure.<eos> They're not gone. "We were here." I can't believe it.<eos> We haven't heard from them in ages.<eos> And we always did before.
You're not a yellow star with me, remember?<eos> I don't want....<eos> What?<eos> To miss it.<eos> But do you?
- Mouth.<eos> - Cock.<eos> - Do you feel my cock?<eos> - Do you feel my mouth?<eos> Yes. Do you....
What can I say? Friendship runs deep.<eos> -Now, move the goddamn cars.<eos> -I guess I overestimated your intelligence.<eos> You didn't actually think I was going to let that bus leave, did you?<eos> actually, I didn't.
I am a star.<eos> I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.<eos> My cock can get hard.<eos> Come on. Fuck.<eos> Please don't do this to me.
Mr. Lomax....<eos> I call Melissa Black.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Shit, did you see that?<eos> You like her.<eos> N-No.<eos> You don't?<eos> Do you or don't you?
Strange, my hands smell like meat.<eos> This is the famous Dobermann?<eos> He is the famous Dobermann.<eos> He looks like a junkie.<eos> They all do.
- Mean it!<eos> Don't sell it!<eos> Come over here.<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> I always do, champ.
That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.<eos> I went on the record with you.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I think I do.<eos> You do?
Captain Miller, I just wanted to say that...<eos> The clock is ticking, Doctor.<eos> Waiting for a personal invitation, Mr Smith?<eos> - No, sir!<eos> - Captain, I don't...
This is not something that's in our heads.<eos> Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?<eos> No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir, but this ship is fucked.<eos> Well, thank you, Mr Smith.<eos> Yeah, you don't...
- Keep him talking.<eos> - Yes, I heard it.<eos> What is it?<eos> It shows you things... horrible things.<eos> What does?
Am I clear?<eos> - A barge is approaching the bridge.<eos> Go to the centre of the bridge and throw the case on the barge.<eos> - How do I know you'll release her?<eos> - You don't.
I've got to get back to work.<eos> Call me, we can get together.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - And you think Max sent it?<eos> - Barry does.
Who did she associate with?<eos> Who did she want to associate with?<eos> Which teachers did she like and dislike?<eos> Which boys did she like?<eos> Or maybe she didn't like?
You were sick, and I brought him to you.<eos> You said, "We'll call him Lhamo," and you went to pray.<eos> I slept and later went outside and saw them.<eos> A pair of crows had come to nest on our roof as if they had come for Lhamo.<eos> Just as they did for the Dalai Lama.
He does the claw.<eos> The what?<eos> The claw.<eos> You know, it's like this...<eos> I don't...
... youandIwillendit.<eos> You lost the exclusive.<eos> No, I didn't. I did not lose it.<eos> -Made us look preposterous.<eos> -I didn't.
So am I.<eos> Straight to my house.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
It's a strong word, and I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified--<eos> I wouldn't be totally off base if I said that in her way...<eos> -...she does possess strong feelings--<eos> -Jules!<eos> Sure she does, Michael.
I want twenty thousand more.<eos> If you don't pay me, you'd better do it yourself.<eos> What kind of gun have you prepared for me?<eos> I want a magnum.<eos> If no, then do it yourself.
What do you do?<eos> I write plays for the radio.<eos> There's no such thing now!<eos> I mean, I thought they stopped years ago.<eos> Do people still do radio plays?
I'm saying it because it's just something I know about myself.<eos> So... if you need more time or whatever...<eos> I don't need any more time.<eos> I am just so madly in love with you.<eos> I don't...
Are you certain you're prepared to proceed?<eos> Yes, Your Honour.<eos> Very well, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will support the constitution of the United States faithfully, and conduct yourself to the best of your abilities, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Oh, there it is.<eos> This is the-the apparatus.<eos> And very simply... when positively charged deuterons... are attracted to the palladium cathode... they cram together... and there are millions of them inside the cathode... getting closer and closer, and then they fuse... and they create energy in the form of helium.<eos> But I read somewhere... that the experiment couldn't be replicated... so how do we know it works?<eos> We don't.
But, strange as it seems, I understand what you're doin' and why you're doin' it.<eos> So I'm gonna offer you an opportunity.<eos> Get out of this.<eos> Before it gets so fucked up nobody could ever recover. Understand what I'm sayin' ?<eos> Yes, you do.
Tell 'im, Max.<eos> Tell 'im !<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Motherfucker ! t.k., bring your bag over here !<eos> now ! do it !
Just... just very... very angry.<eos> Should I keep reading?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tomorrow I'm gonna put Sean on the bus, and he won't want to go.<eos> He never does.
What does "need" mean?<eos> What does "help" mean?<eos> Don't you need money?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course I do...
I'm a murderer.<eos> I tried to forget, but these hands can't.<eos> The blade slashing her flesh... Stabbing deep into her body.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Why did you do it?
There's a couple of thousand patients. They're doing surgery in the street.<eos> We can't possibly save everybody.<eos> Oh, I know that.<eos> I sent them all over there along with my daughter.<eos> I don't...
He raped a nun.<eos> -And...<eos> -l don't want to know an "and." Why is there an "and"?<eos> He's fine as long as he gets his medications.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Robert Biberti.<eos> I represent the financial interests of the group.<eos> That's right.<eos> - Mr. Biberti represents our interests.<eos> - Then he does a poor job of it.
The truth is that I use him.<eos> - What?<eos> - Billy.<eos> When I feel insecure or unsteady I grab ahold of things that steady me.<eos> - Billy does that.
I'll-<eos> - I'll um--<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> She knows.<eos> She does?
Suit yourself.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Richard said denim smells.<eos> It doesn't, does it?<eos> No. No, it doesn't.
- Well, then, let's open them up.<eos> - Hey, that's private property. - We've got rights. - You're gonna have my foot 16 inches up your butt if you don't get the hell out of my way.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I'm gonna file a report with your superior officer.<eos> Well, you do that, sunshine.
We'll put up a good fight.<eos> If there's anything that you or your crew need anyone you want us to get ahold of...<eos> They're Minbari, captain.<eos> They knew what they were signing on for.<eos> So did I.
Who you are?<eos> The Watcher? Snivelling, tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin?<eos> I think not.<eos> I know who you are, Rupert, and I know what you're capable of.<eos> But they don't, do they?
Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.<eos> - Talk to him.<eos> Find out everything he knows.<eos> - You haven't told me jack, so why the order?<eos> Just do it!
- What do you know about this?<eos> You're never gonna die.<eos> Do you think I want anything to happen to you?<eos> We just gotta figure out a way...<eos> I already did.
We will.<eos> For someone who's all-powerful, you sure do like to hide.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> I want this moment to last.<eos> Well, I don't.
- I am helping you.<eos> - You're doing what you're told.<eos> Buffy's trying to help you, too.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Or Xander does.
Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.<eos> Anything we might've heard of?<eos> Home is never far away<eos> Home is Homestar Stew.<eos> But I don't do that anymore.
Then you'd be a strange, strange man.<eos> You should have him automate your house.<eos> Hey! Don't start, Delores!<eos> Tim doesn't like to be pushed into buying things.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
The conclusion is that the killer didn't know about Jack's arthritis.<eos> You were right.<eos> L was wrong.<eos> L believed in Alan Rokesmith.<eos> His sister did.
She treats embezzlers like she treats every other criminal.<eos> Which means she is taking the law into her own hands.<eos> I have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.<eos> - How do you know where to look?<eos> - I don't.
Just to say hi.<eos> He said he couldn't see me last night.<eos> He was working.<eos> - He said he was working for you.<eos> - He did?
I thought about it for a long time.<eos> I fantasized about it.<eos> Do you have a wife and family?<eos> - Then you know what I'm talking about.<eos> - No. I don't.
- No.<eos> There is someone out there who believes in May 5.<eos> He's responsible for the death of two girls already.<eos> I need to know who else believes in Earth changes.<eos> - Einstein did.
She's dead.<eos> She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> You think you know me, Frank.<eos> But you don't them.
A paint swatch.<eos> - Does that mean anything to you?<eos> - No. Should it?<eos> In all likelihood, it was a message he intended me to understand.<eos> - But you don't?
- Bambi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My ex was a big hunter.<eos> He was always going off with his buddies, so I said to him one time, "Take me."<eos> After some complaining, he did.
- I hate needles.<eos> - Everybody does.<eos> - Then I have to drill.<eos> - I hate drills.<eos> Right now, so do I.
I think so.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is what? I don't even know what you're looking for.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, you're Falcon, of course.<eos> Falcon?<eos> Again?<eos> I'm tired of being the bad guy.<eos> But you do it so well.
He's not a child.<eos> - He's responsible for his own actions.<eos> - l don't care.<eos> It's wrong and I want him back.<eos> And so do I.
Then what was she doing here?<eos> I know how you feel about her, Major but there's no reason to be concerned.<eos> You don't know how much I wish I could believe that.<eos> You didn't link with her, did you?<eos> Actually, I did.
I have to make that call because I'm responsible for what happened here.<eos> Jadzia knows what I'm talking about.<eos> She's the one who insisted that the Defiant investigate this planet.<eos> You know as well as I do that you should have been more careful... you should have seen that the barrier was unstable when you scanned it.<eos> But I didn't.
Every time I walk into the room, he smiles.<eos> It's probably gas.<eos> Thanks. You always know just the right thing to say.<eos> How's my baby boy? He recognized me.<eos> Did he?
- What did you do, Chief?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> - What's the matter, Patrick?<eos> - He doesn't like me.<eos> Sure I do.
- lt's all right, Julian.<eos> - Go play with your friend. We'll be fine.<eos> - You want me to play with you, Chief?<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do.
Would you, uh, like me to call everyone together?<eos> Have Prylar Quen say a few words.<eos> There's nothing left to say.<eos> I didn't think you would come.<eos> Well, for a while there, neither did I.
I am simply responding to your erroneous statement.<eos> Something tells me you just hate to lose an argument.<eos> Losing is irrelevant.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> I do not.
And then the men came.<eos> Papa tried to fight them, but they were too strong.<eos> I tried to hide.<eos> Maybe they wouldn't find me because I was little.<eos> But they did.
There seems to be some question in their minds as to whether Dr Jackson is dead.<eos> You were the only witnesses.<eos> If you deny what you saw...<eos> No, sir. I saw him die.<eos> We all did.
I have no intention of killing him.<eos> However, if Shak'I dose survive his injuries he will tell the Goa'uld where to find you.<eos> Look, obviously your medicine is very well it's very effective.<eos> But how do you defend yourselves?<eos> We don't.
- Oh, you know, I...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't feel sick at all.<eos> Your IVIRls and your charts aren't here yet. But I have an idea what to expect.<eos> You probably do too, from your medical training.
- These people are now dead.<eos> - No, it's not what you think.<eos> - You know who this old man is, don't you?<eos> - I don't. I swear to you.<eos> But Jason does.
Yours isn't the first gun I've had pointed in my face, Mr Skinner.<eos> I'm not afraid to die.<eos> But if you kill me, you'll also kill Agent Scully.<eos> You have no intention of saving her.<eos> You never did.
I had no choice.<eos> They were trying to kill me.<eos> - You tried to kill Sean.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
I have some advice for you right now.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I said, "Don't move!"<eos> I didn't, asshole!
Look at the way he's standing.<eos> He's not gay?<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> I don't...
It might have worked.<eos> Didn't you think this information was important?<eos> I don't see the relevance.<eos> - You don't see a small connection?<eos> - No, Agent Ford, I don't.
Let me get back to you.<eos> We're missing the best part.<eos> You know it by heart.<eos> I saw you lip-synching.<eos> Well, lucky I do.
Tea Party?<eos> Ilario?<eos> It doesn't matter who told me that.<eos> You don't want to know what happened out there, sir.<eos> Yes, I do.
- And simpler than going to a salon.<eos> Wait. watch.<eos> - Make me blonde.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Do something to me.
I had a dream about you.<eos> I saw them shoot you and your son.<eos> I saw you drowning.<eos> How did I survive?<eos> You didn't.
Mr. Hale!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Well, I see you've come well-prepared.<eos> - This is Thomas Putnam.<eos> - How do you do?
Did you ever see Giles Corey with the devil?<eos> Or his wife?<eos> I did not see them.<eos> Did you ever see anyone with the devil?<eos> No, I did not.
OK. 50 cents.<eos> And that's it.<eos> Get in there!<eos> Get in there!<eos> - I did it!
-They're good, just a little rusty.<eos> -Give them to me!<eos> It means nothing.<eos> The pool was empty and maybe he saw them at the bottom.<eos> I didn't. Did you?
I should have known!<eos> Go on.<eos> Kill me!<eos> I don't want to kill you!<eos> I never did!
We did Nam, we lost.<eos> We did the Gulf, we won.<eos> What changed?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing ever does.
Politicians put a lot of pressure on you with this, huh?<eos> - You mean the Attorney General's office.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Who said I was talkin' to them?<eos> - You just did.
- How much?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Yes. How much?<eos> We already discussed that.<eos> I didn't. Did you?
You know that feeling? You're not completely embarrassed yet but you glimpse tomorrow's embarrassment?<eos> Don't worry about it, boss.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You said "boss."<eos> - Yeah, I did.
I must see the Commander.<eos> Get him.<eos> They are bandits.<eos> You think I didn't try to arrange a trade?<eos> I did.
Only he can stop this.<eos> - What if he won't jack-in?<eos> Tell him I'm building his chip.<eos> - My dog does not stink.<eos> - Yes, it does, Shawn...
You give me that little gun and I'll give you some candy.<eos> Take the kid out of here.<eos> -Let's go, kid.<eos> How'd I shoot?<eos> -You did.
- I took care of it, pal.<eos> - I'll go to North Hollywood.<eos> - I'll do that on the way.<eos> - Reseda?<eos> - Already did it.
There was someone else in that room, Mr Vail.<eos> - There was a third person?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Did you tell the police this?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I swear to you right now.<eos> Now, more than ever this guy will pay.<eos> Can I have a chocolate bar?<eos> - I know you.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Stu did it.<eos> He killed Billy! He killed my Tatum! - You did it!<eos> Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!<eos> Give me that gun! Christ, man!<eos> No, I didn't.
They stay back and let me do my time.<eos> If I play that game and hurt one of them, they just might change my cushion.<eos> I'm not saying we gotta win.<eos> I just don't want to take a beating.<eos> You do, every day.
Did you think the men who did the shooting were going to kill everybody in McHale's?<eos> I really didn't know what to think.<eos> I just knew that the man had been shot.<eos> Did you think you might be shot dead by the two cold-blooded killers?<eos> Yes, I did.
-lt'll be 20 years this spring.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> -I'm a priest.<eos> In the case of The People of the State of New York against John Reilly and Thomas Marcano, do you swear the evidence you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?<eos> I do.
- It's on tape!<eos> We now know about the cameras.<eos> - So what?<eos> The cops don't like me.<eos> Nobody does.
- Thank you.<eos> That's all. The witness is excused.<eos> Detective Liam Casey<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Allow me to quote from your official student handbook.<eos> "Abstinence saves lives."<eos> Constant, never-ending self-love.<eos> Would you rather he do what he did or be out there breeding?<eos> And I did the Bundy at the Ice Capades.
It should never be a joke to them, Vir.<eos> Never let them think that.<eos> I won't.<eos> I hope you don't mind the rush to get you off station but the doc says that injection's gonna wear off soon.<eos> I do, indeed.
- No sign of a body.<eos> - You will not find one.<eos> - Then how do you know he's dead?<eos> - I know.<eos> So do the Vorlons, somehow.
Doctor, we cannot let him die.<eos> That'll happen if we don't get him to Medlab right away.<eos> Security is very tight, and the Narns are at all of the customs areas.<eos> How do we know whom to trust?<eos> You don't, but I do.
One little scream, and he will let you live!<eos> And we will both get what we want.<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Oh, yes.<eos> But you did not think to clean up your mess.<eos> If a few of their minions, their dark servants, came to Centauri Prime well, where is the harm in that, yes?<eos> You want to see the harm?<eos> Do you?
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, lady! Hey, wait up!<eos> - How do you know my dad?<eos> - Um, well, I don't really.
Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing or I'd paid more attention or I had a uterus.<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> - I know.<eos> You know, you don't deserve this.<eos> You don't, Ross.
What could she possibly see in Jason?<eos> That guy's dad drives a Pacer.<eos> Well, Randy's really hurting.<eos> You remember what it feels like to be rejected.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, actually, I didn't...<eos> Sparky owns one of Michigan's hot rod detail shops - that specializes in interiors.<eos> - He's an expert upholsterer.<eos> Well, if I may say so myself, I'm pretty nimble with a thimble.<eos> - And you just did.
At least for now.<eos> So to review:<eos> Since I am absolute ruler, it follows you are my slaves.<eos> Behold your ruler and bow down.<eos> We don't do much bowing here in Kansas.
What is it you suspect me of exactly?<eos> Look, Lois means everything to Clark.<eos> Everything.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Of course I do.
Give her that.<eos> Or do you want me to beg again?<eos> And you said I couldn't love.<eos> How little you understood me.<eos> How little anyone ever did.
You're gonna be on COPS?<eos> It's my life's dream to be on COPS.<eos> But, Al, I work alone.<eos> You lose three partners in a week and suddenly nobody wants to ride with you.<eos> I do.
Everyone who knows you and loves you understands that.<eos> We want to do what's right here.<eos> We want to stand by Connie.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> - Part of me does.
Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
Can I tell you something?<eos> Honestly? You kind of suck at piping.<eos> If you're going to suck at piping and also not shoot birds, you're not going to be a McMillan Man.<eos> Leslie will most likely fire me out there.<eos> Leslie won't.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
I'll see you at the beach.<eos> I can't go to the beach.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not going to the beach.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.
I'm not going to the beach.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You will.
- What?<eos> You know I don't really use that word.<eos> Yeah, man, I know, but, uh...<eos> I just really heard you say it, though.<eos> And now he won't anymore.
What are you doing out here?<eos> It's quiet.<eos> Kirkman's still in surgery?<eos> There was a complication, but, uh... it looks like he'll pull through.<eos> So will we.
I knew they had Luke.<eos> I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder. Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me, if they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
We haven't...<eos> It's too soon.<eos> Sorry, my bad, I guess.<eos> - I guess we should eat... - Yeah.<eos> - And then we'll...
Brazil!<eos> One of the best efforts I have ever seen.<eos> But, as we enter the final level, he's found a worthy challenger in Ludwig Hefele.<eos> With phenomenal parkour skills, Ludwig Hefele, he's got the speed...<eos> Wills his way back!
- Take off your mask.<eos> - No.<eos> No way.<eos> No one's ever seen me without this mask.<eos> And no one ever will.
With their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Hmm.<eos> And tonight, they will.
I have a meeting with him at 3:00.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna work.<eos> - But what if the king arrives today?<eos> - He won't.
Do not die!<eos> I want to see it again ... last time.<eos> I promise!<eos> I swear today until the end of days, I will love you and honor you, if you are with me.<eos> I will, now and forever.
Uh, well, I... I haven't heard back from them.<eos> But this is an option, a really good one.<eos> I just want the best for you, baby.<eos> We'll make it without you...<eos> By the skin of our teeth, we will.
You're fine!<eos> Let me call her!<eos> Ok, we'll call her, but calm down. You'll calm down?<eos> I'll call her.<eos> No, I will.
Ooh, Smithers.<eos> More face hardener.<eos> Never!<eos> Well, if you want to tamp down a potential rebellion, might I suggest a party after work.<eos> A sweethearts dance, if you will.
Ciro, if they go, we'll lose the best money-making spots.<eos> This fuck up can really cost us.<eos> She left the shop keys, she's not back and doesn't answer her phone.<eos> - You have to find her, Luciano.<eos> - We will, Prince.
Once you told me...<eos> you wanted me to feel whole.<eos> That you wanted that more than you wanted to be with me.<eos> I couldn't imagine what you meant or who I would be if that happened.<eos> And maybe it never will.
Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
What about those three lives?<eos> Then why did you toast me earlier?<eos> One lives through one's conscience.<eos> I will bring the children to the Capital.<eos> You Will?
I'm not sure this is maybe the right place to discuss this.<eos> How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.
Don't you dare.<eos> What did I say? You don't trust me.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Trust is not going to fix this, John.<eos> Nothing will.
Theycanhelpyou .<eos> Father marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'cause the demon will.
I think you must, Daniel.<eos> Nicholas is risking his life on a very unusual long shot here.<eos> I know it's embarrassing, but I'll make it easier for you.<eos> You and I will go in the other room, and we'll both take down our pants.<eos> I won't. I won't.
- I'm pregnant, David.<eos> Jesus Christ, Alice.<eos> I want to have this baby.<eos> Alice ...<eos> Of course we will, Alice.
- No!<eos> No!<eos> - Run away, Dina.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> I won't!
You found your targets, you tracked them down, you fought very hard.<eos> Susan... you are a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Then you will not.
What is this concern?<eos> Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t-to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
You are the most amazing girl I have ever met, Lorna Morello.<eos> I mean, it should be the guy doing the asking, but I gotta say there's something kind of hot about you down on your knees like that.<eos> Yes.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes, I will. -Oh!
I see it.<eos> Noah, that ki... he sai he in't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
From now on, we will be strangers.<eos> You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth? Whatever I am... You love me.<eos> And you always will.
Who are you protecting right now?<eos> You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
I thought that if you'd like to, we...<eos> Speak calmly and clearly.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
I wanted to come home.<eos> I wanted to make something here.<eos> A house of sorts.<eos> A safe place.<eos> A celebration, if you will.
These men are gonna think that you suspect them.<eos> Well, at this point, I suspect everyone.<eos> Even you.<eos> All right, look, a lot of these guys are gonna make it because of the work that you've done, all right?<eos> And some of them won't.
– Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
They want to keep him under observation until further notice.<eos> You know exactly what they will do with him!<eos> Of course we'll do everything we can, to get Nicklas home soon, but ...<eos> Gerda, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> Mom ... no, I will not!
Manu. We need to trust each other.<eos> We had no choice.<eos> He tried running off with our money.<eos> We'll make it.<eos> We will.
You'll come around, Katie, Duchess of Snobville.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I know you will.<eos> You will.
So you'll forgive me if I seek distraction elsewhere.<eos> Find a hobby or a whore or something other than revenge to occupy you.<eos> You risk both our lives going after the king's brother.<eos> If I have to, I will stop you myself.<eos> No, you won't.
- Don't, really.<eos> Relax. Leave it to me.<eos> Don't, Ms. Sultan.<eos> I'll disgrace myself.<eos> I truly will.
I am.<eos> Between this life and one with me.<eos> Between respectability, a family, a man who loves you...<eos> I can't give this up.<eos> I won't.
But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday. Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.<eos> And I always will.
I mean, the only reason he gave his name up was because he thought we'd never get out of that hellhole.<eos> - Okay, so what was Lesli?<eos> - A speed bump.<eos> On the way to finding Charles.<eos> But we will.
That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that.<eos> _<eos> Okay.<eos> If the wrong people find it...<eos> The right people will.
What the hell do you want to do now?<eos> All right.<eos> Your total is $126.39.<eos> And would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?<eos> I will.
- What did you say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - That's what I thought.<eos> - Well, Kevin, you made your bed.<eos> - Not yet, but I will!
You're really starting to get on my nerves!<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!
And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!<eos> - Yes, I will!<eos> - No, you won't!<eos> - Yes, I will!
Exactly.<eos> Well, we won't say it like that.<eos> We'll just...<eos> No, of course not. I'll say it.<eos> Like, we'll just...
Listen to me.<eos> You know the powers of this water.<eos> If you ever get hurt,<eos> If anything should happen,<eos> Nothing ever will.
Me neither. It's true, Reverend.<eos> Vester is a brute with no conscience.<eos> I'll go.<eos> You can't.<eos> Yes I will.
Yatesey's a prick.<eos> OK? Shown his true colours and after this, we drop him like a stone.<eos> But right now, we need him.<eos> OK, Frankie can wait, mate.<eos> Marcel won't.
- I'm leaving her.<eos> - Release the cage!<eos> It's the only thing that I take.<eos> Release the cage, I say!<eos> Kathleen will at any time.
Here's the investment list first for real estate.<eos> - Is it also in paper form?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So give me the papers.<eos> - Yes, as you will.
Oh, so this is where you keep the clones?<eos> Well, obviously, you're part of a high-security programme.<eos> Yeah, most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalised.<eos> Right, so smart people don't know what they're actually working on.<eos> Ah, but you will.
Felix Dawkins? Search warrant.<eos> ♪ Time flies ♪ Oh, shit, not again.<eos> No no, it's a misunderstanding, I'm sure.<eos> How's it going, Morguey? Better hope we don't find anything incriminating in your friend's place.<eos> You won't.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?<eos> And, look, some good came out of all this.<eos> Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.<eos> Well, actually I didn't.<eos> But I will now.
I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess<eos> The identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones Will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
- Change of plans.<eos> - Rogal will get her.<eos> - No, Stefan!<eos> - He's a better candidate.<eos> - Stefan will!
- Oh, lord ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> It seems like these girls are doing a kind of blackmail.<eos> They filmed you while you were doing things that may be illegal in Norway.<eos> Wha will they?
She don't want to talk to you.<eos> She's too scared. What's she afraid of?<eos> What'll happen when you wake up.<eos> That the mission will fail?<eos> That it won't.
Do you know what the British say?<eos> - Do you think it's my fault?<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> What I say is that it's also your responsibility to make it stop.<eos> Because, clearly, he won't.
I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no idea what to do about it.<eos> I feel Like every single thing I am doing is wrong.<eos> You will figure it out.<eos> You will.<eos> You will, too.
Get them tied down and go down below! Now!<eos> How far to the mainland?<eos> Seven miles off Anchorage, sir.<eos> But we won't even make it past the shallows.<eos> No, we won't!
- I don't want that.<eos> - But you should.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> Let's go to your place and hang out.<eos> - No, we won't.
- Are you?<eos> - Just once.<eos> You are?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I will.
- Yeah. - I'll shit where I want.<eos> - Damn right, Troy.<eos> Look at Chris, everyone.<eos> How can he protect you from the dangers of the jungle when he won't even stand up to me now?<eos> Will you?
Wild guess, American Ghost?<eos> Wrong!<eos> Ghost Guys.<eos> It is trademarked, so don't get any funny ideas.<eos> I definitely won't.
Pedro is the first man of the family not to have been born there.<eos> You've been complaining about not having an house there.<eos> The house of my dreams...<eos> But now we have it, and we are going to live there...<eos> The family will!
Ben!<eos> What?<eos> You're nearly 15 minutes late.<eos> You're gonna miss the train.<eos> No, I won't.
If you're worried you should stay with a family member, a friend.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll call my sister.<eos> Just make sure you don't drive anywhere.<eos> I won't. If you're not sure who might have keys, you should change the locks.<eos> I will.
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
(chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine. I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
Ergun! Ergun!<eos> Okay, wait here.<eos> I'm going to get Zeynep for you, okay?<eos> - Bring me my wife.<eos> - I will.
Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
No, thanks. We'll text.<eos> But I have to cancel my sailing contract.<eos> It sucks.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Next winter we'll both he here, OK?
What is their price?<eos> Land.<eos> The restoration of what has been taken from them.<eos> Tell them if they pledge their swords to me, they shall have all they had before, and the Borgia estates I will divide among them.<eos> I will.
Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So? Have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will.
And, believe me, It will work.<eos> I saw her use a similar object on a kid who went mad and killed a bunch of priests.<eos> I'd like lo have a little chat with this Agnes.<eos> Where can I find her?<eos> You won't.
So I think you need to trust me now.<eos> Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?<eos> He's my favorite, which I did not just say.<eos> - If anything happens to him --<eos> - It won't.
I care a lot.<eos> It's just the stuff I'm good at isn't the stuff that makes you popular.<eos> Contestants, all cakes must be... at the judges' table in 60 seconds.<eos> Ay. there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.<eos> Like heck we won't. Here.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wrong moment.<eos> It's the wrong moment.<eos> But will you?
V á away.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Want a ch x í face á?<eos> I want ch n ã á.<eos> - But we ... - Will soon!
Akkie, appears just.<eos> Joep.<eos> Joep!<eos> Help me.<eos> I already á will.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench. A brace of draymen bid God speed him well, And had the tribute of his supple knee<eos> As were our England in reversion his.<eos> Well, he is gone, And with him go these thoughts.<eos> Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, Expedient manage must be made, my liege, 'Ere further leisure yield them further means<eos> For their advantage and your highness' loss. We will ourself in person to this war,
But... It will go well? No, it will not do well.<eos> We are not going well at all.<eos> Or if you are walking... But it will be wrong...<eos> - And you are ...?<eos> - Yes, I will...
If you were so confident about that, why are you telling me now?<eos> - I'm only telling you so you know.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Zoe Hart is walking around with the information that could undo my entire relationship.<eos> She won't.
If you'd like me to go somewhere else, Diane, just say the word.<eos> No, David.<eos> You will stay here because we leave you alone.<eos> Somewhere else will leave me just as alone.<eos> No, they won't.
Oh, no way! He can't keep his pants up, can he?<eos> Right, well, there you go, eh?<eos> Taste of her own medicine. Bitch. Sold his...<eos> Can you work it out Alison? He's bringing an overnight bag with him where?<eos> I will.
How long will you be gone?<eos> Look, if something happens while we're gone...<eos> We'll be all right.<eos> If anything happens, you get everyone locked in the cells, keep them all safe.<eos> - I will.
Liar!<eos> What are you writing again?<eos> I won't say.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I won't.
What I expected was the courtesy of an honest emotional reaction.<eos> Instead, I got "I'm gonna think about it" and teenage silences.<eos> Maggie --<eos> I can't deal with that, all right?<eos> I won't. Maggie.
I shouldn't meet him anymore.<eos> Dream on.<eos> Do you think you're enough for me?<eos> I won't see him anymore.<eos> I won't.
Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
Oh, that's...<eos> that's so good to hear.<eos> Thataboy.<eos> I just... I just want you to not worry about anything.<eos> I won't.
We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!
He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!<eos> Of course I will!
- I swear I will.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> Will you tell?<eos> Jane: It's not Artie. It's Jonathan.<eos> I won't.
Um, for a long time, he... he wanted to get revenge on the bastard who ran her over.<eos> But I told him, "Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No. I won't.
Yeah, well, we were hanging out a couple weeks ago, election day... Huh.<eos> Actually, and, well, we... we had a real connection.<eos> And I keep on thinking that I should maybe take her out and see if there's anything to it.<eos> But I think that she might be a little self-conscious about the whole situation, unless, of course, you were okay with it, so... what do you say?<eos> Well, well, I'll, uh...
- My sister played Chekhov for many years. I know it by heart.<eos> - "The Seagull". - Masha.<eos> Masha, confidently:<eos> "He will, ask him for them."<eos> "He will."
But when I get out, I'm gonna get a job.<eos> I'm gonna get enough money to get an apartment... and we're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay, Milk.<eos> And I never will.<eos> I never will.
No, go jump in the ocean.<eos> - Do you have any sevens?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> No!<eos> No, I will not!
Okay, Olivia.<eos> You feeling comfortable?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> These wires will show me how you respond to the tests.<eos> I'll just... Ashley.
And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> - Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> - Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> - God will.
Will you do something for me?<eos> Will you... Will you look after Mother?<eos> - If anything happens.<eos> - Of course we will.<eos> But it won't.
God... I'm jealous of the bird.<eos> If we all had two wings... we'd be in the Indies by now.<eos> We called it the Kept House, made from flotsam and the beams of our ship.<eos> The Kept House will protect and shelter us.<eos> If God wills.
The board already warned us.<eos> If we go on like this, we'II go bankrupt.<eos> We need Mariangela, baby.<eos> We need her if we want to grow.<eos> The family will.
I cannot practice proper psychological warfare until I understand...<eos> - ... the psyche of who I'm dealing with.<eos> - She's making up words.<eos> If you want my help in destroying Jimmy Praboo I need to know his Achilles' heel.<eos> His fatal flaw, if you will.
Why?<eos> Because I called you strident?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Okay, I will.
Don't.<eos> All right, I need an arsonist spouse or something.<eos> - So you're gettin'scooped like every morning.<eos> I mean, do you have any kind of plan?<eos> Yes, the show will still...

But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.

Was there ever a more beautiful sight on God's earth, Tess, than watching you whistle?<eos> I could stand here all day watching you - pouting and swearing to yourself.<eos> - I did not swear!<eos> - Perhaps I will give you a lesson...<eos> - No, you will not!

Cam, we have to face the fact that I am going to die here.<eos> No, I don't have to face that fact, because I am not going to let it happen.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But the truth is, even if you manage to create a distraction and destroy the device, you are never going to get me to the gate by yourself.<eos> - Yes, I will.

I want to go back.<eos> We'll go back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bab'Aziz, won't you go to the gathering after all?<eos> I will, my little angel. I will.
Mr Brown, are you all right?<eos> I'm perfectly all right.<eos> Evangeline, could you let Cook know that the new nanny has had to leave and I'm off to the agency to find a new one?<eos> Good.<eos> I'll just...
Christine... If I were to leave, I wouldn't even know where to go.<eos> Then why leave?<eos> That's what I'm sayin'.<eos> I don't wanna leave.<eos> - All right, I won't.

-I'm sorry. -Please, take her away.<eos> Officer, take her away. I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> We need to identify the body.<eos> -Is your brother coming?<eos> -No, I will.
Hello.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Franz.<eos> Relax.<eos> Will you,
Okay, let's get you ready for the fair, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.<eos> Nothing fits anymore.<eos> If he keeps growing at this rate, we're gonna have to send him to college by next week.<eos> Well, he will in these.
You're not a baby, George.<eos> I think you're old enough to see our side of this.<eos> We can take him to an animal shelter.<eos> - They'll kill him!<eos> - They won't.
I'm just... dizzy.<eos> You know what the worst part of this is?<eos> You and me.<eos> We never could get it together.<eos> Now we never will.
Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - She still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.<eos> But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.<eos> - She will.
We just wiped out your single advantage you had over the Goa'uld.<eos> I would say that's about as good a reason as any.<eos> Enough.<eos> - I won't tell you anything.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
I don't care how long it takes.<eos> I only have to hit you once. Just one good hit and it's over.<eos> He bleeds.<eos> You can count on one thing, baby. Even if I don't kill you, you'll never see Gracie again.<eos> You never will.
JANE:<eos> No.<eos> Peter, I...<eos> I'll save you, Peter!<eos> I will!

In your heart.<eos> How could you be so sure?<eos> I had a feeling.<eos> I do love you.<eos> And I always will.
Just give me a few minutes to check it out.<eos> No.<eos> You could have a weapon hidden in there.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Not without me, you won't.
It's your graduation.<eos> They should be there.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> They won't want to be there.<eos> - Of course they will.
I just wanted to try it.<eos> And I don't feel like I should justify or explain it to you...<eos> - Then don't.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I won't.
And tell him to come with you two next week.<eos> I wanna see the three of you together.<eos> - Yes, that would be a nice picture.<eos> - All right, see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
That.<eos> That's what she wanted, but I couldn't get it up so I faked it.<eos> What does a fake sonogram look like in case I ever need to do it?<eos> Everyone is glowing about my pregnancy.<eos> When will I?
Meeting with one of my constituents.<eos> You going to be at the Bing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> Maybe I'll see you over there then.<eos> Maybe you will.
Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction... on Cadet Hayes's part.<eos> But that's all it is.<eos> The killer used different weapons... he demonstrated no consistent M.O.<eos> And no clear victimology. None of it will hold up in court.<eos> Well, something out there will.
Oh, but we have so much work to do.<eos> If the writer can carry a basket, you can both do it in my presence.<eos> -So he falls from the roof--<eos> -Yes, I know, I know. Don't tell me.<eos> "The greatest thing you'll ever..."
You must learn to be on your own.<eos> Where's your rosary?<eos> Whenever you feel afraid... I want you to squeeze it with all your might and say an Our Father.<eos> And then your fear will go away.<eos> - It won't.
What do you plan to do with that?<eos> Commit a heinous crime. What else?<eos> You'll wait for me, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course you will.
We have to move on before it gets too cold.<eos> - I promised her.<eos> - It's too dangerous here.<eos> We have to go.<eos> - I won't.
Thank you.<eos> Father.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Promise me you'll come back alive.<eos> I will.
I thought it was a secret.<eos> I mean, I know Iris doesn't want it talked about.<eos> Come on, Iris. I'm sure we'll all recognize ourselves.<eos> I don't see how you... anyone... can.<eos> They won't.
This thing is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> The last stop, baby.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I will.
I don't care.<eos> I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents.<eos> They're so happy to be a part of your special day.<eos> Tell them we're glad they're coming.<eos> I will.
Your mother, the one who stepped in without being asked... and single-handedly wrecked everything.<eos> What is this about?<eos> She'll never come back here.<eos> - Who, Mother?<eos> Of course she will.
Best of three games.<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - What if something goes wrong?<eos> - Nothing will.
How many have you done?<eos> For that matter, how many times have you sat on the grass and done nothing?<eos> You need to start taking some time for yourself.<eos> Promise me you'll do that.<eos> - l will.
Come on!<eos> There's a time for everything, Thomas.<eos> There's a time for everything.<eos> Your time will come, Thomas.<eos> It will.
No, don't do it!<eos> please don't do it.<eos> only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul. I promise.<eos> Nobody will know.<eos> I will, Hardy.
She'll be sent for.<eos> She'll come.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> No, she won't.
Look at that!<eos> A ditch in the track, or something like that...<eos> - And how will I go to school?<eos> - You won't! - And Dad to work?<eos> - He won't either.
I won't lie to you, Mr Poirot.<eos> I'm glad at the way things worked out.<eos> And as soon as there's been a decent interval, Jane and I plan to be married.<eos> If she'll have me.<eos> Of course I will.
And if you're not here Jørgen Mortensen won't come anymore.<eos> If he goes, I go.<eos> - Will you translate?<eos> - No.<eos> Will you?
See, he says he's not going. - Stop taking pictures, fatso!<eos> Well done, Harvey!<eos> Cool!<eos> I won't go to the army!<eos> I won't!
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist... and we would have no knowledge of the Force.<eos> They continually speak to us... telling us the will of the Force.<eos> When you learn to quiet your mind... you'll hear them speaking to you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> With time and training, Ani, you will.
Just a suggestion.<eos> Water's murky.<eos> We might make it.<eos> No way!<eos> No, we won't!
Water? Fill it up?<eos> To write?<eos> - No. No, for the salad...<eos> If I eat too much salad?<eos> But I won't
Are you kidding?<eos> Safest block in the neighb.<eos> Being a gangster, what's that mean?<eos> The shit I see in the boardroom, I don't know if I'd make a distinction.<eos> Oh, will you, please?
It got too scary.<eos> Jesus, right under my nose.<eos> You'd think you'd know.<eos> No, Dad.<eos> You won't.
Czechoslovakian immigrants or some shit.<eos> These Polacks will haul paper, plastic and aluminum for 7000 a month less than Dick.<eos> They pay us 40 times the monthly for stealing a stop.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> They won't.
So what does that mean?<eos> It's a trap.<eos> - I will go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - I will.
Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> They will... They will.
For two months.<eos> Then you get a divorce.<eos> ...the dead with the dead...<eos> I don't want to marry.<eos> I won't.
All I wanna know is... who's coming with me?<eos> Who's coming, man?<eos> Who's coming with me?<eos> Who's coming with me, man?<eos> I will.
Who is this?<eos> Hello?<eos> This is the FBI. We have this number and we will trace it.<eos> Who is this?<eos> No, you won't.
even in death.<eos> You're reaching each other through her painting.<eos> It's nothing I've ever seen.<eos> can you?<eos> And you never will.
Anna... Wanna dance?<eos> I know that you're avoiding it, but today is my day.<eos> Anna, I won't go to the hospital.<eos> I won't go to the hospital, Anna.<eos> I won't.
I am so happy!<eos> Honey, is the fish ready?<eos> It's already fixed! I'll send it out right away<eos> Come and drink with Ma<eos> Sure I will
Two hundred dollars.<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Monica, I don't want to lose $200.<eos> - We won't. - Okay.
You know something Rudy? - You're like school in summertime.<eos> - School in summertime?<eos> Yeah bitch! School in summer time!<eos> Open your fucking ass nigga hole or I'll pop your bitch ass!<eos> - I'll a poppa yo a bitcha assa tuba.
- Mulder, uh, where are you?<eos> I'd better not say.<eos> Look, just get out here as soon as you can.<eos> - How can I get in touch with you?<eos> - You won't.
That would be so great. Let's hang in.<eos> You never know what's gonna happen.<eos> Come on. Open wide.<eos> Ken, turn the Yankee game off and come on out here now!<eos> I will!
I feel unbelievably relaxed.<eos> It's my sister who's all worked up.<eos> And my father's making a six-hour train journey to hear a thesis on yeomen in the year 1000 at Paladru Lake.<eos> He'll nod off after five minutes.<eos> Everyone else probably will too.
Remember that picture? How it kept getting closer and bigger on the screen?<eos> You just about see the faces of those drivers and then zap, the picture went dead.<eos> We didn't get to see what happened next.<eos> Well, guess what, Alek?<eos> You will, you son of a bitch.
Yeah!<eos> I'm talking filthy!<eos> This is all under protest now. This is a warm-up act.<eos> - They still have to laugh at the joke.<eos> - And I won't.
What do I pay you for?<eos> Well, you haven't paid me for...<eos> Yeah, right...<eos> Won't work. Never mind.<eos> - What won't?
My heart is about to leap out of my chest.<eos> And I want everybody to hear this.<eos> Ilene, I've known you were the one for me ever since we teed off on the moderate-to-difficult course at the "Putt-Putt Panorama."<eos> Ilene Markham, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, she will!
Ilene, I've known you were the one for me ever since we teed off on the moderate-to-difficult course at the "Putt-Putt Panorama."<eos> Ilene Markham, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, she will!<eos> What she said!<eos> - Of course I will, Al.
Now please, let me explain.<eos> - Please?<eos> - Explain?<eos> Karen!<eos> Will you...?
Rob will kill every last one of them.<eos> He will not know.<eos> Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not! He will not!
He will not know.<eos> Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not! He will not!<eos> No! He will not!
Tim, it's a big job.<eos> I can't blow off Olaf.<eos> You know, this is unbelievable. I came all this way and now my sister won't even know I was here.<eos> Yeah, wait a minute.<eos> Yes, she will.
I mean, look at you, man.<eos> You're the biggest hunk in Chicago.<eos> You should be bagging more panties than a clerk at Victoria's Secret.<eos> Or if you don't wanna be popping penicillin for life you ask your special girl if she'll go steady and hope she says yes.<eos> Oh, she will.
- You Will !<eos> - I won't, I won't.<eos> One day ... ... you'llmeetsomeman, and you Will love him tremendously.<eos> And you Will live and die for him.<eos> You Will !
Good.<eos> How are you feeling this morning?<eos> Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.
- Why not?<eos> Because in two days you are going to be elected Kai.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> There's no guarantee I'll win.<eos> Of course you will.
Now be still!<eos> Poison!<eos> Poison!<eos> If the poison don't get you?<eos> - Then God will.
Full of surprises, aren't we...<eos> Be still, Kat!<eos> I'll beat you brainless, by Christ!<eos> Poison don't get you...<eos> God will...!
Or rather, yes<eos> Sometimes.<eos> In his sleep<eos> So you didn't tell him?<eos> Will you?
How pathetic.<eos> Killed by the same man that killed his father.<eos> You killed my father?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> As I will you.
It's too dangerous.<eos> I like danger.<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Made up your mind?<eos> No, and I won't.
- Ready?<eos> - Yes. It was very difficult, replacing all the Malathion with my formula.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't, dear.<eos> But soon you will.
You mustn't believe what director Kiuhon says, don't listen to his sweet talks or fall into his traps.<eos> Handa, don't you believe I belong to you already?<eos> I will never forget our oaths.<eos> You must wait for my return.<eos> I surely will.
Then I give you life eternal.<eos> Everlasting love.<eos> The power of the storm and the beasts of the earth.<eos> Walk with me to be my loving wife forever.<eos> I will! Yes!
You must return to the Enterprise immediately.<eos> Troi is dying.<eos> We will transport you whether you come willingly or not.<eos> Security force fields are protecting us.<eos> They won't any longer.
It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told.<eos> Mister, my family will pay cash.<eos> Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.<eos> It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.<eos> Yes, it will, Precious.
Wearing pyjamas. - Can't this wait till I get back?<eos> - No. I've got to move now.<eos> I'm afraid that if I don't, Andrews will grab Williams for the Shop.<eos> Ackerman and Williams' wife will become unfortunate accidents.<eos> Then so will we.
Yes.<eos> Then what would you say if I told you that she has no powers whatsoever?<eos> We have seen her powers here.<eos> That's right.<eos> And you will again.
The crowd is on its feet, cheering.<eos> I'm down.<eos> The count starts.<eos> The crowd's screaming, "Get up!" But I can't.<eos> I won't!
BARRY: The what?<eos> IRIS: The Thai food was ready 10 minutes ago.<eos> BARRY: I should go.<eos> I'll go.<eos> IRIS: You will?
Look!<eos> Look over there! Look!<eos> Right now!<eos> Go on. Go on.<eos> I'll...
You can't put the lads up to their necks in this.<eos> It would be tempting the devil.<eos> You don't mean to say...<eos> That we're dishonest?<eos> No, of course, but other people will.
I am a man! From Earth I'm the one who has taken you inside me.<eos> You're of two minds, sir. You haven't finished your work, and you hesitate whether or not you should go back.<eos> I know who you want to talk to, sir. My father. To have him out of your way, and the Szerns who oppose you.<eos> Do you feel disgraced? Spurned? I love you, sir.<eos> As nobody ever will. From beyond life! From beyond death and woe!
I need to call a locksmith. -No, that's not possible.<eos> Why?<eos> -Listen, I'm expecting someone.<eos> You won't leave me outside like this?<eos> -Yes, I will.
Oh, wally !<eos> No , wait !<eos> You can't go out there.<eos> What if they discover you're an alien ?<eos> They won't !
Well, I can still call them, can't I?<eos> I mean, that is what they're for, isn't it?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Helen. It's getting a Iittle late.<eos> Why don't you just go on home.<eos> I will if you will.
Spare us from all the constant ringing.<eos> I can't help it if I'm never home.<eos> He's going to give up.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> I sure as heck would.
It was awful!<eos> It's his girlfriend and his best friend.<eos> You can't blame her.<eos> Are you really saying that you'd stick around with me if I was paralyzed from the neck down?<eos> Of course I would.
And now I just want you to just tell me about your day.<eos> Hi, I'm Amy.<eos> All I did today was, like, rub lotion on my face and talk, talk, talk, talk.<eos> Amy, would you like to...<eos> Yes, I would!
My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
He would never tell me.<eos> You've got to stall.<eos> You have to stall.<eos> I can't.<eos> How would I?
And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
That sounds perfect.<eos> That's because it is.<eos> The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you lived next to me.<eos> Oops!<eos> You would.
He's got your eyes.<eos> And your smile.<eos> He's gonna break a lot of hearts.<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> - You'd better.
He may not be a regular churchgoer, but he's a good man, my son.<eos> He just turned 21.<eos> And he already has a job at the auto plant.<eos> It was stupid to mention the job.<eos> A real mother would.
She was very happy that day.<eos> She asked me to say "I love you."<eos> I didn't.<eos> She wanted me to marry her.<eos> I wouldn't.
No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't touch the babies.<eos> It makes the mommy eat them.<eos> But why would she...?
I know Hitler. Oktoberfest.<eos> Sauerkraut. And Heidi Klum.<eos> Would you like to know more about it?<eos> Can I?<eos> Would you?
Think about her a lot?<eos> When she left my womb, she was blue. Her heart had stopped.<eos> Jo yelled, drank, then said life was sick.<eos> You think it's my fault, huh?<eos> Because I'd drunk?
-Jesus! -We can... I can look into how much you can take out of the business if that's...<eos> I've got maybe 200 grand I can lay my hands on immediately, but even then, are they going to let me withdraw that amount in cash, without asking bloody questions?<eos> Well, it's your money.<eos> Yeah, but they're going to think I'm laundering money, then they're going to tell the police!<eos> -Really? -Well, I would!
-Friend of a friend. -Who?<eos> -I don't know. Somebody. I don't know, I can't remember.<eos> Well, who were you with?<eos> -Well, you wouldn't know 'em. -Try me.<eos> Well, you would. The usual smackheads.
Roger Elgood.<eos> He was a GP, lives on Ripponden.<eos> Got struck off months since for signing blank prescriptions.<eos> Don't you know what goes on on your patch? Why would Tommy Lee Royce know to go to Roger Elgood?<eos> -Why wouldn't he? -Catherine.
I bet if we took your blood right now...<eos> Mm-hmm, see, I could say the same thing about you, but I wouldn't want to change a single thing about you, so I won't.<eos> I don't want to change anything about you either.<eos> I like you alive, not dead on a toilet after having a heart attack trying to pass a deep-fried onion blossom.<eos> - God, Miranda, why would you even...
That's going in the album!<eos> We got a letter! - A letter?<eos> We never get mail.<eos> - Sorry. It's stuck.<eos> - Would you...
Yeah, I know.<eos> I am trying to keep it professional.<eos> You'd get bored with me.<eos> - Oh, I doubt that.<eos> - Well, yes, you would.
Normal rules don't apply to Jacs.<eos> Yeah. Your daughter's fucked.<eos> You'd get bored with me.<eos> - Oh, I doubt that.<eos> - Well, yes, you would.
I saw the gathering of trunks.<eos> She goes with you?<eos> It was her intent.<eos> Yet I would find no comfort in her presence.<eos> As I would in yours...
I don't think so. What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
It's late.<eos> Go home.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Listen.<eos> Not really good at this kind of thing, but I would...
I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
- Mmm.<eos> It's like food, but not. Mm-hmm.<eos> Would you like another glass of wine? Mm.<eos> [Snaps fingers] - Whoo!<eos> - Yes... I would.
Pinkerton? That's right.<eos> A chartered mercenary with a badge!<eos> And you place his word above mine.<eos> I think you would have her Ripper above all else.<eos> Another bite, another chance at him. But you would not?
With my penknife I cut his throat.<eos> I Would have killed him If I had let him.<eos> The judge said: " Henry" you knew what You Were doing? "<eos> " Yes, Your Honor. I wanted to kill That son of a bitch! "<eos> And I would.
Stop it! Sit down! You should be nicer to your son.<eos> It's just a thought.<eos> Who wants to hear a song?<eos> We'd love to sing a song for you.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
Didn't think you were coming.<eos> Very good, gentlemen.<eos> Can I call on Monty Taylor, Senior Convener, Ford Dagenham?<eos> Thank you, I shall try to be brief.<eos> If you would.
Oh, you exaggerate.<eos> You're American, you don't understand these things.<eos> Have you mentioned this to Granny?<eos> Did she laugh?<eos> Why would she?
I don't care.<eos> I'm over it.<eos> That's why he's been whining about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black. Is he making any progress?<eos> Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.<eos> So would Ben Affleck.
So you wouldn't buy it. Absolutely not.<eos> I mean, I don't know if I would.<eos> I mean, it depends.<eos> I guess it depends kind of the price. I mean, yeah, no--<eos> I definitely would, I definitely, I would.
What?<eos> For our annual back-to-school dinner.<eos> I've been going back and forth, trying to figure out what to make, but if I do bouillabaisse, I can put a little bit of everything in.<eos> Mom, we don't have to do a whole...<eos> No, why wouldn't we?
And reboot.<eos> My mom's dating the Terminator.<eos> You know why I'd rather play fetch with you than my dog?<eos> It's 'cause you would never bring the ball back To your tiny, little dog girlfriend.<eos> You'd ing it to me.
But I just need a moment of your time.<eos> I think we should have dinner tomorrow night-- uh, no. Sheldon.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Cooper--can you just tell him what's going on?<eos> I'd rather not, frankly.
For the love of... I was a coward.<eos> I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
No, no, I get it, I get it.<eos> Where you're from is part of who you're selling.<eos> For instance, under "special skills" on my résumé, I mention that back in Minnesota, I was the 1995 Nicollet County Slam Dunk Champion.<eos> You put dunk champion on your résumé?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't you?
You can make all the mistakes you want with, God willing girls your own age.<eos> B, I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know it was Rachel that sent the Gossip Girl blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.<eos> And you're going to?<eos> I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.<eos> Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?<eos> - Well, why wouldn't she?
Even the state's attorney... the new state's attorney... thinks there's nothing there.<eos> And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?<eos> You want to know what I would say?<eos> I would.
So when did Donatelli go undercover?<eos> We were partners in narcotics.<eos> Unfortunately, most of the blow we confiscated ended up in my nose.<eos> Internal Affairs tried to get Nicky to rat me out.<eos> He wouldn't.
Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure it's just your imagination.<eos> I don't suppose saying we're sorry<eos> - would quite cover it.<eos> - No. It wouldn't.
I'd like to save you from that embarrassment.<eos> That's very kind of you, Owen.<eos> My committee has the power to hold public hearings.<eos> I'd like to spare you that.<eos> Would you now?
The ones I thought you defended too.<eos> How much time we got?<eos> 37 minutes.<eos> It wouldn't hurt to have an idea.<eos> Yeah, it wouldn't, huh?
Darryl, now is not really a good time again.<eos> Let me call you back?<eos> All right.<eos> Not that I'm okay with you stealing my stuff, but those earrings really do look amazing on you.<eos> Then again, what wouldn't?
liable to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you together would like to have some tea while you wait?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
It 's so complicated, cutting a body.<eos> No, no cutting. Just burning.<eos> Set fire on her, throw acid to burn it all.<eos> L'd burn her.<eos> L really would.
Causes need currency.<eos> So we'd like to discuss... a business deal.<eos> Not interested.<eos> We'd prefer to hear that from Selva.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
You want it seize it.<eos> -We'd rather not.<eos> I wasn't speaking to you, Krendler.<eos> When I speak to you, I'll look at you.<eos> Why would we rather not?
I don't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence.<eos> I think we should buy him a moped.<eos> I think we should get a divorce.<eos> - You won't tell Mum, will you?<eos> - Why would I?
He thought about it in many different ways.<eos> It used to come back over the years again and again and as you see friends getting divorced and remarried the topic would come up again.<eos> It had so many variations and so much really serious thought to it that he knew one day he was going to make it.<eos> May I ask why a beautiful woman who could have any man in this room, wants to be married?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
- You guess what?<eos> - We'll see. - We'll see what?<eos> It's shortsighted to write off this place when we haven't even bought Fran's yet.<eos> - And we don't know if we will. - We don't?<eos> Why wouldn't we?
No matter how terrible the crimes these men committed, it seems wrong to hand them over to be executed.<eos> This is a Federation starship, not the Barge of the Dead. Would you have preferred the Captain release them?<eos> Of course not. They're dangerous men.<eos> Executing them ensures they'll never pose a threat to anyone again.<eos> So would life sentences...
Thank God you're alive.<eos> You know my better half.<eos> It figures I'd meet the perfect guy and he'd already have a perfect girl.<eos> Hello,blondie. Her girlfriend's here.<eos> Jimmy,Paulie,go secure BosIey,would you?
You have results, you report them.<eos> -Can I explain?<eos> -You just lied to the Pentagon!<eos> Once they know we've completed it what's to stop them from taking over the project?<eos> -Why would they?
DRUSILLA: Very sweet, she was.<eos> Like clover.<eos> And honey.<eos> Think of it as our way of giving you what you want.<eos> - What would I...?
Someone you know?<eos> My... husband.<eos> Don't you think one of the charms of marriage... is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?<eos> May I ask why a beautiful woman... who could have any man in this room, wants to be married?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Right now, the 2 big ones are "entenmann's" and "she's hot."<eos> I mean, here's this cute trainee driving around in the truck all day with me, and I wouldn't blame you if you felt a little weird about that.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, it's not a little weird for you? No! Doug, I mean, I know you wouldn't fool around on me.<eos> Of course I wouldn't, but her.
I know.<eos> I don't want you to either.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> When Michael died, you asked the aunts to bring him back.<eos> But they wouldn't.
Actually, I had another thought.<eos> Go ahead, Captain.<eos> We use our gate to go to Madrona, then do a 180 and return through the second gate here on Earth.<eos> If one input the Earth's coordinates on the Madrona dialling device, he would be sent back to the gate on this facility.<eos> You would.
Harvey Briggs has bought himself a steamer.<eos> - He can take us up to Pittwater.<eos> - Or across to Mossman's Bay.<eos> - Who'd trust Briggsy with a steamer?<eos> - I'd rather Pittwater.
- And, one by one, he will kill us all.<eos> - Three down, two to go.<eos> Then it's going after Ethan.<eos> I better beat it there.<eos> - We'd better.
- It's two o'clock, dear.<eos> It is time...<eos> - Oh, give them to me, then.<eos> Would you care to see the boat, Mr. Poirot?<eos> - Oh, I certainly would!
And I was wondering if you and your husband would join Connie and me for dinner?<eos> - Thanks, but we're not going to do any...<eos> - We'd love to.<eos> We would?<eos> Well, of course you would.
- Meet me tonight, right here.<eos> Well! I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.<eos> What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.<eos> I mean, I want to see him again.<eos> Who wouldn't?
I shouldn't have waited to call.<eos> Then why did you?<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid she'd hang up on me.<eos> Afraid she wouldn't.
Put me through to Sec. Gen. Noyce.<eos> We'll be at the qualifying trials.<eos> You can speak to him then. No, no, no.<eos> I want to speak to him right now.<eos> So would 25,000 other people.
- Really?<eos> How is it you've come to know him so well?<eos> A man comes in for a drink, he wants to talk.<eos> He didn't want to talk to Sisko when he arrived.<eos> Who would?
No.<eos> Well, there you are. See? I've done it again.<eos> I'm supposed to be in car 564. Maybe you should go to car 564.<eos> Would you know where that is?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You have no idea... how much I understand what you're going through.<eos> Look at her, man.<eos> - She look like the missing link.<eos> - I think she's kind of cute.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
He has our new orders.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> And assemble the bridge staff for a briefing in 1 5 minutes.<eos> Picard out.<eos> - Mr Elbrun, would you...
Why not?<eos> Quickest way to slip up doing undercover work is doing things you normally wouldn't do.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean you wouldn't take wine to a woman who's invited you for dinner?<eos> Of course you would.
And you must stand witness at her last moment;<eos> Your beloved shall die after the fateful moment when the warlike metal fires three shots.<eos> And you would have me watch?<eos> B e silent, silent.<eos> - You would?
Not only that<eos> - You're gonna hear something fantastic...<eos> I'd like to have Berangere, a bit.<eos> I'm organized now, so if she wants....<eos> Sure she would.
- No, sir.<eos> Lulu?<eos> She said the gentleman would pay for dinner.<eos> You...<eos> The gentleman would...
- Really?<eos> Mm...<eos> Maybe not run away. Maybe visit for a while.<eos> - Read to us, Malcolm.<eos> - Maybe your parents wouldn't...
- Don't worry about it.<eos> - So how are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Well, I made it.<eos> You wouldn't...
- Quite a mess you have here.<eos> - Don't say!<eos> What's with Marek?<eos> - Why does that interest you?<eos> - Why wouldn't it?
It is a present my father gives you.<eos> I?<eos> Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your sake?<eos> What? He is making me signs that I am to force you to accept it.<eos> I would not...
It is worse than above.<eos> You can not get out of bed.<eos> Can you come?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would?
Sounds like a storm.<eos> Barnstormers.<eos> I suppose you young ones know that barnstormers were early play actors, went around on horseback playing in barns and such?<eos> - I didn't know that, Grandpa.<eos> - Well, Zeb would.
You see, my friendly chauffeur and the other gun... were just decoys.<eos> And that is the gun I was supposed to kill you with.<eos> I'm even taking off my bracelet because I don't want you to get scratched.<eos> - Now do you believe me?<eos> - I'd better.
Hogan!<eos> General Fenstermacher's on the phone, Colonel Klink.<eos> General Fenstermacher? The head of the General Staff?<eos> Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.<eos> But why would he...?
What?<eos> Help them? Of course.<eos> You know how the prisoners think.<eos> You'd know where to look for them.<eos> I would?
You carry a double-0 number. It gives you a license to kill, not get killed.<eos> Since I've been head of Ml6, there's been a 40 percent drop in casualties.<eos> I want it to stay that way.<eos> You'll carry the Walther unless you prefer to go back to standard intelligence duties.<eos> No, sir, I would not.
Once I really fell asleep on his arm.<eos> Bad manners.<eos> But... Really... It smells nice.<eos> They were shoving his head in the pond to make him talk.<eos> But he wouldn't.
Always the same hiding place.<eos> Come in.<eos> This is your parents' bedroom?<eos> - Does that intimidate you?<eos> - Why would it?
- But -<eos> - No buts about it.<eos> I insist.<eos> - I wouldn't want to -<eos> - Well, I would.
I'll learn.<eos> - Oh! I'll be late for my show!<eos> - Oh, look, can I see you again?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
If Sabrina were only here.<eos> Hey, how about smuggling her up here?<eos> What if Father sees her?<eos> Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it.<eos> - No, we sure wouldn't.
They never do at a time like this.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> It's so good to hear you laugh again.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd better.
You feel like you could do anything.<eos> Were not people up there.<eos> Were like two streaks of light with wings and...<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Nobody would, except another flyer.
Thank you for a charming evening, darling.<eos> I'm glad you enjoyed it.<eos> I think I'd like some coffee.<eos> Would you like some coffee?<eos> Yes, I would.
Catherine, dear.<eos> He can't dislike you that much.<eos> He's bound to come round.<eos> No, Morris, he will not.<eos> But even if he would, I would not.
He's a man, with red hair, and he's very determined.<eos> Why should a man wish to become a student here?<eos> He says he has a thirst for knowledge. And he wants to quench it in our swimming pool.<eos> Caroline, will you take care of this matter while we continue with the meeting?<eos> But Dean Clinton, wouldn't you rather...
She's the opposite of what we need.<eos> An agitated soul...<eos> But a soul, nonetheless.<eos> - We like your daughter, ma'am.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
