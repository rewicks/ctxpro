Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
How did you steal all that money?<eos> Right. Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.
I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.
It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> _ NO.<eos> No, signore, I do not.
Do what he says. Do exactly what he says.<eos> Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> I do, Lutz.
Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.
Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I do?
You think, uh, it'd be crazy if... We did something together?<eos> Are you asking me out on a date?<eos> Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool if I just watched you drive away.<eos> Enoughtalking. Useyournose .<eos> Then don't.
Isn't this pond just beautiful?<eos> And that rock face over there, its just exquisite. Don't you think?<eos> Yes, I do. It's stunning.<eos> Do you still remember what it looks like?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I do.
We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?<eos> Did you ever sleep with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?
Never a dull moment.<eos> But I didn't know this.<eos> I don't really know what's going on.<eos> Truly.<eos> Now, Stanley, you never do.
Sorry.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> I think you kicked the hornet's nest today.<eos> Yeah, we did that.
Take my trophy.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> I'm gonna die.<eos> I did it!<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Haven't been able to find any.<eos> Guess that's just the way I am.<eos> Don't you get mad at 'em?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> But what parent doesn't?
Ah, yeah, it's pretty gross.<eos> I actually work here.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't walk around all the time in a red smock with a name tag?<eos> No, I do not.
And I don't need your support.<eos> Stop it, honey.<eos> Stop, both of you. Just stop.<eos> I don't think you have any other move left, Stan.<eos> Of course he does.
I don't understand.<eos> She destroyed it.<eos> She?<eos> You know her!<eos> You do, don't you?
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.<eos> Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.<eos> God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.
We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what?<eos> One of you does.
We're just guests here.<eos> But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight.<eos> Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?<eos> No.<eos> One of them did.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't. I don't.
- Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone...<eos> - No, no, no, no, stop.<eos> I detest conversation in the past tense.<eos> You said the fact that you were his brother made no difference.<eos> It doesn't.
This is insane!<eos> This is unnecessary.<eos> No, your security is compromised and we don't know who to trust.<eos> And that justifies dressing up?<eos> Yes, it does!
It's... it's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.<eos> We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this.
Of course you can.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> 'You know why.'<eos> No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.<eos> He did not.
No one has to know.<eos> - Do you know where he lives?<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.<eos> I don't need anyone.<eos> You mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.
Batman!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Joker, you mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.
if you...<eos> - You really need to leave.<eos> This is just a practice sword. It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.
Well... We weren't gonna settle before, and we're not gonna settle now.<eos> Especially when they're asking double the original number.<eos> That's blackmail.<eos> They didn't have a leg to stand on before.<eos> Now they do.
Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
Um, we need a moment.<eos> Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?<eos> You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> I think you need a little rest.<eos> Why did you frame Danny?<eos> I didn't.
The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.
Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't. Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, that is why I am here.<eos> But the first person you sought out was Colleen Wing.<eos> Hmm, yes, that was our assignment.<eos> She could lead us to the Iron Fist.<eos> - And she did.
I've seen this language before, but there's a lot I didn't learn.<eos> A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it...<eos> I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.
If you need more money, call me up, come back, we bang again.<eos> Price goes down 'cause I already had you.<eos> But if you want to bring a girlfriend... price goes back up.<eos> - Well, I don't know what to say here.<eos> - I do.
Mom, can I have a slushy?<eos> Yes, in just a minute.<eos> Is that Abby's brother?<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yes, you do.
- What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Books are stupid.<eos> I don't.
- What?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, I'm a little confused.<eos> Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces?<eos> - Well, I didn't, really...
- Less happy.<eos> - Why would it make me happy?<eos> I was trying to cover up the smell of the skunk that I let spray me so that there would be no questions.<eos> - Well, now I have more questions.<eos> - Of course you do.
- I mean, what is that? - (scoffs)<eos> Unless...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.<eos> - He doesn't?
My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict. Crack.<eos> You can fill in the blanks.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> I did.
Never get on the bad side of small minded people who have a little authority.<eos> I thought I taught you that.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> You don't think I have a right to see my granddaughter?<eos> I do.
Means he shoots people.<eos> From very far away.<eos> You never know what hit 'em.<eos> So, how do you know who you kill if you can't see their face?<eos> I don't.
I see you are negotiating the terms of the armistice without me.<eos> - On the Kaiser's behalf.<eos> - I'm on your insistence.<eos> We could easily win this war if only you had a little faith.<eos> We don't.
Hey. Vince. You're back.<eos> Okay, Hildur... finally.<eos> Oslo's decision is that I have to sign off on all subsidy payments.<eos> Erling, you and I came to an agreement...<eos> No, no, no, no, we didn't.
Are you planning to keep the beard?<eos> You don't like the beard?<eos> I don't like the rash.<eos> I don't have a rash.<eos> I do.
Listen, listen, fuck the church, okay?<eos> Fuck the record company, fuck Roy, your parents, me, fuck Cool Calvin, fuck everybody, do it for you.<eos> - It's your night. It belongs to you.<eos> - Okay. - Come on, come on, you're on.<eos> - You do it for you.
Shane.<eos> Do you smoke pot?<eos> I mean, sometimes.<eos> Do you have any?<eos> Yeah. I do.
So it will never happen again.<eos> This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...<eos> It's a biological lie.<eos> You don't have to accept it.<eos> I don't!
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.<eos> Shut up Tej.<eos> Dom.<eos> Do you really wanna put that car in gear?<eos> Do you?
I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...
Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> No, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers. And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg? I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> You needed a brother.<eos> Still do.
How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see... You didn't die, did you?<eos> Not even over there, where everyone dies.<eos> No. No, I did not.
Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No-one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.
People are saying you're mad.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
What is with you, bradley?<eos> Be happy.<eos> We're about to rid ourselves of an asshole Who has majorly, majorly fucked us over.<eos> Well, he nailed ike the spike for us.<eos> He didn't do that for us.
I hope these pajamas are okay.<eos> They've been in my locker since the time that dog got lost in here.<eos> They're beautiful, Lucy.<eos> Do you remember that night, Andy?<eos> Yes, I do.
- What?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - She doesn't have anyone else.<eos> I'm not trying to take Caleb's side here, but...<eos> Then don't.
This relationship stands for love, loyalty and trust but above all, for friendship.<eos> Aria, your vows.<eos> I, Aria, take thee, Ezra to have and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse for richer, for poorer to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> I don't need tissues.<eos> Em, today you do.
- So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.<eos> - Already written it.<eos> - When?<eos> It's already written.<eos> Did it last night.
- I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did. - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
It's good to talk.<eos> Everybody. How are you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you again.<eos> - How you doing?
No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?<eos> No, I don't, Mother.
Mother, never mind, okay?<eos> Do you remember the night you were putting up the shower curtains?<eos> No.<eos> Do you remember a man showing up?<eos> No, Mother, no, I don't.
She didn't even see me.<eos> I'm not sure about this one.<eos> She's impossible to get to.<eos> I have no in.<eos> Or maybe I do.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?<eos> I thought you said you liked living with us.<eos> Hugo, no...<eos> No, I mean... yes.<eos> I do. I do very much.
- All units...<eos> - They're gone.<eos> That, that... That's not possible.<eos> That's... They couldn't have taken everyone.<eos> THEO: They didn't.
How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.<eos> I did?
I, uh...<eos> I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.<eos> I did?<eos> Yeah, you did.
According to Mangels, just off the living room is a hidden custom-made U.L. class 350 safe where our prize awaits.<eos> With all that security, we can't risk breaking in.<eos> We'll need a cover.<eos> We do have a cover.<eos> Well... you do.
Does it look like I am masterminding the takedown of the Kensington Firm?<eos> Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No, I do.
And we didn't get to be that way. By taking orders from other people.<eos> Well, margot...<eos> We don't need margot.<eos> If justine wants us to take down this smuggling ring...<eos> Which she emphatically does not.
If whoever killed the kincaids was after that money...<eos> They're gonna come after tommy next.<eos> I'm calling him right now.<eos> Does alice know you're here?<eos> No. She doesn't.
I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that? - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?
Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.<eos> Well, don't you want to see him, too?<eos> Don't you want to find out who you really are?<eos> - Of course I do.
The dog is dead.<eos> Father, he died when I was a child.<eos> No, no, I heard him!<eos> He's here. I heard him.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course you did.
What happened?<eos> The Wizard and his men have Langwidere.<eos> The Wizard is here?<eos> If her soldiers don't turn over the guns, he's going to execute her.<eos> What do we do?
He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong roan was about you.<eos> He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
Would your skill in a fight aid us in our efforts?<eos> Of course.<eos> But do we need you here?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
My phone was broken.<eos> I was trying to activate it--<eos> I told you to stay away from that drug house.<eos> You gotta stop shooting Allen!<eos> I didn't do it on purpose!
And they're mostly all Germans.<eos> But you work with the Gestapo?<eos> Is that what you've heard?<eos> The boys at school said so.<eos> I don't.
Some young PC from Hounslow division.<eos> Never heard of Harry Woods, he said.<eos> Doubt if he'd heard of Scotland Yard either.<eos> Why didn't he show them his warrant card?<eos> Well, he did.
I bet in the next few days, the Queen and the Princesses will be on a ship from New Zealand for Washington to represent us.<eos> That's the way Mayhew works.<eos> The long game.<eos> Well then, with men like that, how did you ever lose the war?<eos> Perhaps we didn't. Just the battle.
The long game.<eos> Well then, with men like that, how did you ever lose the war?<eos> Perhaps we didn't. Just the battle.<eos> Does your son want to be a policeman?<eos> Yes. Yes, he does.
The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!<eos> The police want to ask me questions, Holt.<eos> - They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.
- They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.<eos> I hope if you learn anything from an education, it's that more than one theory can be true.<eos> I didn't kill Skye.<eos> And I did.
No, no, no, no. Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> You're right.<eos> Fuck me already. Don't, Audrey.<eos> Audrey, don't.
But not yet perfected, which is why you had to create a false life in between missions.<eos> Keep the shadows from going mad, right?<eos> We had to reanimate immediately on the death of the previous.<eos> I had no idea that the memory threads would jump from clone to clone like twins.<eos> Really, I didn't.
Hey, Alvey. Alvey: How you doing?<eos> I got a class.<eos> Catch you guys later.<eos> Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?<eos> Yeah, she did.
He's from Manchester.<eos> It's kind of, like, a rough area.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I don't want you to feel inferior.<eos> I don't.
What's the game?<eos> What's the game?<eos> You sure you want to know my game?<eos> Oh, you don't even have one.<eos> No, I do.
Come on in.<eos> Drink?<eos> Ah, I don't drink.<eos> They told you everything?<eos> They did, indeed.
- Goodbye. - Bye-bye.<eos> - (speaking Mandarin)<eos> You said that we have to get back home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But do we?
Then we can get off.<eos> People were going as couples to see hardcore pornographic films, to see sex films.<eos> I mean, nice couples.<eos> At the time, I had no idea that anyone I knew, much less anyone that I was related to would ever see this film.<eos> And, um, they did.
It they haven't already.<eos> What?<eos> Feeling paranoid?<eos> On edge?<eos> High school does that to a person.
You always seemed like a good guy.<eos> Don't think too hard.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.<eos> Then again, they almost always do.
I mean, yeah, I guess I remember.<eos> Why?<eos> Hannah matched with Marcus.<eos> Did she?<eos> Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.
Those tapes are messing me up.<eos> - They're doing shit to my head.<eos> - I get it. I get it.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do.
That's just a thing he says to guys.<eos> You got it way easier than Alex.<eos> With the hair.<eos> So, he didn't like Alex either.<eos> Well, he kind of did.
Sometimes you judge people...<eos> I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.
I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.<eos> I usually don't, so...
No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
- Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay. I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay? Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.
Okay. I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay? Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
I might have been... I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
Did you have an encounter at the party?<eos> An encounter?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.
This is known to the world.<eos> Meet me at the jetty.<eos> Are we ready to depart?<eos> Don't remember talking about bringing on new people.<eos> We didn't.
Say night night. Love you. Love you.<eos> Right, Monkey. I'll race you.<eos> Come on. Go, go, go!<eos> What if something goes wrong?<eos> But what if it doesn't?
Regarding me clamping down...<eos> You on board?<eos> I am.<eos> Don't know if you recall my handle...<eos> I don't.
There's only two of us.<eos> You changing your mind?<eos> I'm ready to kill him.<eos> But I need to make sure you know what this means.<eos> Do you?
Me.<eos> I'll talk to Ezekiel.<eos> I'll tell everyone what I did. And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> Did you?
And they killed more.<eos> Olivia...<eos> Jesus brought Rick and the rest here because...<eos> You wanted to know.<eos> Now you do.
Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.<eos> People say I have an expressive face.<eos> But if not, let me repeat your question.<eos> Why do we need two doctors?<eos> Answer... we don't.
They give out our exact address.<eos> It just sucks 'cause people hate sex offenders, and now they have my location.<eos> It's like I'm a fish in a barrel.<eos> Hey, I promise you, nobody looks at this shit, okay?<eos> Vigilantes do.
I'm a fullservice dad.<eos> I got bottles and diapers.<eos> I'm singing and slinging lullabies in multiple octaves.<eos> - You want to sing one right now?<eos> - No, sir, I do not.
South Bronx, not Puerto Rican.<eos> Yeah. No, no, I know where you're from.<eos> King Kulina casts a long shadow, brother.<eos> Well, I don't know about that.<eos> You do. You do.
We didn't buy it.<eos> This is a gift.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, please.<eos> Don't.
I had her pregnant five hours after she said hello.<eos> Which is remarkable because "I never do this sort of thing."<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't either.
It's hard for me to understand why God would put someone on this Earth just to suffer.<eos> We can't understand.<eos> Um, but it's okay.<eos> It's okay to question God.<eos> I do.
- Yeah...<eos> - Which I needed to do.<eos> You know, Nauta's a great fighter.<eos> Respect to him and his team, but... but we got it done today.<eos> All right, well, you did.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come here.<eos> I don't know what the hell he was doing out there.<eos> He was out of control.<eos> 5 grand doesn't suck.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Just, it was fine.<eos> You know, did what it's supposed to do.<eos> You got some slomo shots of you and Nate hugging?<eos> Laughing at some hilarious situation from our childhood?<eos> - In fact, we do.
Unbelievable!<eos> A new champ!<eos> Okay, no more!<eos> And he wants more!<eos> No, I don't!
Thank you.<eos> Morty, that was amazing!<eos> This is my brother!<eos> Not that family means anything!<eos> This family does.
When did you become a monster?<eos> I was a monster when you met me!<eos> We were monsters!<eos> - We didn't care about anything!<eos> - I still don't!
I have not stake in this...<eos> I don't either, I'm...<eos> I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel he wants what's best for it and...<eos> Hey, man, I'm not touching this.<eos> You do you.
Tell me what you think it is I think.<eos> Wasps.<eos> I know all about wasps.<eos> And you know they're all gone.<eos> - Do I?
No, thank you, Governor.<eos> I don't need your charity.<eos> I'm not the Governor any more.<eos> They fired me.<eos> They didn't.
Hey, hon, I didn't hire him, I was blackmailing him.<eos> My point is, this is a blood feud.<eos> We can't be fightin' a blood feud while we're trying to land a big-time sponsor.<eos> We're just gonna have to do it ourselves.<eos> - Do?
I'm still considering my options.<eos> You want me to dance?<eos> I want the cover.<eos> You don't want the cover.<eos> Hell, yeah, I do.
- Don't talk about Lluís.<eos> - I can't. He humiliated me.<eos> He stopped respecting me, but I can't stop loving him.<eos> Lluís might be weak, but he'll always take care of you and Ramonet.<eos> So what do I do now?
You know the terms of your parole strictly prohibit use of illegal substances. I...<eos> I got a prescription for that.<eos> Good for you, sweetie.<eos> But guess what.<eos> Mr. Putnam doesn't.
Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
Quinn, are you there?<eos> We need to get back to being independent. Quinn, you obviously hear me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Look, you can do what you want.<eos> Do nothing, whatever.
Yep.<eos> National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
Look, he had a seizure today... at the bodega a couple of blocks from here.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Because the paramedics came, and there was nothing you could do about it.<eos> And honestly, he didn't want you to know.<eos> He still doesn't.
- No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Who? Who said that?<eos> Why?<eos> "Why" what?<eos> Why did you show them the... pictures?<eos> I didn't.
"The Drone Queen."<eos> Yeah. And in Berlin?<eos> Just stop, Dar.<eos> I assume you never heard the whole story... of your medical ordeal there.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.<eos> You know that.<eos> I don't.
What if I told you... I'm not ready for this, any of it?<eos> I'd say, "Good."<eos> You'd be crazy to feel ready.<eos> What if the American people made a mistake?<eos> They didn't.
I thought she came to hurt me.<eos> I took the bullets out of her gun, and she couldn't defend herself when he came.<eos> I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.
When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't. - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
"You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, you will have no place."<eos> For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.
I think you should tell him about the book you wrote.<eos> What book?<eos> The romance novel.<eos> That's him. He... he wrote it. That's him.<eos> - What? No. N-no, I didn't.
The man I just saw leaving.<eos> You mean Father Brian.<eos> He's the only man permitted in the convent.<eos> Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?<eos> - No. - Well, this man did.
Bring Kevin in.<eos> Jerome tried to sell me out.<eos> And you're his little brother.<eos> So don't tell me you know nothing 'bout it.<eos> - I-I don't.
But that was a lie, wasn't it?<eos> Baby, you're not happy. Nicole.<eos> You need this.<eos> You always will. No, listen, even if that was true it doesn't mean I, I don't need you, baby, because I do.<eos> I do.
She's been looped in.<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?
Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?<eos> Neither does Rebecca.
You mean our bed?<eos> You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm surprised he found the time.<eos> You didn't know he visited pops?<eos> Sure, I knew.<eos> I just didn't think he visited that often.<eos> Hey. Neither did you.
I did not want this.<eos> Flint is my friend, but I know what he is.<eos> I have no illusions about it.<eos> But for all the dangers he presents, for all his offenses... the one thing he's never done is force me to choose between him and you.<eos> That, you did.
Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do?
I don't care.<eos> Your age has never mattered to me.<eos> I like you.<eos> And you like me.<eos> I do.
Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
- Come on.<eos> - That was no heart attack.<eos> - Who had a heart attack?<eos> - Clemenza.<eos> Only he didn't.
- Nice.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration.<eos> We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
You know what you have to do?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> This guy doesn't really come out here a few times a week.<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
Tablescape. It's called tablescape.<eos> - Oh, hello. We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
You've made this move already.<eos> - I have a plan B for you.<eos> Your brother asked me the same that day.<eos> I didn't have any, then.<eos> But I do, today.
Right.<eos> And where is Central Park?<eos> We still have some time.<eos> Let me get Ms. Anders for you.<eos> Hey, Carl, how you doing?
All right, Mummy.<eos> I have noticed a certain halting of progress since I assumed the role of your spiritual directress, but the prospect of life vows can be a difficult time for a novice, and you are assured of all our prayers.<eos> I don't always doubt them.<eos> There are times when I feel them upholding me like wings.<eos> And times when you do not?
Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
I even talk to her sometimes.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, don't you ever think about your dad or Angelo?<eos> I'd like to believe that we go on after we die, that there's life after this one, but...<eos> I don't.
This is also where he was murdered.<eos> This portable speaker's made from the same plastic resin and magnesium alloy I found in the blunt force trauma to Ian's skull.<eos> But if Ian was killed here, why dump his body nearly a mile away?<eos> Come on, Bones, please tell me you got some prints off that portable speaker.<eos> We did not.
We know that you were his dealer.<eos> Okay. I think we're done here.<eos> I don't know anything about drugs.<eos> And just so we're super clear on that, I'm gonna go call my lawyer. Thanks.<eos> Okay, you do that.
It's just rules that govern the universe.<eos> Next thing you know you're gonna be telling her that rainbows are...<eos> Light refracted through water?<eos> - She already knows that.<eos> - Of course she does.
Bones, come on, we're trying to eat here.<eos> I'm just stating a fact.<eos> I understand that you're stating a fact, but we haven't seen Gordon Gordon in a while here.<eos> We may never see him again if he dies of a heart attack. She doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, I do.
This guy is pathetic.<eos> We can tear him down with fear.<eos> I know that you didn't kill Ron, okay?<eos> But I'm gonna need you to help me out here.<eos> Great, or we just do the opposite.
She said something about a vision.<eos> I-I don't know, I've never seen her so worked up, though.<eos> So I'm supposed to miss this whole party and all this dancing because she had a bad dream?<eos> I know neither of you believe in this stuff, but you...<eos> I don't.
And we are looking into constitutional lawyers.<eos> We're gonna need the best...<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> Listen.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Teddy, honey, want to go draw mommy a picture?<eos> What a good one!<eos> He's dead, isn't he?<eos> And I think Cyrus may have had something to do with it.<eos> Of course he did.
The Major's not Army, he's a Marine.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who's buying all this weaponry?<eos> We don't need to have a situation.<eos> We already do.
How many hunters have you seen out here before?<eos> A lot.<eos> Still wanna split up?<eos> We can deal with it. We just need to find Brett's trail.<eos> No, we don't.
I don't know anyone who doesn't need a little rescue.<eos> Some people make a habit of getting rescued. Same way, other people make a habit out of jumping in after them.<eos> We decided together not to play.<eos> What gave you the right to do this?<eos> This does.
I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
- You made up the game?<eos> - Correct.<eos> I barely know you, Sydney, why are you doing this?<eos> If this has anything to do with Jenna.....<eos> - It doesn't.
- Hey, are you sure you're okay?<eos> You're not still upset with me about...<eos> No, promise.<eos> He doesn't have anything on you, right?<eos> He does.
What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
I think I would just gotten assistant coach.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Who am I if I stay?<eos> Nobody wanted this.<eos> Somebody did.
This is exactly what they wanted all along.<eos> Us breaking apart.<eos> I mean, they already succeeded with Aria.<eos> Whether we pushed her out or she did herself she's gone.<eos> Aria definitely did it to herself.
Yeah, it's the worst.<eos> I wouldn't wish it on anyone.<eos> It always seems like we're saying goodbye.<eos> Do you remember that kiss we shared?<eos> I do.
Just wait a minute.<eos> Wait for what?<eos> Do we really wanna do this?<eos> Nobody wants to do it, Aria, but we have to.<eos> - Do we?
You want to get it done right?<eos> Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
Well, I'm heading out.<eos> I've done what I can.<eos> He's on life support up on three, but candidly, I don't think he's making it till morning.<eos> You had me running there for a bit, thinking I'd done something wrong.<eos> You did.
Aren't we the "No Secrets" club?<eos> We're the "No Secrets Between Us" club.<eos> I think what they're doing here is smart.<eos> I mean, do we really believe there's going to be a "let's talk things out with the zombies" phase once the human population learns we exist?<eos> - I do.
Took a long time, but we finally caught you.<eos> Or maybe I just stopped running.<eos> Do you suffer, Niklaus, as my wife suffered?<eos> As my child suffered?<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Mm-hmm. - And you are both being disgusting.<eos> "The meat."<eos> You know, you used to have a jar that you kept all your boogers in?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - You absolutely did.
- You can.<eos> Chew, swallow.<eos> The world will not implode, I swear.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Do it.
Chew, swallow.<eos> The world will not implode, I swear.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.
We didn't. We always stay over in Ambersea.<eos> At the Westcliff Hotel.<eos> So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.<eos> But I don't.
I know that now.<eos> What about M.K.?<eos> What about M.K.?<eos> Does the book say how to unlock his Gift?<eos> I don't...
Total noobs.<eos> Yeah, Rip yarded us in.<eos> You remember his speech?<eos> I know you don't. You were too busy running your mouth.<eos> Of course I do.
I-I won't fly jet planes... you, uh, stay out of court.<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> You know, guys like you... you think you're so damn smart, and you think you don't have to play straight with anybody.<eos> The wheel is gonna turn.<eos> It always does.
Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
Wes is dead.<eos> - Annalise probably killed him.<eos> - She didn't.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Frank did.
'Cause she rude.<eos> Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.
No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.<eos> You deaf, bitch?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Why'd you kill that boy?<eos> I didn't.
You're the child.<eos> And the last thing you should be doing right now is worrying about me.<eos> It's just that I think we need to have a plan in place.<eos> I got that covered.<eos> - You do?
No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive. And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Then you will be forgotten by both time and the world.<eos> Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy. I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
As you can see, I'm more than alright.<eos> I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better. You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
I'd watch what I say if I were you.<eos> Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family? We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
You want to get back to the States, it's 50K.<eos> 50K?<eos> We're just trying to get home.<eos> You know we don't have that kind of cash.<eos> You do now.
I don't know who I am anymore, and that's... It's worse.<eos> At least before when I looked in the mirror, I knew who I was, and now... it sounds like bad lyrics, but there's a stranger looking back.<eos> We're going to begin what's called exposure therapy.<eos> We need to go back to the night of the accident.<eos> I don't...
Well, hey, thanks, 1FFfrancesca.<eos> You were great today.<eos> You, too.<eos> Those folks love you.<eos> Who doesn't?
Who beat me on any game?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really, now?<eos> I don't think you understand I own the arcade.<eos> No, you don't, but I do.
- I don't know.<eos> You think anybody in this fucking department gives a fuck about your deadbeat brother?<eos> - So there's no one else?<eos> - No.<eos> What do I do?
You think anybody in this fucking department gives a fuck about your deadbeat brother?<eos> - So there's no one else?<eos> - No.<eos> What do I do?<eos> What do I do?
Lucky for you, this potion will take a few hours to stew.<eos> But it'll cost you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I've been running low. - Hmm.<eos> A chick did that to you?
Camille lives wherever she wants.<eos> Homes all over the globe.<eos> She's always liked to spend the winters in Agra.<eos> She loves the smell of lotus blossoms.<eos> Who doesn't?
Okay.<eos> I'll... I'll get there.<eos> But you can't.<eos> The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
I have been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> There's something I need to tell you about where I've been and who I am.<eos> It's all right. I know.<eos> You do?
The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the Institute.<eos> You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
We'll find her.<eos> Here's the address to the closest den.<eos> There's a good chance she's there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Azazel did this.
Which you had with you when you time-jumped<eos> - off the Waverider.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - what you are talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
What can I do?<eos> Just tell her how you feel.<eos> She knows how I feel.<eos> It goes without saying.<eos> Yeah, for us, it does.
Please, just...<eos> Just let me go, man.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Does this look like a spear to you?<eos> It most certainly does not.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do.
She told me that Prometheus forced her to do this.<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable Intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
Ok. Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name... Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
That's Yurievich.<eos> I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich... Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't... Sleep.
Agh! Only need to make sure you never get on that boat.<eos> You thought you could replace me?<eos> Ha ha ha! That's cute.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Oh, I did for so many reasons.
Did she go home sick?<eos> So if you can buy your way out of jail... does that mean Nick's gonna get out?<eos> Honey, she's been here everyday since you got home.<eos> She must've been feeling pretty funky.<eos> - What if he does? - Yeah.
Sorry.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Did you let students without permission slips take the sex ed class?<eos> Uh... Drew saw a comment from a kid online who says he was there.<eos> Of course he did.
How could you do that?<eos> To me?<eos> To Jesus?<eos> - No one knows it was me.<eos> - I do!
Is that correct?<eos> I'm gonna need you to answer me "yes" or "no."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So is that why you lied?<eos> - I didn't.
Anatoly wasn't playing ball unless you did the Bratva's dirty work...<eos> Which is where you took Dinah.<eos> Oliver, I thought you didn't want anything to do with the Bratva.<eos> I don't, but if it's a choice between me crossing the line and the two of you crossing one, that is a very easy choice.<eos> What did you do?
She's gonna have a tough time finding a decent job.<eos> She's certainly not gonna find a job in journalism.<eos> You just blew up her life.<eos> Honestly, I... didn't mean for it to go this far.<eos> Yes, you did.
I'm... - I'm trying to work on it.<eos> - That's progress.<eos> Anyway, Paul's big problem with me being Mr. Terrific was the fact that he was worried, but now he doesn't have to worry with these bad boys in my arsenal.<eos> Sounds like you got the emotional logic all figured out.<eos> I do.
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> Where you going now?<eos> According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.<eos> Chase does everything sideways, man.
Are no one's hero.<eos> Everything and everyone that you love will wither and die at your touch.<eos> Da.<eos> Good riddance.<eos> What do we do about Kovar?
Oliver, have you brought Anatoly Knyazev to Star City?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And he just told me that his operation was nearly compromised by my team.<eos> Well, I said, "that's impossible. The team no longer exists."<eos> The hell it doesn't!
She says she needs to talk to you.<eos> She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
(GRUNTING) Ah, here it is.<eos> First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II<eos> - in the sixth dynasty.<eos> - Oh, my God. Does it say anything about how to stop it?<eos> Yes, actually, it does.
I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
A new Internet.<eos> What? Why?<eos> Okay. Well, I haven't really thought this through, so...<eos> - I own a telescope...<eos> - Of course you do.
You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot?<eos> Bald cunt.<eos> Come on.<eos> Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.<eos> They don't.
Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> I don't really know much more now than I did when I was alive, and I think whatever I know now that I didn't know then<eos> But I do know that I love you.<eos> I mean, I... I had to die to know just how much, but...<eos> I really do.
Do not say a word. Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Sure I do.
Now, maybe if you made your move at dinnertime, you'd've got past the gate. But you'd've ran right into the marshal's office across the street.<eos> How you know where the marshal office is?<eos> You ever hear of the Macon 7?<eos> All the same, why you care we get ourselves kilt?<eos> I don't.
Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
He's obsessed with finding the answer, which is an easy solution for us.<eos> Once he does, we'll get rid of him.<eos> I promise.<eos> And how's him causing a scene at the theater help us?<eos> It doesn't.
So I'll just cook part of him.<eos> No, my dear.<eos> - Let's be calm.<eos> - You don't have that kind of control.<eos> And you do?
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
Yeah?<eos> What happened to, "Cisco, you can beat her"?<eos> - You can.<eos> - "I believe in you."<eos> - I do.
Joe already suspects something's up.<eos> You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.<eos> This story is going to change lives, Barry.<eos> Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?<eos> I don't.
Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all. But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.
Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
- Okay. Okay.<eos> - All right?<eos> All right. Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
I went to the future.<eos> How far?<eos> Eight years from now.<eos> I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was.<eos> Did you?
Wait... what are they doing?<eos> Call it extra credit.<eos> I found some descriptions of an antique church bell in your family estate records.<eos> Wait, we have an estate?<eos> Oh, we did.
- No, everybody stop!<eos> - Uh, hello?<eos> They're sirened.<eos> Oh, you brought the lighter.<eos> Of course you did.
Oh, my God, you are so full of crap.<eos> Fine, then prove me wrong.<eos> Prove that the past is behind us.<eos> Prove to me that you don't care.<eos> I don't.
Caroline, it doesn't matter.<eos> Today, tomorrow...<eos> I know where I'm going and I deserve it.<eos> - No, you don't, okay?<eos> - Yes, I do.
God.<eos> Cutting it pretty close.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> How do I know you're gonna keep up your end?<eos> You don't.
I'm not sure I'll be free.<eos> All right, professor, how do we get rid of the queen of hell?<eos> Are you sure Katherine's in our world?<eos> When Cade crossed planes after the 11th ring of the bell, other souls could step through, too.<eos> Same way Kai did.
We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
Hot women turning up unannounced are no longer welcome.<eos> Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes. Actually, I do.
And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
Precisely.<eos> Yes, although she did have that wretched dependent waiting for her at home.<eos> Well, two, if you count the child.<eos> I think I know what's happening.<eos> Y-You do?
I have some upsetting information to give to Lucifer.<eos> It's a revelation that might send him over the edge against his Father.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?
- How rare?<eos> - Let's put it this way:<eos> all my legal contacts are out of this stuff.<eos> Wait, you have illegal contacts?<eos> You don't?
No, I...<eos> Dean told me to go.<eos> The woman --<eos> The one you lost?<eos> I didn't.
Sam and I will be waiting for him.<eos> I'll pop him with a Devil's Trap bullet.<eos> I'll finish him off with a demon blade.<eos> And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.<eos> Cool, cool. What do I do?
Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
Serena and Alton seem smart.<eos> Pierce...<eos> You know he calls himself.<eos> "The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?<eos> I do. Unfortunately.
Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.<eos> Texting constantly, ultra possessive.<eos> Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.<eos> Guess that explains why he was there.<eos> I did good, right?
Hmm.<eos> But...<eos> You know, gotta protect the rep.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
If I...<eos> Why couldn't I just tell him the truth?<eos> ♪<eos> Gwen...<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
Try us.<eos> We're pretty open mind.<eos> My family, we...<eos> Got a secret.<eos> All the best ones do.
You're taking her to the sandbox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm ending this, once and for all.<eos> Kelly and her baby have to die.<eos> No, they don't.
Human.<eos> Human.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That extraction, it nearly killed you.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
I've been so lost.<eos> I'm not lost anymore.<eos> And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.<eos> You can't actually mean that.<eos> Yes. I do.
I told you I'd put this together.<eos> I'm very good at following instructions.<eos> And you need to rest.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Kelly -- No, Cass, I don't.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
Why'd you plead innocent?<eos> Why'd you make us go through that trial?<eos> Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> Why?<eos> Just... do it.
Then we should bail.<eos> These wretches all tell the same story, Lord.<eos> They flee slaughter at the hands of the brothers.<eos> We must surely be next.<eos> And what do I do?
- Brida! - You and me.<eos> Move!<eos> We make the square!<eos> Your sister made a good whore!<eos> She still does!
Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
I'll get you out faster with this to surrender.<eos> Well, you've had plenty of clients right where I am.<eos> What do they tell their kids?<eos> I got no fucking clue what to say to my boys.<eos> No one ever does.
Get it out of the way. Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
What if the kid did?<eos> What if he saw me?<eos> Break.<eos> Will you relax?<eos> He didn't.
I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> I did.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
I came from dirt.<eos> I put my 20 in on the force.<eos> Saved every penny.<eos> And I built this.<eos> I did this. This.
Now it-- It's happening all over again.<eos> He's gonna talk about all that now, Manny is, and when he does... that prosecutor's gonna give me the death penalty.<eos> Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't.
We'll, uh, give you some leeway, Ms. Wexler, but don't stray too far.<eos> Charles McGill is not the subject of this hearing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did Jimmy know his brother was the one that prevented you from hiring him?<eos> He did not.
I mean, it must be awful.<eos> Well, I think you're good.<eos> Really good.<eos> You don't know what that means to me, coming from you.<eos> Sure, I do.
She has the critics, so what?<eos> You have the audience.<eos> You're the one they're rooting for, not her.<eos> You know, I-I really thought this film was going to be a flop.<eos> I really did, Hedda.
- You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> You were never in my corner.<eos> All these years, you always thought Davis had more talent than I did.<eos> She does.
Giving Bray easy access to move captives.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> If this compound sits on a tunnel... and let's admit that's a... that's a mighty big "if"... how do you suggest we get in or even know where we are?<eos> It's not like we have a map.<eos> No, the Middlesex Museum of British History does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody, just calm down.<eos> We're on the same side, fellas.<eos> It's okay. You don't have to do this, sweetheart.<eos> He has my son!<eos> No, he doesn't.
You've been told we lost our son.<eos> He was on the beach one moment and gone the next.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> We didn't lose Christopher.<eos> I did.
Those two new each other.<eos> Knew each other how?<eos> It looks like they had an affair, because after it ended, she had a restraining order against him.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Love never does, my friend.
With what?<eos> Simple binary choice.<eos> Did she or didn't she?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No. She didn't.
You're a cold, heartless killer... who'd murder her own son if it got her what she needed!<eos> Spying on me, deceiving me...<eos> Is it worth it, killing me?<eos> Is it worth Whitehall?<eos> Then do it.
He gave you a second chance.<eos> Yeah, second... third.<eos> Howard saved me.<eos> I wish to God he never got on that airplane.<eos> He didn't.
Dad?<eos> You never called me that before.<eos> Command, I thought Deavers left.<eos> Didn't he say he was heading home?<eos> He did.
I'm on a low-sodium diet.<eos> I'll file a motion.<eos> That's my guy.<eos> Thank you so much for covering for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you. I did it for my dad.
I believe these are yours.<eos> Please don't leave me alone again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anyone ever tell you you have a kind face?<eos> I do?
I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But now they do.
A strong support system is key in these kinds of studies.<eos> Okay, we are not gonna give up on her just because...<eos> Because her only family just walked out the door?<eos> Violet will come back.<eos> What if she doesn't?
What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Still ice cold and pale.<eos> I hate to say it, but...<eos> Then don't.
You saved my leg, but now it's time I stand on my own two feet, you know?<eos> Yeah. Screwed-up dads.<eos> Everyone seems to have one.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Luke did all right.
But i...<eos> Even though you don't like me like that,<eos> I still want us to be friends...<eos> Best friends.<eos> You do?
If there's something you want to get off your chest, Perhaps about jason, now would be the time.<eos> Weatherbee just asked me if i knew anything about jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing. That i didn't.
What happened?<eos> Jason.<eos> he's gone... i know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
So when an anonymous buyer made Mayor McCoy an offer, she couldn't refuse...<eos> Anonymous buyer?<eos> What do they have to hide?<eos> No one cares.<eos> I do!
How hard it would even be, if I've me a little heads-up?<eos> Look, I am, by nature, a conscientious objector.<eos> Not saying anything to either you or Betty, was the most moral, apathetic choice I could make.<eos> But, Jug. She's not going to write about me and Grundy in the paper, is she?<eos> Like she did with Chuck?
I was married to a man who would come home from work every night, late, and drunk, and with a temper.<eos> One night, I ended up in the emergency room with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone.<eos> The next morning, he barely even remembered the fight, and he promised that it wouldn't happen again.<eos> But...<eos> It did, again.
I thought the one thing that we could keep our Riverdale safe from was child predators.<eos> Ms. Grundy's not a predator.<eos> She's a good person<eos> Archie, you don't have to defend me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Will that satisfy you?<eos> Yeah, it will.<eos> It has to. And I absolutely would dare, Mom.<eos> She has to leave town.<eos> - The hell she does.
FP was a mess.<eos> He was stealing from the company and selling stuff on the side.<eos> All things considered, I was pretty generous.<eos> So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.
I'll get it.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Right this way.<eos> I thought you said she wanted me to be here.<eos> She does.
I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> - Where is Mustang? - No, no, no, no.<eos> You do not want to go see him.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know, wistfully.<eos> - Wistfully?<eos> - Longingly.<eos> Like you liked Betty.<eos> I do.
Be at the Great Meadow Golf Course, one hour.<eos> If you bring the evidence, you have my word I'll release your family.<eos> You don't give a shit about the evidence.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
I want what you're giving Payne.<eos> What makes you think I want him dead that badly?<eos> 'Cause they're amateurs, and you're thinking about it, which means you still get paid even with them dead.<eos> I didn't think you were a man that cared about money.<eos> I don't.
"If you see something, say something."<eos> Well, Jafar...<eos> He saw something.<eos> But he took it one step further.<eos> He did something about it.
I am not "man." I am Mr. Rankin.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me how the four of you ended up together?<eos> Why wouldn't the four of us be together?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I don't.
What?<eos> Why? We just saved the school.<eos> I just don't want to be my dad's legacy here.<eos> I want to leave all of that behind.<eos> With the statue and everything that we did here tonight.
What's yours?<eos> Wade Houghton.<eos> So... you know Asa Farrell?<eos> That's the man we're lookin' for.<eos> I do.
He do it?<eos> He the killer?<eos> No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
I can't help but feel that his escape has something to do with him coming back here for some unfinished business.<eos> The tie-in to Jim Blackwell is too huge a coincidence.<eos> Do you have any idea what that reason might be?<eos> No.<eos> No, I... I don't.
Yes, I've been here for three years.<eos> I think I've shown my value.<eos> I have my notary license.<eos> Well, Marion, I... I don't mean to be harsh, but, may I ask, do you have a college degree?<eos> No, I don't.
I-I'm so glad.<eos> Yeah, and I get such a vibe off them, Of your mom...<eos> What a cool lady she was.<eos> She had great taste.<eos> Yes, she... she certainly did.
Well, that's quite the story.<eos> And how did you end up in Los Angeles?<eos> Like a book, we've all got a lot of chapters.<eos> Yes, no.<eos> That we do.
I did want to.<eos> Mother, it killed me that I was so small, that there was nothing I could do.<eos> But you thought about it.<eos> You thought, "when I'm big enough, I'll kill him."<eos> I did.
I did. Me, Norman.<eos> I-I did that.<eos> That is one thing that I know for sure.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I don't...
It's time for me to fix this.<eos> Turn to your left, please.<eos> Okay, if you could step up to the desk, please.<eos> I need to take your prints.<eos> Wha... what do I do here?
- Shall we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have your license?<eos> I don't have a Blockbuster card.<eos> Yeah, neither does anyone else.
Oh, I just heard about Kevin.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna go to Christine's.<eos> You want to come?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay.
Oh, shit.<eos> That bad?<eos> At least he's usually willing to deal.<eos> But we got to get in his front door first.<eos> How do we do that?
I'm sorry.<eos> There are no photographs of me as a child.<eos> I didn't think I minded.<eos> But now I've seen one.<eos> And I do.
Shelagh?<eos> You must've seen babies that lived as long as mine did.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do they have fingers and toes?<eos> Yes, they do.
Work. Where we all have to go.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - What's wrong with your face? It's like a long wet weekend.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Yes, you do.
You're doing your due diligence.<eos> Mr. Byrde, we don't know...<eos> Call me Marty.<eos> Marty, we don't know that much about stocks and investing.<eos> Well, I kinda do.
I...<eos> I saw Furkat. He told me you were here.<eos> So you just happened to be in Paris?<eos> No, no, I have a... I have a friend here.<eos> Of course you do.
- I did, yes.<eos> I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful, especially on someone of that age.<eos> You could have infected yourself and others.<eos> You could have devastated the entire Citadel.<eos> But you didn't.
Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.<eos> Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.<eos> They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.<eos> This isn't a war we can win.<eos> So, what do we do?
You are very kind, my lords. But Jon is our king.<eos> He is doing what he thinks is best.<eos> I warned Jon this would happen.<eos> That he couldn't leave the North and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.<eos> He didn't.
- Could've been worse.<eos> She wanted to kill me.<eos> And would have killed me<eos> - if it wasn't for Davos...<eos> - But they didn't, did they?
But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.
- I made him back down.<eos> What?<eos> Why? Why? Because he would have been killed, and so would you.<eos> And I already have Charlie's death on my hands.<eos> We all do.
And apparently, she's also been talking to Taylor about me.<eos> Well, then, you have a major crack in the damn, Marius, because that cop is gonna run Pete's name sooner rather than later, and it's not gonna be your face that pops up, is it?<eos> If the truth comes out, it's gonna be a shit storm to end all shit storms, because you'll go back to prison.<eos> And Eddie can say goodbye to his fingers.<eos> So I don't... what do I do?
I'm sticking to the plan. I'm sticking to the fucking plan.<eos> I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm gonna beat the clock. I'm telling you. That's what I'm saying.<eos> What if you don't?
Just 'cause I don't wanna do something.<eos> Doesn't mean it's fear. It... sometimes I don't wanna do something.<eos> Just 'cause I don't wanna do it.<eos> So you don't wanna do it?<eos> Maybe I don't.
This is gonna be great on you.<eos> Yeah. That does look good.<eos> Well, we have to look very hard to find something. That wouldn't look good on you.<eos> Well, I don't know about all that.<eos> I do.
Come on, you get that.<eos> That's the last thing I wanna do 'cause it's what mama would've done.<eos> And you know she had that mile-wide mean streak.<eos> And frankly, I'm... I'm scared that I have it, too.<eos> You don't.
That's the last thing I wanna do 'cause it's what mama would've done.<eos> And you know she had that mile-wide mean streak.<eos> And frankly, I'm... I'm scared that I have it, too.<eos> You don't.<eos> All right, you do not.
She just peed on my legs. And I felt it.<eos> What?<eos> I felt it!<eos> My god!<eos> I did!
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The neighbourhood's really hot right now.<eos> Some great restaurants, clubs in the area, if you like to go out.<eos> Yeah, I do.
How do you know Zach?<eos> Oh, we met at a benefit.<eos> You know, I'm not surprised.<eos> - He knows everybody.<eos> - He really does.
Maybe we should just accept our good fortune.<eos> Just not before we talk to Sheila, though.<eos> Oh, of course, I'm gonna have a lawyer look at the contract.<eos> I have a feeling she'll find a million loopholes that are just gonna screw us over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
I mean, we're good now, but... I'm not sitting in judgment of anybody.<eos> I just hope...<eos> What?<eos> I just hope you know you deserve to be happy.<eos> Everybody does.
I'm not just doing this because it helps me.<eos> It goes so much deeper than that.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> I... I want to know.<eos> No, you don't.
You know why.<eos> Come on, aren't we all equal in the eyes of God?<eos> I don't know how to say this.<eos> But, honestly, if that's how you're looking at it, then you really don't understand the problem.<eos> I do.
You did.<eos> If you will let me, I think I can help Highway 65 flourish.<eos> I want us to write our story.<eos> You don't wanna do it?<eos> Baby, I don't.
And I got so mad I just decided I'm walking away.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> But as I walked away, I remember thinking to myself, but if he comes after me right now and he gets me, then I'll be with him forever.<eos> And he did?
I will schedule an appointment with the doctor on Monday.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to wait until Monday.<eos> I want to see her tomorrow.<eos> Of course you do.
You look good, Mom.<eos> Oh, honey, when'd you get to be such a good liar?<eos> Oh, hey, y'all.<eos> Bucky, you didn't have to come sit over here all night.<eos> - Of course I did.
You'll fix that?<eos> Not a lot, unfortunately.<eos> We just try to stabilize her.<eos> And wait for the circulation to clear on its own.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Dad?<eos> Yes, sweet girl?<eos> Do you think she knows we're here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
"I thought that love would last forever.<eos> I was wrong."<eos> - Hey. I'll take that for you.<eos> I never know what to say at these moments.<eos> Oh, nobody does.
I just... i figured a man Wasn't supposed to feel anything.<eos> You were all alone?<eos> Thing is that's exactly what I did to you.<eos> - I let you down.<eos> - No, you didn't.
So we're just gonna make a bunch of new ones.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Zach cares.<eos> He really does.
But songs evolve and sometimes you have to just let them.<eos> But this didn't evolve on its own.<eos> You changed it!<eos> And I'm sorry, but I liked it the way it was.<eos> Of course, you do!
Uh, my license is in my wallet.<eos> And my registration and insurance is in the glove box.<eos> Is it okay if I reach for it?<eos> But, which stop sign did we roll through?<eos> Because we didn't.
No...<eos> Look.<eos> We know she has parents.<eos> - We know that now.<eos> - No, no, she doesn't.
Well, girl, you have made quite a splash.<eos> - It's so not funny, Juliette. - I know, I know.<eos> It feels like the whole world is looking at you.<eos> But do you feel like you did something wrong?<eos> No, I don't!
I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
- Oh, come on...<eos> - I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.
- I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
Chris Stapleton, The Exes, and of course, the first live performance by Juliette Barnes since that plane crash earlier this year.<eos> Aside from bringing you a new artist, I was thinking about big media integration... Uh, Deacon!<eos> Just the man I want to see, let me introduce you to Casadee.<eos> - I know Deacon. - Hey, Cass.<eos> How you doing?
I didn't even think.<eos> And now everyone's making me into all types of things.<eos> And even you think it was my fault.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I didn't, baby.
- No.<eos> It's worse.<eos> - How's it worse?<eos> Because I was an established artist who had the luxury of taking a chance.<eos> - Hallie does not!
She's basically lost everything.<eos> Anyway, your whole world is opening up.<eos> I lost everything too.<eos> I know.<eos> We all did.
No, I wouldn't talk about it in this setting.<eos> Honey, we've gotten so far off topic.<eos> I'm the one that's sitting here completely exposed.<eos> No, I didn't have an affair.<eos> I don't...
There you go.<eos> I'll see you next time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I remember you.<eos> No, you don't.
I'll see you next time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I remember you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's great.<eos> - And you love him?<eos> - No! I used to, but I haven't in a very long time.<eos> - So why do you call him?<eos> - I don't.
I don't understand why you would reach out over something that's so personal.<eos> Because it's personal to me too, Deacon.<eos> I've lost pregnancies and I wanted her to know that someone out there understood.<eos> - I'm sorry, Jessie.<eos> - I didn't...
No!<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I... I kind of wanted to.<eos> All right.<eos> But at the same time, I really didn't.
Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Guys, we're gonna start with that one, all right?<eos> Michael, did you get the changes to the end of "Good Rain?"<eos> Yes, I did.
Whatever this is, I'm not doing it.<eos> Just get out of the car.<eos> Jessie, I don't have time for this.<eos> - You do have time.<eos> - No, I don't, Jessie.
I mean, if it's anything like this party.<eos> It's filled with stupid people.<eos> Present company excluded.<eos> How do you know I'm not stupid?<eos> I don't.
Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
The rest of your life.<eos> I liked those stories we read, especially about the fish who got too big for the pond.<eos> That's a really good one.<eos> You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you?<eos> No. I don't.
How old are your kids?<eos> Lila's 17. Nate's 11.<eos> You got kids, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wasn't gonna miss this.<eos> What's it been, 25 years, 30?<eos> You disappeared, brother.<eos> - But I read your book. - You did?<eos> We all did.
He-he...<eos> This has to end right now.<eos> He's twice your age and he's using you.<eos> You have no fucking idea what you're talking about!<eos> Yes, I do!
Because I get how this goes.<eos> He leaves now, and then the next time, three months later or three years or tomorrow, whenever he shows up with his bullshit, you let him right back fucking in.<eos> I mean, I-I really don't understand it.<eos> I have tried.<eos> But I don't.
You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.
Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> You don't.
I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do. You don't.
I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do. You don't.<eos> - I do.
You don't know me.<eos> I do. You don't.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I do.
I do. You don't.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
- I do.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
I do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I know you.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We can't save each other.<eos> We can only save ourselves.<eos> I have to tell you something about the night Scott died.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I don't?
I'm sorry.<eos> No, just go.<eos> Um, I just... I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't know how to live with this.<eos> You just do.
And you got stuck there.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you, man.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - You...<eos> - No, I don't.
But Jake didn't kill her.<eos> Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out.<eos> What? And you don't?
She's alive.<eos> What's the name of your inmate?<eos> Abby didn't tell me what this is about, which isn't unusual.<eos> But, I have to ask.<eos> No, you don't.
Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
Please.<eos> Huck, what was she driving?<eos> Huck, don't you dare give up on me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you? !
It's all categorized as hunting, Donnie.<eos> I know, but specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is dire, Donnie. He needs some ideas of a concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no. I don't, Donnie.
Why?<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- May I?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> It was a few years ago. Yes.<eos> Of course I do.
You motherfucker.<eos> Audrey used to to fund a real estate scheme.<eos> Yeah, and who lured her into this fucking real estate scheme?<eos> Him, because he knew that she had your money.<eos> Did you do a real estate deal with her before? Before when?
He had his story. He stuck to it.<eos> Unless he didn't.<eos> If they had anything, they would have charged him.<eos> And who knows what he would have said then?<eos> I do.
Okay, here's the address.<eos> Sending the location now.<eos> Squad, 1305, copy that.<eos> Who lives there?<eos> GOSS: Who doesn't, more like it.
I'm suspicious that the folks you work for... the federal government...<eos> occasionally fuck up.<eos> Hey, you get me started, I'll admit I'm suspicious that not all prize fights are on the up and up, that Warren Buffett and Bill Gates may not really like each other as much as they claim.<eos> I'm even suspicious that maybe you don't really need those glasses to see.<eos> I do.
It feels delicious on your ass.<eos> I mean, we used to sneak out at night and, - oh, for hours we would...<eos> - Bigby, please.<eos> Are you telling me you don't even remember that tree?<eos> Of course I do, darling. Of course.
Screw Broussard.<eos> Think he gives a shit about us?<eos> Then where the hell is he?<eos> - You know where.<eos> - No, I don't.
How hard can it be to clean up after a pig?<eos> Look, I'm the only one who feeds him, cleans him, and maintains his wallow.<eos> I am grateful beyond words.<eos> I bet you didn't even know it was called a wallow.<eos> - I certainly did!
Oh, we're winning so far.<eos> There was a British agent here asking after you.<eos> Figured he'd catch up to me, eventually.<eos> The money is good, Martin, but I don't need it.<eos> Neither does Steiner.
Why did Nick look like daddy?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... We were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.
It's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... We were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.<eos> - We all did.
I will not live like this.<eos> I can't be this vulnerable all the time. I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
My god, my god, my god!<eos> My baby.<eos> Can't tell you how grateful we are.<eos> You have no idea what this means to us.<eos> Actually, I do.
- was buried right here?<eos> - So it's either a complete coincidence or the killer was the digger.<eos> Hey, we believe in a lot of things but not coincidence.<eos> You see any signs of a pick or a shovel?<eos> I do not.
Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
- After all this? - No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
Or... moving through mirrors?<eos> Eh, no, but, I mean, there was a lot we didn't talk about.<eos> For the record, not a great mother.<eos> Do you still have any of her books?<eos> I do...
- If the autopsy proves she died from anything you did to her, you will go to jail, Mason.<eos> Now we talked to Dr. Landeaux.<eos> He told us she was suffering from dementia, and she could become violent.<eos> Now your record doesn't suggest you like assaulting people.<eos> - I don't.
You have a son. You should be thinking of him.<eos> You're here because of me.<eos> None of this would have ever happened to you if you hadn't met me.<eos> So you think I wanna change that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You're here because of me.<eos> None of this would have ever happened to you if you hadn't met me.<eos> So you think I wanna change that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't.
Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
It's no fault of his that I struggle.<eos> What is it?<eos> This morning... .. Osborne came to me... .. demanding... .. that I... That he...<eos> But did not Dr Enys advise at least six weeks of abstinence?<eos> He did.
I have law school after that.<eos> It'll probably be years before I get a real job.<eos> And he broke up with you?<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
You mean, there's not another bus?<eos> People lie.<eos> Board don't.<eos> You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?<eos> Sure, I do.
What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you, I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
If any of you have any questions at all, please come talk to me about it.<eos> If not, let's get back to work.<eos> Mike.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
$3,600?<eos> Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The clinic has a fund to help with this kind of thing.<eos> We do it all the time.
- I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> - Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.
I put myself on the vocational training lists when I was 17 years old.<eos> I'm 52 now.<eos> Still waiting for my slot.<eos> But we still gotta take care of ourselves down here.<eos> And so we do.
I made a deal with your dad to get me my key.<eos> If I let you go, he's got no reason to do it.<eos> What if he doesn't bring it?<eos> He will.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
And I don't mean to make light of the circumstances.<eos> Believe me, this is all happening just as quickly for me.<eos> But I want to make this work.<eos> Plenty of arranged marriages do.<eos> And plenty don't.
But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
- Last three worlds I've been in haven't had any fucking oxygen.<eos> My fingers just... they just... They just keep shorting me out.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did we kill the beast?<eos> - We did.
Then stop worrying about what we're doing because tomorrow isn't about losing.<eos> It's about winning.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> We've been up all night and we've got nothing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Because I'm an O'Hare, Jesse.<eos> I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right. Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?
No. I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.<eos> I've not come here to talk you out of anything, alright?<eos> I'm only here to let you kno that whatever you decide, I'm with you, Padre.<eos> It'd be over between us, Cass.<eos> If I did it.
- Ricky!<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?<eos> - Ricky, I'm so sorry.<eos> - You lied!<eos> He didn't do anything!
No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
We'll be very respectful, but we need to go in and get 'em.<eos> First of all, they're not men.<eos> They're boys.<eos> And they now have sanctuary inside this church.<eos> - Like hell they do.
"...with the introductions effected by the two retinues, "at which point, the Princess and the Prince..."<eos> That should be the other way round, surely? "..<eos> Will strip to the waist and wrestle in the filth "and detritus of the forest floor." It doesn't say that.<eos> Um...<eos> No, it doesn't! What about the end?
A wild boar, 200 pounds A made game, I say.<eos> It would be a trifle dangerous.<eos> Where did you acquire these poisons?<eos> I want to...<eos> Where did you...
Yeah! - Whoo! - My baby, my baby!<eos> Well done, son.<eos> Remember how cute he was in his little Buzz Lightyear costume?<eos> Or how he used to say "burfday" and "Li-bary"?<eos> He still does.
It's just water weight. That iv is the only reason you're feeling stronger.<eos> You need to leave it in. You know, screw this.<eos> You're not gonna do it,<eos> - I'll pull it out myself.<eos> - Whoa! No, no, no. Please don't do that.
It should be me apologizing to you. Why?<eos> I'm the one who made everything worse.<eos> I haven't been fair to you.<eos> Stohl also said that he hoped we all learned something today.<eos> And I did.
You know, it used to be if a doctor told a patient to do something, they just did it.<eos> You been binging on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" again?<eos> I'm just saying, things were different.<eos> Like, guys didn't need to tell women every single thing they were feeling.<eos> My father never did.
There can't be a bigger emergency than this.<eos> My son is dying.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and do nothing?<eos> Mrs. Banks, Dustin still has options, other ways of continuing to warm.<eos> Mr. Kessler does not.
Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is. - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
Why are you asking?<eos> Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.<eos> And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do, don't you?
I am. [Music] Fitz!<eos> Oh, Fitz, this has all been a big misunderstanding.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> - Things just got out of control.<eos> - Yeah, they did.
I'm with the u.N. Taskforce here.<eos> Some biohazardous materials were unearthed on this site.<eos> Really dangerous stuff.<eos> You have paper?<eos> I do, indeed, yes.
Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do. And you?
Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Is she your source for the Resistance?<eos> - No!<eos> - No! Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here! Unh!<eos> Well, I do.
We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
Ah, well.<eos> No matter. We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Please tell me that you built a back door to this place.<eos> - I did.
That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> - I do.
It would've been nice to have your support when Kyle drew his line in the sand.<eos> I didn't agree with your take on it.<eos> Besides, Adam should've come to me. I'm the producer.<eos> I really don't think he makes the distinction.<eos> Of course he does.
Make him your pal, Delorme.<eos> Open him.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Hey. Yes. Do you understand how big this is?<eos> I do.
My wife and I had a son.<eos> Oliver.<eos> He's almost five.<eos> They had Canadian passports.<eos> I didn't.
No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
- Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.<eos> I'm sorry too, Harvey.<eos> Jessica, you don't need to apologize.<eos> Yes, I do.
That bridge is fifty feet high.<eos> The water was shallow.<eos> There were rocks.<eos> I barely survived the jump myself.<eos> Yes, but you did.
Remember when Constable Crabtree shot him?<eos> We never did take out the bullet.<eos> - The bullets match.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
Bradley, don't send that video yet.<eos> She wasn't kidnapped by Inazagi.<eos> They realize who she is, that's who they'll sell her to.<eos> She has no corporate I.P.<eos> But you do.
I have to get back to work, sir.<eos> You got a gut feeling about who did this?<eos> I have someone in mind.<eos> Hey, didn't hear you come home last night.<eos> I didn't.
They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Find Rachel at the bar.<eos> Wait. How do they know I was there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just do.
He's what Black Badge made him.<eos> Though they lied to him about that, too.<eos> That's why I was in Purgatory.<eos> I was trying to help him find out what he... we are.<eos> What they did to us.
Damn, I do feel naked without it.<eos> - Hold... still!<eos> - How do we get out?<eos> - We go down!<eos> - What about me, what do I do?
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.<eos> Fucking Eddie.<eos> I ain't seen him.<eos> How did you afford a place there, then?<eos> I didn't.
There.<eos> - Those were hers.<eos> - Man, what the fuck?<eos> - How you know that?<eos> - Just do.
Sara! Grey, do something.<eos> - She's still alive.<eos> I'll try to stabilize her, but we need Gideon.<eos> I don't know how to be a Captain, man.<eos> Yes, you do, Jefferson.
They're stories, all right?<eos> The Medieval world was a time of turmoil.<eos> It was the collapse of Rome, which led to the collapse of civilization itself.<eos> And don't even get me started on the health and sanitation.<eos> - Yeah, please don't.
Yeah, we do.<eos> Excellent work, Jeremiah.<eos> I know it wasn't easy.<eos> We have a deal, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
My job.<eos> Protect the identity of Supergirl and the DEO.<eos> - You're gonna mind-wipe him?<eos> - Do you object?<eos> No. Just... Before you do...
Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?
Woody, look,<eos> I know you got it in your head that... I don't know...<eos> I may not think highly of you, but I'm telling you this, I just want to help my sister.<eos> Now do you want this or not?<eos> I do.
Both of you.<eos> When you told her, what did she say?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> She didn't want to believe it.<eos> None of us do.
How long have you been married?<eos> A year.<eos> Not long enough I think for him to be scouting a younger version.<eos> I understand your grief.<eos> No, you do not.
Forgive me, Madame, I can't tell you.<eos> Cannot or will not?<eos> Cannot.<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Well, who does?
Do what you need to do.<eos> I can'n'breathe in here.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Mom said you like to paint, too.<eos> I do.
So you just stay calm and they'll make everything all right.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.
He'll be coming by way of Mystic Falls, carrying one of the bones and the means to find another.<eos> Between the three of us, we should have those remains by sundown.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> For that matter, why would you trust me?<eos> I don't.
That's where Martin Byrde is.<eos> Alive and well, swiping his Amex.<eos> How are we gonna do this?<eos> Byrde liquidates his business.<eos> Somebody does the same to Bruce.
You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you...<eos> The gods did.
They're all over the place, demanding independence from every planet they land on. Why are you here?<eos> Because I figured out why you keep your box as a phone box.<eos> I told you, it's stuck.<eos> "Advice and Assistance Obtainable Immediately." You like that.<eos> No, I don't.
The town's unclear.<eos> But I did hear this big casino guy,<eos> Donald Thayer, he's getting ready to get busy building upstate.<eos> I know Thayer.<eos> Mm. 'Course you do.
But apparently, I can't give it to you.<eos> You're allowed, you know.<eos> You are not an algorithm, you are not a machine, you're human.<eos> You are allowed to have a down quarter.<eos> All hedge funds do, eventually.
Or I will.<eos> Deb, you found Wags?<eos> No.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> - You do?
Look at me.<eos> I don't ever want to hear you say that again.<eos> It's Daddy's fault that Mommy and Daddy aren't together right now.<eos> When you're a kid your age, you think that your parents know everything.<eos> But we don't.
If I lost, someone else must've gained.<eos> So I ran a thousand simulations a day in my head.<eos> And over and over again, Bobby, it came back the same.<eos> I was your stalking horse.<eos> You did the transaction.
Isn't the point of analysis that we don't know?<eos> Which is why I'm not in that racket.<eos> We don't have that kind of fucking time.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Fucking right we don't.
No.<eos> I couldn't say. Sorry.<eos> Only it's our understanding that he was the victim of a violent assault during the two days we're talking about.<eos> And you'd think it'd be something that might come up.<eos> It honestly didn't.
Yes.<eos> I'm still involved with the university.<eos> It's where I studied.<eos> But we appealed for all the party guests to come forward.<eos> - You didn't.
You were awake before he put you to sleep again.<eos> Your husband, while your hands were around your little girl's throat.<eos> You should have seen him.<eos> The shape that boy was in, he couldn't have left here on his own.<eos> He didn't.
You didn't luck into being born a Royal.<eos> You were born with killer instincts, and that's why I wanted to meet you... Your Majesty.<eos> What did baby do?<eos> Baby made a mess.<eos> Yes, he most certainly did.
I have to go.<eos> Listen to me. They're the ones that can't even get on nasdaq.<eos> Off the phone, please, Mr. Davis.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Shoot me up, doc.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> Do it.
Well, Mommy says there are many shades of different as there are of people.<eos> Well, I wish I was told that when I was growing up.<eos> Are those my meds?<eos> You don't need these anymore, Suzanne.<eos> No, actually... I do.
- Nice job, Suzanne.<eos> Here, let me...<eos> let me...<eos> Okay. Let's just U-turn this and go to Medical, okay?<eos> Do a three-point turn, maybe, all right?
Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
See, they look positive to me.<eos> I mean, I know some of the lines is blurrier than the others, but I think I'm so fucking crazy, I'm seeing shit now.<eos> Babe... you're actually pregnant.<eos> I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.
No.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> We did what we believed in.<eos> Ain't no one can take that from us.<eos> Except they did.
My aunt tried to explain it, but I don't think she understands it, either.<eos> I know trepanation.<eos> They basically... lift the upper flap of your scalp and drill a hole under your skull to release pressure on the brain.<eos> You making this shit up right now?<eos> Uh, my... my roommate, freshman year, uh, he did it for enlightenment.
Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Alie said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
Don't.<eos> Please. That's not tech.<eos> That's the spirit of the commanders. Please.<eos> Ilian, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
You know I never saw what that looked like.<eos> I am going to be a great dad some day because of you, and that's a hell of a gift.<eos> So... you got a gift too?<eos> You're... you want to transfer?<eos> I don't.
- Wallace Tufo?<eos> - You're the NYPD officer?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> How bad is he?<eos> Who did this?
We're fully booked next week.<eos> We've got three open suites, so I was just gonna rotate guests as they come, and we'll do the regular rooms first, then we'll do the cabins afterwards.<eos> Why don't we just wait till the off-season?<eos> Better to do it now. 'Cause they upcharge in the off-season.<eos> Everybody does their renovations then.
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.<eos> I don't know what's right.<eos> My best friend in the world does crazy shit and doesn't trust me and doesn't listen to me.<eos> It is not that simple, and you know it.<eos> I don't...
I told you a story about us swimming.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> My dad... the way he taught Danny was he took him out in the middle of the ocean and he threw him overboard.<eos> He expected him to swim.<eos> And he did.
- Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
But the AG thinks that you stalled, she's gonna show you the Hans Gruber Memorial Exit.<eos> Well, it's nice to hear you take the potential demise of my career so seriously.<eos> Laugh or cry.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I sure do.
If we fail, it's on both of us.<eos> I won't be able to protect you.<eos> And what a relief that will be... for both of us.<eos> The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.
Model it up for me.<eos> All scenarios.<eos> Son, I did something today that is gonna absolutely floor you.<eos> I thought you went golfing today.<eos> I did.
And let me guess.<eos> You have a solution.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Yes, I do.
And the traction control is off!<eos> This has now been transformed from something that was brilliant... into something that is sensational.<eos> Of course, you'd never drive in race mode on the road, in the same way you'd never take your wristwatch into space.<eos> But it's nice to know that it would still work if you did.<eos> And this does.
Nobody is!<eos> It's true that car design has become so dreary lately.<eos> And I think part of it, it's almost as if the people who design cars don't actually like cars that much.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But they did then.
You're saying...<eos> I'm gonna have to do it, aren't I?<eos> Soon, James Bond was ready to go in the water.<eos> - Do I look like Roger Moore?<eos> - Yeah, you do.
I'm gonna have to do it, aren't I?<eos> Soon, James Bond was ready to go in the water.<eos> - Do I look like Roger Moore?<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - You do, yeah. Yeah.
Right, into the tight complex of old lady's house.<eos> Keeping it nice and tidy through there.<eos> And now full power for the lumpy, bumpy sprint down to substation.<eos> Front hazards coming on under hard braking.<eos> All flats do that for some reason.
- Does that mean he's not coming on, then?<eos> Well, James, his lungs have filled with icy water, he's sunk to the bottom, and his body is being compressed to the size of a Ping-Pong ball.<eos> So that is a no.<eos> It's OK, though, because we have a back-up plan.<eos> - Do we?
- No, not this time.<eos> But he was mad enough that he could have.<eos> I wish he were dead.<eos> - You don't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
So you can abandon the Quad with a clear conscience.<eos> Okay, you do understand.<eos> You're right about one thing, Kalla.<eos> Your ancestors had no good choices.<eos> But you do.
Skipping out on you?<eos> Real dick move and I'm sorry for it..<eos> Very, very sorry.<eos> - I don't care anymore.<eos> But I did.
Going after the drive, I get.<eos> But putting our lives on the line to settle a score?<eos> So what're you saying?<eos> We just let him get away with it?<eos> He already did.
- We were just in the Pollux system.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> So we just traveled half a lightyear?<eos> That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> Maybe it does.
This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.<eos> Discontent is growing.<eos> Teku is overreacting.<eos> You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.<eos> I do.
Drop your weapons.<eos> - And then what?<eos> - I meant what I said.<eos> Please don't make me a liar.<eos> Do it. Do it.
I panicked. I didn't have time to decide how to tell him about us.<eos> But I've thought about it, and I spoke to Liam, and I'll just tell him straight away.<eos> I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, what do I do?
Hi, Sophie, it's... [screams]<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?<eos> Yes, but you got to wait in line with the other kids.<eos> No, you don't, buddy.
Foley won't talk to you.<eos> He won't even talk to me.<eos> Does that seem like the behavior of a man whose acts were unintentional? No.<eos> But it doesn't mean you have to engage.<eos> Sure it does.
You're so far ahead of where Axe and I were when we were your age.<eos> We hadn't made hard choices. You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget. I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
If you write that I'm safe, and don't wish to risk more than that in a letter, it won't be a lie.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I'm more worried about Abe.<eos> I know Washington wants him to stay where he is, and you have to follow orders,<eos> - but Abe doesn't.
The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
722 man on Long Island.<eos> 725 whaleboat courier."<eos> Whaleboat.<eos> I know who his courier is.<eos> You do?
And almost got goddamn eaten, how we all almost died Because you took the truck and the hotel was overrun.<eos> Alicia, I thought it was safe.<eos> We checked every room. Nowhere is safe. Sorry.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I almost died after that.<eos> It doesn't.
Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Not that that's hard with a psycho like you.<eos> You know Mom was afraid of you, right?<eos> She was afraid of you.<eos> She thought she loved you, I'm sure.<eos> She didn't.
Come on.<eos> It's a warning.<eos> The germans must already be there.<eos> They were supposed to come by train.<eos> They didn't.
Well, no teenager leaves her phone.<eos> How could she get off a moving train?<eos> When the stain stops moving, I guess, right?<eos> But then the station CCTV would've shown her getting off the platform. Right.<eos> Unless she didn't.
Saunders.<eos> We need a negotiator.<eos> He can be here in 45 minutes.<eos> Eric said I should take the lead on this.<eos> He did?
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes. Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
You. Lord Uhtred.<eos> Bury him.<eos> Lord King? It is done.<eos> What we have just witnessed... do you believe it to be true?<eos> I do.
No, it was a surprise, lord, nothing more than that.<eos> Lord, love should be gentle and kind.<eos> "Gentle and kind," she says.<eos> How is it that you have a knowledge of how love should be?<eos> I do not.
Told you were special.<eos> I was thrown away like someone's garbage.<eos> You know nothing of my pain.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Monseur Clios had a safe room installed.<eos> The safe code has 8 digits.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know that.<eos> Well, who does?
What does the tox screen tell us?<eos> Er, traces of alcohol.<eos> Nothing else found in her bloodstream.<eos> That conflicts with the account we got from Meryl Fairchild.<eos> Aye, it does.
And if she didn't send them... .. well, who did?<eos> I take it you did go home last night?<eos> Mia was killed five weeks ago.<eos> So she didn't send those texts to Jason.<eos> No, she didn't.
- A poncho...<eos> - And some colourful socks!<eos> - Why? Hey, you didn't have any plans today, did you?<eos> No, no, I guess not.<eos> - Good, because we do.
Oh, well, thank you for coming.<eos> It was a nice distraction.<eos> Oh, Mrs. J.<eos> She has no idea who her daughter is.<eos> After two-plus hours in there, neither do we.
You should get back to the courtyard.<eos> Training's about to begin.<eos> Actually, I thought you could train me.<eos> I'm Regent now.<eos> I don't do that anymore.
That's crazy.<eos> Okay, okay, okay... Tonight Melanie's, then a secret rave maûana, followed by dancing at...<eos> It's my dad.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> Don't.
Michelle...<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I know what my dad does, Maxine.<eos> I don't need to be at some boring speech.<eos> This one you do.
That's not true.<eos> You don't feel that way.<eos> You can't feel that way!<eos> Twenty-three percent.<eos> I do, Kirsten.
How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
Well, you went a little off-book.<eos> I had a memory, I improvised.<eos> You mean "went rogue."<eos> - You could have gotten Jane killed.<eos> - He didn't.
I lied.<eos> When I told her I loved her. What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
I didn't listen.<eos> Because you were too close to the mole?<eos> How did you get over it?<eos> That feeling of... being betrayed.<eos> I... I didn't.
That's okay.<eos> They have a rule that if you have a party, you have to invite the whole class.<eos> It's too many kids.<eos> - The whole class?<eos> - So we do the whole class.
- Okay, great.<eos> - God, it's exciting, huh?<eos> - Yeah. My dad might finally catch a break.<eos> Why do you want him to admit to something he didn't do?<eos> I don't.
DNA? An eyewitness?<eos> We discovered Rutger Hiss had glass shards in his arm!<eos> And?<eos> That's it.<eos> Well, what the [bleep] do I do with that?
He was a senior officer.<eos> It's likely that the attackers tortured and questioned him.<eos> Or perhaps he discovered you had facilitated.<eos> The escape of the spies. And it was you who killed him?<eos> He didn't. And I didn't.
That he might be playing you, using your trust...<eos> I told you.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I don't anymore.
It's gonna get ugly.<eos> Especially without treatment.<eos> Even with treatment.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do.
- Drinks?<eos> I... Yeah, let's not... Let's have a welcome party.<eos> You know? We're all new. Let's get to know each other.<eos> Who wants to go to Malibu?<eos> - I do!
So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Well, uh...<eos> - I'll tell you what I did love:<eos> The two black girls.<eos> We want more of them.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
All right.<eos> Come back, play more Brubeck, then get the fuck out of here.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Got any blow?<eos> No. We don't.
Now you're gonna get me something to eat!<eos> "Just another patient"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Kristen doesn't scare you.<eos> She sure does.
David Haller.<eos> As I said...<eos> They have her.<eos> Division Three.<eos> They probably do.
She barfs every morning and says she didn't.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She cried when ET died.<eos> Well, who didn't?
Evening, garçon.<eos> What's on the menu tonight?<eos> This... this is truly undignified.<eos> Do you want to eat or not?<eos> Well, I do, yeah.
Eh, it's what's in the air.<eos> Larry, stop!<eos> As your attorney, I'm advising you not to answer anything.<eos> Heidi, you have no authority to subject him to this test!<eos> Actually, I do.
- Hurricane?<eos> - Buckle up, darling.<eos> It's gonna be a bumpy flight.<eos> You were right, Klaus.<eos> A baking soda bath did wonders for our hives.
I have a feeling there's lots of things they never told us about.<eos> Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.<eos> They were trying to keep you safe.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - No. No, it didn't.
Lost.<eos> Lonely.<eos> Angry.<eos> It never felt like me.<eos> But today, it does.
So, yes, I stole your diamonds, but that is nothing compared to what you've stolen from me.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I want you to disappear.<eos> I want every moment I wasted on you back.<eos> No, you don't.
So, if it bites you, do you...<eos> You're born a were, dimwit.<eos> Not exactly common knowledge.<eos> Weretigers are rare nowadays.<eos> - So the Rev did that?
She made her choice with Blaine, I probably drove her into his arms.<eos> Nazi!<eos> I left a lengthy apology on her voice-mail.<eos> How'd she respond?<eos> She didn't.
If he doesn't, he gets in trouble, and they don't... the hospital... they don't know where he is.<eos> You don't really believe he needs those pills, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
Malfunction detected.<eos> Ambient pressure increasing incrementally.<eos> No! Don't!<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
Your family will never know what you did.<eos> But everything you do.<eos> Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see,<eos> The people you don't.
Come on.<eos> Oxygen level... critical.<eos> Hey, Monty, Monty, Monty, no.<eos> Hey, hey, it's connected.<eos> What do I do?
Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but...
And there's no organs, there's nothing I can do, so just leave me the hell alone.<eos> I mean, this isn't you.<eos> You don't get wasted in bars and bail on your patients...<eos> I didn't bail on anyone!<eos> So, how we doing over here?
I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
I don't even know who that man is.<eos> How can you know what you have or have not done?<eos> I thought you couldn't remember anything.<eos> Unless, of course... you do remember.<eos> I don't!
Barton.<eos> Ugh! Barton's no good for this.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - I need to be here.<eos> No, you don't.
What kind of teacher are you?<eos> I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands. You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
I took that boy from his parents. And now I have to tell them.<eos> And I don't know how.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you stop feeling like this?<eos> You don't.
- Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it. No.<eos> I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.
Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it. No.<eos> I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.<eos> But I don't.
Maia Rindell?<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> And don't sit.<eos> Maia.<eos> How you doing?
And he wants us to do what?<eos> This is the malware from his computer.<eos> He wants us to offer the feds a deal.<eos> He will defuse the malware from the power grid if they offer him immunity.<eos> And if they don't?
Let-let me, uh, see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like.<eos> Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, rather than see it driven by its rightful owner, they want to bring it to the dump and flatten it.<eos> Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.<eos> It's half his. He doesn't want this child.<eos> But I do, Your Honor.
Okay. Who are you?<eos> Elsbeth Tascioni.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't like eating alone, do you?<eos> - I do, actually.
I will not!<eos> As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do.
As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do.<eos> - No, we don't!
Sorry.<eos> You forgot?<eos> Chloe Decker forgot?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What did you do with my roommate?
And cut.<eos> It's a little dark, buddy.<eos> - You know, just try to have fun with it.<eos> But I thought you told me this helped you work through difficult personal matters.<eos> I did.
Liz, what can I do?<eos> How can I help?<eos> You are helping.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
- I'll open up his vessels. It could save his life.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Okay, okay. Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs? Yes, ma'am. Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
Oh, my...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> You? Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
Now what do you want to do about it?<eos> Well, we can't have a murderer walking around.<eos> Right.<eos> We'll send her out into the mist.<eos> Now what do we do about Eve?
I don't get it.<eos> You said it needed to be fixed, so I called Cousin Mike in Jersey.<eos> Cousin Mike?<eos> How... how did he fix it so fast?<eos> Oh, he didn't.
Turns out our agency has a pedigree.<eos> Paul Jennings, Davy Crockett, Sacagawea.<eos> Every one of them is an American hero, and they all worked right here in this room together.<eos> I always thought Daniel Boone was the one who wore the fur cap.<eos> - Ah, technically, they both did.
Cute.<eos> Remind me, what do you do again?<eos> You know how it goes.<eos> Just kind of in between things.<eos> I don't... but good luck with your things.
Oh, it's like that, huh?<eos> That is fine.<eos> I didn't want it to come down like this, But you leave me no other choice.<eos> Now tell me! Who did it, benito?<eos> Who did it? Who did it?
ugh. Hope you have a plan.<eos> Yeah, i'll pop 'em in or something.<eos> For the hearing! Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, are you kidding me?<eos> Of course i do!
Anybody!<eos> Anybody! Help!<eos> Keep up!<eos> Get off my back! I didn't berate you when you barfed all over the sidewalk.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Anybody! Help!<eos> Keep up!<eos> Get off my back! I didn't berate you when you barfed all over the sidewalk.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
As long as it will lure it towards us.<eos> Look, I'll research the correct symbology to paint in gold leaf onto your version of the box.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, miss Jenny, you say you have a plan to procure enough gold to make weaponry.<eos> I do.
I-I don't know.<eos> Well, if we save Crane, then maybe it'll stop Dreyfuss.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But then what if Dreyfuss still goes after Molly?<eos> I don't...
I sent it away.<eos> You-You sent them away. How?<eos> I e-mailed law firms that specialize in suing the LAPD till I found a junior partner willing to draft a letter.<eos> Well, there's people that are trying to kill you, so if you'd like to stay alive, - it might behoove...<eos> - What if I don't?
You waiting around so that you can get caught?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> That looks like something you might hide something in.<eos> Yes, it does.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
More likely, you took a nasty blow on the battlefield.<eos> Perhaps you're suffering some minor brain damage or, at least, more brain damage.<eos> Snart did this!<eos> I believe you.<eos> - You do?
No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too.
And what about me?<eos> I've known you for a month and you've lied the whole time.<eos> He's my child's father.<eos> Well, I guess I know where your loyalties lie.<eos> Yes, you do.
But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
Thanks for coming.<eos> Listen, Gavin.<eos> I've thought about it, and if this is about you buying PiperChat...<eos> I didn't come here today to buy your company.<eos> You didn't?
Lord 0dda.<eos> You will set tongues wagging, drinking with the peasants.<eos> Let them wag if it please them.<eos> You asked me some days ago if I agree with the payment of a ransom.<eos> I do not.
Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
Well, I'll have you know street quality is far superior to what the U.S. government use, and when it comes to common criminals, I may know one or three.<eos> Why don't you two go and get Owen's IDs while we work on finding him?<eos> How?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes...<eos> Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't. They do.
Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
Oh, yeah, I read that one.<eos> Apparently, memories around big events seem clearer, but the periphery disappears.<eos> You remember the feeling, not the details. - No.<eos> I remember it exactly.<eos> - He doesn't.
Yeah, but then he seemed okay.<eos> Oh, shoot, can I have a tampon?<eos> I forgot to go to the store.<eos> - Sorry, I don't have my period.<eos> - You don't?
But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow.<eos> All crows talk. They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
I didn't need to find her.<eos> I just needed to make sure no one else can.<eos> This doesn't excuse what you've done.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I want to see where this is going.<eos> - Ms. Flatch, you truly are delightful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And you have some wonderful things to say about Mr. Henderson.<eos> I do.
You know what I want.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> - Owe you one.<eos> - Get what you wanted?<eos> We both did.
You're never gonna have to worry about him hurting you again.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> And thank you for letting me stay here today.<eos> You have a really nice family.<eos> I do.
That was six months ago.<eos> Everyone came home.<eos> Except for Eddie.<eos> And you never heard from him?<eos> No, I did.
Now I play in my company's intramural league.<eos> She won't let me go to the games.<eos> He gets too excited.<eos> - Well, it's exciting.<eos> - You do!
You'd be surprised how many people feel that way.<eos> This might help you understand them a little bit.<eos> Marx?<eos> I thought he hated religion.<eos> Uh, h-he did.
Cannonball accidents almost never happen in New York.<eos> ...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo! Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
I do, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Davis... is the chief benefactor of the East Peck Historical Society, who fire the commemorative cannonballs.<eos> Shortly after I approached him with incriminating information, a cannonball flew through my window.<eos> That doesn't just happen.<eos> Actually, it does.
What the hell do you want?<eos> You know, it's weird...<eos> You hit a bad shot, but you didn't throw that club away.<eos> Why should I throw away a perfectly good golf club?<eos> You did yesterday.
He would want revenge. Hey.<eos> Hi, Henry.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-Sure. Everything okay? S-So... you know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
I admire you.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You're fighting so things like that won't happen to other people.<eos> I wish I could tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
I know a lot about you, Emma.<eos> You faked your own death, and hid in the past.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No, you don't.
We get her back first, of course.<eos> But Bruhl's right.<eos> These machines are too dangerous... nobody should have them in the first place.<eos> You think Mason or my bosses are just gonna smile and say, "Sure, let's torch it"?<eos> No, we do it ourselves.
You wanted the patent.<eos> If I had just given it to you, you would've walked out that door and never looked back.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> I'm done.<eos> Done? No.
No, he just wants you to make the demo better so he can take as much money off the table as he can.<eos> He'll walk away rich, the company will crater, and you will go down with it, and that would be the end of Pied Piper.<eos> Richard, you have to tell Keenan that you're not gonna take this deal.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What do I do?
The tribal police has him on security footage at late night bingo.<eos> Also... Dr. Allan says the tooth was Jesse's.<eos> Shit.<eos> Remember those riddles that I got when I was young?<eos> Of course I do.
Hey, why not?<eos> You, you already have those skills.<eos> I got those skills like I built Daisy a shitty Dollhouse.<eos> It was a prefect Dollhouse and I can tell you want to do it.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.
And Patton, too.<eos> He may be struggling, but he's still at OTB, still game.<eos> Look, if you want to blame yourself for anything, do it for surrounding yourself with people who are just as stubborn and bullheaded as you.<eos> Besides, you're not the only one who wants to make Garcia pay;<eos> we all do.
I came to tell you that Noah raised the plane without the Road Demons' help, but they still want a new price.<eos> If they don't get it, they'll take their business somewhere else and Eli Voss loses his biggest customer.<eos> Saying yes makes Voss look weaker, which is even more dangerous.<eos> Noah has no idea how to deal with men like Mr. Crowbar.<eos> - And you do?
He will make an example of my husband, and then my family.<eos> Then he will go after the ones who made the offer, your husband and your family.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> I thought you were pacifists.<eos> So what do we do now?
Nee, I'll work on it.<eos> If not, someone will have to call Onkel<eos> - and explain the delay. - I said, I'll work on it.<eos> - Besides, no one calls Onkel.<eos> - Someone does.
Not his, yours!<eos> So if you can still find your own badge, I want it on my desk.<eos> He said the lives of your children are hanging by a thread?<eos> Jo,but he doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, he does, Brooda.
You're not old enough, I'm afraid.<eos> Then why not Dad?<eos> You two should work together more often.<eos> Because as you well know, your father no longer works for the Firm.<eos> And she does?
Don't answer that question.<eos> It's not just about sex.<eos> So you mean you have a deep, spiritual connection to a murderer?<eos> You don't know her, okay?<eos> And you do?
Yeah, so that I could see how much better she is than me.<eos> First of all, she's not.<eos> And second of all, yes, exactly.<eos> He wants to know you still care.<eos> Well, I don't.
Wow... it's got a seatbelt, this goes here and this one here...<eos> Double up.<eos> I got shoes for you, and you got me this.<eos> You didn't like it'?<eos> Of course I did...
You got something for me, cop?<eos> Over there!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> I thought you said he went this way.<eos> He did.
What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.
I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.<eos> I do what?
Chat for an hour?<eos> I like apple pie, but not that much.<eos> Mr. Bennett. Good to see you.<eos> Hi, Heather.<eos> How you doing?
My sons do it every year on my birthday.<eos> Look, Clint, I appreciate you payin' me back.<eos> And honestly, I'm surprised you remember I wanted to travel.<eos> - But if you think this makes up for...<eos> - I don't.
- All right.<eos> All right, I'm done.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Well... does the break room have a lock on the door?<eos> It does.
Hot damn, you serious?<eos> I got a good feeling about this one, okay?<eos> Oh, baby, you always do.<eos> I got a good feeling about this one.<eos> You always do.
But now that they know we're not leaving...<eos> So you won over their hearts?<eos> That's what you're saying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I did.
You're a producer.<eos> Everybody that works in television is a producer.<eos> You knew they were gonna portray me like that.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - You did.
I can see you.<eos> You know, whoever's out there, I've got a call button, and I'm not afraid to use it.<eos> I thought you were all laid up.<eos> I'm sore, but I'm fine.<eos> How you doing?
Sorry.<eos> We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field. Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
Come work with us.<eos> Let's do this together.<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> I'll roll through red tape, whatever you need from me, but, damn it, my daughter deserves a future.<eos> They all do.
I need to take Anne Shirley home.<eos> She was adopted.<eos> She's no longer in residence.<eos> But she... she came back here yesterday, did she not?<eos> - She did not.
And I shall do my utmost to prove myself worthy of your friendship.<eos> Uh, Anne loves to read. And she knows ever so many big words.<eos> Does she use them all in every sentence?<eos> I like to read, too.<eos> No, you don't.
Uh, Anne loves to read. And she knows ever so many big words.<eos> Does she use them all in every sentence?<eos> I like to read, too.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't.
You loved Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> You love Judith.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you love me, Father?<eos> Do you?
You are a fool and a liar.<eos> You must be keen to return to the eager arms of the Madame de Montespan.<eos> No doubt, she will offer you respite from your sleepless nightmares.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
No.<eos> - Do you think That I wanted him to die?<eos> No.<eos> - He's got a knife, and he Could've gone for us at any second.<eos> - But he didn't.
Has reconciled the world to himself And sent the holy spirit among us. For the forgiveness of sins.<eos> Through the ministry of the church, May god give you pardon and peace.<eos> I'm sorry, dawn, but...<eos> He didn't Pose a threat.<eos> He just didn't.
Sir? On the night of the incident, you Didn't sign out your cs spray.<eos> What?<eos> Well, it's a simple mistake, I know.<eos> I did. I'm... I'm sure I did.<eos> Well... You didn't.
What did I tell you?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You're just dumb, you know that?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
- What are we...<eos> - Just stop. It's what they do.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> You guys don't understand.<eos> Angelo doesn't do time.
Well, thank you, Claire.<eos> But I'm well.<eos> Maigret said there was hardly anyone at Claude's funeral.<eos> - Well, I know the wives shouldn't get involved --<eos> - Then don't.
What makes you so confident?<eos> Because I believed him when he said he didn't know Isaac Goldberg.<eos> Was that his name?<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I knew him?<eos> Did you?
My parents died when I was three.<eos> I got passed around foster care, drugs...<eos> Yeah, I read all that in the file, Reeves.<eos> I don't need you to worry about me.<eos> I don't... but Bishop does.
I-I don't have any idea what he's talking about, Murph.<eos> Guy's crazy.<eos> Hey, that's Havana.<eos> Since when do you like Cuban music?<eos> I don't. But you do.
But since you have me here, what kind of car are you driving?<eos> Because we have some incredible lease programs right now.<eos> Okay, the only thing I want to hear out of you right now is your alibi for last night, assuming you have one.<eos> You got one of those?<eos> I do.
OK, what was the point?<eos> What was the effect?<eos> They told us the world was ending in a potential war zone - what did we assume was going to happen?<eos> World War Three.<eos> But it didn't.
Finish Julliard.<eos> Go on a big world tour, meet all these new people.<eos> I thought you wanted me to stay.<eos> Then it's Julliard.<eos> No, I do.
Yeah, but Alex did a great job of updating the song.<eos> And thank you, Cott, for making us look hot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got style.<eos> You do.
And thank you, Cott, for making us look hot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got style.<eos> You do.<eos> Mm-hmm. You do.
There's something wrong with my sister.<eos> There's something wrong with both of you.<eos> I'm sorry, Simone.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Yeah, he and me had a pretty interesting conversation.<eos> Started talking about Hunter.<eos> It was funny... something... something about P.E.Ds?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- I was just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> You asked for my help!<eos> You did!
Huh. Crazies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nah, you always got my back with the girls, so I got you.<eos> Look, I didn't know you worked this shift, at the club.<eos> I don't.
That I've put you through.<eos> Do you know how it feels every time I think about what these men do to you?<eos> It breaks my heart.<eos> You know how I feel to do it?<eos> Do you?
I put it in your name.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I do. I do.
I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I...<eos> That I love you, too?<eos> I do.
Hey, sexy.<eos> How long you been over there?<eos> I'm scared about this baby, Derek.<eos> I know you said that... you'll do whatever I want, but... I don't know what I want.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Ladies, where's your manager?<eos> The Atlanta NextFest and Honda people are waiting outside.<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> Yo, we ain't got a manager.<eos> No, we don't.
What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Nearly 65,000 viewers!<eos> This is about to get fun.<eos> I'm already having a blast.<eos> You wanna know where zombies come from?<eos> I do.
Even if you found the person who assaulted your son, that's all we can charge him with... assault, not murder.<eos> Well, he could go to jail for years.<eos> If he's got priors, it could be decades.<eos> You don't know what will happen when you find him.<eos> Nobody does.
I'm really, really rich, I have a team of lawyers that will keep you tied up in court for years.<eos> So when you get discharged, just pack up your stuff and leave, like you did when I was born, 'cause I don't wanna see you.<eos> I don't wanna talk to you. I don't want to hear from you, ever.<eos> - Wanna know why I never wrote you back?<eos> - I do, I really, really do.
No, not him.<eos> Him!<eos> Ooh... nice!<eos> Gabi, I don't want to marry you.<eos> - You don't?
Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
I was under your thrall.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> True.<eos> But part of you wanted to help me, though, didn't it?<eos> Part of you always does.
You received your MBA from Columbia, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Do you remember the subject of your master's thesis?<eos> Well, it was 30 years ago.<eos> No, I don't.
Me?<eos> Annaleigh?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> We need him.<eos> We all do.
What did you do?<eos> Ethan.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just that if Ben said something or did something...<eos> He didn't.
Um, we have to process your home for evidence tonight.<eos> Do you have someplace to stay?<eos> Mr. Kettering, do you have someplace to sleep tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
!<eos> Tell you what?<eos> Chen.<eos> How long have you known that Chen was working with the CIA?<eos> He didn't.
You want some coke?<eos> - You remember Callie and...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - ...her brother Christian.<eos> - Yeah, no, I don't.
Yeah?<eos> - Right? Is that what he told you?<eos> Craig doesn't plan jobs, okay?<eos> He's muscle.<eos> Well, he does now.
Do you?<eos> That's the point, isn't it?<eos> You're all adults now, and I have to learn to let go.<eos> But I want something.<eos> - Of course you do.
We both know you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.
If the nazis get their hands. On that much oil, the war's over.<eos> How did the americans respond?<eos> Butler wants our intel.<eos> On marigold asap.<eos> Course he does.
That wouldn't be too good for you.<eos> I don't get it. Everybody knows you're a fed.<eos> Yeah, but here's the difference.<eos> You say you didn't kill that doctor.<eos> I didn't. Ok.
But I would... I would listen to my lawyer, who is telling you that nothing good will come out of confronting Rutger.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To... get some fresh air.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
Probably the murder.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm starting to get you.<eos> Oh, not many people do.
I haven't been back to Krownest since before my time at the Imperial Academy, Ezra.<eos> And I didn't exactly leave on good terms.<eos> Well, maybe things have changed. They might be happy to see you.<eos> (CHUCKLES) You don't know my family.<eos> FENN: I do.
I happen to know some very reliable people in town.<eos> Total pros, proper villains.<eos> Yes, but proper isn't the same as fun, is it?<eos> You know how I like fun.<eos> I do, darling.
Look, if there was a virus in Sabatino's e-mail, none of us were looking for it.<eos> Man, I knew something was off about this guy.<eos> I knew it. I thought he helped save you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did he?
Serious.<eos> Well, it's got to be connected to LIN28A.<eos> Did Krystal just fall arse backwards into something big again?<eos> I do not know how the girl does it.<eos> Seriously, you don't?
- You got a minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Just wanted you to know how much I appreciate this.<eos> Your father always said you were a good kid.<eos> He did?
Surprise, surprise.<eos> It's a brazen act of aggression.<eos> Well, it's a crime of opportunity.<eos> Petrov thinks the US government has their eye off the ball.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called. They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
Reach out to the people who don't like us. They'll be prime to go with it.<eos> Okay, so when we respond...<eos> -On the record or...<eos> -On.<eos> What did she do?
It's nothing.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -What?<eos> You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?<eos> No, I don't.
We had a deal. We will let you know if you are needed.<eos> - Sir... - That was not a request.<eos> Why did you have to go talk to him?<eos> There has to be a way out, Francis.<eos> Does there?
She said she wanted to be invisible.<eos> I knew it wasn't possible.<eos> I knew that she would only ever go away... if I made sure of it.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oversight, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.<eos> It would have gone on and on.<eos> - Years and years of investigation. - I don't care.<eos> You should have talked to me, instead of making a last-minute decision like this.<eos> I didn't.
The SUV passed a number of cameras while it fled the scene.<eos> Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras, pedestrians' personal cameras...<eos> If we can access that feed, we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.<eos> We don't have the resources to consolidate footage from dozens of sources to find a single target.<eos> The NSA does.
I see.<eos> When did you last hear from him?<eos> He wrote a letter, he said he was coming to visit, bringing some good news.<eos> Due to arrive on the Chatham train three days ago.<eos> - Of course, he never did.
Why do women do anything?<eos> I can't read their bird brains.<eos> Oh, that's why.<eos> When she left, did you try and win her back?<eos> - You did, didn't you?
I was young, I hated Adam, I wanted him out of my life.<eos> So you hired Mr. Moses to kidnap and kill your own stepbrother.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, and I thought he had.<eos> I did.
Hey. Hey, boys.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out, I was being offensive.<eos> So, normal. Yeah--<eos> Sheldon, what did you do?
We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
You're not here to socialize, so just get 'em in, get 'em out.<eos> Are you asking me not to talk to people?<eos> 'Cause that is what I do.<eos> And Phil don't seem to have a problem with it.<eos> No, but I do.
Nobody keeps me on edge for 500 pages then decides they're just done writing.<eos> Either end the damn story or don't even write it!<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> God, for a minute, I thought I missed something.<eos> You did.
Jordan... I... got so caught up trying to run away from my... old life that I didn't fully think it through.<eos> Susan... No, just-just listen, okay?<eos> I... I hurt you.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
No.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay?<eos> Yeah. Slow, slow...<eos> Okay.<eos> - You don't need that. - Yeah.<eos> No, I do, I do, yes.
But the only person I'm having sex with is Gabi.<eos> Exactly. She's the only employee in this house involved in your itch.<eos> Hold up, wait a second, Elliot.<eos> Josh, Gabi didn't give you an STD.<eos> Yes, she did.
Wrap your head around that for a minute, that the universe... or God... wanted the one person that I love most in this world... to be dead.<eos> Maybe the universe is saying there's something else you have to do first.<eos> Maybe you're not meant to be here.<eos> Maybe you're meant to be helping your friends.<eos> How do I do that now?
You heard me.<eos> Why?<eos> Personal experience has taught me military secrets should stay secret.<eos> With all due respect, just because you served in Vietnam doesn't give you a monopoly on national security protocol.<eos> In my office, it does.
Could've done that at the house.<eos> There's also something I thought you should know about Trevor.<eos> If it's something I'd rather not hear...<eos> The Navy didn't tell you the truth about Omega.<eos> Trevor didn't either.
I buy the blackmail, but I'm not sure Baracus is a serial killer.<eos> He is definitely mixed up in this.<eos> - And I just voted for him.<eos> - So did I.<eos> All right, we did it!
- What? I said I didn't get you anything.<eos> It's okay, it's Christmas.<eos> I'm just feeling, um... suffocated.<eos> What with the gifts and the letters, and you saying you missed me.<eos> - I did...
I want to stop that, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I can't be the guy waiting around for letters or writing words that I don't mean.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I don't.
We both know how clever she is.<eos> She'll be able to get past the waiver.<eos> Not worried about Liberty.<eos> Well, then, why would she need our help?<eos> She doesn't.
So we start there.<eos> - Follow the money.<eos> - Adele needs you.<eos> You're a quick study. You're a survivor.<eos> We do this as a family.
Officer Kalakaua, can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you believe that there's a thin line between love and hate?<eos> Because the way that you were laying into me back there, that was so over the top,<eos> I was like, Wow, maybe she likes me.<eos> I don't.
Plus, I want to rub it in her face - that we've been hanging out.<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> I won't mention you said that word a bunch of times.<eos> Hey, Mickey. Did you know that the national bird of Guatemala is the Quetzal?<eos> 'Cause I do.
You're one to talk.<eos> What?<eos> Kai didn't come to bed last night, okay?<eos> I know you didn't break up with him.<eos> Yeah, I did, last night in the sauna.
We got to find him.<eos> Uh, does this bus go to River Sun Casino?<eos> Do you have the fare?<eos> I have these.<eos> It does now.
Uh, yeah, but I did.<eos> I did win, you know, so maybe the lesson is there is no lesson.<eos> It's just life. You know?<eos> Just sort of happens.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I've been taught better than that.<eos> This man... - hit you. Whoa!<eos> - Aah. - He hit you with a car.<eos> - I know, and he felt so bad.<eos> - He did it twice.
This man... - hit you. Whoa!<eos> - Aah. - He hit you with a car.<eos> - I know, and he felt so bad.<eos> - He did it twice.<eos> - He did, didn't he?
Well, that is the obvious first step.<eos> And I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, but it-it doesn't hurt to check.<eos> Am I right, Ben?<eos> Oh, Ben! A huge monster!<eos> What do I do?
You are?<eos> I don't want the memory of today physically attached to my body.<eos> I'll hold off for now.<eos> So my plan worked.<eos> It did not.
And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name. Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
- Restocking already?<eos> - They say liquor sells itself.<eos> Bet the sight of you pouring' it don't hurt either.<eos> How does our latest cocktail progress?<eos> - It doesn't.
It was mimicry, not sympathy.<eos> It was a good tactic, bringing in Diana.<eos> What?<eos> Nobody said anything about Diana's bewitching effect on you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
Cool it, Stevie, they're just doing their jobs.<eos> We did good by Jerry's kid.<eos> He trusted us.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Of course he does.
Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
Amelia?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your husband's gonna be very happy to see you.<eos> No, Pride did not toss him overboard.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.
I need to prove that I can do something on my own.<eos> You know?<eos> Callie, look. I know I'm not your parent. All right, but I want to help.<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - Well, we do.
Be fearless.<eos> Must be nice to have somewhere to let go.<eos> You don't need permission.<eos> I just... I with I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
- Everything here is great.<eos> - Kind of expensive.<eos> Oh, I'm paying. Don't worry.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Look at that.<eos> You got a lot of detail in there.<eos> Look how cute you made me.<eos> You know I'm always gonna take care of you, right?<eos> You always do, Sis.
I mean, I thought that I was ready for her.<eos> And then there she was, and I just...<eos> Alicia, it'll get better. You know, it's gonna take time, but it'll get better.<eos> Yeah, 'cause time heals all ills, right?<eos> Except it doesn't really.
No, I-I just think there are certain possibilities that we have to consider.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like that this woman, Alicia, just snapped. Okay?<eos> She lost her daughter... You think you ever get over something like that?<eos> You don't.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?<eos> How does this fit in to their endgame?<eos> Could just be a terrorist attack.<eos> - And we don't know it was them.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Are you feeling dizzy?<eos> Any nausea?<eos> Only when I drink tequila.<eos> I'm trying to establish whether or not you have a concussion.<eos> I don't.
See over there?<eos> Only Kona has that kind of detail on the label.<eos> Well, clearly, I am in the presence of a craft beer savant. Hey, yo.<eos> We got something?<eos> Oh, we sure do.
Uh, yikes. $37,000 annually.<eos> That's not taking into consideration books, cost of living, ramen, beer kegs, bean bag chairs, et cetera.<eos> Joey Fletcher's family didn't have anywhere near that kind of money.<eos> How did he pay for it?<eos> He didn't.
Already on it.<eos> Plan trade data coming in.<eos> Alex, I've put us on closed comms.<eos> I got an answer from Keyes about the recruit Leon mentioned who died in the car crash.<eos> They didn't.
They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry... I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Do I have permission to fire?<eos> You think you got the balls?<eos> Go ahead, pull the trigger!<eos> Shoot me!<eos> No, but I do.
He was with me that night.<eos> Bryce, he only got the gun because he was afraid of being robbed.<eos> Shut up, all right?<eos> He had Roller's passcodes.<eos> Everybody did.
Virginia was asking about you!<eos> Virginia was...?<eos> No!<eos> You're lying!<eos> No, she didn't!
Don't touch...<eos> Let's go, Des.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Why does evil always win?<eos> Dean, it doesn't, okay?
Dean, don't tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...
Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you...
Take care of it.<eos> Done.<eos> Hey, y'all.<eos> Morning, babe.<eos> How you doing?
Gonna take a wild guess here and say Darren was stealing valuables from his drywall jobs.<eos> Probably fencing them, too, which is why he could afford a second home.<eos> You sure nothing's missing?<eos> I was telling the truth, I honestly don't know.<eos> I do.
You lent it to Joshua Chris when you were courting him to sign with you.<eos> Oh. Where did you get that cock-and-bull story from?<eos> Joshua Chris.<eos> He might've been willing to keep your secret back then, but I got the sense from the call with him that things did not end well between you.<eos> They didn't.
It's disrespectful, and, frankly, it's time for him to go.<eos> So what are you saying? You want me to take care of him for you?<eos> (chuckles) It has to be me.<eos> You, you're gonna help me get the cash and deliver it. And then I'm gonna kill him.<eos> You do that,
If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
No one's heard a thing since.<eos> Rumor is she's gone straight, but also, just plain gone.<eos> No one disappears without a trace.<eos> Someone knows something.<eos> Someone always does.
Last earthly possessions of Milton Barker.<eos> Or at least the last earthly possessions that weren't stolen by Travis Unger.<eos> Says here Mr. Barker was an insurance adjustor, died of a stroke, age 86, no known heirs.<eos> So, how do you open this?<eos> I don't.
Where are you going?<eos> The respite I mentioned last night?<eos> It's over.<eos> You know I don't like it when you do this.<eos> Nobody does.
Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sure you do.
What are you doing, Leo?<eos> _<eos> You think I don't know who you are, hmm?<eos> You think you took him from me?<eos> You didn't. You didn't.
Agreed.<eos> I should have told you about Leo.<eos> She's still in love with you.<eos> Well, that don't excuse what she did.<eos> No, it doesn't.
He said take a metric ton or nothing.<eos> I understand it put us in danger.<eos> So why'd you do it?<eos> Because now you have a choice.<eos> With nothing, you don't.
No.<eos> We are way past that.<eos> I'm really sorry, Anna.<eos> You know, none of this was supposed to happen.<eos> But it did.
Kill him.<eos> When does it stop?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Do you honestly not remember any of this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is where you married your true love yesterday.<eos> My true love?<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.
It's sapping the magic from everything here.<eos> Well, can't you fix it? Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I'm... I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
I never set out to hurt anyone.<eos> And then I got in too deep before I could make the investors whole again.<eos> I'm just so embarrassed for you to see me like this.<eos> I deserve to be in jail for what I did.<eos> But not for what you didn't.
You know, first, Rooster doesn't want to be part of this ranch.<eos> Now he doesn't want to be part of this family.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> He'll come back.<eos> Colt did.
Or you learn to live with them.<eos> Listen... You want to be a good leader?<eos> Let your soldiers believe in their success.<eos> - And when they find out the truth?<eos> - Maybe they never do.
I'm sorry.<eos> That's probably why I wasn't asked.<eos> The Roster, it's very tech-centered, and, well, you're famous for...<eos> Hating the Internet.<eos> I do.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> Carol, that's everyone.<eos> Did you say Gail?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Your parents...<eos> - You don't know anything about me!<eos> You're right, Chelsea.<eos> I don't.<eos> But she does.
Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
I went and had drinks with Bert about a month ago, and, you know, he let it slip.<eos> A month ago?<eos> And you've just been sitting on this?<eos> Well, I kinda thought it was more up to Bert to tell you, and I advised him to do exactly that.<eos> Yeah, well, he didn't.
That itch and burn was so fierce!<eos> 'Cause you ain't right!<eos> I tried to get my own phone back there to take a picture.<eos> Don't act like you don't like it.<eos> No, I did not.
This would make a perfect look for a bachelorette party.<eos> Yes!<eos> Bridesmaids, take note!<eos> Um, where did you get these done?<eos> Actually, I did them myself.
This was done by Uncle Daddy's corrupt popo.<eos> Pol, this was done by Bryce.<eos> Because Uncle Daddy forced him to do it.<eos> Listen, you guys, we didn't know any of this was gonna happen, okay?<eos> But it did.
What?<eos> It was on the news this morning.<eos> They were part of a drug ring, yeah.<eos> They got what they deserved.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Previously on "Claws"...<eos> We set the Coombses up to be killed.<eos> No, we set them up to go to jail.<eos> Listen, You guys, we didn't know any of this was gonna happen, okay?<eos> But it did.
We all thought you died.<eos> We did. W... Everybody was so upset.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I don't remember nothin'.<eos> You don't?
Well, now you do.<eos> I was just trying to see what Roller was up to.<eos> He said it was your people that tried to kill him.<eos> He say we try to assassinate him?<eos> He did. He sure did.
And my sister doesn't need one since she didn't do anything.<eos> She hasn't even been charged.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Your boss does.
She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
Good job.<eos> What? I plugged a thing into a thing.<eos> I don't mean that specifically. In general, good job.<eos> You didn't have to, um...<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
He can still give orders from behind bars.<eos> That's why we're moving Makino tomorrow to the secure ward at King's.<eos> It's funny.<eos> The head of the Ochoa cartel was so paranoid to think someone who's been asleep for seven years is gonna bring him down.<eos> But in a way, he did.
I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's working.<eos> The decoy just rerouted.<eos> It's working!<eos> Weller, we did it.
- How did he seem?<eos> - Good.<eos> Happy.<eos> He was talking about which dorm he wanted at New Haven, right? Did he say where he was going after dinner?<eos> He didn't.
He brainwashed and recruited these kids.<eos> He orchestrated these robberies.<eos> We've been through this, Sergeant.<eos> - You don't have anything on...<eos> - Yes, we do.
'Cause I promise you... the second you put her in jeopardy,<eos> I tried to be a good mother to her.<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> You don't.
Pencils down.<eos> Pencils down!<eos> Um, what does it take to pass?<eos> 75.<eos> And if we don't?
Excuse me.<eos> Please explain the course of treatment.<eos> Mr. Halstead, I'm Sharon Goodwin, executive director of patient and medical services.<eos> I thought I should say hello.<eos> Well, how you doing?
Why didn't you tell us your security chief,<eos> Lazlo Simms, had a mile-long record, which, apparently, you paid to have expunged?<eos> We all have things in our past we wish we could wash away.<eos> Laz is the only person in the world I completely trust.<eos> He didn't do this.
We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
Karissa, I can't raise Liam or Nelson on the phone.<eos> Tracking them.<eos> Their signals are... dead.<eos> When did they check in at the offsite facility?<eos> They didn't.
Carol, do you still want me to deliver this baby?<eos> Of course. But how am I gonna tell him?<eos> You just do it.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Yeah, just do it.
Jasper, you ready, child?<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> "Carol Andrew Pilbasian Miller," loving wife, devoted friend, died in childbirth "after a torturous, protracted, bloody labor."<eos> Yeah. You're not writing a damn obituary.<eos> No, newspapers do it in advance all the time.
The Russians could do anything with that intelligence.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't. Okay? You don't.
A think tank?<eos> It's none of your concern.<eos> "It's none of your concern, sir."<eos> You don't have to respect me, but at least respect the office.<eos> I do.
What is the point of all this?<eos> !<eos> Why am I being kept in here...<eos> - Henry...<eos> - like I did something wrong?
Why?<eos> Now's a time for us to pull together.<eos> You can come back at the start of next week's roster.<eos> That's if you want to come back.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Vera?<eos> - She let Smith out to get to me.<eos> I'm lifting your suspension.<eos> - That's if you want to come back.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What the fuck? !<eos> Oh, you think this is funny do you?<eos> Not to mention, getting Novak to do your dirty work.<eos> What if someone else had caught you with my card? ! I would lose my job!<eos> Yeah, but they didn't, did they?
Well, this new guy, he's the one the department would ask to examine me if you try to mess with my pension.<eos> Turns out I'm not the first ex-cop that he's seen with my... condition.<eos> You mean you're not the first cop who was willing to pay him more.<eos> Whatever you thought you had on me, made you think you could push me around?<eos> You don't.
You mean you're not the first cop who was willing to pay him more.<eos> Whatever you thought you had on me, made you think you could push me around?<eos> You don't.<eos> You really got my name from Quinn Malcolm?<eos> We really did.
You know exactly who it is.<eos> You told Proctor.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I can't remember.<eos> - Yes you do.
I got permission to access the net to prove that chick provoked you.<eos> You got influence.<eos> This guy.<eos> - How do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Mike is dead because of you.<eos> - I didn't kill Mike!<eos> - No.<eos> Mike?<eos> I did!
Hate to be the one to break it to you though, Vera, but you and, um, your Jakey? Nothing about it is real.<eos> It's fiction.<eos> Everything Jake has said, everything he's done, it was all at my instruction.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
To do something I should've done a long time ago.<eos> Once Kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.<eos> Cooper tried to shut it down.<eos> Harold has to work within the system.<eos> Henry Prescott does not.
Look, I did the best I could.<eos> I don't know how long he's gonna last.<eos> I hear, like, these little gurgling noises<eos> - when he breathes.<eos> - You did fine, JayJay.
I already had enough capital in professional respect.<eos> I could have lost something.<eos> "Oh, let's not hire that transvestite."<eos> It could have happened.<eos> But it didn't.
Good day, sir.<eos> Of course I don't have it yet.<eos> So I could probably get shot and I would be OK.<eos> Unless... if you die in your dream, do you die in real life?<eos> What do I do?
Yes, I am!<eos> No, you're not!<eos> Whaaaaa?<eos> Ashi, you have Aku's powers.<eos> I do!
- No one.<eos> There was no signal.<eos> - So, why was your house firebombed?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - Well, I do.
- Maybe.<eos> All right, it's bedtime.<eos> Liam, bedtime.<eos> - I need to finish this level.<eos> - No, you don't.
I just did what he said.<eos> - Who else was involved?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you know who asked Eddie to provide the players with that supplement?<eos> No, I don't.
I don't know.<eos> Well, given the number of times you've called each other, we find that unbelievable.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Inside Darren's house is fully covered now.<eos> Cars, phones, plus his in-laws, family, all their phones too.<eos> All ready for take-off.<eos> - ...did I authorise this?<eos> - She did.
! Apologies for barging into your fiefdom, Mr Examiner, but you'll have to stand that witness down.<eos> What?<eos> And this hearing needs to stop immediately.<eos> The state DPP has no jurisdiction over the National Crime Commission.<eos> But we do.
I've been here three years and I'm never leaving.<eos> So don't tell me I've stopped trying.<eos> I just meant...<eos> No, that you're an American who has choices.<eos> These people don't, and neither do I.
Please don't quote program to me.<eos> Maybe you need to have the program quoted to you.<eos> Look, if you don't wanna do the surgery because it cuts too close to home, then fine.<eos> But you have to at least talk to him.<eos> - No, I don't.
Hey.<eos> Am I the biggest cliché ever?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> Of course you do.
Take him for a ride.<eos> So... tell me what you do to piss somebody off so bad<eos> - that they're still after you.<eos> - Could be the Pinkertons, could be Silver Cowboys Gang, could be Dave!<eos> - So what did you do?
- Nah, it's superficial.<eos> - You had no plan out there, huh?<eos> - Oh, I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why? Did you?
- Thanks for lunch.<eos> You gonna eat those pickles?<eos> What?<eos> - You don't like 'em.<eos> - Well, I do now.
Oh. Again?<eos> What kind of dream was it?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I don't remember my dreams.<eos> - You don't?
Okay.<eos> Well, you don't have to say that.<eos> - I know my mother.<eos> - Really?<eos> Do you?
I know what I feel coming off of you, Scott.<eos> It's hunger.<eos> And there are a lot of healthy and fun ways to satisfy it... if you're interested.<eos> Do you have an extra key?<eos> I do.
The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
You're fired.<eos> Please, I-I really was going to do it. I...<eos> I believe you.<eos> But my rule is three strikes and you're out. Otherwise, where does it end?<eos> In that case, why not do this publicly?
Oh, yes, and God bless Phoebe.<eos> Amen. She's gonna be back home before you know it.<eos> I don't want Mama to come back.<eos> Oh, you don't mean that.<eos> You do too.
What? You were right.<eos> You were right to push him. You've been great with him lately.<eos> He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him.<eos> You know, I knew about Julia.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
- Mason, I can... there's a way out back I know...<eos> - Yeah, I'd like that. - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Got a boner the size of the Palace of the Parliament!<eos> The Palace of the Parliament!<eos> Ha-ha! So, Orzan tells me you have something for me.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - We do...
Detective Ionescu.<eos> It's happening today, 3:00 p.m.<eos> West Side Apartments.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh. Don't have to thank me.<eos> I got loaned to you.<eos> No, I do. I do.
That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I want him to go to a school.<eos> I don't want him to drop his eyes every time a white man walk by.<eos> I don't want him to be a "boy" no more once he turn into a man.<eos> Don't you want that, too?<eos> Of course I do.
We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up North, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up North.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, Your Honor.
Get back.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I believe you.<eos> You do?
Oh.<eos> - Yes. - Why?<eos> Really?<eos> I... Do you not want me to?<eos> I do!
I can totally handle all of this by myself.<eos> I'm an independent woman.<eos> My God, seriously?<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
Hey, I'm glad you called.<eos> I'm sorry about lunch today.<eos> I'm an idiot, babe.<eos> I don't even know what's going on with me right now.<eos> - I really don't.
No way!<eos> It's a glitter bomb!<eos> Looks like you still have it.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> Well, we do.
Okay.<eos> Look, I know you think I've been doing a bang-up job all these years, but that ain't exactly true.<eos> I let you put yourself in harm's way.<eos> I... I pushed you to it.<eos> No, you didn't.
You can if you win.<eos> - Did you? - No!<eos> But I got this.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I did.
You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again. Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?
I'm not gonna ask you again. Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?
She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?<eos> He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.<eos> Self-sacrifice, that's noble.<eos> - Only if he stands a chance.<eos> - Maybe he does.
- I told you, do not sing.<eos> - You need to sing!<eos> - I am sorry. I can not.<eos> - Yes you can, but do not want.<eos> - Well, I do not.
Shut the fuck door!<eos> I gotta tell you, I was always like,<eos> "Tracey, this doesn't make any sense,"<eos> and she was like, "Words, words, words and some numbers."<eos> But she did it.
I'm telling you.<eos> Do something about Gabe.<eos> Mike... You see what you made me do, man? You see what you've made me do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mike, Mike, Mike. Please, don't.
Take care.<eos> You too.<eos> Ryan, look who's here!<eos> / Hey, Dad.<eos> Rhino, how you doing, buddy?
I like you, Ray.<eos> I feel really bad for what they did to you.<eos> I don't need to look a gift horse up the ass to know there's shit in there.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> We do.
I don't know about that.<eos> Fine. Maybe you can just talk to me if that's easier.<eos> Do you ever feel like you hit rock bottom?<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> I sure did. In my late 20's.
Would you just let me have the win?<eos> We're winning!<eos> It ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?<eos> I hope you do. Huh?<eos> I do.
Go do it!<eos> Go do it!<eos> - Adam!<eos> - Shane!<eos> What do we do?
It is.<eos> You and Mom, we never talk about anything.<eos> We never talk about him.<eos> We never talk about how he affects all of us.<eos> We do. We do.
Wow.<eos> Oh, krista, you're home early.<eos> Why... mmm. Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him? I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, krista, you're home early.<eos> Why... mmm. Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him? I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Oh, face it.<eos> You can't wait to take me home so you can be mom's little hero. You live for that shit.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> I just want you to know you're right, Nadine.<eos> Darian, we don't...
He wanted you to tell me everything.<eos> How frustrating for you.<eos> Between Ms. Peregrine rules and my ******* not to scare you off.<eos> It's like no ones telling you anything? !<eos> So why don't you then?
He devised an experiment.<eos> He kidnapped an Ymbryne not knowing or caring whether she would survive the experiment.<eos> But the fate of Barron and his group was more horrifying still.<eos> Why didn't Barron turn into one?<eos> He did.
A pretty new girl walks into a room, everyone's head turns, looks her up and down, wondering,<eos> "who is she fucking?<eos> "Who could she fuck?<eos> "And how high can she climb, and is it higher than me?"<eos> I don't...
So I could wear a ponytail.<eos> Didn't it hurt?<eos> Anything worth having hurts a little.<eos> Besides, nobody likes the way they look.<eos> I do.
We have a serious fucking problem.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.<eos> What, you think the Afghans who are getting shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?<eos> No, but the Pentagon does.
I was about to fire the entire office.<eos> Anyway, when I was over there, I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.<eos> Did you know his uncle works at the Albanian defense ministry?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Well, he does.
Free the lines!<eos> Lines freed!<eos> Did Bernie go out, Gus?<eos> Miriam, what are you doing here?<eos> Did he?
That's the tide rising, gonna work us off this shoal.<eos> Look, look, this'll at least give us some time.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?<eos> That right.<eos> Sure does, boy.
All right, look, the whole reason that this ship is on a course is 'cause they charted a plan and they followed it.<eos> So it's lucky Clara didn't get a chance to say yes because I'm incapable of making a plan, incapable of supporting her.<eos> I'm just saying maybe things turned out for the best.<eos> My plan is to find the son of a bitch that stole my ring and marry her the second I get off this ship, and I don't care what her parents or you or anybody else has got to say...<eos> You the kid that does the diving?
Tao Tei movement!<eos> All troops to the Wall!<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - No. - How do you know he won't betray us?<eos> - I don't.
It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
No more. Do you hear me?<eos> Pull the damn trigger.<eos> Stop it!<eos> But you didn't kill him?<eos> In my heart, I did.
I don't have three hearts.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't!<eos> - You do! - Don't!<eos> - Do!
Ray!<eos> I do not know if you are you, if you are her.<eos> I am, of course I am.<eos> - No, you are not.<eos> Yes you did.
You know what-- don't fucking touch me.<eos> My whole life, i got the high hat and the icy mitt... From people like your father.<eos> We're not less than you.<eos> I never said you were.<eos> Oh, well, he did.
Not gonna happen. Want another red dot on your chest?<eos> - I'm not a terrorist. - Hey! You stole a bag.<eos> - We got a job to do.<eos> - This is crazy. - I don't work for the CIA.<eos> - Well, you do today.
- Oh! What the fuck?<eos> - Look at that ass!<eos> This is supposed to be private!<eos> I don't do this to you.<eos> Yes, you do.
I mean good.<eos> Your shooting is good.<eos> Do it again. Sight the lowest part of the V, cheek resting against the...<eos> I had a father, thank you.<eos> I didn't.
I did not count women and old men.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why so lenient?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> Actually, I do.
What I care take that bus to the south as soon as possible.<eos> - And if I do not?<eos> - You are fired.<eos> Well, fire me, idiot.<eos> Do it!
Second runner-up.<eos> Everybody said she should've won, but the fix was in.<eos> You know how those pageant deals work.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
- I'm just saying.<eos> - Shut!<eos> Do you wish we had a choice, is that what you're asking?<eos> Well...<eos> We don't, Sergeant.
Hell, yeah, "We're so fucking proud of our troops," but when it comes to actual money, then all of a sudden we're stuck in everybody's tight-ass budget.<eos> Talk is cheap, I get that. Talk is cheap. But money screams.<eos> This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.<eos> I think we should all fear for it.<eos> I do, Dave. I truly do.
Go back again. And play.<eos> "Our science team is attempting to decode the sets."<eos> "Sets." I don't know what that means.<eos> Something about advantage, suits, honor and, uh, flowers.<eos> I don't...
That's not a Midlands Branch.<eos> That's not part of the plan.<eos> Now, we got to go back to the ranch and bury the car.<eos> Fuck!<eos> No, we do not.
Oh, it's gonna burn out when it hits the Brazos.<eos> No one to call around here, anyway.<eos> No, these boys is on their own.<eos> I still don't see the problem, Toby.<eos> You still don't...
Okay.<eos> Didn't happen to have your surveillance cameras on this morning, did you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, so you have the robbery on video.<eos> Of course we do.
My partner had a family.<eos> A big one.<eos> They don't got no pumpjacks in their backyard.<eos> I didn't kill your friend.<eos> Yes, you did.
I am so afraid.<eos> Mother, the preacher said such bad things about Father Miller.<eos> Don't you listen to any of that.<eos> But I heard.<eos> We all did!
Perhaps the earth should swallow me whole.<eos> Is that what I should pray for?<eos> Do you have any mail for me, Mr Drew?<eos> Oh, yes, Mr Bates.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
(BABY GRIZZLES)<eos> Bates has printed about the Sabbath again.<eos> But how did he have the money?<eos> JAMES:<eos> I... He didn't.
Twice.<eos> You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase. How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
Never is.<eos> We have considered the postion of Vice Admiral It's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice admiral do not fly, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
Done talked to the devil.<eos> Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?<eos> How you doing, Rose?
That what it say on the radio.<eos> "Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.<eos> I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.<eos> I'm working every day, can't get no credit.<eos> What to do?
As long as it do that, I'm gonna stick with it, try to make some sense out of it.<eos> Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.<eos> Let me get in here and get these eggs, man.<eos> Get ready to go bury Papa.<eos> How you doing?
Yeah, right!<eos> We're all thinking it.<eos> Is there really nothing he can't do?<eos> - Do we hate him?<eos> Yes. - We do!
- Hey. - Hey.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> I got the mammogram today, you know I hate them.<eos> I do.
You buzz me up, and I'll give you a free dance on the way down.<eos> How about that?<eos> I'll let you up.<eos> I like Gordon Lightfoot.<eos> Who doesn't?
My parents may see the corpse.<eos> You will not see her body.<eos> That's part of the plan.<eos> Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.<eos> - I do.
Why must proclaim with us the message Limus never?<eos> Him the Lord else has imposed treasure.<eos> If, otherwise we'll be late.<eos> - And I know how you hate that, honey.<eos> - I do.
We're all part of the same dream team.<eos> We should make T-shirts!<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> You have no idea the kinds of evil he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I can't find your factor.<eos> - Dad, I told you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I told you I left it at the hotel.<eos> - No, you didn't.
It's just a dream of a farmer from Kansas.<eos> That farmer's dream is all some people have.<eos> It's all that gives them hope.<eos> This means something.<eos> It did on my world.
A daughter.<eos> Kit.<eos> She's 21.<eos> - Does she tell you anything?<eos> - She does.
And where we're headin', this hotel... they made their last stand there.<eos> Didn't realize they were just packing' meat... in one place like a goddamn buffet.<eos> They lasted two days.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to get down there myself.<eos> Hell, we all did.
I don't know-know.<eos> I just haven't had my lady time in a while.<eos> It's been on my mind.<eos> I'm sorry if this interferes with your destiny.<eos> It don't really.
God made me to know Him, to love Him and to serve Him in this world.<eos> And does God want you to serve Him with half of your wits?<eos> With one hand in the air?<eos> No, Father.<eos> No, He does not.
No other way out?<eos> I suppose if you count the Vasari Gate.<eos> But it's ancient.<eos> No one knows about it.<eos> Langdon does.
You afraid of heights?<eos> A little.<eos> I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.<eos> So don't look down.<eos> Or do.
Jam all communications down there. No messages get in or out.<eos> Got it.<eos> Shall we go in?<eos> Robert, you don't have to go in there with us.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yes.<eos> That was your impression?<eos> London's vaporous air is not, I think, healthy for her.<eos> - Does she not seem pale?<eos> - She does.
- Very relevant.<eos> - Or an invasion of men?<eos> - I'm not stingy with my body.<eos> - As you very well know, Ole.<eos> - You do, Ole?
- They're being silly.<eos> We rarely eat this good.<eos> - Who knows about locks?<eos> - Locks?<eos> - Maybe Steffen does.
Here.<eos> This is Eric's fee for his fight.<eos> He wanted you to have this.<eos> If anything happened to him.<eos> And of course... it did.
But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
But it took me a while to get you out.<eos> I wish I had sent you a note. I wish I could have told you I was coming, But could not take the risk, in case they were watching,<eos> Why did you not tell me?<eos> I tried.<eos> No, you did not.
You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
Turn it over.<eos> Let's get a close-up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'd like to get a little swab of the blood on your hands. A little swipe under the nails. A little bit off the scratches on your back.<eos> Okay if I do that?
Bring him.<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God chooses us over you.<eos> Not today, he didn't.
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.<eos> - Idle.<eos> Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.<eos> - We don't have that.<eos> - No, we don't.
- Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We fucking made it.<eos> - We did.<eos> We did.
I never did care for anything any gorgie did say, nor His Majesty the Queen, nor the army.<eos> What my dad said were the truth and I'd fight any fucker who says else.<eos> Your bloody dad telling the same... bloody story every bloody night.<eos> I mean, does he actually believe we buy all that bollocks?<eos> Tyson actually does.
He's still going.<eos> All right, then. Listen to your ma.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - I know.<eos> No one does.
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, Dad.<eos> And this here is Luke.<eos> We call him that because he's got leukemia.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He doesn't really.
I mean, I think I am.<eos> That's why Conner... he went into the store.<eos> It's okay. Have some water.<eos> How did Conner know the store clerk?<eos> He didn't.
- Well, stay out of mine.<eos> I don't need some weird girl creeping around in there.<eos> Don't worry, Scott, there's not much to see.<eos> Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name.<eos> No, you didn't.
You have me.<eos> You have Charles.<eos> You have more family than you know.<eos> You never had the chance to save your family before.<eos> But you do now.
I was even right about you.<eos> What about the rest of the world?<eos> Doesn't it ever wake you up in the middle of the night?<eos> The feeling that one day they'll come for you... and your children.<eos> It does, indeed
Come. We shall leave the men to it.<eos> My wife is capable of hearing what the commissioner has to say, Mrs Lancaster.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Though what I have to say she may not want to hear.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I am pleading with you.<eos> Send him home before Churchill does.<eos> It will be an almighty humiliation if a Tory government fulfils our responsibility!<eos> I would like nothing more than to say to hell with Malan and his damned apartheid, but we need South Africa to protect us from Stalin and his advance there.<eos> We all do!
That's why you stayed at the campsite, for your story.<eos> In part.<eos> Also because I was concerned about you... and your sister, and I liked you.<eos> - Do you even have a brother?<eos> - Of course I do.
Because humans are complicated beasts.<eos> You believe comforting lies, while knowing full well... the painful truth that makes those lies necessary.<eos> In the end, Conor, it is not important what you think.<eos> It is only important what you do.<eos> So what do I do?
Uh... Seriously?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I have all the time in the world.<eos> Actually, you don't have all the time in the world.<eos> None of us do.
I'm trapped.<eos> The only way out is to win.<eos> - So, you have to win.<eos> - No...<eos> No, you do.
Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
One of their edicts was a rule that all men must shave the hair of their pubis.<eos> They would walk the streets carrying a small wooden rod, a dowel, which they would roll along the front of a man's trousers.<eos> If a man's pubic hair was long enough to curl around the dowel, they would beat him.<eos> Now, I ask you, do I look like a man to walk the streets carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?<eos> No, sir, you do not.
- We want to honor her life.<eos> - It's the least you could do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, you got a gun, Marshal?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Better leave it behind.<eos> Well, if I come out unarmed, how do I know you won't shoot?<eos> Well, you don't.
Fingers too.<eos> See?<eos> Fun.<eos> - Do you remember when you and your friends had that party and you painted all those crazy animals on my wall?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
Just not that one.<eos> But homegirl in a catsuit, though, she could get it.<eos> What's good, ma?<eos> Not you, pa.<eos> What them pockets do, little daddy?
What up, son?<eos> Does everybody in here that's working...<eos> What up, Dad?<eos> -got at least $20 in their pocket or purse?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I just squeezed in another last-minute appointment and I can't do it.<eos> Yeah, I see.<eos> Come on, babe, please.<eos> I got an appointment, too.<eos> -Can't Kenny do it?
And personally, I think he's doin' a great job.<eos> You know what? The two of them just make me believe in the sanctity of marriage.<eos> I hate to be the one to say this...<eos> But Barack has definitely got bitches.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You're an amazing man, Rashad.<eos> You're an amazing father to Maya.<eos> I could never ask for a better partner than you.<eos> I guess I just figured you knew how I felt.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Anna, get in the house.<eos> Your wife hit me on Friday night!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Yes. Yes, she did.
You think I don't remember. You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car?<eos> Did Megan get in your car?<eos> -No! -Yes, she did.
I just wanted to know why they set up this whole mess and why they let us out.<eos> I wanted to check the information.<eos> How was I to know that that bastard was going to fuck us.<eos> I know I fucked up.<eos> But I did good too.
Everything she said came true.<eos> You couldn't have stopped it.<eos> It's prophecy. It's fate.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Of course I do.
When they find you, you're looking at three counts of murder one!<eos> That's death in this state!<eos> Something tells me I got a better lawyer than you.<eos> Why did you kill Emily?<eos> I didn't.
She fell.<eos> Her head hit the table and she didn't get up.<eos> I could have helped her, but I didn't help her because I thought that if she...<eos> If her heart stopped beating, then mine would stop hurting.<eos> It kind of did.
I wish I could hear it.<eos> Here.<eos> It be's very soft.<eos> Do you actually hear what these dreams say?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I look in the backseat. There's that bag, just sittin' there, lookin' right back at me.<eos> I look over at the guy.<eos> Guy about 20 feet from the car.<eos> I turn to Julie. "Julie, drive, and fuck it."<eos> And we do.
There's a place down the street that can do one right now.<eos> That's it. You're all done.<eos> What?<eos> What? Why won't you stop?<eos> Do it again!
Well, sir, the Webbs, um, are just checked in.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And the other thing?<eos> The other thing.<eos> As you can guess, I imagine, Reynard wants more money.<eos> Of course he does.
We're just your ordinary, everyday nuclear family.<eos> Members only.<eos> What the fuck does that say?<eos> It says you're a member.<eos> Damn right it does, baby.
Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.<eos> What's that?<eos> Call yourself a Catholic?<eos> You don't know the excommunication rite?<eos> And you do?
- I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man. - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
You don't know who the fuck her dude is? - Let me know.<eos> Jake?<eos> - I don't have a dude.<eos> Yeah, she doesn't have a fucking dude.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Your grandparents are living in sin because your pappou won't propose.<eos> Uh, I don't get why Yiayia needs that.<eos> Because you're not a woman who has put up with Pappou for 50 years.<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> No, you don't.
God, Nathan!<eos> I didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Well, I didn't expect to see you either...<eos> I was sure you'd find all this sentimentality repellent.<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is what they ask in school?<eos> "What is life?" What did you answer?<eos> I don't...<eos> - remember.<eos> - Yes, you do.
We-- we're both sorry.<eos> I am not fucking sorry.<eos> She's 16.<eos> You got any at home, you'll understand.<eos> I don't.
It could help the both of you to put the past behind you.<eos> I don't want to put the past behind.<eos> The past is Merry.<eos> There's no way I want to put that behind.<eos> But Dawn does.
No, I'm not hiding anything.<eos> That's such a bullshit line.<eos> What is? I have nothing to hide.<eos> I don't.<eos> Everyone does.
And the world now has an example that you can do the right thing, and you don't have to end up in a cage, one room, a prison.<eos> After more than a year in the country under temporary asylum,<eos> Edward Snowden has received a three-year residency permit in Russia.<eos> And now, here live from Moscow, Edward Snowden.<eos> Hi, Ed. How you doing?
Listen, think why Lhotsky's dead.<eos> Obviously, he was talking to Webb, so they killed him.<eos> They're going to kill me...<eos> We don't know why that guy's dead.<eos> Yes, we do.
Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... My friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
I understand, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> You and your crew have been through a lot the past six months.<eos> I wish I could say that it gets easier.<eos> But it never does.
You and your crew have been through a lot the past six months.<eos> I wish I could say that it gets easier.<eos> But it never does.<eos> No, sir.<eos> It doesn't.
Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?<eos> I don't, because I haven't been back there.<eos> She didn't.
There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't. Okay.
I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped.<eos> I turned around and went back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients.<eos> And I still don't after all this time.
They're concerned about ticket sales.<eos> What?<eos> But it's an 18,000-seat place.<eos> Nobody sells that out.<eos> Hammerleg did. Last week.
It's not to me!<eos> All right, look, decide right now, him or me.<eos> Come on, don't go there.<eos> Look, I got a family to feed.<eos> What? No, you don't!
Thanks for meeting me.<eos> I felt bad for never giving you anything at west Chester.<eos> Do you think this is political?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Apparently you do.
But it ends here.<eos> That's not how this is gonna go down, mims.<eos> I need to do it for her.<eos> This has nothing to do with her.<eos> Maybe it does.
Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
Are you a cop? Not anymore.<eos> Hey, thanks for the assist. Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here? No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
So... where did you learn about the secret rule?<eos> Let's talk about your dad.<eos> I don't like what you're insinuating!<eos> Yes, it was my idea to bring Lou-Lou here!<eos> Peter did nothing wrong!
No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
Dad, will they?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You know, I seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did.
Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> Huh? The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one even knows where she is.<eos> I do.
No!<eos> He doesn't want any.<eos> - We're good. - I'll make him a plate.<eos> Forget it.<eos> He doesn't...
The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, con "A," was to find the secret beach. And now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu.<eos> Nursing a hangover.<eos> SГ­.Major hangover.<eos> You don't like it when someone change your plans, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
- Iraq.<eos> - Same fuckin' thing.<eos> Goddamn right I didn't.<eos> I didn't even fuckin' know where it was.<eos> Still don't.
The jury gets to decide which they like best.<eos> Now, the good news is we get to hear what their story is first before we have to tell them ours. So we keep our mouths shut until we know what they're doing.<eos> You keep saying "story," like I'm making it up.<eos> I want to tell you the truth.<eos> You really, really don't.
No, I only met her.<eos> I... I didn't even know her name.<eos> They said you had a knife on you.<eos> You didn't, right?<eos> I did.
We're both working men.<eos> Your lawyer tell you not to talk to me anymore?<eos> Not even casually?<eos> He ask you how it happened?<eos> He didn't?
Come on, Helen. You sure he did it?<eos> No question.<eos> You blinked.<eos> I did not blink.<eos> Dennis, honey, you did.
- I just thought...<eos> - What did you think?<eos> I work for you.<eos> How would it look if I were to stay in your room?<eos> - A lot better than if you didn't.
I am done giving you what you want.<eos> You can finish this.<eos> I need you to finish this, please.<eos> I need you to finish this right now.<eos> Do it, do it!
Taking your antihistamines?<eos> I can't.<eos> They knock me out halfway into the next day.<eos> Do you want to get better or not?<eos> I do. I just...
Oh, miss winters.<eos> I say, miss winters.<eos> We're so confused, aren't we, cissy?<eos> Our brother, Charles, told us that you're writing an article on the home guard for the lady magazine.<eos> -Yes. -But they just did one.
Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do? Yep.
Well, you know, there are some other candidates to hear, Bunny.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Some more.<eos> - Do you know any of them?<eos> - I do.
Bring it in right here, homie. Whoo!<eos> All right!<eos> It's like black Jesus up in here.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Oh, my God! I just did a flip. Oh, my God!
- What?<eos> First of all, I don't care if they like Shark Tank more than Techtonic.<eos> They're murderers!<eos> All right.<eos> Second of all, no, they don't!
- Yeah. - I heard it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We've killed people!<eos> Why "we"?<eos> Why "we"? No, you did it!
So he pulls out this backpack... And inside is a like legit, full-on dead chicken.<eos> Not from a store, with feathers on it, newly dead.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We laughed so hard I thought I was gonna pee my pants.<eos> Joanne did.
Even apples, some of them.<eos> Or a spud.<eos> So have I.<eos> - But you have to draw the line somewhere, don't you?<eos> - Yes, you do.
Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No. I didn't.
Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
But we know where we belong, don't we?<eos> - Are you coming with us? I shall be following behind, just to be on the safe side.<eos> But you don't need me -- you've got him.<eos> You really have -- and he knows how to take care of his family.<eos> Yes, I do.
What's that?<eos> I hear AKs.<eos> RPGs.<eos> That's not good.<eos> What do I do?
So, this Luke Cage was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?<eos> Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.<eos> He was filling in for Dante that night.<eos> One man is linked to a criminal, the death of four people, the destruction of a restaurant, and you don't find him suspicious?<eos> Of course I do.
Because she's gonna be a lawyer, and she's gonna be able to defend her damn self.<eos> Ain't that right, baby?<eos> - Hey, Mariah.<eos> - Snap, crackle, pop!<eos> - How you doing, Henry?
What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
Why you gotta stunt on me?<eos> No, I mean, seriously.<eos> Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me...<eos> - Right. - And I was on the run. - Why even get involved?<eos> But he did.
- You waiting for me?<eos> - No.<eos> I bet he told you I was dead.<eos> Diamondback got to you, didn't he?<eos> No, he didn't.
One is enough.<eos> We have only two, and one is too much.<eos> Ma, you don't understand...<eos> - You think I don't understand?<eos> - You don't.
These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
I don't want a penny from the bastard who killed Antonio.<eos> What?<eos> You're a little tipsy, let's save the wine for later.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
Antonio drove us crazy with this song.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - You have no rhythm.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Just... just trying to look chivalrous.<eos> You're a low-down son of a bitch.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we both believe the same thing.<eos> No matter how dirty the business, do it well.
Look, I'm sorry. But it's not negotiable.<eos> Thanks the vow of confidence, Tim.<eos> Anna, wait.<eos> I take it you know your patient Frank Henderson died last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
She one of them now, ain't she?<eos> What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night? Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, no, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Nothing.<eos> At least you've still got hope.<eos> ♪ Over and over<eos> Anna has homework.<eos> No I don't.
My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead.<eos> Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
You can see here the indentation on the head, - neck and lower spine. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Weapon?<eos> - Some kind of angled iron. - Maybe part of a machine or...<eos> - So basically you don't know.<eos> No I don't.
Sack her, 'cause she's a lying bitch.<eos> It's her you should be investigating.<eos> Look, I want to have a talk to your boss.<eos> Don't have a boss.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Be happy for me.<eos> What do you really want, Barbara?<eos> I want to know what happened to Chloe.<eos> I'm sorry. Of course you do.<eos> We all do... We all...
So?<eos> More than half the town believes in spaceships.<eos> But you don't believe she did it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Depends.<eos> Did you write these letters to Max Holloway?<eos> Yes. I did.<eos> Did you kill Chloe Holloway?<eos> No, I did not.
Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
Listen.<eos> You need to run from this place, fast and as far as you can before death catches up with you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> It will.<eos> It always does.
Is that clear?<eos> Mr. Lee, you been with the Central Pacific since Sacramento, you got us through the desert.<eos> You're gonna want to see it finished.<eos> Chinaman need long work, Bossman.<eos> Railroad done.
How many times have you told your patients that just because they make one mistake doesn't mean they have to make two?<eos> Hundreds of times, darling.<eos> But I talk to prisoners.<eos> They rarely listen.<eos> - And when they do?
Yeah, we searched the entire Asylum.<eos> There aren't any tunnels here.<eos> That's because according to the blueprints,<eos> Arkush doesn't have tunnels.<eos> Sure, it does.
- I-I don't want her worrying about me.<eos> - Like you could ever stop her?<eos> But I, uh... I understand.<eos> You know how much I care about you, Maura?<eos> - I do.
- Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
- So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> - I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
Put the gun down, Juice.<eos> I'm tired of you drivin' me around, A.C.!<eos> Tell me what you need!<eos> - Take me to the cemetery. - No, man.<eos> We did that already.
And these Scarfaces decided to scare her by killing Nicole?<eos> How could you not know there's a major drug cartel being run out of a B-minus Brentwood eatery, right under your nose?<eos> It's just desperate flailing.<eos> I hope they keep that kind of unsubstantiated bullshit up.<eos> I don't.
Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.<eos> My pastor didn't, Johnnie. Baby, I'll find out...<eos> I'll find out what happened, I'll find out who did this...<eos> Nobody did this!
I thought today was the reason for the way you've been acting lately.<eos> I know there's business on your mind.<eos> And I know there always will be. - Yeah.<eos> - Look. I am sorry they wore their uniforms.<eos> Yeah, they fucking did, eh? They fucking did.
The North remembers.<eos> They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
We need each other.<eos> I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.<eos> At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years.<eos> Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?<eos> I do.
Fight them?<eos> Kill them?<eos> It'd be you against all of them.<eos> I mean, these people don't know how to fight.<eos> You do.
If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
Well, why wouldn't you say it back?<eos> I mean, if it's true you would say it, right?<eos> 'Cause I, like, I love you.<eos> Oh, my God, please stop saying that.<eos> -Okay, well, I do.
You're talking about me in the past tense.<eos> Look, I didn't know what to expect coming here.<eos> I mean, when I saw you the other night, you seemed different.<eos> Well, you just said I seemed good. You do, okay?<eos> You do. Just...
- He will me being sausage.<eos> Consider your tone.<eos> He wants to help you.<eos> I do not need help.<eos> But I do.
Come with me.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> - We're close.<eos> - You know you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I agree.<eos> And you should only choose the right warrior.<eos> Jinna, I'm the right warrior.<eos> You know this.<eos> We both do.
- Take it easy. Enough!<eos> We have to move it.<eos> Wait. It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
Look at me, I'm just trying to live my life, be a good person, and the rich keep getting richer while I turn to dust on Bleecker Street, you know?<eos> Fuckin' Tad, you know, I just want to be happy.<eos> Is that w... I mean, I just want to be happy.<eos> I just want one day where I just feel good.<eos> Of course, of course you do.
I mean, yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure I was. I mean, we could go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.
- We don't need that.<eos> - I'm on the pill.<eos> - Cool.<eos> You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> - You do.
- Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
Ah, well, here we are.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Do you have any information regarding the case that you have not shared with us?<eos> This is for my mother.<eos> No, I do not.
Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
What the hell happened last night?<eos> Stumbled onto a mugging.<eos> And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.<eos> Where'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
I'm not looking for a good reputation.<eos> We're releasing Barbara Kean into the wild to observe her behavior.<eos> She's a beautiful experiment.<eos> You know what she's going to do, don't you?<eos> I don't, actually.
Call her.<eos> I'll go get 'em.<eos> It was nothing that you did or didn't do, Alfred.<eos> Why I went away. I want you to know that.<eos> I do.
Oh, boy. All right, listen.<eos> The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> I did. I did.
Where is Judy?<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> He has to be somewhere on this boat.<eos> Peralta!<eos> No, he doesn't.
Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop.<eos> Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Oh, yeah, I straight up drove him off.<eos> Big screw-up on my part.<eos> I'm trying this new thing where I just own my mistakes.<eos> - I like it.<eos> Do you?
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?<eos> Showing my unborn baby how an ass gets kicked. [growls]<eos> All right, Cortez, time for your checkup.<eos> [sighs] No, thank you, I feel fine.<eos> No, you don't.
He should be on medication.<eos> And did I tell you he still craps the bed most nights?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> No, you did not.
On the flagship's mainmast!<eos> They're showing her fleet identification, asking us to verify who we are.<eos> Get my log from below.<eos> You have the proper codes to respond?<eos> I do.
Okay, I'll call you later. 'They were also demanding that Kuwait produce less oil...' '...so that oil prices go up...' '...and Iraq profits more.'<eos> 'Amidst these apologies and threats...' '...the Iraqis also accused the Kuwaitis of... '...stealing oil.'<eos> 'We had grown used to these threats by now.' 'And believed that the situation wouldn't change'<eos> 'But we were wrong.'<eos> 'It did.'
I was with you for two days yet you don't recognise me.<eos> I am kind of hurt, Mr. Katiyal.<eos> I remember...<eos> - No!<eos> You don't!
The two of you will go away, have a nice time.<eos> It'll be good for you. What?<eos> I like Anna.<eos> - No you don't.<eos> - I do.
Boris wanted me to give you this.<eos> It's probably another list of tasks he needs me to tend to in his absence.<eos> I don't know why he doesn't just e-mail me this stuff.<eos> He's old-school. - You want to hear it?<eos> - I do.
So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
"Didn't want you missing out.<eos> "The Company is called Tradepass.<eos> "Double your money in four months, max."<eos> It's trust Dicky time.<eos> And they do.
Shit on a biscuit!<eos> Colorful language.<eos> You've always been good with words.<eos> Don't act like you know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
You're not. She's dead.<eos> Maybe you'll have something in common with her soon.<eos> Goodbye, Ann.<eos> It's open.<eos> How you doing?
What's going on?<eos> You just couldn't leave it alone, could you?<eos> You were almost free and clear.<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.
Scary thing about this hallway... there are no cameras.<eos> Uhh! Oh, yeah. Come on, try something.<eos> Give me the chance.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> That professor, your dog attack, the taxi... nothing to do with me.
We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh...<eos> Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
Open the door, Monty.<eos> - I say open the door.<eos> - Please, sir.<eos> Please, sir. Stop.<eos> - Please don't.
You know, it'd just be easier, that's all.<eos> You should go.<eos> Yeah, I'm going to go shower first.<eos> So, you have the money?<eos> I do.
We gotta wear body cameras and all of that.<eos> I don't know why they gave me one. It's not like I'm gonna shoot myself.<eos> But, hey, I figured if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.<eos> What are you up to, man?<eos> How you doing?
Point is, you spent your retirement fund getting me out. Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.
You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
Who are you?<eos> Oh, I think you know who I am, what I want.<eos> The creature, the beast.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
You stole my ideas and you pawned them off as your own.<eos> What ideas?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> You know just as well as I do, Ken.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> - That facility was on lockdown.<eos> No one coming in, no one going out, which means if she was murdered, someone on the inside did it.<eos> And that narrows down our list of suspects.<eos> Yes, it does.
Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want it.<eos> You're in over your head, cop.<eos> Trust me, you don't wanna do this.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
Hold on, Reverend.<eos> I didn't come to see the boy. Not to help, at least.<eos> I came 'cause...<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Sure you do.
Holy water irritated him severely, but had no long-term effect.<eos> Will you pray with me?<eos> You are very brave to return.<eos> He doesn't like the light.<eos> My mother didn't either.
I mean, you don't have to have it on display or anything.<eos> No, you know what? I got the perfect spot for it.<eos> It's the trash, isn't it?<eos> There. Now you can see it every time you do the dishes.<eos> - Oh, yeah? Every time I do the dishes?
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> I just didn't think you were the boyfriend type. I'm trying it out.<eos> And?<eos> Sometimes he talks when I don't want him to. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do that.
There's a window during shift change.<eos> No one will notice.<eos> The things I need you to change are quite sophisticated, but I'll write them down for you.<eos> And then, like you said... I can be someone else's problem.<eos> All right, we do this thing.
You hear that? Right there.<eos> - That's the sound of victory.<eos> - Jimmy, stop selling.<eos> And don't act like you don't see the problem here.<eos> - I don't.
That's great. Please let me be there when you tell Howard.<eos> Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, o-of course I do.
I haven't won her over yet, but I will.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Did ye now?<eos> Well, yes, I did.
Good evening, my beautiful wife.<eos> And how was the rest of your day since last we met?<eos> Not bad.<eos> I take it you had a good day.<eos> Aye, as a matter of fact, I did.
And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
I should've told ye before we wed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was cowardly of me. Jamie, you must know your father's parentage makes no difference to me.<eos> Hm. Well... it should.<eos> It doesn't.
So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I ken what these men will face, and I know how to prepare them for it.<eos> You don't.
Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?<eos> Aye, I do.
That's not a water gun, man, that's a flare gun, which I'll hold onto for safekeeping.<eos> Uh... Why?<eos> Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun. Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
Make sure that your water, for your dog in the bowl.. It's not frozen.<eos> A terrible thing happened..<eos> Like three dogs.. It was so cold, it was like 5 degrees in the morning. Three dogs got brought to the vets..<eos> - I thought you had to be back at work.<eos> -I do.
Hey.<eos> - I was expecting your voicemail.<eos> -Ha, you got me.<eos> - I thought you had a meeting.<eos> -I do.
'Cause you don't know that Samuel Wayne has never once paid for a drink.<eos> Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know. You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> It never does.
Dobbs assaulted him.<eos> He believes him responsible for choosing the men to be interrogated by them.<eos> I didn't mention it to you because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just didn't.
So what are you saying?<eos> You saying I went too far with him?<eos> Maybe you went too far.<eos> Maybe you didn't go far enough.<eos> Maybe you did it just right.
There's a rat on my team!<eos> You're about to move a lot of illegal cash.<eos> You need to get this buttoned up.<eos> I need to know if you're still in.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Operation over.<eos> So, what, we go back to questioning Mom? No.<eos> We put out a federal warrant.<eos> His crew sees a Fed warrant, he might as well have a target on his back.<eos> He already does.
That matters to me.<eos> Good guys take down bad guys.<eos> That should also matter.<eos> It's what I thought you did.<eos> I do.
Saperstein chose to rely on Wozniak's mercy.<eos> So you tip the scales?<eos> Issue a federal warrant?<eos> I needed to apprehend Saperstein before he got to Wozniak.<eos> Yes, you did.
They don't even know how much brain damage he has.<eos> He might not even wake up!<eos> - I can't take that chance.<eos> - You have to.<eos> We both do, okay?
That's what the deal was.<eos> You want to explain to me what happened with Harlee?<eos> I told you, I was wrong.<eos> Hey! I need to know if you're still in.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It wasn't right, what he said about Wozniak's daughter.<eos> My cousin committed suicide.<eos> - His father was a tough guy, loyal, and a little scary.<eos> You gonna ask me if I know any men like that?<eos> Do you?
- Can't hide behind you forever.<eos> That punk's gonna have to see me on the block!<eos> In the cell block, then you're headed for the other one.<eos> Didn't your mother tell you not to stab people?<eos> My mama did.
Sounded like detergent.<eos> [laughs] That's what I get for being late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you wanted to talk about a case.<eos> I do.
She doesn't have enough information to make something like that happen.<eos> So the prosecution just let him out?<eos> Last we argued, your boyfriend played for that team.<eos> We've argued since then, and he's not my boyfriend.<eos> He didn't do this.
Those swamp people would buy it tomorrow if we gave 'em a holler.<eos> No way.<eos> Oh, I feel sick to my stomach.<eos> I didn't think it could get any worse.<eos> Then it did.
Tick-took, tick-tock, brother.<eos> Here I am, an open book with all the information right there in front of you.<eos> "If a tree falls in the park and there's no one to hear, it is silent, invisible, and nameless."<eos> - Philosophy.<eos> - Do it.
- No.<eos> - Their top guy.<eos> No way that motherfucker was going to jail, huh?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> So, you didn't do it?
I just want your parents to know that you're living with someone who's completely devoted to you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What-ing with someone?<eos> You say you're living together?<eos> Yeah. No. We do not.
Perhaps we can find something for you here at the palace.<eos> You are a shepherd, you say?<eos> Yes, my queen.<eos> Do you play the harp?<eos> Many shepherds do.
The Lord I revere does not slaughter women and children.<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> No.<eos> No, I do not.
This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
We can come up with some title...<eos> I always have some errands to run...<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> You know anybody in town?<eos> No, I don't.
Look at you!<eos> What was the effect?<eos> I didn't Ike it.<eos> I don't have an addictive personality.<eos> He did.
Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
You're a fucking brunette now? Yeah, why not?<eos> Why have you been telling lies about Paul?<eos> I haven't.<eos> You said he left comments on your videos.<eos> He did.
Lucky he saw Captain Pounds grab you first, huh?<eos> And wasn't afraid to say so.<eos> You think maybe you over-reacted?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I don't.
- It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
Are you on the pill?<eos> Yes...<eos> But I'd like to use a condom.<eos> Yeah, I don't have any.<eos> I do.
You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
Lewis, what happened?<eos> Who did this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We kept filming like you said.<eos> -I did?
Because the lab was about to explode.<eos> Somebody set the lab to self destruct.<eos> Right.<eos> We don't have a self destruct.<eos> No, actually we do.
Detective, what made you so sure so quickly Nasir Khan was your man?<eos> The mountain of evidence.<eos> So why bother questioning him?<eos> Sometimes a suspect wants nothing more than to confess.<eos> - Did he?
How many years were you a Shieldman?<eos> - 30?<eos> - And Reeve for ten.<eos> Not only that, I helped him teach his son, and you, one end of a sword from another, if you remember.<eos> I do.
- Go ahead.<eos> Are you Slean's woman?<eos> Only, I saw him leave your home this morning.<eos> You did?<eos> I did.
I am free.<eos> Home and free.<eos> Mr. Prosecutor, I'd like a word in my chambers.<eos> Hey, Bunker.<eos> How you doing?
You got me, lady.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.<eos> You know?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Job knew the risks.<eos> We all did.
I hear you went native while I was away. - Yeah.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
I lied that I don't have place for love...<eos> I'm falling in love with you, Ayan...<eos> And today, I finally understood that you can never love me the way you love Alizeh...<eos> I love you...<eos> What do I do?
I remember playing right there.<eos> And I made this crack when I tripped chasing after Aunt Astra.<eos> Yet, even after you fell, you got right back up again.<eos> Nothing can keep you down.<eos> You did this to me!
Let's keep an eye on probate, see how the estate settles.<eos> The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah. Maybe she does.
And yet, here we are.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I didn't kill Tony Allen.<eos> Why'd Joey Marks order the hit on him?<eos> He didn't.
Yeah, but I put up with the bullshit because what I do is important.<eos> Oh, God, you're such a condescending asshole.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it that way.<eos> Yes, you did.
Who does that?<eos> I've made this trip more times than I care to remember, and I can tell you there's absolutely nothing out there.<eos> It's completely desolate.<eos> So why'd your ex-husband give you this?<eos> He didn't.
Yeah, you know I can't do that, right?<eos> I've seen the video from the store.<eos> I saw how upset you were. Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I know you didn't know what was going to happen to my son that night.<eos> No, I didn't.
If father reads this to the chieftains, it may be just enough.<eos> Enough to what?<eos> To destroy the Khan.<eos> The Arab saved us again.<eos> He does... or he doesn't.
Listen, it doesn't seem like they had much of a relationship.<eos> Still, John...<eos> Still what, Kevin?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> It doesn't?
Okay, we can stop.<eos> My brother was fucking killed!<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - Kevin...<eos> - Do you?
We're executing a warranted search of this property.<eos> - Step aside, sir.<eos> - This is fucking harassment.<eos> I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> You do that.
What have I done?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, I did.
I could try.<eos> Good.<eos> Good. And then we'll figure out what to do next.<eos> When did you get Henry that cologne?<eos> I didn't.
You sure?<eos> Mm-hmm. If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
And running around like crazy.<eos> You're safe.<eos> We're together.<eos> Did he know?<eos> Gene, did he...
I completely shit the bed last game.<eos> - No. You... It wasn't that bad.<eos> I...<eos> - It was shit. - I have to tell you.<eos> - You don't.
A Mithraic temple.<eos> Perhaps an entire complex. I just hope they have insurance.<eos> Unexpected archaeological discovery insurance.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> Of course we do.
No, but that makes sense.<eos> He was definitely getting money from somewhere.<eos> - Who was paying it?<eos> SANDS: Why did you go to the station, Henry?<eos> I didn't.
- Yes,<eos> Henry. Why?<eos> Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!
Henry. Why?<eos> Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...
Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...
Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.<eos> Fucking-A right I did.
They have enormous power.<eos> Good for Shadowhunters.<eos> Lethal for humans.<eos> But you, you already know all about runes, don't you?<eos> Maybe you don't.
And once you do that, the new ideas, the winners, will present themselves because you are a winner.<eos> You're in the special forces here. You are a Navy seal.<eos> And there's a reason for that.<eos> Did the s.E.A.L.S make a mistake signing you up?<eos> No. They did not.
Yeah.<eos> Denny dantone's coming in with an offer on the Norton house -- $62 million.<eos> Prepared to close in less than a week, I hear.<eos> How the fuck did he see it?<eos> He didn't.
Okay, you went this far, get right to it.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> You greased some fellows in my union.<eos> If you say I did.<eos> I do.
The Bryan Connerty at the settlement conference... he would've stormed out of here the moment I walked in.<eos> But you stayed, and you listened.<eos> Hmm. And like you said... I stare at the lions at the zoo, too.<eos> Doesn't mean I wanna be one.<eos> Sure, it does.
As your intern?<eos> That's not what you were asking.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Don't forget, whichever crew gets the B-boys to rock is the crew that comes out on top.<eos> Hello, South Bronx!<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -We got no hot water.<eos> How you doing?
- Nick. Maybe you should just let him sleep this off.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - We met at dinner.<eos> Hello. Hi, there's been an accident.<eos> - Oh, God, I don't...
- Fuck.<eos> - Hey!<eos> You okay, Robert?<eos> Some free advice... stop spending money like you actually have money.<eos> 'Cause you don't.
It works itself out in about a week or so.<eos> Just won't be able to raise your arm above a "heil."<eos> That's... inconvenient.<eos> They have no idea what causes it, or...<eos> Sure they do: Age.
This would be a huge get for me.<eos> Now, how much would you take to get it off your hands?<eos> (sighs) I don't know, um... maybe...<eos> - double our advance?<eos> - Done.
What is wrong with me?<eos> Junior.<eos> Hunter.<eos> You know why I built my office entirely out of glass even though birds can't see glass?<eos> I do not.
- How dare you!<eos> - How dare both of you!<eos> You're fired!<eos> - You can't fire me!<eos> - I just did!
I have no idea.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!<eos> What do I do with her?
And you need me.<eos> So I'm moving in, too!<eos> Kimmy, you do not need to do this.<eos> Yes, I agree with D.J. You do not need to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
If you guys want to take this one, fine.<eos> Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> You know, I always figured you gave me this job because I speak my mind.<eos> - I did.
You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
No? You have 11 missed calls.<eos> You have to fuckin' talk to him.<eos> Do I, Clyde?<eos> Yes, you do, Jeannie.<eos> Yes, you do.
We had sex.<eos> Feel better hearing me say it?<eos> That I fucked another man while you were gone? Yeah, well, now at least we can both acknowledge you're a whore.<eos> - You didn't sleep with any Vietnamese prostitutes...<eos> - No, no, no, I didn't!
Did you?<eos> Well, did you enjoy it? Look, there he is.<eos> Look, still at it.<eos> It was confusing. It was like he already knew all of our questions.<eos> Well, yes, of course he does.
You do?<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...<eos> Almost never, actually.<eos> And when he does... No.
And that's why I killed Cray... for you.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That... That's on you, not me.<eos> I never asked for that.<eos> Of course you did.
So what's the plan? Are you praying for her to live or die?<eos> I pray for her soul.<eos> This is wrong.<eos> This is a mistake. I will not have blood on my hands.<eos> You already do.
Then why you want out? Y'all looking to upgrade?<eos> Having kids?<eos> No, not any time soon.<eos> - Nothing like that. - Is that why he came to see me and asked me for money?<eos> He did?
"Boy" me one more time.<eos> Take your son and get back inside.<eos> You know we didn't do anything.<eos> What's that?<eos> We didn't do anything.
When I first started working for the Broker, I'd keep track.<eos> Not "write shit down" keep track. Nothing stupid like that, but just... remember their names.<eos> Like they were lovers or something, I don't even know what.<eos> Wasn't even something I was consciously trying to do.<eos> I just did.
If you did care, you would realize that constantly reminding me that he's gone forever isn't something I wanna think about any more than I already do, which is pretty much all the goddamn time!<eos> You're living in his fucking house.<eos> Yeah, and maybe I shouldn't be, but if I don't, then there's nothing left of him.<eos> - There's nothing. - Sandy, that doesn't even make sense.<eos> Yeah, it probably doesn't.
Don't you patronize me.<eos> I just put my clinic on the line for you.<eos> It's under control.<eos> - They murdered a man.<eos> - They didn't.
You killed Dickson?<eos> No, I just made the best of a bad situation.<eos> That symbol on the wall, that was you?<eos> Your approval rating went up 10 percentage points after your press release, after that image went viral.<eos> Now, did I do the wrong thing?
What?<eos> Yeah, a long time ago now. The government outsourced itself to Jarrod Slade.<eos> - No one said boo. - Slade?<eos> He owns it.<eos> Well, at least one of his shell companies does.
Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die.<eos> I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Astronauts share.<eos> They may need each other's forces when they come up there.<eos> - How do you know they get up there?<eos> - They do.
Please forgive me.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight.<eos> And if you're lucky, we'll talk about it in the morning, too.<eos> OK, if you didn't send the roses, then why did you say you got me flowers?<eos> Because I did.
I will no longer boss you around.<eos> Really? Yes.<eos> Be at peace, my children.<eos> And we don't have to pay you back?<eos> Of course you do.
You know, the ones where the girls don't really want to be there.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Eva, no, I'm not into that kind of stuff.<eos> - You know me.<eos> - I do.
- I thought you said you counted the doors.<eos> - It wasn't like this before.<eos> There's someone back here, Jonah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> She does.
You bought it all with good memories, so your friend Jonah could spend some time with one of my star attractions.<eos> That's great.<eos> So why did he let her go?<eos> I don't know. I don't know, okay?<eos> I don't.
Where's Rand?<eos> No hello, no nothing.<eos> Come on. I'll take you to him.<eos> So she didn't catch you?<eos> She did.
How about we go home?<eos> Both of us. To our own homes.<eos> And we just leave it at that.<eos> You're wasting time.<eos> Do it.
That's one of your old arguments.<eos> It must be a good one then, since it's used repeatedly.<eos> Will you come to the medal ceremony tomorrow?<eos> -Erling, you don't want me there.<eos> -I do.
-They'll be here soon.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Intelligence wanted me to guard her for a few days.<eos> But why didn't you tell me Sharif is dead?<eos> -I didn't?
I was in college.<eos> Trish Kellogg and I spent every Valentine's Day just hiding out, eating milk duds.<eos> I'm not sure that had anything to do with a serial killer.<eos> Didn't the police catch this lunatic?<eos> They did.
And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police...<eos> Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
No, because two hours later they caught Glen Baker.<eos> And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought. What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
! I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No. You do!
And now you can be the first to worship me.<eos> The Hidden One is dead.<eos> I have his power now.<eos> I won't ask much of my followers, only that they serve me, obey me, and as is fitting, fear me.<eos> What did you do to my sister?
It could happen to us.<eos> So we need to be prepared.<eos> To that end, say "hello" to that end, say "hello" to our new and improved compliance department.<eos> These assholes work here now?<eos> That, they do.
- What I came for. What?<eos> These are game consoles.<eos> Right, but just the last gen.<eos> We don't have time for games.<eos> No, we don't.
The radio wants you on the six o'clock news, and some breakfast show wants to talk to you, along with the committee chair.<eos> -Why?<eos> -Same old nonsense.<eos> Two women, two different generations and viewpoints... All the crap we're supposed to be so proud of here in Norway.<eos> Why don't you do it, then?
So Anderson Rake Consulting employs over 20,000 in more than 90 countries and count among their clients the Department of Defense.<eos> I gathered as much when I saw my ID.<eos> It came with a security clearance.<eos> How'd you manage that on short notice?<eos> I didn't.
You're welcome to stay here.<eos> You can feed Bear while I attend a wedding.<eos> Since when did you start dressing like a middle school science teacher?<eos> I don't.<eos> But Uncle Ralph does.
They were slipped under the door.<eos> - By whom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I got a text with instructions.<eos> To do what?
Officer Reed there is a good man, just not a very smart cop.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> I didn't teach you how to love.<eos> Of course you did.
- A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
Are you starting to worry about them, Charlie?<eos> You should.<eos> You probably won't like what I do to them.<eos> If I could feel sympathy for you, Charlie, I would.<eos> But I don't.
Agent Wickham, Homeland Security.<eos> Detective Fusco here's been working with us to infiltrate this domestic terrorist ring.<eos> Homeland Security running a joint operation with NYPD?<eos> - How do you explain that one?<eos> - I don't.
- I gotta turn myself and I gotta... - What?<eos> No, hold on.<eos> I gotta tell how it could happen.<eos> - Yeah, but you don't know what happen.<eos> - Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
-Because we never talked about it.<eos> -About what? I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
Tell me what's up.<eos> I think this place is making me worse.<eos> We'll go home after lunch.<eos> Who wants to skip some stones?<eos> I do!
I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
Does he write letters to the dogs?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, that would be like the home run, right?<eos> I mean, that's what we need.<eos> - Does he?
I killed her. As you can see Srikant who was excruciated by the police..<eos> "Has lost his mental balance completely.<eos> You can see that he is vew scared.<eos> I killed her.<eos> - You didn't do anything.
Vew shortly, you will receive a call from my accounts department.<eos> No.<eos> Why are you taking it the wrong way?<eos> Look, you are getting it all wrong.<eos> I didn't do all this for the money.
I wonder what's next.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> 'Cause of some movements that you fucking hallucinated?<eos> How did you explain your NDE to people in Pittsburgh?<eos> I didn't.
I see a bossy woman who you married who's always in my house.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You know, I don't agree with how you raised these girls, but I see how much they like you.<eos> That must feel kind of good.<eos> It does.
Uh, yes, Patrick.<eos> She... She's gone.<eos> The poor kid.<eos> She really didn't have that coming, you know?<eos> No, she didn't.
I knew it.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Save Mara kill Beowulf, and we have a deal.<eos> Over there.<eos> - What do I do with this?
- He looks hot to trot to me!<eos> He reminds me of Mrs Lemaire's teeny dog.<eos> He wanted to mount Mrs Françu's bitch.<eos> Remember, Philippe?<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street. Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Perales, please step down.<eos> Drew, what's wrong?<eos> Everything's wrong.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?<eos> I do.
I think you can.<eos> But you won't because if you wanted to kill me, you would have pulled that trigger already.<eos> Just like you would have done to yourself.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Actually, I do.
Cheryl, get in here!<eos> And you know what ATM stands for, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't wanna be the kind of person that gets off on that.<eos> I really don't.
And it's this... That I'm accepted as I am.<eos> Completely.<eos> For my good qualities, sure, but also for all... of my filth.<eos> And I appreciate a woman who is that giving.<eos> I truly do.
He made some shrewd trades around 9/11.<eos> You know, he did what he had to do.<eos> My husband plays hardball.<eos> Nobody makes billions of dollars pitching underhand.<eos> But his work situation beforehand, what he did after, incendiary.
Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I noticed... everybody's real cozy with Deacon now.<eos> I'm really not sure how all this is gonna work now that you're here, and not back in 2016.<eos> We have a mission to finish.<eos> We do.
- No, you don't.<eos> - I do.<eos> I love her. I do.<eos> She makes me feel alive.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
- I do.<eos> I love her. I do.<eos> She makes me feel alive.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - She does.
No. Sh...<eos> Freddy, you're the one who fucked that one up.<eos> I mean, you saw what he was up to.<eos> I mean, I caught on a little bit later, but I didn't have the cards to do anything about it.<eos> But you did.
- That won't work.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I have no mass.<eos> I have no material form to contain.<eos> But if you did?
No. I came home to tell him, but I never had a chance.<eos> Grace?<eos> Is that you, sweetheart?<eos> -You didn't have to come.<eos> -Of course I did.
Not Robert Handsome.<eos> That's not a name for a person.<eos> He had a heart attack, if you can search by that.<eos> OK. I-- Now you just typed in "Bobert."<eos> You did. That's-
- Yep.<eos> I'm in town until harvest.<eos> Oh, you're a farmer.<eos> - What do you farm, dirt?<eos> - No, no. We do almonds, apricots, beans, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, citrus, cotton, and plant seed...
Actually, can I...<eos> I really need to go to the bathroom, okay?<eos> He doesn't need to go to the bathroom.<eos> - I do need to go to the...<eos> - He doesn't.
No, I just...<eos> - no, somebody just said that.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> They also said you keep a guy named Shane downstairs for sometimes sex.<eos> Of course they did.
She and her longtime love, Deacon Claybourne, have made no public announcement, but pair are rumored to be holding the event at a property once owned by the bride's mother.<eos> And the pressure may be taking its toll on the couple, after a scuffle with the paparazzi last night outside a restaurant in Nashville.<eos> Dad!<eos> I guess I just poured gasoline on all this.<eos> No, honey, you didn't.
He's saying I was the problem?<eos> I'd love to tell the folks it's not true, but I can't do that without knowing why you bailed on him.<eos> It just didn't work out, is all.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't working for us.<eos> How we doing in here?
We'll see you tomorrow, boys.<eos> Probably not his first time in handcuffs.<eos> No, but it's his first time facing a felony hate crime.<eos> I understand he shouted gay slurs at you?<eos> - Damn right he did.
What if Riff's just sick or hung over or something?<eos> I doubt Luke would consider canceling for a hangover.<eos> But he's looking for a replacement, right?<eos> - I'm sure he's gonna find someone.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
- What was I supposed to do?<eos> ! - I don't know.<eos> But I do know what it is to be a 16-year-old girl and have a fight with your father and leave the house forever.<eos> And I don't want that for Maddie.<eos> I don't, either.
Does it?<eos> Come on.<eos> He was always like this on the road... the parties, the groupies.<eos> You must remember.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I never wanted you to know, but you have to understand that your mother has always had your best interests at heart.<eos> So, all my parents are liars, then.<eos> Look correct me if I'm wrong here, but didn't you originally<eos> - drop Will from your label?<eos> - Yeah, I-I did.
- even talk to us?<eos> - Yeah, absolutely, honey.<eos> Look, we're just... your mom and I are doing everything we can to get her home right now, all right?<eos> - I don't get why she's doing this.<eos> - I don't, either.
Avery has no time for me now that juliette's back in town, So I feel like my album's at a standstill.<eos> Are they, like, hanging out again or something?<eos> They're hardly talking, actually.<eos> Not everybody has a great relationship with their ex.<eos> Well, scarlett and gunnar do.
What is the point of writing any If no one will ever hear them outside of this room?<eos> Look, I thought the same way when I was your age.<eos> I wanted to get in front of people so badly That I actually snuck out and played cafés.<eos> Wait.<eos> What if I do that, too?
What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Really think you're winning her over.<eos> Honestly, if we don't turn the dial up, she won't rule in our favor.<eos> We need to use our alternate strategy.<eos> Look, I know that you don't want to do that.<eos> - I don't.
And the songs that we wrote together...<eos> Look, in spite of all the hell, that part was heaven.<eos> There's just something that happens.<eos> There's a magic that happens.<eos> Still does.
So I would posit that the work now would be for you, Deacon, to find a way to be relieved of that crippling burden of guilt and for you, Rayna, to find a way to take a step towards forgiveness.<eos> You both have a deep mythology about this bond... its inevitability, the sense of yourselves as artists all tied up within it.<eos> But there's a dark side to it.<eos> I'm not questioning whether you both love each other or not.<eos> You clearly do.
I-I still can't believe it was real.<eos> Well, believe this.<eos> Elton said that you were an absolute natural out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> He did not.
Well, believe this.<eos> Elton said that you were an absolute natural out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> He did not.<eos> Yes, he did!
Fucking Jesus Christ!<eos> What the heck's going on here?<eos> This is such a great little place that you have here!<eos> (Cough, straining) Thanks for letting us stay, fuckface.<eos> I didn't!
Enough of this fucking middle man shit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure. No problem.<eos> I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
Best we can tell, Mount Weather was destroyed by an internal self-destruct mechanism.<eos> It worked as designed.<eos> 49 of our citizens were lost.<eos> So when do we strike back?<eos> We don't.
It isn't, not even close.<eos> Why don't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday?<eos> Come on, Kane.<eos> I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know.<eos> We do.
She even prefers the enemy's language.<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
Bellamy...<eos> I need you, and we don't have much time.<eos> You need me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I can't do that, and I can't do this.<eos> What have you got to lose?<eos> Pike should be in his quarters.<eos> Bellamy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
Azgeda cut off Costia's head and delivered it to my bed, and still I let them into my alliance.<eos> I'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty.<eos> I'm sorry, Lexa.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> Yes, you did...
Can we talk about something else?<eos> We don't have to talk at all.<eos> Murphy?<eos> He's alive.<eos> What did you do to my friend?
Maybe a little medicine... will trigger your memory, hmm?<eos> No.<eos> You have to understand, the Silent Brothers aren't like us.<eos> They lack your charm and superior people skills?<eos> Yeah, most people do.
It's this way.<eos> I'm sorry... about what I said before about your mom. I didn't know.<eos> It's cute.<eos> You assume I have feelings.<eos> I don't.
And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You...<eos> You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
There he is.<eos> Ricky: Man, he looks fucked.<eos> Bubbles: Look at his hair.<eos> How did he grow it back?<eos> He didn't, Ricky.
Right now I'm doing nothing wrong.<eos> Just waiting for my pizzas to cook.<eos> Nothing illegal about that.<eos> And it's not a lie if you believe it's not happening.<eos> And I do.
I don't know.<eos> This weekend?<eos> Might as well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't...
(Clang) Fuck!<eos> How's it going, Randy?<eos> Got a tip about a Bamp; E that led us here.<eos> You know anything about that, cutie pie?<eos> No, I don't.
No!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> I--I know where the money is!<eos> - Nice try.<eos> - No, I do.
Yo, J, you see?<eos> He didn't die.<eos> I knew that shit would work.<eos> Guess I lost that bet.<eos> Nah, he did.
Look, Maddie.<eos> No one thinks that I can do this.<eos> No one thinks that I can get my little girl back.<eos> No one believes that I can raise her by myself.<eos> But The Bulldog does.
Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do.
He gonna look after her.<eos> I got to look after mine.<eos> Do whatever I can to protect my daughter.<eos> I know you understand that.<eos> I do.
He's still processing it himself.<eos> What do the PMs know?<eos> That I need them to close down the positions, not stampede the fuck out of the corral.<eos> But they're instinctive creatures, and without knowing exactly why, they feel antsy, which leads them to feeling restless, which leads to motherfucking anarchy if we don't rein it in.<eos> What do I do about the investors?
It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that.<eos> Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
Two metal boxes about so big.<eos> They were real secretive about them, though.<eos> - Did they pay you what they owe you?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No, sir, they didn't.
No.<eos> Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't. You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do.
Then I hypnotized him out of it.<eos> - Mmm. You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Huh? - It only works on him. - Ah.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
Would you look me in the eye and spew lies about me on the witness stand?<eos> How did you respond to the SEC letter on Rubinex? I didn't.<eos> I gave it to my lawyer.<eos> I thought you said Rubinex never raised flags with the regulators.<eos> It didn't.
You're busting my balls.<eos> Well, you could say that she's bad at her job, that she's lousy.<eos> Cheer me up.<eos> No.<eos> She does a good job.
- We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
She says she went to the pub because she worked there.<eos> Withholding information is as good as lying.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> Just didn't occur to me, that's all.<eos> She did a couple of shifts now and again.
And it fits with the manner of her death.<eos> That was cruel.<eos> Kicking her when she's down.<eos> I know you think I didn't see ya.<eos> But I did.
Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
I think he's got the yips or something.<eos> We need to make sure he's not crashing.<eos> We'll go scoop him up.<eos> DeGiulio knows about our informant.<eos> Of course he does.
Well, they are clubbing you like a baby seal.<eos> It's time that you got out in front of this.<eos> You are a target for the Attorney General now.<eos> Maybe it's time you got out of there before you get fired.<eos> And do what? Hmm?
Mmm. Thank you.<eos> - Your Honor.<eos> - Counselor.<eos> - Mmm. - You didn't have to come.<eos> Oh, of course I did.
Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
Our mission is to...<eos> When was my first kiss?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't you?
All available guards to lock-up.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
She may have found a way to disconnect.<eos> Then we have no choice.<eos> The wrist bands, where are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I do.
Roan. He's got you doing everything wrong.<eos> - You're hiding.<eos> - I'm not hiding.<eos> I'm waiting for him to return with the Flame.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
What are you saying?<eos> He doesn't go, I don't go.<eos> Fine. We'll go without you.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> Actually, we do.
You're not fuckin' about.<eos> No.<eos> I've done this three times.<eos> Once it worked, twice it didn't.<eos> It didn't?
It's like getting Titian to decorate a cake.<eos> I love this person.<eos> Get over him, just go on a fucking dating website or something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, I don't.
You will cook and clean.<eos> You do know what we're takin' on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you know the dangers?<eos> I do.
It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
Take, for example, the modest desert scorpion.<eos> Now, can any of you tell me about, say, the Omdurman scorpion?<eos> Miss?<eos> Do you mean the "Deathstalker" scorpion, Dr. Sweet?<eos> Why, yes, Miss, I do.
Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.
- Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
Then came back as if nothing had happened.<eos> - No, it wasn't like that.<eos> - Roll up, roll up!<eos> The show must go on...<eos> and it did.
What if he's telling the truth?<eos> See, the kidnapper called from a PCO.<eos> Then he wiped his own fingerprints.<eos> But he left behind the cigarette butt.<eos> So under the circumstances he did two things.
Manohar?<eos> He wants this to happen.<eos> And the other voice on the CD could be Manohar's as well.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> He did it.
Not alive, no.<eos> You get them Brass and they get you away from the psychopath hunting you.<eos> It ain't just him. What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?<eos> What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?<eos> They didn't.
I have to go pee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here we go!<eos> I think you look a little like me.<eos> Yes, you do.
I couldn't tell you.<eos> It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So you did have a plan.<eos> No.<eos> You did.
I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong room.<eos> I didn't order that.<eos> I did.
Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but...<eos> Aria maybe.<eos> Why would Ali think that Aria had anything to do with Charlotte's death?<eos> Maybe she did.
-No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
Aren't those even legal?<eos> Wait till she finds out she's here to bag a black man. Uh-oh.<eos> Okay, um, I also want to introduce you to London.<eos> She is our super-sexy Pakistani woman who might have distant links to Osama bin Laden.<eos> No, now she does.
Fine, whatever.<eos> But I'm telling you, they would change your life.<eos> Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
You are a perfect match for Darius.<eos> Tiffany's not the only one who can be a football princess... or a queen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally... someone who gets me.<eos> Aww. I do, honey.
Hey, wait.<eos> I mean, I got to ask you... what the hell are you doing?<eos> I mean, you picked Tiffany.<eos> That's great. - But we need to have an understanding.<eos> - No, we don't.
- She's in a car, she's on her way.<eos> - Great. She has no idea what's coming, does she?<eos> Do you ever feel bad about what we do to these girls? - Oh, my God!<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Cause... this person killed my mother.<eos> And I want to see him stopped.<eos> It's why I gave you the bracelet.<eos> But you don't know me!<eos> I do!
It's an albatross, dummy.<eos> Mr Lermontov will be with you shortly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He has the best view... in the best city in the world.<eos> I do, don't I?
The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
Quite so, Mr. Reid, fingerprints.<eos> But accredited this time, given as evidence.<eos> The victim, Rabbi Ratovski's bloody fingerprints stuck on a shirt of Isaac Bloom.<eos> And not one word of denial did he make, Mr. Reid.<eos> He did so to me.
This might be our only shot at them!<eos> Why the hell would you hurry while I've been tracking all this down by myself?<eos> I'm withholding evidence that would sink you and you're still sneaking off doing God knows what!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> Damn right, I don't!
- Beer in the fridge?<eos> - Yes, please!<eos> You're a tough bitch, Audrey.<eos> I thought they broke up.<eos> They did, sorta.
I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill? I heard he had kidney stones. But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
Remembered we had some extra paint out back, and... it matches close enough, right?<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
Oh, I was being poetic.<eos> Don't you like poetry?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> All the men I grew up with liked poetry.<eos> I don't.
Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
We have brought him back only to murder our own world and ourselves with it... unless we can stop him.<eos> But it is impossible.<eos> Not all of us together have any hope of stopping him.<eos> No.<eos> She, alone, does.
Yes.<eos> I can try.<eos> I hope this is a new beginning for us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Sorry.<eos> - You ruined it.<eos> Why would I want to ruin your yearbook photo?<eos> Maybe because you haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't even know if he goes here.<eos> Do you go to this school?<eos> What's your name?<eos> You haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
I'm glad nobody got hurt.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - See you. - See you.<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
- Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
You're too smart to need anyone.<eos> And it's the smart ones who always survive.<eos> Then survive with me.<eos> Look, Scott's going to have a plan.<eos> They always do.
Is this why you came to Central City?<eos> Not to get to know me or your sister, but this nonsense?<eos> No one in Keystone will race me anymore.<eos> But I don't actually have to explain myself to you.<eos> Actually, you do.
Stop.<eos> We are gonna get out of here, Jack.<eos> I love you.<eos> Ok? - I've... I've always loved you.<eos> - Don't.
You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?<eos> In point of fact, you do.
Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.
You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.<eos> I do...
- I need a number.<eos> Nine, eight and a half, I....<eos> Eight and a quarter.<eos> She had notes.<eos> Did she?
Dad, you may kiss mom.<eos> But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.<eos> It can't be Mona.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Do you understand what this means?<eos> They were prepared to do the same to you.<eos> I.... Sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike.<eos> That wasn't your call to make.<eos> Mom, he didn't do this.
There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.<eos> Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay? If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
In fact, I'm ashamed of it.<eos> You, John?<eos> Mr. High and Mighty?<eos> Do you remember the last time you beat on me until your knuckles bled?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Have you completely lost your mind?<eos> I don't have time for a debate.<eos> Good, because there's nothing to debate.<eos> What you did--<eos> What I did?
Look, I know how you take everything on, everyone's problems.<eos> It's one of the things I love the most about you.<eos> But you can't fix this one, Ollie.<eos> I have to try.<eos> No, you don't.
Tommy Merlyn was--was one of the greatest people that I've ever known.<eos> He was--he was so much more than just... A billionaire playboy.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I loved him in-- in every way you could possibly love someone.<eos> And so did Oliver...
No bees.<eos> What--are you ok?<eos> Does the word Ravenspur mean anything to you?<eos> If this is something to do with your father, honey--<eos> So it does.
We can do this together.<eos> You just need to get out of here.<eos> What the hell did you do that for?<eos> I had him.<eos> No, you didn't.
I did.<eos> We did.<eos> I had a 7-year-old daughter, and I know all about gambling, and I wasn't willing to take the bet that your father could possibly change.<eos> He let me believe that he abandoned us.<eos> Well, I don't...
You're even more beautiful than I imagined.<eos> Well, I have to admit you two do make a cute couple.<eos> But then again, so did Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.<eos> Do you take this woman to lecture you about trans fats for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.
Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
I'll drink to that.<eos> Here.<eos> They are gonna shit.<eos> Look, this was good fun and all, but seriously, Foster, you gotta stop trying to kill me all the time.<eos> I never did.
- What?<eos> - You're pretty smart.<eos> Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> Well, yes, I do.
- So what?<eos> No need to be shy.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'll be really happy if you kissed her.<eos> You did...didn't you?
Told you.<eos> Those pirates picked the wrong guy to mess with.<eos> Since when does Rory even know how to fly the jump ship?<eos> How did he even find us?<eos> Actually, I did the flying.
Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He would have died if I hadn't helped him.<eos> I took him home and made him coffee.<eos> but I doubt it.<eos> I get up early....<eos> I did something terrible.
And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.
This is a dark magic charm, giving its wearer the curse<eos> This is surely a tactic of General Howe's.<eos> He persuaded one of his spies to sacrifice his very humanity in order to sabotage Washington.<eos> Too bad good ol' George didn't see it coming.<eos> Or perhaps he did.
You were right.<eos> That bonnet belong to someone that I cared about.<eos> My daughter.<eos> - You had a daughter?<eos> - Still do.
That's where he fired the gun.<eos> Why is there gunshot residue five metres away as well?<eos> My colleague has answered the question.<eos> Did the gun ever lie in a position on the ground five metres from the suspect?<eos> No, it did not.
I know he's not the easiest skipper, but he's good at his job.<eos> I'm learning loads from him, so I'd rather keep at it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah. If you move us on now, ma'am, it looks like we messed up, doesn't it?<eos> And we didn't.
- Good!<eos> Go!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
No, he, uh--<eos> I dropped out.<eos> Joined the army.<eos> Since when does the US Army accept high school dropouts?<eos> They don't.
We have a warrant to search these premises for evidence.<eos> That gobshite Craig Cooper.<eos> He'd say anything to save his own skin!<eos> Yeah, he told me he owed you money.<eos> Aye, he did, but not for drugs.
Did I say that? OK, this is what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go to your house so you can stay here<eos> -and take care of everything else.<eos> -I couldn't ask you to do that.<eos> Well, you didn't.
Move over.<eos> -It was Zig and Sharko.<eos> -Well, I was close.<eos> -I would've thought you knew that.<eos> I do.
I was dying to tell you, Mom. I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
Now, my sister doesn't usually make mistakes.<eos> So... what went wrong?<eos> I got unlucky.<eos> It happens.<eos> Not to you, it doesn't.
I want to help.<eos> You want to help me steal a bracelet?<eos> I want to help you not die.<eos> You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.<eos> No, I don't.
I assume you know that because you murdered him.<eos> The secret to a healthy relationship is not wanting anything.<eos> Tell her, Ben.<eos> I don't want anything from you!<eos> Of course you do, darling.
Don't worry about me.<eos> Reggie, please.<eos> You are getting rid of the one person you can trust in all this.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do.
Even the QR19 software couldn't find a match.<eos> So we don't know anything.<eos> We don't know where she is, what she's doing.<eos> We have no way to find her.<eos> We actually do.
Wow. Sweetie.<eos> You will have an affair with your personal trainer.<eos> You know, who knows?<eos> We just don't know.<eos> We don't, do we?
Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
PMG will have no choice but to sever ties with Ashmore Records, and you'll be free.<eos> The thing is, Nathan was right.<eos> People know who I am.<eos> They're buying the record.<eos> So what do I do?
well, i don't know What he was doing,<eos> But that's out there Forever, all right? And once it's out there, There's not anything Anybody can do about it, so -- So don't be him.<eos> Well, i'm not him, Nor do i even know him.<eos> So, i don't know why You have to assume I'm gonna do Something wrong.<eos> I don't.
Mmm, paying off a few demons is easy, especially since they rarely survive long enough to collect.<eos> Still waiting on Valentine's thank-you card.<eos> Opening the gates of hell... that's a little more tricky.<eos> Valentine doesn't have the cards.<eos> I do.
I can feel it.<eos> Mrs. McBride is a big bully and a big perv.<eos> Probably hasn't been laid since VCRs were invented.<eos> And if she doesn't like us, who gives a shit?<eos> Well, I do.
Who? I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is:<eos> Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
Madison, what have you done now?<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> We have room.<eos> - Put him back where you found him. - We have room.<eos> We do not.
I love you.<eos> Say something else.<eos> No.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- And once that...<eos> It's charged.<eos> You can go now.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did.
I remember that pain -- sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I --
I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but --<eos> I do.
Well, maybe I should have.<eos> And at least he wouldn't have would up a chew toy for the Time Masters.<eos> But if you did, we wouldn't have this opportunity.<eos> An opportunity?<eos> To do what?
He gave me the creeps.<eos> Yeah? How come?<eos> He wouldn't talk to me properly.<eos> He's odd, like he has no social skills.<eos> Some people don't.
- Big day, man.<eos> - Congrats. Thank you. This place looks great.<eos> When you address the crowd today, make sure that you thank the mayor because he pulled a lot of strings putting this entire deal together.<eos> Um, I don't have to do any speeches, do I?<eos> - He doesn't do speeches.
Get him dressed.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Did you bring me breakfast?<eos> - Christ!<eos> Did you?
The Authority never switched it back on.<eos> - Did you talk to Lagarza?<eos> - Phone's dead.<eos> No, landlines are all supposed to work.<eos> - Well, they don't.
Nothing...<eos> You called the cops?<eos> No way...<eos> - This car...<eos> - Did you?
Finn can purge it himself.<eos> He's earned the agony.<eos> Besides, you know how much I love burning things to the ground.<eos> Klaus, when you said that you wanted to work together for Hope's sake, I wanted to see what that looked like.<eos> And now I do.
We can't do that.<eos> - Freya, that will destroy her.<eos> - I know what's at stake, Elijah.<eos> I know.<eos> What the hell do we do?
- Klaus?<eos> - What is it?<eos> Something happened and you're gonna be angry, but Lucien wants you to be angry.<eos> He's trying to lure you into a trap.<eos> What did he do?
Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I can.<eos> If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.<eos> Of course I do!
No, I'm gonna do it!<eos> - Do it. You bought it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Fine! - No, I didn't!<eos> - Yeah, actually, you did.
He said get a car.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Hey, kid!<eos> You don't remember our faces. Say it.<eos> I don't, I don't.
Hasil, come on!<eos> What prithee said Ruckus tonight?<eos> Went on a run is all, lady Ray.<eos> I didn't give no order.<eos> I did.
You think on that.<eos> My guy doesn't know anything.<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
No, no, I haven't heard from her.<eos> Today I got home early and the store was closed.<eos> I feel responsible. We are responsible.<eos> Audrey will tell you if she thinks you owe her money. - Don't worry about it.<eos> - Well, she sort of did already.
Excuse me, Miss?<eos> Are one of you girls using the toilet stall as a babysitter again?<eos> 'Cause if so, Donnie's gonna flip.<eos> I just really need my mom.<eos> Baby, girl, we all do.
People would think we were bullying you.<eos> Go ahead and wipe it off.<eos> We should wipe your body.<eos> - Do you want me to do it?<eos> - Please do it.
"And?"<eos> I don't want to fight with you. It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now. Haha!<eos> But I do, too.
But here's the play:<eos> you claim that these idiots didn't search me in the right way.<eos> You walked in here, I got the jump on you, and you had to help me out the back door.<eos> And I never see you again.<eos> No one does.
Valentine must be searching for the warlock, where did Jocelyn...<eos> Hodge, your rune.<eos> You okay?<eos> - So how do we find Magnus?<eos> - We don't.
Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past.<eos> - That it would unlock you.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> I don't know!<eos> But you do.
Clifton: Nina.<eos> What?<eos> You have a daughter, right?<eos> From your first marriage?<eos> Yes I do.
You have till sunset to decide.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Remember what you said to me the morning of our wedding?<eos> We weren't supposed to see each other until the ceremony, but you... you wouldn't listen to rules.<eos> You never did.
I suppose Alec is just following his duty.<eos> Not everyone gets the luxury of following their heart.<eos> I'm gonna go deliver the preliminary findings.<eos> It seems like you have everything under control here.<eos> Luke, what do I do?
♪ You always save the day ♪<eos> ♪ Thank you, Hank ♪<eos> ♪ That's what we came here to say ♪<eos> ♪ I had hypertensive nephropathy ♪<eos> Yeah, you did.
What would become of him if something happened to his mother or me?<eos> He looked at me and asked me if I was hurt.<eos> The poor kid was scared, of course.<eos> - Do you guys have kids?<eos> - Yes, we do.
What was the rape like?<eos> Brutal.<eos> The poor lady was a wreck.<eos> And if you're going to ask me if we have her fucking DNA,<eos> - we don't.
Sesmillo, read.<eos> 96 civil lawsuits against the police, 21 treated by paramedics, 2 cervical injuries.<eos> 567,000 euros in losses, complaints from 7 embassies and a man with a fractured hip.<eos> - We'll take responsibility but we got him.<eos> - No, Alfaro, we don't.
I think I might have helped save a little boy.<eos> Reverend says that I saved you too.<eos> All I know is I put you here.<eos> I made you like this.<eos> After what you did to me...
Find... life outside of these walls.<eos> I was listening to Liam's speech, watching him these last few days.<eos> He's so clearly Simon's son.<eos> - But you don't know that.<eos> - I do.
- How's Eleanor?<eos> - I don't know, Mum.<eos> How's Violet?<eos> Tell me now if you had anything to do with the fact she's missing.<eos> - I didn't!
It's not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's something else.<eos> Tomorrow, if we fail and they succeed, remember that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
Would be fun, like old times.<eos> Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you... - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, not anymore.
Look...<eos> I wish I could tell you that I'm not going to pull my sword...<eos> - but I will if I have to.<eos> - You said you wanted to be good.<eos> - I do.
I wish I could tell you that I'm not going to pull my sword...<eos> - but I will if I have to.<eos> - You said you wanted to be good.<eos> - I do.<eos> - But you don't.
How could one man be capable of such... violence?<eos> But then I saw it... with my own two eyes.<eos> And when one comes across someone with such talent... with such a gift... well... you don't let that go to waste.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Matt, you are the toughest son of a bitch I have ever met.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> I came to New York thinking there's no way I could feel lonely in a city of millions.<eos> But you do.
They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
And he's just one kid?<eos> Alone?<eos> Kid grows up, rounds up every warrior he can.<eos> Men, women, young, old, doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.<eos> And they do.
I've made some additional adjustments according to the theory of quantum-retro causality, and if my math is correct, the trip through the Time Stream should reverse your condition.<eos> No. No.<eos> I'm not leaving you or the team.<eos> Which is why I'm not giving you a choice.<eos> What did you do?
I'm joking.<eos> Puppies don't waltz.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> I don't have insecurities. Mm.<eos> Everyone does.
Trixie, babe, come on.<eos> Get ready.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> I had no idea that Hot Tub High School paid so well.<eos> It didn't.
Don't mind my brother.<eos> He's just a bit... simple.<eos> We meant no disrespect, truly.<eos> I thought you told me you wanted your wings back.<eos> I do.
- that's just not there.<eos> - There's got to be an explanation for what I saw, Dan!<eos> There has to be.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> I don't...
And I think, with that in mind, we should keep our relationship professional from now on. Oh.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well. If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in. No.<eos> He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant.<eos> Put his faith in God, not the police.<eos> Why do you care about a priest?<eos> I don't.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Come here.<eos> Hi. Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.<eos> Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.<eos> I thought he killed you.<eos> Oh, he did.
You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Look at me.<eos> J'onn, look at me.<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
Made it worse.<eos> Well, did you make it about her? Or did you make it about yourself?<eos> I apologized to her.<eos> I thought you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Yeah. Well, I didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> You know, market penetration is only as good as the guys in the field.<eos> So I talked to Zak.<eos> He's okayed two full-time reps.<eos> - Zak did?
- Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
- Where is he? Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey.<eos> Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
Mark was in love with her.<eos> Thought about Rachel night and day.<eos> Obsessed.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, she did before the Price trial.
Your head ain't right.<eos> I threw it after we crossed the overpass.<eos> E, we wasn't even on the freeway.<eos> How do you know where I threw it, huh?<eos> E. Huh? You don't.
What's your Pretty Boy talking about, huh?<eos> Easy over here don't remember where he ditched the gun.<eos> Don't listen to her, dawg.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I do.
Ten minutes for Alonso to grab that shit from the wheel well.<eos> Shit.<eos> -Go now.<eos> -What?<eos> Do it!
- Wait, but why? I mean, if they're working for Voynov, wouldn't they want to kill him?<eos> - What?<eos> - Really?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, but she doesn't.
And why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does...
I really want to learn Kung Fu of the Iron Kick.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't deserve it?<eos> And Wu does?
That ain't gonna happen.<eos> Patty's all about her numbers, and we took a big hit here today.<eos> The only way to recoup that balance sheet is to catch Rosalee alive and get her reward.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
I asked myself the exact same question when I lost Brad.<eos> All of that pain, it is... it is overwhelming, isn't it?<eos> It burns.<eos> And that's why you felt the need to take the lives of those boys because each time you took one from this world, you thought that it would stop that pain.<eos> But it didn't, did it?
- Am I a faggot?<eos> You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.<eos> I mean, unless...<eos> How do I know?<eos> You just do.
I couldn't stop myself. That wasn't you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Vincent, what are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
I need to meet someone new.<eos> I need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
You can see it.<eos> Look at them!<eos> They're all in it together.<eos> Good, beautiful morning, guys.<eos> How you doing?
He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
- Where am I?<eos> - Solitary.<eos> Can't have fighting in my prison.<eos> She was attacking my friend.<eos> Yeah, she does that.
I brought you something.<eos> When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> You manage to crack the file? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
But I... I went back to work.<eos> Of course you did, because you realized there was no other choice.<eos> This is their game, and we are just their soldiers.<eos> We don't push back.<eos> Like hell we don't.
Killin' me.<eos> And I couldn't see it.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I do.
You never rendered your opinion on Captain Rogers.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You know,<eos> Fet's new comrade-in-arms.<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
- you should just stay home.<eos> - I'm afraid for you.<eos> You need to be back in the tank in just over an hour, so let me deal with Otto.<eos> You protected him your whole life.<eos> If Otto did this...
Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.<eos> None of the agents did, just me.
No, not since you beat the crap out of him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, uh... I'll take a cutter.<eos> Cutter? Don't know what that is.<eos> Sure you do.
What do you mean, "Dumped in the bay?"<eos> I mean he was alive and then he wasn't and he was dumped in the bay.<eos> And guess what, security footage was missing.<eos> So now you think he needs a visit from the Sheriff.<eos> Damn right he does.
I think that's probably something he got from his mother.<eos> I think with lives on the line, my son will ruin his career.<eos> When he's gone to jail, he could tell the FBI about me and the bridge, about the car tracing back to Lookinglass.<eos> Duval will expose it all if it helps catch those killers.<eos> So, what do we do?
One's for Stax, one's for Hume, and one's for a little girl.<eos> I'll find out if Stax or Hume has a daughter.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> - Why do we have to leave?<eos> - We just do.
They ran into each other a few months ago, and they hit it off.<eos> She says that Wally has changed.<eos> She needs this to work. Do you understand?<eos> Uh, Duval, you remember Wally.<eos> - I do.
Home away from home.<eos> Not that I don't think you're good at your job, but... I was hoping they'd send other agents.<eos> They're mounting up.<eos> I knew you wouldn't wait for backup.<eos> No. I don't.
Well... Keep doing whatever you are doing, you don't need me.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Do you treat a lot of Nazis?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Because I do.
You confessed to murdering him.<eos> That's because I did it.<eos> Yeah, you know... new evidence suggests that's highly unlikely.<eos> New evidence?<eos> OK then, I didn't.
I know it was...<eos> I felt something, still do.<eos> No, you just wanted it to be him.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Or maybe I do.
-How am I a bully?<eos> You bullied me into Phil.<eos> You bully me into feelings.<eos> I don't want to feel!<eos> Then don't.
What you want to do, partner? I don't know.<eos> I thought maybe you could teach me how to move the money around.<eos> Then I could do it.<eos> How did you set this all up?<eos> Tasha did all that for me.
If I had found the location on Lobos, you had a plan in place?<eos> I did.<eos> That's a loose end.<eos> He doesn't know who I am.<eos> He never did.
Well, this bird will never tweet.<eos> Tweets are to signal danger - or request nourishment from mother bird.<eos> - Mm. Call home! Pache?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he d... he did some work on the show.
- Kermit! - Huh? - Oh!<eos> - Denise!<eos> Uh... oh, no.<eos> I missed your 5k run!<eos> - No, no, yes, you did!
! Cheers, mon capitán!<eos> I think we'd all like to see more of you on the show.<eos> - Aw. - And the rest of you, too.<eos> If I knew your names, I'd praise you all individually.<eos> But since I don't, cheers!
Plus, if she shows it, it will open the floodgates.<eos> I mean, for years, George Stephanopoulos has lobbied to wear a crop top.<eos> Do you want to see Greek belly?<eos> - Well, if George feels more comf...<eos> - No, you do not!
- Yep, yep.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it!
You want to make the tough decisions, then you have to know what it costs.<eos> - You're gonna have to live with this.<eos> - Please, don't do this.<eos> Please, I am begging you.<eos> Please, don't do this.
Bludgeon.<eos> I thought it was a break-in.<eos> I did tell you I was coming.<eos> Didn't you get my messages?<eos> Yes, Sol. I did.
Norma Bates?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
- To help the people on the inside!<eos> - You actually believe...<eos> - I expect you to do the same!<eos> - Do you believe in the cordon?<eos> - I do.
Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
That is pure class right there.<eos> Oh. This is... this is very much me.<eos> Now you have to take up ceramics.<eos> You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?
The air marshal? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tagged along with Darryl a few times.<eos> You go in his place,<eos> - take Eddie with you. - T... what about who killed Darryl?<eos> I thought we took care of that with the, uh, Dooley hit in the jailhouse.<eos> Yeah, so did I, Eddie.
Can I ask you something?<eos> This Jackson guy.<eos> He wasn't at our wedding, never even heard his name before last week, and then, all of a sudden, he's Boots' lawyer?<eos> How do you guys all know him so well?<eos> We don't really.
Well, you would need a parent to co-sign.<eos> Even then I'm afraid that you would never make board approval.<eos> What, black folk money ain't no good here?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Nah, you don't.
Amanda, it's all over the goddamn school.<eos> Yeah, social media's fast, huh?<eos> You shouldn't have screwed me over.<eos> I never made any fucking promises to you!<eos> Yes, you fucking well did!
You know... when I went back to Robert after you... I just shut down.<eos> After he left, I tried dating someone, but... he wasn't you.<eos> God, I wish things were different.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
I am still being treated the way I was for 40 years, and I am not gonna settle for it anymore.<eos> Neither am I. I've got a belly full of rage and martini.<eos> Sol lied to me about Kenny Loggins.<eos> He never bought my painting.<eos> Yes! Yes, he did.
What do you want from me?<eos> ! I want the truth, Bobby!<eos> All of it!<eos> I told you everything on the tape yesterday.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, you didn't.
It's okay.<eos> Well, the third and fourth times I started the fight.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do, Troy.
For what?<eos> Some Health Department thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> _<eos> How you doing, Lex?
Just because you haven't seen her, that doesn't mean...<eos> You know exactly what that means.<eos> I know you're probably gonna tell me that me being up here, being able to look in, has absolutely no effect on whether she's still alive.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Come on, let me in!<eos> That one's 65 seconds, which is good.<eos> When contractions are longer than a minute, it means you're getting close. Okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Uh, I-I don't.
- Hey, is she...?<eos> - Yes. - Right now?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Just tell me they train cops to...<eos> - Yes, they do.
And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes. Yes, they do.
Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah.<eos> I just snapped.<eos> And I'm not sorry about it, either.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, he had it coming.<eos> They all do.
You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
I can help. (scoffing)<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos<eos> - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
He loved his child.<eos> He loves his wife.<eos> Sabine once told me she thinks the only reason he joined the party was to make a good impression on her father.<eos> Good. That's good,<eos> - if he did it for her.
This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no. Sabine,<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
- Double your money.<eos> Surely if he could accomplish that, ma'am.<eos> Don't trust him, every breath is a lie.<eos> He must have the money he made from the sales.<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
Listen to yourself, Mary Ann.<eos> You're wishing a woman who's done no wrong into the next world.<eos> But you don't love her<eos> - or why are you here?<eos> - Don't!
What are you doing, Marcheaux?<eos> Let's see who the orders are from?<eos> No royal assent?<eos> Minister Treville needs no royal assent.<eos> Yes, he does.
I mean, I don't even know what "like me" means anymore.<eos> Well, having an affair a month before your wedding seems like a really weird way to figure it out.<eos> It's not an affair.<eos> I've been with. - Do you not want to get married?<eos> - Of course I do.
Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
They're getting remarried, and Spence still doesn't even remember me.<eos> Rosie, may I give you some advice?<eos> Stop whining.<eos> I don't whine.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mmm! They always get my order wrong.<eos> What is so hard about black?<eos> Why do we even come to this place?<eos> Because that barista thinks I'm hot, and I never have to pay for my drinks.<eos> But we do.
She doesn't have a clue.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Circle?<eos> The Circle?<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
The sex was surprisingly great, and my hands have never been more relaxed.<eos> But I don't have feelings for you.<eos> It was just a fling.<eos> I don't mean anything to you?<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Got it.<eos> What you got there, kid? Gummy bears.<eos> You brought gummy bears into my house?<eos> Want one?<eos> I do kind of.
I am so embarrassed. [Chuckles]<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
I got to step up my game.<eos> Dinners, bubble baths, flowers...<eos> whatever it takes to make you happy.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, my God.<eos> I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> And then I came back and found out that you didn't feel the same way.<eos> But I did.<eos> I do.
You going to be all right tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gemma is coming round with Keira.<eos> I don't really want to be alone.<eos> Who does, Agatha?
And look at that.<eos> I thought this was going to be hard, but it turns out ning up a date is easy.<eos> Don't I need your number or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, yeah, definitely you do.
Taking poor relief off the Board of Guardians is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> You don't believe that, and neither do I.<eos> Oh, I don't know why you have to be so proud.<eos> You didn't wish the poor man dead.<eos> No, I didn't.
You telling me you've been hauling this secret around for 18 years?<eos> Never said anything to anybody?<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't believe me, Gil?<eos> No, I do.
Poor Roy.<eos> God.<eos> Now don't you worry about Roy Orbison.<eos> Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.
Now don't you worry about Roy Orbison.<eos> Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.<eos> - He got his, didn't he?<eos> - He did.
Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.<eos> - He got his, didn't he?<eos> - He did.<eos> - Yes, he did.
Yes, it is.<eos> - Who wants to hear my writing?<eos> - No, too rude.<eos> - I'd rather die.<eos> - Good, Theo does.
- Is it sex in a home?<eos> - No.<eos> - I give up, then.<eos> - I think I might know.<eos> - Of course you do.
If it sucks, then, yeah.<eos> All right, so now all we have to do is figure out how to get back to Zoom.<eos> Yes... just a minor issue.<eos> We closed all the breaches and have no idea how to reopen them.<eos> We don't... Wells?
By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute!<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but...<eos> I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
As soon as they bring Ontari out, we put them to sleep.<eos> Nice.<eos> Because she's chipped, you'll have to EMP her like you did me before you give her the Flame.<eos> I thought Jaha destroyed all the wristbands.<eos> So did he.
I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> I shouldn't have put you in this position.<eos> I wanted it.<eos> I still do.
She's not ever gonna hurt us again, okay?<eos> She loves both of us more than anything.<eos> Why don't you go put them pretty flowers in a vase for your grandma?<eos> Then we can give her a funny hairdo.<eos> What do I do with these?
And then all of a sudden, those cars came at us.<eos> And it was like the world froze.<eos> Like... you and I were the only two people in the world.<eos> I didn't even know what I could do yet, but I knew that I could save you.<eos> And I did.
The D.A. is going to offer Catherine a deal.<eos> Five years, minimum security if she testifies against Philip.<eos> Okay. Please, Annalise... No.<eos> It's not your job to worry about me.<eos> Yeah, I do, though.
I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.
- Frank... - Dude's not wrong.<eos> We wouldn't be here if not for his lead foot.<eos> Wow. Thanks for the support, Beard-o.<eos> - Asher didn't start this.<eos> - Yeah... I did.
Could've told me that downstairs. Yeah, I-I know.<eos> I just thought maybe we should talk about... you know.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.
Pop, pop! Come on, now.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Hey, where have you been?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Daddy.<eos> He was stuck in the pond at the edge of the cricket pitch, so I hauled him out.<eos> And how did you...?
I don't understand.<eos> I don't think I ever have.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Harry!<eos> Jimmy does.
Actually, trick question.<eos> It's a welwitschia mirabilis, the leaves are used for both, healing spells and for doing exotic curses.<eos> I thought it was a fern.<eos> Which is why I brought flash cards.<eos> Of course you did.
Thank you for that.<eos> It ain't my fault, or my problem.<eos> For the record, you do see that you're doing wrong, though?<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> But if I hypothetically did...
My parents are farmers.<eos> Indiana?<eos> I...<eos> I thought you...<eos> Of course you did.
You like your new job?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah?<eos> It's good to be away, I bet, huh?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No, I don't.
What does this guy want from you?<eos> After all this time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He thinks we had a relationship.<eos> We didn't.
I hate you...<eos> Because when you were born, your father said he loved me.<eos> Then he went back to his grand wife and his grand house whilst I lay pathetic and half-dead on a straw mat, my thighs slick with blood.<eos> I hate you...<eos> Because if I didn't...
- What?<eos> I would like to pay for this... all of it.<eos> What, you mean you want to, like, invest?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just like your mother.<eos> No, my only weakness was loving you, hoping I'd be loved in return.<eos> But all you were capable of giving is pain, so I ran away and found friends,<eos> friends I would give my life for, friends who give me love<eos> and the strength to do this.
My mother.<eos> She's the one in my head.<eos> She always wanted this for me.<eos> And I broke her heart because I didn't.<eos> I still don't.
You wanted this.<eos> You signed with us.<eos> You wanted this.<eos> - No, I never agreed to...<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
He had some kind of tech.<eos> Maybe he's a shape shifter.<eos> It looked like Laser, but it wasn't him.<eos> Yeah, we don't know that.<eos> I do.
Who are we even kidding?<eos> Even if all of this goes perfectly-- we find the beast buyer, you get exonerated,<eos> Grace Rose goes away-- we can't get back what we had.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. Yes, I do.
Motherfucker, I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
- I'm on a rescue mission.<eos> - Who are you trying to rescue?<eos> Ross Edwards.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
Well, she likes peeing in cups.<eos> - She's into that kind of thing. - [Laughs]<eos> No.<eos> I got a letter this morning from you-know-who.<eos> Oh, my God, you did?
Simon's life is in real danger.<eos> His life is his own.<eos> And even if I wanted to help you, I don't know what I can do.<eos> I don't have security clearance.<eos> No, but your sister does.
But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
They didn't say anything.<eos> Well, they don't know anything.<eos> Well, they know about beasts, so...<eos> But DHS doesn't.<eos> Only Hill did.
Yeah.<eos> More than we ever wanted to.<eos> But, you know, I still believe it's gonna work out.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Maybe half the Hero League for all I know.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Remember the question?<eos> ! I had no idea that shit was gonna go down!<eos> I didn't.
I'm the fuck out.<eos> I was able to track the MAC address to a laptop purchased eight months ago in Santa Monica.<eos> Do you have a buyer?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.
Kyle.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No, uh, I, uh, need your help.<eos> Uh, actually, uh, Cat does.
Yours and Chandler's?<eos> Yes, we busted him.<eos> He's out on bail, but he's about to go to trial.<eos> Yeah, only if you still have the evidence against him.<eos> Do you?
That were Lewis.<eos> It were me that used to bring her Mars bars and let her use t'bucket.<eos> I did not kill that little police girl up on t'moor either. That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife! - I know. - But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
- What've you got for me?<eos> - I think you'll be pleased.<eos> I didn't, and I told you I wouldn't, do anything illegal.<eos> You're not going to tell me you didn't do owt.<eos> I did do something.
But we Indians never learned to turn our backs!<eos> I am right here.<eos> If you have the courage, then shoot me now.<eos> Do you have the courage?<eos> Do you?
This is real, Clary.<eos> This is you... and me.<eos> Here and now.<eos> But why would Valentine tell a prisoner what he was planning to do?<eos> He didn't.
Verity, I lost my child.<eos> How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?<eos> Ask me, Enys.<eos> Am I cleaning it to put away or do I intend to use it again?<eos> Do you?
To talk to Snow White.<eos> Goodbye, Cora.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> No.<eos> But Regina does.
Maybe something similar happened to her.<eos> And that's how we get her to come to the table.<eos> I pretend to be that kind of client.<eos> How do we know that's gonna work?<eos> We don't.
Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
Now, can you please leave?<eos> We already agreed that we're not partners, okay?<eos> Well, it didn't work.<eos> Because you need ten extra digits.<eos> Actually, I don't.
All right.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> I can't ask you to do this.<eos> Well, you didn't.
Excuse me?<eos> I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.<eos> We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?
We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
- Dr. Grey told me to come find you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Meredith actually asked for me, or did she just want Neuro in general?<eos> I... I don't remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
Do you find no tragedy in their deaths?<eos> I find any loss of life tragic.<eos> Including my own, the day you died.<eos> You asked if I see in you the man I loved.<eos> I do not.
He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
[grunting] Yes, bound and gagged.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you find him like that? Or did you do that to him?<eos> Oh, no, my bad. Yeah, I totally did that to him.
- You are a fraud.<eos> - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
The bird's flight, the hare's dash, the leap of the salmon before the trap, the poison, the gun, the gaff.<eos> I get a feeling for their freedom afore it's robbed.<eos> And breathe.<eos> Animals don't lie, I suppose.<eos> Oh, they do.
Good God!<eos> And not to tell me.<eos> You said you didn't want another, not after Julia.<eos> Nor did I.<eos> Nor do I.
Yeah.<eos> That'll do.<eos> They need you upstairs right now.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> Of course I did.
I just need access to the Midtown branch before banking hours so I can open a safe deposit box using this perfectly legitimate key.<eos> Like I said, I'm not gonna take anything,<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone, but if I don't get what I want, well, I did peruse your personal computer over there, and you, Mr. Matthews, have a penchant for high-priced escorts.<eos> A lot of 'em.<eos> Hi. How you doing, ma'ams?
And in order to try, I've got to do a few things.<eos> So you may not hear from me for a minute.<eos> I think I have a way to make some of this okay.<eos> And if it all works out, I'll see you in a few days.<eos> And if it doesn't?
No.<eos> I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly... I'm pissed.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You have no idea.<eos> The last time I saw you here, you were standing just about where you're standing now and you called my son a murderer.<eos> He did save your life, Dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
He's teamed up with a group of people that used to work with Morra.<eos> And now they're creating some kind of Legion of Doom.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Did you say "Legion of Doom?"<eos> I did.
Who's next?<eos> What about that boy that you had a crush on in Bio?<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Baby.<eos> It's true, though.<eos> I destroy everything.<eos> No...<eos> No, you don't.
Serial killers have groupies.<eos> What if Tom is the brains, and he's got someone on the outside being the brawn?<eos> Yeah, but he doesn't see anyone.<eos> I mean, except for me.<eos> Yes, he does.
- Did you speak to the press?<eos> - Oh, will you all just go away? - (SHOCKED GASPS)<eos> That was unforgiveable, Harry.<eos> I-I apologise.<eos> Don't.
The tie.<eos> I was filling in for someone.<eos> It's okay, happens to all of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does.
Apparently, I'm bad for optics.<eos> He suggests I stop talking about frame jobs and faked deaths and take a plea.<eos> So no one else believes that Sofia's alive?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes. I do.
I kind of thought that was happening.<eos> He's pretty great, huh?<eos> He's a very... interesting young man.<eos> - You don't like him. - No, no.<eos> I do. I do.
Honey, this is your health, okay?<eos> I take it he has a pretty full schedule?<eos> Well, our business is day to day so you never know when it's,<eos> - you know, about to get busy.<eos> - I do.
The most important thing is for you to get some rest.<eos> No. My mom didn't do anything.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just... I do.
Now let's get out of here, huh?<eos> Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?<eos> - Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?<eos> - I... I do!
I'm sorry to call again, but i'm here with lynda,<eos> And she's wondering if peter is on his way.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The director got to your office two minutes ago. No.<eos> He didn't.
Thank you.<eos> I know who you really are, raymond.<eos> Who you are to her.<eos> And i know why you did this.<eos> Does she?
The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.
You want some?<eos> !<eos> You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?
You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?<eos> You feel that?<eos> Do you?
Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I drew specs on Superman.<eos> Everyone knows they're the same person.<eos> Well, Lois Lane doesn't.
My Queen... we did not expect you.<eos> Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course we do.
Come on. I'm sorry I don't stock your ganja, but, um...<eos> Free samples.<eos> In the back.<eos> Hmm... We love free samples.<eos> We do?
Bringing us back together.<eos> Yeah, well, destiny's about to kick our ass.<eos> Shall we dance?<eos> - We still got it.<eos> - I do.
♪ Love is your gun ♪<eos> Mira que lindo.<eos> Who told you you could come up here... and ask for a sit-down?<eos> She cleared this, didn't she?<eos> She did.
I can call it in.<eos> Well, what the fuck are you waitin' for?<eos> I don't think he likes taking orders from me.<eos> Little secret?<eos> Nobody does.
Then he's gonna open the tunnel access to the church, we can ambush from the inside.<eos> That's a lot of trust to put in one man.<eos> Yep.<eos> And you still don't trust me.<eos> I do not.
He could still be alive... With her.<eos> Do we really have to go through that town?<eos> The only way to get to the mine.<eos> You know, you don't have to do this alone.<eos> Yes, I do.
The wheels are coming off the goddamn world here.<eos> We're just a couple of... punks from K.C.<eos> If we're gonna survive this, we need all the help we can get.<eos> - You're not gonna regret this.<eos> - I already do.
You know, he thinks he can predict the weather by how the cows are moving.<eos> Can I see him now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Russ, how you doing?
Ohh. Looks like the spleen's been punctured twice.<eos> Could that have been caused when the screw dropped when we were plating?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> The hole is way too small for the screw to have caused this kind of damage.<eos> So then what did?
Reba, do you remember in third year when you got that really nasty eye infection and I had to read to you?<eos> You were doing that paper on "pride and prejudice: Gender and role reversal"<eos> "in 19th century literature."<eos> How did I even remember that, right?<eos> I do.
And it didn't go off without its hiccups, but, um... I got it done.<eos> No one died.<eos> So you'll talk to Shahir?<eos> You'll book the surgery.<eos> I already did.
Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
Yeah, that shit was fly, man. That was nice.<eos> - I worked my ass off trying... - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, man, hard work pays off, bro.<eos> - Do we know you?<eos> - Nah. But your mans do.
Get the fuck out of my house already!<eos> I don't need your help, okay?<eos> I don't need you next to my family.<eos> I don't need you around me.<eos> I don't your fucking help, Cisco.
So now what?<eos> You're gonna shoot me in front of all these witnesses?<eos> You're smarter than that, Cisco.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - But I do.
Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.<eos> Yeah. I don't know how you got through that.<eos> I didn't.
Did he... ever give you... anything?<eos> So, what did you do all day?<eos> There was no light so I didn't know if it was day or night.<eos> How did you keep track, then?<eos> I didn't.
He didn't come into it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> Your face says it does.<eos> It really doesn't.
I'll come and get you.<eos> Ivy's been arrested.<eos> She's not your responsibility.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you really don't.
I believe you're in love with Ivy.<eos> Just not this version.<eos> 13-year-old Ivy.<eos> But that girl, she doesn't exist any more.<eos> She does.
I'd like that.<eos> Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.<eos> Oh, the strike ended a month ago.<eos> What? ! Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I did.
Let's take a break.<eos> You want some of mine?<eos> - Hey. - Hey, man.<eos> Just want to let you know, I know names besides Steve.<eos> Of course you do.
- She's in a mood.<eos> - Still?<eos> I said to tell her that I needed a minute.<eos> - You didn't tell me that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I'm trying to save your life, Maya.<eos> Sweetheart, we should consider this.<eos> Maybe... I went to three different hospitals before I came here, and they all said the same thing.<eos> They said, "go to Grey-Sloan.<eos> Do to Dr. Karev."
I took her in, I'm teaching her.<eos> I am trying to make something good out of it.<eos> That was very cool of me.<eos> I didn't have to do that.<eos> No, you didn't, but why did you?
Near here.<eos> Where'd you go to high school?<eos> Jefferson for a while.<eos> What year did you graduate?<eos> I didn't.
That, too.<eos> First he'd ask why you didn't want it.<eos> I thought long and hard about that.<eos> And you never really said.<eos> No, I didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> We all are.<eos> I don't have anything to hide.<eos> Yes, you do.
Edith... how did you know my wife's nickname?<eos> It just came to me.<eos> I saw you at the restaurant.<eos> You don't want me to see him.<eos> I don't.
It just came to me.<eos> I saw you at the restaurant.<eos> You don't want me to see him.<eos> I don't.<eos> I didn't.
Indeed, first in his class with a business degree from Wharton, and he is ready to take my place de-gunking the cheese warmer.<eos> All right, my brother.<eos> I will especially miss looking into your tired, sunken eyes during our wordless shift changes. Hm.<eos> Remember when we used to nod?<eos> I do, I do.
Sorry, boy, late for dinner.<eos> I know exactly how you feel, Bart.<eos> This family isn't the greatest at recognizing achievement.<eos> Wow, now I understand why you're so mad all the time.<eos> I really do.
Good, Donna, you're here.<eos> Look, I need you to...<eos> The only thing I need is for you to tell me what you did, because I just found out that they're formally charging my father with bank fraud tomorrow.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What did you do?
You said you were going to call a lawyer. Well, before I had a chance to do that, they showed me what they had.<eos> Which is names, dates, witnesses, and everything else they need to put me away for as long as they want.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> How would they... You think I want to do this?<eos> I don't.
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, the prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
- Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.<eos> Look, ever since the day I met you, you have always seen the good in people, and we only need one person on the jury to feel that way about you.<eos> - And what if they don't?
Donna, I need your help and I need it right now.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is the jury back?<eos> No, I need to know if Stephanie Liston still works - at the U .S. Attorney's Office.<eos> - She does, why?
Has our friend arrived yet?<eos> I'm excited to speak with him.<eos> I know you're there, and I know you told them about Shell Island.<eos> But since you're not me, you didn't receive an invitation, and you don't know when and where the meeting is taking place.<eos> I do.
Although I suppose life in the abbey must be full of intrigue.<eos> What I am interested in is a proposition.<eos> Care to hear it?<eos> You have a job for the Vehm?<eos> I do.
Josephine's father was the most prolific criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe.<eos> But for all his success, he had a problem, an enemy.<eos> An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl--<eos> Yes, you did.
She is obsessed with it.<eos> Can I be honest?<eos> I like you guys a lot, and you're probably too polite to ask about it, but you do know about my past?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
The money isn't for you.<eos> It's very generous.<eos> I can appreciate that it comes from a place of concern, but it's dirty money, and I just don't want it.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> No, but your child does.
28 seconds.<eos> Look, I'm not sorry for firing her.<eos> You called her the "B" word.<eos> I didn't call her a bitch.<eos> Actually, you did.
I know.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, do you not understand?<eos> Do you not understand what this means?<eos> I do. I just...
He was defending one of us.<eos> Evy was being harassed.<eos> Mateo was protecting her.<eos> S-she doesn't deserve suspension.<eos> Those black boys do.
You tell them to do right.<eos> And that's always worked, you know, because... because nobody ever had to put it to the test.<eos> But... but the first chance they get to lie... To really, really lie...<eos> I mean, they could... They could have come to you. - Yeah.<eos> - But they didn't.
His pickup.<eos> I sell clothes from the back of the pickup, at nights.<eos> And I don't come out during the day, on account of my heart.<eos> And, how come you don't have your son-in-law's number?<eos> Well, I just don't.
Thank God.<eos> How many times did I tell you not to go?<eos> My dear!<eos> I don't want you to work.<eos> I don't.
Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
I was told I should confront things.<eos> But, um... that wasn't really working out.<eos> I was... I got in this space where I wanted to hurt myself, and then I went to this other space.<eos> Why should I be hurting me?<eos> They did this to me.
But, um... that wasn't really working out.<eos> I was... I got in this space where I wanted to hurt myself, and then I went to this other space.<eos> Why should I be hurting me?<eos> They did this to me.<eos> They did it to you.
I was... I got in this space where I wanted to hurt myself, and then I went to this other space.<eos> Why should I be hurting me?<eos> They did this to me.<eos> They did it to you.<eos> That woman did this to you, so...
He never forced himself on him, and then that kid comes back and kills Wes?<eos> Yeah. Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
Nothing.<eos> Something happens, and you never got anything to do with it!<eos> First time the police came... after the Captains' party, I could've told them about all the liquor you bought, all the drugs, all the girls you got to come around and get screwed.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Nobody did.
I'm not interested.<eos> I don't care whether you're interested. I'm tellin' you...<eos> I wanna see a fight.<eos> -I don't wanna fight.<eos> -I do.
After Tom Carter kidnapped me.<eos> He abducted me and tortured me.<eos> Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.<eos> He showed me a video. It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.
Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.<eos> He showed me a video. It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> And did you believe them?<eos> That you did this to yourself?
Cover your wound with this.<eos> We really have to do this?<eos> Work with Jane and pretend that everything is normal?<eos> No!<eos> You don't.
Hey, Corey, stay with me.<eos> - Step back, mind your business.<eos> - No, you step back, man.<eos> - We got you. - Help 'em out!<eos> - Do something!
How's everything going?<eos> Good.<eos> You can talk to me about anything.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's my ride.<eos> Hey, I tried you last night.<eos> I feel a little, um... Handcuffed here, because I want to be there for you. But I don't know what you're going through.<eos> Crowley thinks I know about Voight and that guy who killed Justin.<eos> Do you?
We don't need them.<eos> Hey! We got enough people, let's do it ourselves.<eos> You want to put your ass on the line?<eos> Fine. Be my guest.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> -Are you--<eos> -Shut up.<eos> You know I'm attracted to you.<eos> No, I don't.
- My hands are tied. We're just gonna have to let it play out.<eos> The man takes a spider outside.<eos> How can he be capable...<eos> All due respect I'm not sure you know what he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but you do?
Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
- Have you met me? - Jon wanted to protect his father's legacy, which you would have tainted with a release of Exhale.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> We'll write six-figure checks to a handful of eggshell plaintiffs, and meanwhile, we're making over 200 million bucks profit.<eos> - No one will care.<eos> - Jon did.
I'll be euthanizing myself this evening.<eos> So, Valerie, did you have a nice birthday?<eos> What the fuck, Alex? What the fuck?<eos> She just left?<eos> He did everything.
And not, like garden-variety teenage girl fucked up.<eos> I mean actually fucked up.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> 'Cause I wanted him to die.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Fauzi Nidal is missing.<eos> I'll take Ghani and I'll go.<eos> And then when things are better, we'll find each other again.<eos> - Do you need me to be brave?<eos> - I really do.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> You know what today is?<eos> Or... would have been?<eos> Of course I do.
No, don't do that.<eos> You could've let me die.<eos> You should've let me die, but you chose me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
I... am bringing you in.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> Put it down.<eos> - Doesn't have to be this way.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Is there anyone else with you?<eos> What do you know about our mission, hmm?<eos> Who knows you're here, huh?<eos> !<eos> You do.
Oh, my God.<eos> The passengers.<eos> They're still alive.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> I do.
She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
Jane...<eos> I'm sorry that I brought you here, all right?<eos> I chose this life, you didn't.<eos> You never had a choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
Okay, now, pull up.<eos> I don't think we're gonna make it.<eos> Break, break, break.<eos> Good job.<eos> No one does what she does.
Please, stop.<eos> Come on! Charlie, I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Charlie, stop!<eos> You didn't have to...<eos> Yeah, I did.
You want to tell me why a federal prosecutor's bugging my apartment?<eos> Is it better or worse when you thought I was CIA?<eos> - No, no.<eos> You have no right...<eos> - Actually, I do.
All right, give us the address. No one likes a tattletale.<eos> I didn't tell Camila, I swear.<eos> - This time, I won't leave a mark.<eos> - I swear!<eos> Please don't!
You can't take those risks.<eos> It is not your call.<eos> You're right.<eos> How did you trace the team to the power plant?<eos> I didn't...
Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
I thought you went out.<eos> What are you eating?<eos> Bacon, tomato, lettuce sandwich.<eos> - Don't judge.<eos> - I don't.
Bacon, tomato, lettuce sandwich.<eos> - Don't judge.<eos> - I don't.<eos> I-I didn't know you liked bacon.<eos> I don't.
I start at the D.C. field office tomorrow.<eos> Oh, so it's like your graduation, too.<eos> Well, I better get up there, or nobody's going anywhere.<eos> And here I thought you didn't want me to make it to this day.<eos> I didn't.
You want to defend that?<eos> Alex, you were so busy at Quantico trying to get redemption for killing your father that you never saw me making you into a scapegoat.<eos> And you make a great scapegoat, Alex, because you believe in this country even after it thought you were a terrorist.<eos> You still love America, and you think it loves you back, but it doesn't.<eos> Never did.
Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
Did you look hard, really look for their tells?<eos> How about you?<eos> You maybe missed some signs while flirting with Garnett.<eos> He asked me out... you out.<eos> He did?
Yeah, they did, but they're not anymore.<eos> They only met up with you for one final cash infusion before disappearing for good.<eos> Caleb was too afraid to tell you.<eos> Caleb said that?<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
Isn't that all circumstantial?<eos> Yes, which is why it's a good thing I have you...<eos> An eyewitness.<eos> The defendant really should've taken that plea deal I offered.<eos> Yeah. Why didn't she?
- If not for DNA, then why?<eos> - Perhaps a fingerprint.<eos> Why would Sadie need his fingerprint?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Your wife does.
Join the club.<eos> Just not my country club.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
You ever think about what I might want?<eos> - Alright, what?<eos> - I need to know exactly what's going on between you and this twin of yours.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I need him.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside.<eos> Helsinki.<eos> You weren't supposed to know about... Helsinki.<eos> Well I do.
No coffee, but I made chai.<eos> You still feeling it? Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
- Alison!<eos> Are you, uh... Are you alright?<eos> Let me help with this.<eos> I don't know what came over me, heh!<eos> Oh, I do.
We spoke to Trina.<eos> Um, I knew her from before.<eos> I was just coming back with lunch.<eos> They killed Tabitha, didn't they?<eos> Well, if they did, they...
Took me a while to realize what the cell regeneration rates mean to you.<eos> You knew this was on the table, Cosima.<eos> It was there when you gave us Kendall's cancer cells.<eos> You don't even care about a cure, do you?<eos> Of course I do!
I didn't know you two were official.<eos> She told her dad.<eos> He flipped out.<eos> Dads can be protective sometimes, but he'll be all right when he meets you.<eos> He already did.
Is that it?<eos> It isn't up to you.<eos> It wasn't before in the basement, it wasn't at the library, and it isn't now.<eos> I don't give a shit if you think you've found the secret to life.<eos> I -- no, I don't. I don't.
Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> Always watching, always ready, remember?<eos> I do.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I can't.<eos> Let's go for a ride, kid.<eos> Daryl!<eos> You seem worried, so I'm taking the kid home.<eos> If you do anything to him... Dwight!
Wait.<eos> Don't you even want to know if you got in?<eos> Nope, didn't get in.<eos> Come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.<eos> Honestly, I didn't.
We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
I head out the door, and all of a sudden, there's all these photographers outside, snapping photographs of this white cop cradling a black baby.<eos> The crowd is cheering, Lenny's taking bows...<eos> Two minutes later, Frank comes stumbling out, covered in soot, helping this old man in his underwear.<eos> Now, nobody wants to see a picture of an old man in his underwear with a cop holding him.<eos> Well, maybe now they do, but...
You know, somebody really should write all this down.<eos> Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.
Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.<eos> No, somebody did.
I do not want to go all legal on him.<eos> And I hope you don't have to.<eos> Hopefully, he'll listen to reason.<eos> You don't know Lenny. No.<eos> I don't.
There'd be no high moral ground left to you.<eos> There'd be no coming back.<eos> I know that.<eos> I know you know.<eos> What do I do?
- $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
She could've killed me.<eos> She didn't.<eos> We saw them kill Chino.<eos> They killed Guero, and you're working for that puta?<eos> Epifanio did, not her.
Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
- They're rats in a cage.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they turn on each other.<eos> Or you.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> Maybe we all do.
No, no, no.<eos> We all saw her hanging there.<eos> It was murder.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Why would I do something stupid like that?<eos> Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives.<eos> That is why.<eos> You got a pencil?<eos> I do.
Christ!<eos> I'm gonna need those keys.<eos> It didn't have to be like this, man.<eos> - Not like this!<eos> - No, it didn't.
This is-he was a murderer.<eos> Liar!<eos> We never said we were gonna kill you!<eos> Liar.<eos> We didn't.
Look, I'm just trying to keep you people safe, and that includes you, Doc.<eos> Until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah. Maybe I do.
I am a big dog.<eos> I was trying to save us!<eos> There is no us!<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
I'm ready.<eos> What I'm about to say, I'm not sure you're ready.<eos> Ready to go in five... four...<eos> Come on, Trip, I don't need this shit.<eos> Yes, you do.
Waverly, I can explain.<eos> There is a face that I didn't want to see again.<eos> Jay Novak, my probation officer.<eos> Why would your friend Henry kill him?<eos> - He didn't.
How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.
It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> T+U+S+U+B+T+I+T+U+L+O I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
And it wasn't from no damn suicide, and you know it!<eos> - I know, Shawn. I know.<eos> - Then do something about it! I don't have the answers, Sean!<eos> Look, this is complicated.<eos> Between Terry, the warden, what you did to Bobby Marks.
Oh, no, ma'am, no.<eos> You have no idea what happened.<eos> And neither does Mike, who would be outraged by this.<eos> Actually, ma'am, I have a better idea.<eos> No, you don't, Mike.
- Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One. - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
It isn't a gate. I agree. I said that.<eos> She's becoming seriously unhinged.<eos> She has gone full metal Nixon.<eos> Who do you think said it?<eos> Well, we did.
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out to cover the mortgage.<eos> But it'll be good to get home.<eos> I've been missing my tub a lot, and Noah's been using a lot of hate speech with me lately, so moving will be a good thing.<eos> All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off unless you need me to stick around, help you transition.<eos> - I... - By doing what?
I can't turn off the power or the gas, and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction.<eos> That won't be cheap. Jeez, man.<eos> I'm sorry. That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
You know, I'd do the same for you. What?<eos> I can bring Travis back.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
What is it that you want?<eos> Nick.<eos> - He's just-- - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that- - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
- And Bob's your uncle.<eos> - Knock, knock, future calling.<eos> Cheese, please, Louise.<eos> Gentlemen, you know the first daughter.<eos> We do.
Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
Man, you can really taste the angel dust.<eos> But no matter how baked I get, you're still gone, buddy.<eos> Man, I wish I could just go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> So just do it.<eos> "Do it?" Do what?
I don't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you.<eos> Look, just be careful how you play this, Dad.<eos> We need them.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I do.
There's something I didn't say last night.<eos> Something I need you to understand.<eos> You don't need to say anything.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
- Hey!<eos> - No, Travis!<eos> - Stop! What did you do?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> What did you do?
Baller, you got lucky on the first date. Yeah, did a little bit... not everything.<eos> I mean, I slept in my jeans.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Hunger is the best sauce.<eos> We did a little bit of under the shirts and, like, finger banging.
I could simply change you, make you follow me.<eos> But that's not my way.<eos> I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you.<eos> Because when you do, you won't have the faintest idea what to do with yourself.<eos> And I do.
Yes, that's true.<eos> Shahir, look, my brain can wait.<eos> It's her first lead surgery.<eos> Come on. You remember your first time.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Come back!<eos> Don't make me jog.<eos> Why is your father chasing after the spay and neuter van?<eos> You got me.<eos> What do I do with you?
Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did.
I know.<eos> At the end of the day,<eos> She's worth it. I'm glad I met you, richard.<eos> I'm glad I met you, too.<eos> But you didn't.
Cut to the sailor who receives that order closing that hatch on his comrades.<eos> The man that closes that hatch is a hero, isn't he?<eos> If this doesn't work... If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
So go ahead.<eos> Stand by me.<eos> Tell me you'll never walk away.<eos> Go ahead, Stefan, come on.<eos> Do it. Do it!
- You know?<eos> - She told me this morning.<eos> - She who? Wait, what did you find out?<eos> I think Michael has a girlfriend.<eos> He does?
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
True, that's true.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> What are you doing here, Alastair?<eos> Sal not give you my message?<eos> She did, aye.
I just know it.<eos> I sure hope so.<eos> I'm sorry about that... God-awful proposal.<eos> Having Herrmann down and out like this... The guy's my best friend, you know?<eos> I do.
Next time you will.<eos> Hey, Leon.<eos> It's your big bro.<eos> Just wanted to hear your voice, man, see how you're doing.<eos> Hey, you guys. How you doing?
They're all dead, so they got nothing to go on.<eos> What about the human bones all over his property?<eos> What do you want me to say, Gil?<eos> We know he did it. We just can't prove it.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Good.<eos> Do you want to know what you're having?<eos> Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound, so I can tell you if it's a boy or a girl.<eos> If you want to know.<eos> Actually, I do.
Omar Velez was a dead end, but if we can figure out who wanted her dead, we'll have our bomber.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Okay, so who was she?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
My son. Yes.<eos> Your son.<eos> It was her.<eos> She tied you up, not me.<eos> She did it, she did it, she did it, she did it, she did it, she did it...
President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.<eos> And I promise you that this is an agreement that you can represent to the people of Myanmar proudly.<eos> See you then.<eos> I don't know how we missed this.<eos> We didn't.
With that said, I'm gonna do everything I can to...<eos> Sir? Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> - We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that. - I didn't!<eos> I didn't!
Hey!<eos> Get away from him now, you filthy, little gobshites.<eos> It's me you're lookin' for, right?<eos> And honestly, boys, I don't know how you keep finding me.<eos> Truly, I don't.
Met his end manning that 12-pounder in the chapel there.<eos> But Bowie died in the barracks, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> - I had an idea, Mr. Quincannon.<eos> - Did you?
So what do we do now?<eos> What you doing?<eos> Putting stuff away.<eos> Emily asked me to help out, so, uh... I'm helping out.<eos> Emily did?
Nope.<eos> No, I-I didn't see him.<eos> It's the darndest thing.<eos> Actually, you did see him.<eos> I did?
Jesse? You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> Jesus.<eos> That's right.<eos> You did.
I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
Yeah.<eos> Yes, my father took me there when I was younger.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> The air smelled like cinnamon.<eos> It did, didn't it?
This world.<eos> Humans understand little about justice.<eos> Justice must be absolute.<eos> I'd hoped that you'd see justice the same way your mother did.<eos> The way I do.
It had nothing to do with you or Supergirl.<eos> It's just obvious how much she loves you and...<eos> I think, she knows<eos> - how much you love her...<eos> - Maybe I didn't.
Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No.<eos> No one does.
And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
How long were you guys together?<eos> Couple months.<eos> I think you're better off anyway.<eos> I didn't see you guys together.<eos> Apparently, he didn't either.
Burn it off.<eos> Do whatever you have to do.<eos> Just get it off me! I told you it can only be removed with the Ceremonia de Desgracias.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just do it!
Did you make a phone call a couple hours ago<eos> - to a Dr. Kukra?<eos> - Is that a real name?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And did you?
No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
- I know as much as all you do.<eos> - So you'd say?<eos> - If you knew something?<eos> - Aye.<eos> But I don't.
It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
You're not the first and you won't be the last, love.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The world is full of men like Rory.<eos> Promise the earth to get what they want.<eos> Well, he did.
I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know. But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
Jasper's actually smiling.<eos> Clarke. Let it go.<eos> We can't just leave.<eos> It's not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
Your word?<eos> I served your father with distinction for 20 years.<eos> You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.<eos> This has got nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course it does.
I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does?
- Did they suddenly sprout?<eos> Mm. Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why'd you tell him?<eos> Why didn't you?
You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.<eos> Hodgins did.
So, you let a known drug user work in your office defending clients.<eos> It wasn't right, but I understood.<eos> If she lost a case, a family got broken up or a child's hopes for the future destroyed.<eos> She needed an outlet.<eos> We all do.
That's cool.<eos> And it should be cool. And I want it to be cool.<eos> But it's not cool yet.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, I don't.
I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
And I will get myself checked out, I swear, but right now, I just need to get to my mother.<eos> She's probably worried sick about me.<eos> Do you remember what kind of dog it was?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't.
He was in the helicopter that night.<eos> He killed the king and got Diana.<eos> Meisner has Diana?<eos> I said he got her, not that he has her.<eos> - Then who does?
Thanksgiving has always meant sharing the bounty of our rich land, especially turkey.<eos> But the one thing we will not be sharing this holiday is Drumstick or Cranberry.<eos> Catherine actually personally chose those names, didn't you, honey?<eos> - Um, yes, I did.<eos> - Yes, she did.
God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
Nothing is there.<eos> I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse. Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> Oh, my God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.
This is it. 1957.<eos> Oh, my God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then I did.
She grabbed it just before she fucking died!<eos> She knew I would figure it out, and it would lead me<eos> - back to you, Craig!<eos> - I didn't kill her.<eos> I didn't...
I have one seat on Flight 47 that's leaving right now.<eos> - If you hurry, I can... - Oh, no, I can't do that flight.<eos> I strongly encourage you to get on the earlier flight unless you want to spend the night next to that guy.<eos> Why did he fall asleep on that wet spot?<eos> He didn't.
The quilters can be a little antisocial.<eos> But I'd steer clear of that scrapbooking aisle.<eos> Those women will murder you while humming to themselves.<eos> You know, I appreciate the gesture, guys, but you really don't have to do this.<eos> No, I do.
- I do want to kiss you.<eos> - No, no. - Yes, I do. - No.<eos> Please sit down. - You want to, too. - You must...<eos> - Oh. - I can tell.<eos> - I don't!
Remember the first four.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Tell me you don't want to say "I love you."<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
Well, might be his only option. I'll go and talk to them.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why is dad really here? I don't know.<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> No, you don't.
- Is that so?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And you can call my attending and get me fired, but that girl is gonna keep her leg because I had the balls - to stand up for her!<eos> - Heather. I'm not gonna stand here and get scolded like I'm in high school.<eos> We did the right thing.
Look, you love Caroline and you don't want her to die.<eos> I understand, because that is the way I feel about Nora and she will, we all will, if you do not get out of our way!<eos> Stay and I'll do everything I can to protect you from this woman.<eos> You don't stand a chance against her!<eos> - None of us do!
Do you honestly think i would do anything to put Caroline at risk?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Stefan, go.<eos> We can take it from here.<eos> How we doing?
Excuse me?<eos> You know, for your little side business.<eos> Where you sell the answers to desperate kids for money.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No, I do.
- Traded her for what?<eos> - I traded her for that fucking bell!<eos> You traded my daughter for a goddamn bell?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
For fancy company.<eos> Well, with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress,<eos> I bet you'd look real pretty in it.<eos> You got a wife Mr. Clay?<eos> Yes, I do.
Don't look so surprised.<eos> I never forget a face.<eos> I'm surprised you remember me.<eos> The owner of a major league team usually doesn't remember the batboy.<eos> The good owners do.
Daddy's right here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> You still want to convince yourselves there's nothing wrong with her?<eos> I'm guessing, by your expression, it doesn't look good.<eos> It doesn't.
That feel okay?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> No, water's fine.<eos> Notice how normal she is with April, and then... and then her dad walks in.<eos> Hey. How you doing, kiddo?
- Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
I suppose you think, uh, I should be okay with letting him walk.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> You made a deal with him.<eos> Yes, in order to save Elizabeth, I made a deal with the devil of the day.<eos> I did.
- I know, and I'm angry about that.<eos> because if she'd behaved differently, she wouldn't be in this position.<eos> But she is.<eos> And no matter how we feel, I think we have to do something about it.<eos> I don't.
Pool's drained, leaks are fixed, generator's running, and I'm meeting my buddies.<eos> Why, Jay?<eos> Why you have to go out?<eos> It's a hurricane outside!<eos> I just do.
Sorry...<eos> Jess.<eos> That's what's wrong with you people.<eos> You think you own the bloody<eos> Actually, I do.
It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets inside the magazine.<eos> Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.<eos> I was able to lift them during a process called cyanoacrylate fuming, ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.<eos> Eric... did you get a hit?<eos> Indeed I did.
That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't?
- Do you ever think about that?<eos> - Oh, yeah, but I want to finish my fellowship.<eos> Oh. Well, you met Jeff here.<eos> You must have a lot of good memories here.<eos> Of course I do.
I thought it was really elegant, audrey.<eos> I liked the wind imagery.<eos> I felt your narrator's excitement. When the weather patterns changed unexpectedly.<eos> You don't agree, mr. Solloway?<eos> No, charlette, I don't.
Really, mike?<eos> Because a woman who cries sexual assault. Might just be looking for attention?<eos> Or... or maybe she was confused.<eos> Maybe she really did want it. Maybe she did.<eos> Maybe she did,
Okay, hang another, mama. All lines wide open.<eos> Risa, call O.R. again. Tell them we need a room now!<eos> - Is she dying? !<eos> - She's in distress. She's not dying.<eos> You people did this to her.
So the decision I made was, in fact, an emotional one.<eos> And if Jocelyn had died...<eos> She didn't die.<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
All right.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Why are you out so soon?<eos> I thought you had something serious to talk about.<eos> We did.
Thank you.<eos> A cytokine storm?<eos> Isn't it a good thing to be young and healthy, since you have a high level of immunity?<eos> It's ironic, but having a high level of immunity can cause a problem, too.<eos> Then what do we do?
You're the girlfriend-- Sherlock's.<eos> Yeah, you moved in with him about a year before I left.<eos> Uh, I'm not his girlfriend.<eos> And I didn't realize you two knew each other.<eos> We don't.
- Yes.<eos> - Thank you, Dean.<eos> Do you agree with the way the students handled Imogen's op-ed?<eos> I do.<eos> And if you didn't?
Yes.<eos> So that didn't end well, did it?<eos> No.<eos> I heard from Lucca, they don't want to settle.<eos> They don't.
♪ Than you. ♪<eos> Did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with FEPA?<eos> - Did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with FEPA?<eos> You know you can't ask me that.<eos> You did, didn't you?
I didn't want to shame his memory any further.<eos> I didn't kill the other four.<eos> I swear.<eos> Elizabeth, do you still have the note that he left you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Nothing was taken?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Does she have a boyfriend?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> - But she did?
My bad.<eos> You didn't stop when she said no, did you, Will?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't stop.<eos> I didn't.
We're not gonna talk about that.<eos> Listen, so I was thinking maybe, uh, Jack should stay with us tonight.<eos> That is a good idea.<eos> I mean, 'cause our couch doesn't have bullet holes in it.<eos> It does not.
You have anxiety issues.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You always look like a deer in headlights, like you're waiting for something terrible to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
We couldn't very well just stick her in a cell.<eos> Mom.<eos> Who owns the drugs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Thank you.<eos> I believe you know him. And his family.<eos> Well, he's 20, so we can charge him as an adult.<eos> The question is, how do you know him?<eos> I don't, personally.
Lie!<eos> If you don't want to go out with me, you... You... you could just say so.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> Whatever you say. I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> You didn't, Gordon.
What the hell?<eos> What happened?<eos> Who did this? Dr. Savetti, pressure on these wounds.<eos> Risa, page surgery for a T.T.A.<eos> Who did this? !
Drop what you're doing and get the hell out of the way now.<eos> Pinkney, suction. - Yes, sir. - Move.<eos> Move, move. Move, move. Stop barking!<eos> You don't have the authority to...<eos> The hell I don't. Enough!
- It's a Mexican rodent killer.<eos> 'Cause a mouse can only take three steps before it drops dead.<eos> You can't get it in the States anymore.<eos> Not... not legally.<eos> But Gordon did.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are... what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, your mom said that you might need some help.<eos> Yeah, we do actually.
Justina's a foster kid?<eos> Justina is Lizzie.<eos> The friend that she told me about was her.<eos> ♪ There is no controlling this ♪ Thanks a lot for telling Zoey that I cheated on you.<eos> I didn't.
It's how they should.<eos> ♪ Morning breaks ♪ You okay?<eos> It wasn't until you... that I could be with someone... the way you're supposed to, without the shame and the guilt, at least in the moment.<eos> I don't want to regret that.<eos> I don't.
I'm not inviting her.<eos> I thought it'd be uncomfortable.<eos> Yeah. I get it.<eos> I mean, we're gonna have to get used to seeing each other with other people, right?<eos> Do we?
- You've got nothing.<eos> I've got the... The Hero Sword!<eos> ♪ That's right, the one king to unite them all ♪<eos> You don't have the bearer of the one true...<eos> Oh, I most certainly do. Don't I, Jester?
Ha!<eos> Seems Galavant has brought the wrong covered dish to the potluck dinner.<eos> Ha! They're kind of attacking everyone, our men included.<eos> Well, you make a cake, you break a few eggs.<eos> So, how do we do this?
Oh, much better.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I just had these done.<eos> You know, you have no idea what that sword makes you do.<eos> Of course I do...
Remember how I was telling you about that guy, whose life you ruined?<eos> You know, how you turned his fiance into a zombie, then cost him his job, killed a bunch of kids that were close to him, kidnapped him, locked him in a freezer and tortured him, before finally stabbing him to death?<eos> Yeah, this is him.<eos> I thought the worst part about this whole thing was forgetting the people I loved, or the people that loved me.<eos> But maybe nobody did.
Temporary insanity, that's all it was.<eos> I'm done with old me.<eos> You can trust me with almost anything.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.
Hey, little sister.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Garrett?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How you doing, Tess?
I bet you have a pet.<eos> A dog. Monty.<eos> Does Monty have a butler?<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
If Silicon Beach was around when I was younger,<eos> I'm pretty sure I would have crushed it.<eos> I'm pretty sure you would have crashed it.<eos> But I am an idea man. You know this about me.<eos> I do, but not necessarily for complex computer programs.
Come on, you know where it is.<eos> Let's go get it right now.<eos> - I didn't steal it.<eos> But I'm gonna find out who did.<eos> And when I do...
No, wait a minute.<eos> You fantasized about who it would be, D.B. No, I didn't, no, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you investigated it.<eos> No, I did not investigate.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Hey, wait. Before you go...<eos> Aunt Meg called.<eos> We're going to dinner at the inn tomorrow night.<eos> Do we have to go?<eos> Yes, we do.
- What if we die before then?<eos> - There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
- Yes. - Chicago.<eos> So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.<eos> I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.<eos> I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.<eos> Who does?
- Right there.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> - WINSTON: Oh, no, no. - NICK:<eos> Telling the truth works.<eos> SCHMIDT: Yeah, it did.
Dying is easy.<eos> You know what's hard?<eos> Not being there for your son.<eos> I want to.<eos> I do.
Private jet is outside restricted airspace, but not for long.<eos> Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn. Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
Meng Zhou was in our police station earlier this morning.<eos> He was pretty ticked to find out about the scam his dead buddies had been running at Willowbrook.<eos> Guess they never told him.<eos> No.<eos> They did.
Well, they're being vague with details, stalling information.<eos> Which, in your professional opinion means what?<eos> I think they're trying to pull a surprise witness. Someone whose testimony will support Jesper's alleged activities.<eos> I don't know who it is.<eos> I do.
It's considered a safe house for supernatural travelers.<eos> Oscar came upon it when he was looking for the Phoenix Stone.<eos> Fine. Just tell him to pack it up, huff it back to Virginia to a pile of bricks called the Armory.<eos> - Did you just say the Armory?<eos> - Yes, I did.
We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon.<eos> I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
A film of great importance to the Führer.<eos> Think about what that means, Joe.<eos> Think how proud your father will be.<eos> My father doesn't even know I work for you.<eos> Of course he does.
So this was the man.<eos> You recognize him.<eos> I think so.<eos> I don't know. You don't know.<eos> You don't...
Are you sure about that?<eos> You broke into my locker?<eos> Gaston, I want to help you move on.<eos> If you still have this book, it must mean something to you.<eos> Of course it does.
Calista and I will go in together.<eos> I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> He wants to talk to you, alone.<eos> 'Course he does.
Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
I seen the same thing with old Mr Wemmick.<eos> Grey, it was, like death.<eos> He lost the leg, of course.<eos> Well, I warned him, did he listen?<eos> They never do, do they?
You'll try harder next time, right?<eos> I was trying to draw a walk.<eos> You can't be a hero if you get on base like that.<eos> I don't need to be a hero.<eos> You don't?
Absolutely.<eos> What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine. I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.

What's the problem, Tommy?<eos> Milan knows that you followed me to his warehouse the other night.<eos> You just gonna stand there and look stupid or are you gonna be real for a change?<eos> Look, man, you don't understand what I'm trying to...<eos> No, you don't.
I hope so.<eos> Ruiz hit me up about that payment.<eos> He ain't never gonna reach his full potential unless we set up a meet, you know, between he and Milan.<eos> You know how that motherfucker is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Call you in the morning.<eos> Tommy, I didn't expect to see you back tonight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A few days ago, you asked me if I was one of you.<eos> I did.
You are an accessory to murder.<eos> You have no option but to release me, and you know it.<eos> Well, let me, uh, patch you up at least before you go, huh?<eos> [Gasp] No. Uh, they do not improve your health, I believe.<eos> Shit, Probyn. What does?
There's been a string of those murders, gory, like some homemade spinal tap voodoo shit.<eos> What's all that got to do with Abby?<eos> Bitch thinks I'm the mole.<eos> Since when have you cared about what Finnerman thinks of you?<eos> - I don't.
My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
Finnerman brought her in to continue working on decoding the Hunter language.<eos> The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez.<eos> This is coming from Regan.<eos> How do we know it's not compromised?<eos> We don't.
I gotta take care of something.<eos> Just a quick work trip.<eos> I'll see you as soon as I get back.<eos> - Flynn, you don't understand.<eos> - I do.
Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
That's why I love LA.<eos> Hey, way back in the day, I was all up and down the Strip.<eos> Now I'm excited if I get up and down the step.<eos> Sophie, Max didn't come home last night, but we don't know that she got laid.<eos> Oh, she did...
Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Ah, damn right you did.<eos> I fucking knew it.<eos> - [Laughs] - I knew you would.<eos> I knew you would do it.<eos> I did.
What's wrong?<eos> You have been on another planet for the entire day.<eos> Ryan is my friend.<eos> I do not like to fight with my friends.<eos> I do not.
Have you been to Italy?<eos> Yes, I was, but it was-- it was full, too I finished firing their agency, and...<eos> I'll be here.<eos> I'm going to take some meetings.<eos> I kinda sort of-- done.
No. But if I get better and I keep winning fights, Then it gets better.<eos> Just fucking say.<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> Good.<eos> Do not.
Oh. Sure.<eos> Uh, excuse me, Captain, Lieutenant.<eos> So, Calderon might have been one of the loose ends.<eos> Do you believe there are more?<eos> Yes, I do.
Let me drink first.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Is it strong enough for both of us?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I do.
On that note, shall we head out to the garden?<eos> Come on, James.<eos> James.<eos> James, we need to investigate this death.<eos> No. No, we don't.
No.<eos> She had Jez by the short and curlies.<eos> She would've let him take the fall.<eos> Agatha, not now. You didn't know her, Agatha.<eos> I did.
Shut up you coward<eos> Archie... they'll wake up...<eos> We'll wake them...<eos> They'll wake up!<eos> Please don't
You chew it too? No, of course not<eos> Go spit it out!<eos> For real?<eos> I swear I don't<eos> No... he doesn't... both of us...
I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped?<eos> Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
I was right about Nolan.<eos> First time for everything, right?<eos> Ah, I'm glad you were.<eos> I like a storybook ending.<eos> Who doesn't?
' 'you will find that taking a life is an unbearable weight'.<eos> Every second. Every minute.<eos> Every hour. Every day.<eos> ♪ The sickness lies and waits a constant reminder of what you did.<eos> And how you did it.
- Yeah.<eos> This woman, she had to explore the world and bang a bunch of dudes to finally find her perfect O.<eos> See, I read it that she had it all along.<eos> She didn't need to go anywhere.<eos> No, she did.

I was scared you were hiding from me.<eos> Were you hiding from me?<eos> What is it?<eos> If it's something I did or said...<eos> No, oh... oh, my God, you... you didn't do anything.
How did it go?<eos> We went out for drinks, and he introduced me to the Moscow Mule.<eos> It's a delightful cocktail.<eos> Sounds like you had a nice time.<eos> Yes, I did.
Coffee's ready.<eos> Scrambled okay?<eos> Yes, that would be nice.<eos> I can't believe I slept so late, but then I remembered that we had quite a workout.<eos> Yes, we did.
Awesome.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you see EW?<eos> I just did.
Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music] I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine.<eos> You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
And what possible reason would he have to do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Maybe these, uh, these shirts, these shoes here, oh, look at that, these magazines.<eos> I like to read the articles.<eos> Right, don't we all?
Yeah, she's sleeping like a baby.<eos> Whew, turns out that Aubrey's advice did the trick.<eos> What exactly did you say?<eos> Well, I told her, you know, if she's scared, you just go right up to the closet, and you tell the monster, "If you don't stop, my Dad is gonna put a cap in your butt."<eos> No, you did not, Booth.
Each is a piece of my soul.<eos> That's what photography is, Angela.<eos> It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.<eos> Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?<eos> You don't.
Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.<eos> Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.<eos> The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?<eos> Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
That nest of vipers is all that stands between you and your loved ones.<eos> You're the murdering son of a bitch.<eos> Patrick, no.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Did you?
A lot of people don't understand how you did what you did.<eos> It was wrong.<eos> It was necessary.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Went down with what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just here if you want to talk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't.
The descriptions of this new weapon's devastating and awesome power stagger the imagination.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> If Truman's hand was forced, then he had to.<eos> He did it.
- Yes.<eos> You won't, of course.<eos> - You don't need me anymore at all. - Yes, of course I do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Neither of you does.
I can't get a single fry in my mouth!<eos> Aah! I didn't ask for a beer!<eos> Throwing beers is the only thing that breaks up the monotony.<eos> Owning a boat sucks.<eos> It does.
What's happening, daddy?<eos> That man is on trial because he did a bad thing to a seal.<eos> I like seals.<eos> I don't like that man.<eos> No one does.
Old savings bonds?<eos> Insurance policy?<eos> It's just one stupid piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is my life.<eos> Well, you don't have to sort through all this stuff now.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll get you five years, out in two.<eos> It's a good deal.<eos> I would take it.<eos> I'd put the gun down. Put it down.<eos> Do it!
Oh, I thought you were smarter than that. What are you talking about?<eos> You aided and abetted a known terrorist and mass murderer.<eos> Not to mention fraud charges.<eos> I have no authority to cut you a deal.<eos> I do.
- We got to stop him.<eos> - No, Walker, Morrison.<eos> No, Morrison doesn't exist.<eos> - I've looked...<eos> - The fuck he doesn't!
Seizure boy here... thinks that...<eos> - Is sure.<eos> - Is sure, is sure that Supershock is insane, and he killed the Senator, because someone wrote a... "To whom it may concern" letter.<eos> Because Janice wrote it.<eos> She did.
So each brick supports the others.<eos> A flying buttress imbedded in the dome itself.<eos> Precisely.<eos> How do you know it will hold?<eos> I don't.
You have nothing to be sorry for.<eos> I knew why you were sent here.<eos> It wasn't your choice. What else could you do?<eos> How did you know I wouldn't betray you?<eos> I didn't.
Rayna can't die again.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> The wounds from her sword... It's linked her to her victims.<eos> If Rayna dies one last time...<eos> So does Stefan.
"She's taken care of."<eos> Yeah, she's taken care of.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, so you didn't kill her?<eos> I did.
Thought you enjoyed it.<eos> She should've gave it up.<eos> Blood on the shotgun we found in your stolen squad is a match for Franklin Haynes.<eos> Sounds like you know everything.<eos> I don't.
It's too bloody dangerous.<eos> But...<eos> You're not cut out for it, OK?<eos> You've got no idea what it's like being on the run.<eos> What, and you do?
It's a different world.<eos> I can do them on the cheap for you.<eos> 10K apiece. But they won't get you through Immigration.<eos> Oh, that's OK. We don't need to get through Immigration.<eos> Actually, we do.
We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dixon was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
Okay. This is crazy.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Losing our son destroyed our life.<eos> You don't feel the same after that.<eos> Nothing does.
You did the right thing.<eos> Not for Jack.<eos> Not in time.<eos> Sorry I ruined your birthday.<eos> You didn't.
Whose place is this?<eos> Yours.<eos> Or it will be after you sign the lease.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> I do.
Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality.<eos> So fuck God.<eos> He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.<eos> Please tell me I didn't say all of that out loud.<eos> Shit. I did.
NowTheGamesBegin.mist.<eos> This is where it led us.<eos> We have no idea what the answer is.<eos> We don't even have a question.<eos> I do.
You're right. You're right.<eos> I know someone is watching me. I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?<eos> Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,<eos> Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.<eos> I really don't.
I wouldn't be here without her, so...<eos> I'm here.<eos> You don't have to like me.<eos> Oh, don't you worry.<eos> We don't.
And you're a better person.<eos> And I think that if he'd met you, he wouldn't be so sure that it's me.<eos> But you're the one that they say shows up every single time, it's you.<eos> I want to be the one.<eos> I do.
You know what that is.<eos> I thought I was all fucked up in the head.<eos> I did not want to be gay.<eos> Do you get that, Ray?<eos> Do you?
- Hey. Remember when we went out to the hot springs in Indio?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> We got caught fucking in the hot tub, and that guy got really mad.<eos> I do.
I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit? - Do they?<eos> - My son did.
Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.
Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was born of the virgin Mary, suffered death and was buried, rose again from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> I do.<eos> I think we're the instruments for each other's enlightenment, man.<eos> In here. Fifteen minutes, Donovan.<eos> How you doing?
He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do. - No, we don't.
I stole the money from him.<eos> He stole it back from us.<eos> He got his four million from the insurance, and I just wanted mine.<eos> No one needed to get hurt.<eos> But they always do, don't they, Mick?
It ain't pretty.<eos> She climbed into the bathtub fucking high on drugs and passed out.<eos> There but for the grace of God, you know?<eos> She didn't mean to kill herself, you know?<eos> But she did.
I deserve to be more than just a janitor.<eos> I don't wanna hear that shit.<eos> You know what, Terry, I don't think you want to know<eos> - what's really going on.<eos> - No, I don't.
Not yet... need a few minutes for the spoof fax to go through.<eos> It needs to propagate through their system.<eos> No one in the world uses fax anymore except cops.<eos> Half of me wants it to be him.<eos> Half of me doesn't.
That doesn't sound like a very convincing battle cry.<eos> Ruby, what's going on?<eos> When we were on our trek, Dorothy asked me what I've been looking for this whole time.<eos> And I told her that didn't know.<eos> Well, do you?
You left without saying anything.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.
- What's that?<eos> That's how many times you've talked about Henry and how many times you've talked about me or us during dinner.<eos> What are you doing counting?<eos> It's just that I really made an effort tonight.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- Hassan El-Sayed?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That's why we got it.<eos> - You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.
They were a pair of sea monsters, one a six-headed giant and the other a massive whirlpool.<eos> They guarded two sides of a narrow strait.<eos> To avoid one, sailors would have to sail too close by the other.<eos> So how did Odysseus prevail?<eos> He didn't.
Get into the reception right now. Hide in the reception.<eos> We have no control over it all.<eos> So whatever destiny that you think or believe you have or have led...<eos> Mike.<eos> What do we do?
What?<eos> Hey! If my daughter is having sex, I should be the first to know!<eos> Have you any idea how dodgy that sounds?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - No. I don't.
I used to fancy myself a good judge of men, but I can't think of many people who would do what you did for a stranger.<eos> I didn't do it for her.<eos> I suppose you want something in return.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Miss Skerrett, I do.
If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.<eos> You do?
So why fight it?<eos> Just give in.<eos> Why hurt Melissa?<eos> She only wanted to save her marriage.<eos> They all do.
No.<eos> Do you have Ventolin?<eos> No.<eos> I get asthma... when I get too hot.<eos> No, you don't, Chelsea.
Mum?<eos> Where's Harry?<eos> He was... he was just here.<eos> We lost Harry, Mum.<eos> We did.
Oh, my God.<eos> Nadine must not have given it to her.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you, away from your partner.<eos> 'Cause we probably broke some laws trying to get Mateo back.<eos> You didn't. I did.
Dr. Halstead, you're not listening to me.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I've tried everything.<eos> You have nothing to lose.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why should us carry-on folk have to foot the bill for those morons who don't know how to pack? !<eos> Three weeks, I went from Edinburgh to Warsaw on two pairs of pants and a tam-o'-shanter.<eos> I'm falling asleep.<eos> - I love naps!<eos> - Who doesn't?
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh! That's so sweet.<eos> I... And I can't believe I'm finally going to prom.<eos> I can't believe I finally have a happy memory in a high-school gym.<eos> - Joe did that to you?
Sounds like you need a drink.<eos> I'm not sure that's a good idea.<eos> I used to have something of a --<eos> Oh, come on. I feel weird drinking alone.<eos> I don't.
This is California.<eos> Lake Superior is here, all the way across --<eos> Are you trying to take off my shoe?<eos> I thought you wanted to show me things.<eos> I do.
What's a griffin?<eos> What is... wait, what is the Griffin?<eos> The Griffin is the name of the bar that we own together, you buffoon.<eos> - You don't know the name of our bar?<eos> - Why don't we...
- The airport heist. I'm way ahead of you, already read the reports.<eos> The crime took place on US soil so we're not obligated to include the Chinese in our investigation.<eos> But as a courtesy, the bureau is allowing a detective from Hong Kong to... consult.<eos> We don't have time to look after a Chinese cop.<eos> - But you do.
Because he's brilliant.<eos> And they want to exploit his work.<eos> No, because he's a killer.<eos> He killed three people.<eos> Actually, I do.
".. I see no destination."<eos> "You don't ask my condition."<eos> "I think about you."<eos> "I can't forget the past moments, listen to me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"
"I think about you."<eos> "I can't forget the past moments, listen to me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"<eos> "My tears prick me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"
- OK?<eos> I want to help.<eos> - Well, I'll swing by and make sure that cat of yours is fed.<eos> She doesn't really like men.<eos> Well, who does?
And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
- Oh, that sounds great!<eos> - Good. Hey, guys, you want to come play laser tag?<eos> No, no, no, Robin.<eos> Uh, they're all busy and have fulfilling lives!<eos> Well, I don't.
Remember when we used to talk about movies and politics?<eos> Mm. Well, the Ax-man is rockin' it on all cylinders.<eos> My boss loves me.<eos> I thought you said he hated you.<eos> He did.
Ah! Now we don't have to use that stupid broomstick.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> We always have so many random pieces.<eos> We never know what they go to.<eos> But this time, we did it.
Does the FBI have a steering committee, sir?<eos> - A...<eos> - Steering committee.<eos> - No.<eos> - Does the
Commissioner, that's enough.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, Frank, do you remember why I invited you up here?<eos> You know,<eos> I don't.
- None of that matters.<eos> - Said there was a storm - and something hit my head. - It was a long time ago for me.<eos> How severe was that injury?<eos> Did they induce a coma?<eos> - No, they did not.
What is it?<eos> A body was found in the Potomac.<eos> It's being brought to the lab.<eos> Well, that's not good, because that means the local PD moved the victim from the crime scene, and I know how much you hate that.<eos> I do.
We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
Don't they even see what they're doing to me?<eos> They don't see it.<eos> They never have.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I really do.
Tick-tock.<eos> Almost audition time.<eos> - Huh? You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?<eos> You didn't mean that, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Housekeeping will take it from here.<eos> Put some mints on the pillow.<eos> You know, I am getting a little sick of Seely always acting like he's better than us.<eos> I mean, just 'cause you get a commendation from the mayor and back-to-back marksmanship awards doesn't mean you're a better cop.<eos> It kind of does.
Babysitting punks like Marcus?<eos> Mentoring rookies, like me, and yeah, some like Marcus.<eos> Most rookies have a sense of respect for the job.<eos> You did.<eos> Well... maybe Marcus does, too, in his own way.
No, Vince, we do not need anything from Costco.<eos> Ten years on the job.<eos> I never had to kick in a door until it was my own.<eos> Does that ankle look swollen to you?<eos> They both do.
Say it!<eos> I want to hear you say it.<eos> You're not taking the scar.<eos> I have a plan!<eos> You always do.
Bonnie, you know how I... that it just wasn't...<eos> I met someone.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It sounded like you said you met someone.<eos> I did.
No, he didn't.<eos> Well, we did.<eos> Wait, is that what this is about?<eos> Do you think that I want to be with him?<eos> Well, do you?
Kirsten?<eos> Um, Cameron, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, any one of them could have wanted Anna out of their way.<eos> My parents had another daughter?<eos> Your father did with his first wife, Elizabeth.
But it was just your name in the log, not mine.<eos> Is this going where I think it's going?<eos> Look, I... I don't want you to feel compromised.<eos> Good.<eos> Neither do I.
Brought us out of the Cold War, strong ties to the China, managed to stay friends with Germany even after the NSA shit.<eos> Now the Shaw leaks.<eos> Well, sounds to me like someone sees an opening.<eos> Yeah, Chris.<eos> I do.
I don't want him open that long.<eos> Invites a whole host of complications.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about this?<eos> We do the valve replacement and the lung transplant at the same time.
That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
Okay. After I do this, go get the doc and tell her to, um...<eos> Tell her to bring me back, if she can.<eos> If not... no hard feelings, okay?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
General Walker. I have something to say!<eos> Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas?<eos> I didn't really take to the city.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does.
I just... when did... When did everything change?<eos> Just answer me... answer me one thing. What...<eos> Was John F. Kennedy reelected in 1964?<eos> What the fuck you want to know about Kennedy for?<eos> I just do.
So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
- I've just been informed that you help yourself to the company profits at your own discretion.<eos> So would you mind telling me how much you paid yourself this week?<eos> - Yes, I would mind, very much.<eos> - Okay, well, I need to know.<eos> - No, you don't.
All the time.<eos> When did that start?<eos> I don't think it ever really stopped.<eos> Um, maybe they cut back when we were born, but ever since you left, they just totally don't care, and with all my stuff and Tricia...<eos> Well, you don't, do you?
It's nighttime, anyway.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather not.<eos> I dare you to take them off.<eos> You don't wanna see it. It's not...<eos> Maybe I do.
Sorry. Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
Ah, yes, you'll recall this happened last year.<eos> Even my masseuse has a manuscript.<eos> - Oh, no, no, I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> Well, I-I do...
I didn't want you to go chasing after him.<eos> I wasn't gonna go chasing after him.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> I know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
This is happening.<eos> You can tell us everything about Mark.<eos> By everything, I mean everything about Mark.<eos> I want all the details.<eos> I, however, do not.
It makes no difference.<eos> You're still a kid, things are more complicated for adults.<eos> Maybe mom thinks I'm a failure.<eos> Maybe you do too.<eos> I don't, dad.
The Secretary of the Navy's daughter has been abducted.<eos> My God.<eos> That's awful.<eos> And you think I had something to do with it?<eos> Did you?
I think there was somebody in that house, not Alec Moros, somebody else.<eos> Danny.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I thought you didn't know where Danny was.<eos> I didn't.
Stepping out of line isn't gonna bring Matthew back any faster.<eos> I didn't want anything to do with this case to begin with.<eos> Oh, now it's my fault?<eos> I didn't say it was your fault.<eos> No, actually, you just kind of did.
It could become a problem that I put up those posts.<eos> Now we'll both go down together.<eos> Anyway, I have all the evidence, so it's done.<eos> Young Gon is the one who started stalking and writing posts first.<eos> He did it all first.
And so he turned the screws on my family.<eos> Threats... and promises.<eos> After the trial, Henry awarded me the Boleyn family lands.<eos> And Henry knew the chambermaid's story was a lie.<eos> Of course he did.
For her sake and yours. I'm sorry for my behavior just now.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> That's quite all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You deserve better.<eos> That's quite all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one does.
- Is this all right?<eos> - Um, yeah.<eos> I don't usually go to bars.<eos> - Oh? Well, I do.<eos> So... Yeah, whatever, I do.
- Okay, sure.<eos> - So your Aunt Sylvia, um...<eos> - she has breast cancer.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - You do?
We'll figure it out.<eos> If you didn't do it, then you're not losing your job.<eos> I have to go to work.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.
Are we seriously gonna do this now?<eos> We were supposed to do it yesterday but you didn't even try.<eos> So if you want, you can blow bubbles...<eos> I did try. I showed up.<eos> You didn't.
As far as the court of law is concerned, any crime you committed in the past has no relevance.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I have to testify.<eos> No, you don't. No.<eos> Yes, I do!
- Peter's not here.<eos> - It's you I've come to see.<eos> Do you remember Clarity Winlove?<eos> No.<eos> - No, I don't.
Help me!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Harriet!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Do something!
Dylan, I'm... I'm glad.<eos> You are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I get it, the... the two of you.<eos> I-I really do.
Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
But we already got enough to ring you and Jesse up for the murder of Noah Johnson.<eos> "We"?<eos> What's up with this "we"?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The hell you don't.
That is so not true.<eos> And I've never lolled in my life.<eos> Okay. Tell me the name of our professor.<eos> Oh, come on, you don't remember his name.<eos> I do.
But I need one more favor.<eos> I'll announce tomorrow.<eos> Stand by my side.<eos> Sure.<eos> What do I do now?
- Okay, I'm a memory.<eos> Make your lunches!<eos> Have a good day at school, and I love... all of you.<eos> I didn't have the heart to tell her it was Saturday.<eos> I never did.
No one cares, freshman.<eos> We're not gonna talk about last night?<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Oh, you're acting like I attacked you.<eos> Because you did.
- Yeah.<eos> He's a Grimm.<eos> We're not exactly taught to trust them.<eos> Does he know what's going on between us?<eos> He does.
So, I jump out of the way.<eos> And lucky there was no cars coming. But Don, oh!<eos> He said a funny, funny thing.<eos> You remember it? No.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
And miss an all-nighter?<eos> I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay. You said you had something.<eos> I do.
You're in danger!<eos> Ma'am, I need to talk to Kayla.<eos> You need to talk to me, Brandon.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
It would make me a traitor to my people.<eos> You would take a hit politically.<eos> The alternative is war with India.<eos> Do you think your people would prefer that?<eos> Yes, I do.
It might tag a section as plagiarism when, in fact, it's just a phrase in common usage.<eos> For example, in one paper they flagged, "there's not enough money to go around," or "according to conventional wisdom"<eos> as plagiarized, when in fact they're just sort of clichés.<eos> Unoriginal, but not plagiarized.<eos> - So, what do I do?
Well, thank you anyway.<eos> I don't want to make this any more confrontational than it has to be.<eos> So, please, just have a seat right here.<eos> I have several questions I think the grand jury would like to hear the answers to, um, but I understand that you have a right to invoke spousal privilege.<eos> - I do.
So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
They shoved a mic in my face.<eos> You know, if you were a work of art... and I'm not saying you aren't... you would be a study in...<eos> Oh, please, don't try to define me, okay?<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> - No, but I do.
Let's just say, she's Laura without the moral compass.<eos> Jeez. At our wedding she took off with a case of whiskey and a valet parker.<eos> She was 16!<eos> Mmm. How did she come up?<eos> She didn't.
We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything.<eos> Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine. But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
Alexis, I would never hurt you.<eos> This isn't what you think.<eos> What the hell is your game, Hayley?<eos> Believe me, you don't want to know.<eos> Neither does your father.
Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.<eos> How many of these things do we got to do...?<eos> We got to fix that...<eos> Might have acquired a quick infusion of cash.<eos> He did.
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better.<eos> I... I really, really do.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
I don't need to be on my step-daddy's insurance.<eos> You know, actually, I think that's great.<eos> I think it's great that y-you want to be independent, Norman.<eos> I think that shows character.<eos> Oh, really? Do you, Alex?
We'll just do it together.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - You really want to do it? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do. I really do.
"Big Nose Kate."<eos> Long-time companion of a famous gunslinger... _<eos> Not the filly I'm looking for.<eos> Think blonde. Think striking.<eos> Men always do.
The full moon is tonight.<eos> At exactly 10:36 pm, which means we have less than 5 hours.<eos> The unsub's gonna kill those kids.<eos> We have no idea where he is.<eos> Antonia does.
I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not. You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
"This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not. You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - Yes, she did.
But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
Okay, no I haven't.<eos> Just go away!<eos> I can't take that sad look. It's the same look you gave Chestnut that time he crapped on the couch.<eos> I'm fine alone; you didn't have to leave.<eos> No, I did.
- That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do. - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
Place looks nice.<eos> Changed some things around, huh?<eos> Some new pillows.<eos> I like those.<eos> No, you don't.
- Let me get you... - We should probably get the element of surprise.<eos> - Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, right?<eos> I'm just saying it's not exactly Ocean's Eleven in there.<eos> Hey, could you get this guy out of here?<eos> Sorry, I didn't...
No. Not tonight.<eos> But you want to.<eos> For real.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
He was a lot more, like, sensitive?<eos> Oh, and then there was An Arrow Through My Heart. He was a lot more manly.<eos> Oh, and then there was a time he played an alien -who didn't think he'd ever fall in love.<eos> -I love you.<eos> And then he did.
Oh, um, I have three portions of rotelle that I can make into four.<eos> That's enough. I got this.<eos> Just clean that up.<eos> Seth, they've never had an off night like this before.<eos> What do I do?
I guess she was the one that always brought the happy to the relationship?<eos> You know, she, she was a lot like your dad.<eos> Just... full of joy.<eos> How do you know about my father?<eos> I don't!
I'm a... television character!<eos> And kind of a jerk!<eos> Yeah, but, like, the total fan favorite.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Do?
Wow, glad that didn't happen, huh?<eos> Sorry girls, I didn't mean to.<eos> I don't know how to control this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> None of us do.
And I know yours.<eos> You had your own daughter beaten to reclaim the regency.<eos> And I've gone so long without a kill.<eos> I don't know why you rule out a future for us.<eos> I don't.
- I don't know.<eos> - Her whole life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That woman has a long road ahead of her.<eos> They both do.
What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Let me find my son.<eos> But every time one thing here seems almost rational, two things pop up that make absolutely no sense at all.<eos> Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
It could be days. It could be hours.<eos> But whatever it is, I'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge.<eos> So what I need to know is where you stand.<eos> I don't matter.<eos> No you don't.
Sometimes rules are good.<eos> Essential, even.<eos> It's... an allegory.<eos> So it doesn't mean anything.<eos> Maybe 20 years ago it did.
Come on.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still don't know why you did that.<eos> And I don't, either.
'You know that. Don't you? '<eos> The girl identified you, Kristian.<eos> 'My love... I would never...'<eos> It's not in my nature, you know that.<eos> Don't you?
She asked me.<eos> She begged me.<eos> It's not Matthew's fault that this happened.<eos> He knows what he's done.<eos> You both do.
OK. - OK, I won't tell her.<eos> - What I said to you in the hospital, I don't know how many times I have to apologise for that.<eos> How many times I have to tell you I don't blame you for what happened to Alice.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - But I do.
I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
And out there, we will be gods.<eos> Then I tossed my badge and said, "Have fun with your girlfriend".<eos> 'Cause he loves work so much.<eos> - But it didn't really land, you know?<eos> - I do not.
I'll remember him to my dying day.<eos> Then you must also know that your sister's eldest child was his child, too.<eos> - But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.
You never know why.<eos> You never know if they're gonna come after the family.<eos> Vince, Nancy being shot is an unbelievable tragedy, but to think your family is in danger, that's a bit of a stretch.<eos> Unless, you know something you're not sharing with me.<eos> I don't.
This isn't mine.<eos> Before the last open house, I put 27-watt bulbs in everywhere.<eos> It's a staging thing-- makes the space more inviting.<eos> I thought you said no one knew where or when the game was being played until the day of.<eos> They didn't.
- Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> For real?<eos> You got a beautiful voice, man.<eos> I do.
And then I found out from this nice doctor that you were looking for me.<eos> I was.<eos> - He gets a little confused.<eos> - Yeah. But she still loves me.<eos> Yes, I do.
I changed my number.<eos> I didn't want to be found.<eos> But it'll be good to see you now.<eos> We have so much to catch up on.<eos> Yes, we do.
And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
I hope not.<eos> It's not enough to hope though, is it?<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
How idiot Angus almost killed Anne Stringer?<eos> No one thinks you almost killed her.<eos> Wouldn't matter if I did.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Did what?
Did you hear?<eos> Gas leak.<eos> My wife, Hank Wesley, all those good people hurt because of a rusty valve.<eos> This doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
What are you grinning about?<eos> You got your money, Jesse. What money?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> You got your nurses, Mama. You did it.<eos> No, you did it, Daddy.
_<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
Something of that kind.<eos> The estate is a fine one.<eos> There is no risk.<eos> - What if I need the money?<eos> - But you don't.
Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Exactly.<eos> But... under the ultra violet light...<eos> You're to use these bills to make the payment.<eos> - Why "these" bills?<eos> - Just do it.
She's had her run here.<eos> She was your dad's pleasure chest, and then my dad honored him by keeping her here.<eos> But, yeah, I mean, we don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, we don't owe you anything, Marsha.<eos> Nobody does.
- God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
Oh, you're so right.<eos> She... I need 15 minutes to myself.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I cut a deal, and now I'm here. Wait a second. If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance to turn on someone to get out of it.<eos> They did.
No, I am not.<eos> Not bad for two people that came from nothing.<eos> I didn't come from nothing, and you know it.<eos> Bet it still feels pretty good to write that number down.<eos> Oh, it sure does.
Thank you.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.<eos> Why would you ever want to go back?<eos> I don't.
- Excuse me? - Rape? What?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Women submit applications to sleep with me.<eos> You've made that very clear to us, and also that you don't use drugs.<eos> He doesn't.
Don't mention the money! - Fucking hell, man.<eos> - Be discreet, all right?<eos> This is not the place you want people to know you're carrying around?<eos> 3,000. - Three grand?<eos> - What do I do?
Major Hamilton, would you agree Corporal Allman was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did the Army do anything to help that condition?<eos> We have considerable resources available to those who need help.<eos> Steve didn't.
On the public record, we'd look like idiotic sleazebags.<eos> It's a mildly embarrassing footnote!<eos> Some people would kill for that story.<eos> Some would kill for half a million.<eos> Yeah, someone did.
And you agree that no-one else is in this room? Yes.<eos> 'What if he comes back? ' Your words to Amil.<eos> Who were you talking about?<eos> No-one. You know who shot up your house.<eos> No, I don't.
Any idea why someone would want to kill him?<eos> My best guess, he's done something dumb.<eos> Tried to rip off the wrong person, they've come after him.<eos> The world's full of arseholes, people who deserve what they get.<eos> Todd didn't.
Government informers are everywhere.<eos> It's better now.<eos> Ten years ago you would just be taken off the street.<eos> At least in this country, we thought we would know who are enemies are.<eos> But we often don't, do we?
Oh, great.<eos> So, what'd Elaheh say?<eos> Did she tell you her husband was a car thief and a drug dealer?<eos> Well, we're not sure Elaheh knows anything, but Amil does.<eos> So, Amil does and Bahman does.
I don't know yet.<eos> You go, I'll be right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You alright?<eos> So, what do I do?
Congratulations.<eos> What?<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I... I thought you couldn't, 'cause you had...<eos> Idiopathic infertility. So did I.
I'm sure you know I'm very interested in what you have to say.<eos> I come here with mutual interests in mind.<eos> I see, so this is like a goodwill visit.<eos> But you have nothing to offer. Oh.<eos> But I do.
Your wine is that important to me, T.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> - All right, fine.<eos> - Look, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do...
They probably had a pattern of atm robberies.<eos> How do i approach this?<eos> One page at a time.<eos> Tao.<eos> Hey, buddy, how you doing?
Gus, you are very patient.<eos> With him, it's necessary.<eos> But it pays off.<eos> - Don't you think?<eos> - I do.
With him, it's necessary.<eos> But it pays off.<eos> - Don't you think?<eos> - I do.<eos> I most definitely do.
You mean the ones that come automatically online?<eos> Hey, it's not fraud.<eos> It's time-saving.<eos> And we use our own cybersecurity program ourselves.<eos> Yes, we do.
Or yours -- so maybe some of your gender assumptions Need an update. Okay, let's just talk about<eos> Detective sanchez's behavior last week.<eos> Yes, let's, because julio would take a bullet for me Or anyone else who worked here without thinking.<eos> And what does that count for in your analysis, A willingness to sacrifice for others?<eos> A lot, but so does self-control.
I want to move in together... full-time.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You had me so worried.<eos> I thought you wanted a divorce!<eos> I don't.
That, to me, is treason.<eos> Is it not to you?<eos> Now, then... I have thought long and hard about this issue, and based on what I have heard, I find there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the espionage charge; therefore, Mr. Dellinger's extradition is hereby approved.<eos> Ma'am, we have one more motion to be considered.<eos> We do?
Is that like a halo?<eos> No.<eos> That was the baby's hair.<eos> It already has hair?<eos> Sure does.
- In the vanilla powder?<eos> - Very Vanilla.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I made him that shake.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
Okay, I need you to hear me.<eos> This is not a matter of confidence, okay?<eos> It's not me. It is the bone.<eos> I am saying that, with the pelvis that I have left, I literally cannot do it.<eos> Well, you better do something.
...that I did not make a choice.<eos> I wasn't given one.<eos> I-I was forced to use the knowledge and resources I had to fulfill the oath I took to save her life...<eos> Because the door didn't open.<eos> No, it did.
You know what it's like.<eos> You... When you operate, when you control if a person breathes another breath, when... when you hold their beating heart in your hand, when you are responsible for that life, you don't see or hear or feel anything else.<eos> The rest of the world just disappears.<eos> You know that.<eos> You all do.
Yes. Yes!<eos> H-How can you ask me that?<eos> Of course I do!<eos> All I do is play it over again in my mind, trying to figure out how I could change it.<eos> Of course I do.
Edwards, what if we did a balloon catheter?<eos> Robbins was in there.<eos> I saw her.<eos> You saw her?<eos> I did.
I wanted to believe that.<eos> The patient was dying.<eos> I made the decision to save her life.<eos> You made a decision that you didn't have to make.<eos> Yes, I did.
Tell me what happened to Mary.<eos> You were there.<eos> He wrenched from her all the powers he had granted her, as if he was turning her inside out.<eos> I do not know how she survived it.<eos> But she did?
Right now?<eos> Dean Ward, what a coincidence.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I didn't know you went here.<eos> I don't.
He... or... or... or worse.<eos> My God.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I don't know why I came here.<eos> I-I don't...
It's been a while.<eos> The officers that found you two in the tunnels said you were pretty well set up.<eos> I'm sure you don't want us to be bothering you all the time.<eos> - Don't you guys have better things to do?<eos> - We do.
Is this the stuff from the gym bag?<eos> Uh, yes. I haven't processed it all yet.<eos> But Kent didn't find any prints other than the victim's.<eos> Didn't his medical records say that he had a peanut allergy?<eos> Yes, it did.
- He pulled a real disappearing act.<eos> - Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act? - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> You really don't.
Well, she ruled out the sister.<eos> Based on what?<eos> The sister was left-handed.<eos> That means she had a completely different embalming technique.<eos> Sam did the embalming.
I promise.<eos> Come on. We had fun over drinks.<eos> Right? I mean, didn't we?<eos> We ... Yeah, we did.<eos> - 'Cause I did.
Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did.
- in the bath, okay? - I'm not gonna change my mind!<eos> Whoa, whoa. Why are you yelling at me?<eos> I get it.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes. I do.
Till now.<eos> The flower... it's from the vine you were trimming back in the garden.<eos> Yes. The final ingredient.<eos> If only he knew I was growing it right under his nose.<eos> Actually, he did.
So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
He wasn't ours to kill.<eos> - Dolls...<eos> - ...has nothing to do with this curse and certainly has a serious attitude problem.<eos> I don't like him, Wynonna.<eos> Well, who does?
WILLA!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Do you remember me now?<eos> Yes, Robert.<eos> I do.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Right initials, wrong fella.<eos> Robert,<eos> - you don't want to do this.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
You gave me acid?<eos> That's just rude.<eos> Screw you, Killjoy.<eos> Hey, dumbass, you didn't read the whole warrant did you?<eos> Of course I did.
Those trouble-makers your RAC sends around the J?<eos> Please.<eos> Call it what you want, but those "visitors" who came to your planet pumped you full of that green shit.<eos> That's why you're still alive.<eos> They did no such thing.
What a jerk.<eos> Yeah, he sure can be.<eos> I'm annoyed with him, too.<eos> Did he at least tell you that I wanted to have some one-on-one time with you?<eos> No, he did not.
I mean, what else is a young, confident man to assume?<eos> Ben!<eos> I was talking about Ben.<eos> I thought we had a connection.<eos> We did!
-Me?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -No. -No.<eos> But I do have to leave.<eos> I do.
The way he transitions into a canter, it's like... like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, hello.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - 'Cause this approach does not.
Well, HS still has nuclear material in their possession.<eos> Stopping them has to be our first priority.<eos> I get it, Elizabeth!<eos> Well, I...<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
He's a young kid, he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> Now be honest, you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
They can't tell you shit.<eos> Right? Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
He's got to show me something first.<eos> If he does, who knows?<eos> Emma Harris?<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.
- Hey, I just stopped by to see how you are doing.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Can you talk some sense into my brother?<eos> I don't know if you remember my brother, David.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'll call Fitz, tell him we need it ASAP.<eos> Oh, and this one. She works at that shithole over on Franklin.<eos> - Patsy's.<eos> - Yeah, she wants to quit.<eos> - You do?
I mean, you had feelings.<eos> You had huge feelings, and you can't be expected just to turn those feelings off like some robot.<eos> Especially if you've been through something horrible together.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
And you knew this.<eos> It wasn't about you, Maggie.<eos> I am your sister.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?
We'd like to call Faiza Assaf, Your Honor.<eos> I told Annalise she can't testify.<eos> It'll buy us time.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Nadir, I need you to listen to me.<eos> You were not abandoned.<eos> Your parents did not give you up.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, actually, I do.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
Sorry, four children, using their birthdays, to the same clinic where Nadir was born.<eos> Means they have parents.<eos> Use it.<eos> You have a family out there.<eos> No, we don't.
- The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest.<eos> For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And this case wouldn't even be considered<eos> - unless there was an ulterior motive.<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - That has nothing to do with this case.<eos> - But it does, Your Honor.
If Dr. Nachmann simply uses some discretion<eos> - by pulling his blinds...<eos> - He shouldn't have to.<eos> Your Honor, we have to weigh the minor inconvenience to Dr. Nachmann against the significant public interest in preventing crime.<eos> - So we do.
Privately?<eos> Uh, certainly.<eos> I need a lawyer.<eos> You do?<eos> Or Peter does?
My father will be back shortly, when he is, you can leave for work.<eos> Bones, why are you even doing this?<eos> You don't even believe in psychology.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't see anything else, I swear.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I don't.
Everything else points to Dr. Brennan.<eos> The way the victim was clothed.<eos> The way her hair was cut.<eos> The question is, how does killing Melissa get him closer to Bones?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie.<eos> I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
- Booth, Booth!<eos> We're not making any progress,<eos> Hank and Christine are getting big fast, and we agreed to make space.<eos> Beer hat stays, and the Cocky belt buckle, - Ugh. - and you can keep those weird stones.<eos> Fine, as long as we do something with that pile of socks.
Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
Don't you think i realize that?<eos> This man has money and power.<eos> And in my experience, people with money and power Will do anything to keep it.<eos> Why would i trust you?<eos> Hmm? Your boss didn't.
You'll find them at his headquarters.<eos> I imagine this is what it feels like the first time one steps into the Batcave.<eos> This must be Mike Stratton's war journals.<eos> Last night, you asked if I had a problem with you assisting my father.<eos> I do.
To take revenge for my family.<eos> Just sorry I failed.<eos> You didn't fail.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
Then why bring me here?<eos> Why not simply make your denial and cast me out?<eos> You believe yourself a good journalist, I am sure.<eos> Good, I mean, in that you understand the moral imperative of the truth.<eos> I do.
Oh, that's so sweet!<eos> And I got these.<eos> "Enjoy all my old lipstick, you big sissy."<eos> Why did she call me a sissy?<eos> - She doesn't -- Oh!
Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
Those two can't stay mad at each other. - What did you do now? It's only a matter of time before their teary reunion.<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> Oh, here we go. - What did you do now?<eos> [playful music] - What did you do now? Grab your Kleenex.<eos> - What did you do now? ♪ ♪ - What did you do now?
You have surveillance cameras here?<eos> Think the guy who owns this place cares about his employees?<eos> Does he?<eos> I haven't met the guy.<eos> He doesn't.
We caught a bloody big bear.<eos> Wow! With your little stick?<eos> Yeah. I just grabbed him by the 'orns and stuck it in.<eos> Right. Not sure bears have horns.<eos> This one did.
It was just a business he could support his family with.<eos> Your dad was in the family business.<eos> What brought all of this on?<eos> I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist.<eos> I really didn't, Amantha.
You don't need a husband.<eos> You need a saint.<eos> Okay, we probably went too far.<eos> They want me to see somebody.<eos> Who does?
Okay.<eos> Is it weird being here?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Remember that big ol' picture we used to have up here?<eos> I do.
Some things.<eos> Not everything.<eos> I don't want to corner you, Tawney.<eos> Hem you in, put you on the spot anymore.<eos> I really don't. I...
Trey went back where?<eos> That's what I asked Bobby.<eos> He said that's all George said.<eos> He asked me to pass a message on to Daniel, too.<eos> Bobby did.
God, you resent me, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> You're filled with resentment for me.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> I do.
And by that you mean...?<eos> Do you go to school here?<eos> No, Emma, but I'm thinking about it.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Doesn't everyone?
Come on.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Well, you know how your mother is.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, well, it can have that effect on you.<eos> Then why do you keep going back there?<eos> - Do you know what I wanna do? - What do you wanna do?<eos> Do you remember that bar off Columbus where we first met?<eos> Yes, I do.
I am afraid to ask you this, but I really have to.<eos> Did we make a mistake?<eos> You and I?<eos> No.<eos> No, we didn't.
Hanna...<eos> Maybe you should go wait in the car with Alison.<eos> Seriously, we got it. Just go sit in the car.<eos> No, I need to help.<eos> Okay, because if I don't do something, then...
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So you thought that you could leave without saying goodbye?<eos> You know I hate goodbyes.<eos> I do.
When you left me, Cathy.<eos> When you broke my heart.<eos> That's sort of when the pain started.<eos> Wait. You guys used to go out?<eos> Um, yes, we did. As a matter of fact.
I guess we should take this moment, perhaps, to let go of some old grudges.<eos> Screw that, I am going out guns blazing!<eos> Wait! Wait a minute!<eos> You're alive, that means my cryo-chamber worked!<eos> Damn right it did, crunchy Munsch.
Sometimes vigilante justice is the only way.<eos> I'm with Chanel.<eos> She killed my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, so I suppose no one cares that your boyfriend murdered my boyfriend? !<eos> No! No one does. All right.
He's been seeing a psychologist for several years.<eos> I've read his report.<eos> He's file a complaint for harassment. His lawyers are involved.<eos> - We have no grounds to continue inv<eos> - Yes, we do.
- She's 13, Marcella.<eos> - She blames me, she listens to you.<eos> - And it is your fault.<eos> - If that makes you feel better then...<eos> No, it doesn't.
Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
- Coffee.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You were right.<eos> All his alibis held up.<eos> Of course they do.
It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
And it's yours... if you hold up your end of the bargain.<eos> I've had a good life... thanks to you.<eos> Very few of the world's secrets I haven't cracked.<eos> It seemed worth a soul... at the time.<eos> It always does.
And, by the way, where the hell is Crowley?<eos> I mean, we're essentially all set up.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he's the one that boxed us into doing this.<eos> You'd think he'd have the decency to -- Show up?<eos> He does.
They contain all the essentials for an epic bachelor party.<eos> (quietly):<eos> What the hell's happening?<eos> Rogelio, you really didn't have to do this.<eos> Of course I did.
We're doing shots!<eos> No, no shots. MEN: Shot!<eos> Shot! LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Truth be told, if Derek knew his boat was being searched, he probably wouldn't feel so buoyed.<eos> But alas, he doesn't.
Because I'm fascinated by antivirus software. I'm not. It bores me.<eos> Okay, um, because you set the gold standard and you're looking for your next challenge.<eos> I am, too.<eos> What makes you think you know what I'm looking for?<eos> I don't.
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
She know?<eos> About you?<eos> About you.<eos> I hide all the time.<eos> All of us do, in this culture.
I'm so tired.<eos> You haven't slept for days.<eos> I want to sleep forever.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
We have every right to be here!<eos> I said stand down.<eos> You want to shoot me?<eos> Shoot me!<eos> Do it!
This is an end-of-days cult.<eos> You have no idea what real fervor is.<eos> Unless you overwhelm them from the start, you're gonna fight them to a draw at best, Which means they win.<eos> And you've got one chance to get it right.<eos> So until then, he does nothing?
Instead of making the American more powerful, It created an alliance against him.<eos> Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab, Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
What do you want me to say?<eos> Has anyone told my mom?<eos> Given what she's gone through, it seems a little soon.<eos> She deserves to know.<eos> She does.
What makes you think...<eos> He's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with you.<eos> I-I didn't know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
Let's go.<eos> Come on, yogi bear.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Hurry up, guys. We don't have all night.<eos> Maybe we do.
It means abandon everything and everyone.<eos> It means run for your life and don't look back.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - I have no choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
Damon, did the spell work or not? !<eos> I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
Innocent people got hurt.<eos> I went nuts.<eos> Him with a machine gun in Banija and me 4 months pregnant.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you had a child.<eos> We don't.
You see the hair?<eos> Why didn't you give this to the police?<eos> I was... 8 years old.<eos> I thought this belonged to my little girlfriend.<eos> - - But it didn't.
I don't think anybody would look down there.<eos> I know i wouldn't.<eos> Okay then get back to the loft.<eos> Hopefully we'll have nick by then.<eos> And if you don't?
Unh-unh! The guy I worked for -- total badass!<eos> And yes, he could be a dick.<eos> Now, that guy... had some stories to tell.<eos> And he has a lot to answer for.<eos> Okay, so what do I do?
In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought --<eos> I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
show yourself!<eos> Don't come any closer!<eos> - Steady.<eos> He means me no harm.<eos> - Yes, I do!
So, they found a safe house in Kabul?<eos> Then they got to walk across the Pakistan border, take a bus to Karachi, fly to Jakarta, and sail to Christmas Island.<eos> Wow. Think they'll make it?<eos> They have a chance.<eos> They didn't before.
- Your name... please, sir.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Mr. Crowley, did your parents ever teach you any manners?<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Oh, but you do, sir!
Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
I'm ready.<eos> Whew. Did you think I was in the coffin?<eos> Uh...<eos> If the shoe fits.<eos> It didn't.
The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
- Ms. Perez, what type of information were you able to gather about the defendant, his Internet activity in particular?<eos> On average, Mr. Solomon procured an escort three times a week.<eos> He also had a blog where he graded the women based on factors such as breast size, pubic hair, and vocal enthusiasm.<eos> I was young.<eos> I don't do that anymore.
Oh. Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Let's eat.<eos> What?<eos> If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?<eos> Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?<eos> Yeah, I did.
That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
The nerve to stay in my life.<eos> Make me trust you, take care of you.<eos> I just want to fix this.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> How do you do that, Frank?
- Pull the trigger!<eos> - Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it! Pull it!<eos> - Please don't do it!<eos> - Do it!
Don't!<eos> - Don't do it!<eos> - Pull it!<eos> Do it!<eos> - Do it! Do it!
I know you can't solve this.<eos> So all I'm asking for is a temporary fix.<eos> Something that'll let me do more than just sit back on this ship while the others risk their lives for me.<eos> I don't believe the others have a problem with that.<eos> Maybe not, but I sure as hell do.
Maybe you didn't want to know what he said.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm gonna have to live the rest of my life never knowing what he said tonight.<eos> I mean, what if he said he loved me?<eos> What if he did?
And guess what he liked to use on people who didn't pay up.<eos> Anyway, the point is that I got over it, and I even became a cop, but-but we don't know how this guy is gonna react to that, and the fact that his dad is still alive?<eos> I say we don't find out.<eos> No, I-I... I have to tell him to his face.<eos> Of course you do.
You think he's gonna turn himself in.<eos> He may have.<eos> But now his actions have become more erratic, more intensified since he killed his mother on that boat.<eos> Good, 'cause I don't want him to stain his routine.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
Smart move, man. I didn't do it.<eos> Yeah, you can save that for the judge, man.<eos> I saw you snatch that bag.<eos> No, that's not what I mean.<eos> I didn't do that.
Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
I completely forgot.<eos> You're getting married.<eos> To MLA Janki Ram's daughter.<eos> What does my personal life have to do with this case?<eos> Nothing but neither did the personal lives of my clients.
I didn't think so.<eos> Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink. Your mother?<eos> Your sister? Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
Why did you do that? He wanted reactions. But I did not think I would go so far.<eos> - Are you in love with him?<eos> So why did you kiss? I did not do it. It was he who wanted.<eos> Since coming to school, he fell in love with me. He kept following me at that party. The only way to get rid of it was to kiss him.<eos> So I did.
You stop it, Suk-won.<eos> You remember everything now, don't you? Yeah, I do.<eos> But.<eos> Why'd you hide everything from me?<eos> I didn't.
But there's a real difference here.<eos> The people whose cases you're reviewing...<eos> They went through the system.<eos> They faced a jury of their peers.<eos> You did no such thing.
We have them.<eos> Far from ideal.<eos> Okay, Emperor... coming to you.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
That's why you and the rest of your crew are here.<eos> Instead of going from point A to point B in your reality, you punched a hole through space-time and ended up here, where our Ishida reclaimed his throne.<eos> Something you obviously haven't done... not yet.<eos> Mind you, I don't know how you're gonna do that without the Blink Drive.<eos> Well, how did he do it?
You know, she wasn't afraid of dying.<eos> She just faced it head on.<eos> I mean, I wish I had that kind of strength.<eos> Hey.<eos> You do.
Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.
That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He doesn't.
Look, I- - I don't know what else to say to you.<eos> Look, I came here hoping to, I don't know, make some kind of amends.<eos> Yeah, so when you're ready for that, you know, let me know.<eos> T.J.! Hi.<eos> How you doing?
No.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I want to see this.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
Well, I'm workin 'on that.<eos> What do you say after this next job, we take off to the mountains?<eos> Get a cabin like we used to?<eos> You want a baby brother?<eos> You do?
Fine.<eos> That's all I get?<eos> Look, my boys don't know about this, and I don't want 'em to.<eos> He still look like me?<eos> He never did.
Thank you.<eos> I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um...<eos> I started taking Oxy.<eos> And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
I'll take that chance.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I figured I'd scared you off.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Ray.
Your advice, Captain, was a conclusion I had already reached unaided.<eos> We tried.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> We can see that, at least.<eos> We did.
On the plus side, your prints landed in AFIS.<eos> When you were in prison, there was not one single bombing in New York. You got out July 2015.<eos> 13 months later, the Bensonhurst Bomber starts blowing things up again.<eos> You have to admit, that's a little strange.<eos> No, I don't.
I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
And I'm being told an osprey is heading towards our guys.<eos> It'll never make it in time.<eos> Beale, is that drone armed?<eos> Yes, sir, but we have no authority to order a strike.<eos> But Duggan does.
We can't destroy the satellite because the missiles are grounded, but if we can disrupt the satellite's signal before it gets to the ship, then we can regain control of the destroyer.<eos> But even if we disrupt the signal, you can't reprogram the Corbett's computers without physically being on the boat.<eos> You try to go out to that destroyer, Walt, I guarantee you the hackers will use the ship's weaponry to turn you into Swiss cheese.<eos> And it's moot, anyway, because we have no way to disrupt the hackers' sat signal to the ship.<eos> Yes, we do.
Yeah, I don't think the other kid does, either.<eos> Well, that kid fired on us.<eos> We didn't have a choice.<eos> You think I feel good about that?<eos> Nobody does!
They named a high school after him?<eos> That's because in the original version of history, the plans Scott stole helped Grant win the Battle of Champion Hill.<eos> And I'm guessing none of that happened because Scott was bayonetted by a Confederate turned into a zombie by a future virus.<eos> Okay, so... how do we fix it?<eos> We don't.

@ ~ I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.
Oh, my God. It's him.<eos> He's even uglier than the last time we saw him.<eos> 65 of your years ago, you saved me from capture.<eos> Listen, you don't need to thank us.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops, they've all run afoul in my organization, but you...<eos> I've never had to whack a professor before.<eos> Guess I'm moving up in the world, hey, boys?<eos> The speedster, how did you manage to defeat him?<eos> I didn't.
- You're a liar! - Julian!<eos> - You're a meta-human.<eos> - Stop, no, stop!<eos> You put your foster father in the hospital, didn't you?<eos> - Didn't you?
You would barely even look at me.<eos> I... couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
Power... yes, the monster.<eos> That's... ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R. - Can't be it... - 'Cause we would have detected<eos> - a surge in the power grid.<eos> - We did not.
That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
He's still out cold.<eos> How hard did you hit him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't mean to knock him out.<eos> Or maybe I did.
You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
Can you just tell them how Oliver usually approaches things and--<eos> I tried that.<eos> I told them all about how you and Speedy and Spartan were a family, and even though you were tough and scary and even a little abusive, they clearly trusted you because they stood by you.<eos> But then it hit me.<eos> No, they didn't.
I don't know.<eos> I think it's what my father would have wanted me to do.<eos> He saved my life.<eos> On Genesis day, he... wrapped me in these rags, said they were ancient, from the time of Devarim, that they would protect me from the fire.<eos> And they did.
Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
Heh. Too soon?<eos> Probably.<eos> I was able to cross-reference the list with the city census, nailing it down to 6 potential targets.<eos> How do we know who he'll hit?<eos> We don't.
I just need to speak with Thea.<eos> I think I saw her talking to Malcolm over by the ice sculpture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Son... I think you need to clam down.<eos> We both do.
Like someone threw a throwing star at me, kicked me down a flight of steps, and knocked me out.<eos> The doctor said you're not supposed to sit up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the doc doesn't know me that well.<eos> Not sure I do anymore either.
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
Now, it seems that my publisher says that for my self-help book to make the best-seller list, I need a celebrity endorsement and not just any celebrity endorsement... the endorsement of endorsements.<eos> Mother, I would be happy to write something for your book.<eos> I need Oprah.<eos> Uh, do you even know Oprah?<eos> No, I do not.
What was his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do know.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I do...
- It's a little hard to believe.<eos> - Is it?<eos> How much did Sheriff Wilkins receive in, uh, campaign donations from Newett Energy last election?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
She swallowed it, hook, line and sinker.<eos> ...appointments, PAC money, even the gavel...<eos> Wait, you said he called Barneki.<eos> Barneki was the odd man out.<eos> He did.
I'd met him.<eos> They sent a version of me to kill everyone on the hobbs list, And now you want my help.<eos> Jennifer, it has nothing...<eos> Jennifer? She never told you<eos> No, she didn't.
Well, I missed the opportunity to be your father.<eos> So maybe someday...<eos> I'm suspected of being a north korean spy.<eos> Are those the friends you tend to keep?<eos> I don't...
We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
My memory, it...<eos> I get confused.<eos> I... you don't know what's it's like in my head.<eos> No, no, you're right.<eos> I-I-I don't but...
Isn't that the best?<eos> You guys made a person.<eos> We did.<eos> And I like to think I helped.<eos> You didn't.
It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.<eos> They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.<eos> Until the part where the elephant got away.<eos> Great, but I thought you said you got a clear picture of him.<eos> I did.
What's taking them so long?<eos> Asking that every minute ain't gonna get them here any faster.<eos> Oh, I'd shut up if I were you.<eos> You got a problem with me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Uh, I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> He wasn't really a good person.<eos> Yeah, he was still your father.<eos> I got no more family left.<eos> Yeah, you do, pal.
What's Poopie Penguin?<eos> What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?<eos> Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points. Penguins don't fly.<eos> No.<eos> They do in my universe.
It's all yours, Hirsch.<eos> Hey-o. Second responder.<eos> Yo, dude, you didn't carry that all the way up the stairs, did you?<eos> You know there's a dumbwaiter, right?<eos> No, I did not.
Tony, Julio.<eos> Alderman Matt Casey.<eos> Appreciate y'all hearing him out.<eos> The reason that I ran for alderman is folks were tired of hearing half truths from politicians who didn't give a damn about this ward.<eos> I do.
Silas, this is Cal.<eos> Call me back A-S-A-fucking-P.<eos> I don't care what Sarah told you.<eos> Do not give Freddie Ridge the medicine.<eos> We did it...
Because it sure seemed like something serious was gonna go down if someone was there.<eos> Eddie, that's insane.<eos> Because I don't know.<eos> Maybe that's what we do, hurt people, now that Cal's in charge.<eos> No, we don't.
I didn't ask questions.<eos> I don't know, somewhere I had this hope, this stupid hope that the call was a sign that he wanted out, that... to come back, to be a real doctor, and I didn't want to push.<eos> Next thing I knew, he was dead.<eos> I have something to say to you.<eos> Apparently, the whole Lane family does.
I don't know what<eos> - Come on!<eos> - the bases are.<eos> - Just tell me.<eos> Of course you do.
You paged me?<eos> It's... 2:00 A.M.<eos> Bri, you should be sleeping. I heard the nurses talking.<eos> They said I'm gonna get the transplant.<eos> Hmm. Of course, you did.
I just watch nature happen.<eos> - Nature?<eos> You fucking freak!<eos> What? My eyes didn't see that, all right?<eos> What did you do?
You know, Horace, it's time.<eos> It's time for you to claim a fucking life.<eos> You sat out the first half, now it's time of you to make something of whatever time you fucking have left.<eos> - I didn't sit out my life.<eos> - No, no, you most certainly did.
What kind of complications?<eos> We had to use the bypass machine after all.<eos> I thought we made our wishes clear.<eos> Did they tell you they were doing this?<eos> They did.
As soon as we can, we'll get you out of the ICU and into a room... one with a view.<eos> Hey, easy there.<eos> Dr. Rhodes...<eos> You know what I'm facing.<eos> I do.
I want to go to military school.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Dom's dad went.<eos> I thought you and Dom broke up.<eos> We did.
Oh. Okay.<eos> What's that?<eos> What...<eos> You don't like her?<eos> No, I do.
Yeah, and, Riley, I believe you have some good news for Darika.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My dad's going to do Darika's repair for free at his surgery center.<eos> Oh, my god. You must have the greatest dad ever.<eos> I do.
Let me sleep.<eos> I heard Alex in the garage.<eos> I think he got the shotgun.<eos> You don't have a shotgun.<eos> Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.
No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He did the sex sniff.<eos> Okay, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to.<eos> Too late, I do.
Look, the feds are useless.<eos> They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.<eos> I want to get home and see Amy.<eos> Don't you want to see Kevin?<eos> Of course I do.
Is it me on a dragon?<eos> Sir, is it me on a dragon?<eos> Boom. $15,000 cash. Wow.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> Oh, you didn't.
You don't think they would tell us?<eos> I'm not gonna risk it.<eos> Plus, with everything that's going around on Fost and Found.<eos> - How did Justina even find out about...<eos> - She didn't.
Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I...<eos> I don't.
He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered.<eos> And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, why aren't you dancing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just too dumb, I guess.<eos> So, how could Molloy forget giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- Great!<eos> There's like 50 wires!<eos> - Jesus: Okay, I don't need this.<eos> - Mariana: Fine! Well, we don't need you.<eos> - Yes, we do.
There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work. - Wait.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
For the first time in four years, we have a new champion, Southern California.<eos> Brant Country Day, Anchor Beach, and High Tech LA came from defeat<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> So, the strategy that we used was to tell everybody that the arm worked.<eos> - Uh, because it did?
Hey, anybody home?<eos> Police.<eos> You were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> - Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Yeah, but, uh, what if something happens to that kit?<eos> Don't we... don't we need a backup kit?<eos> Go get a backup kit.<eos> Gabi, you didn't even want a kit.<eos> Of course I did!
You're not wearing your wedding ring!<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> I know why.<eos> - You do?
I remember this one day, before he was gonna leave, I accidentally fell out of a tree, broke my arm.<eos> I was, uh, I was six years old and, uh, I remember my arm was killing me, but, uh, I was smiling all the way to the E.R.<eos> 'Cause you didn't think he'd leave if you were hurt.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Did he?
Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared.<eos> The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to Morrow?<eos> I did.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Here we all are.<eos> Are you ready to do this?<eos> No, ma'am, but, uh, I always figured this day was coming.<eos> Maybe I did, too.
Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.
He's in the backyard, mulching.<eos> Do you mind being back there with us?<eos> I think it might help.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I do.
See you around sometime.<eos> See you around.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got you.<eos> You did.
They can sure make the world feel like it's got some kind of direction, yes.<eos> Sounds like you cared a lot about this lady, Dan.<eos> I did, Tyrus.<eos> I still do.<eos> 'Course you do, Dan.
For real, Dee, you gonna do me that way?<eos> What?<eos> You ever dream of being somewhere else?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I need to speak with you.<eos> - Oh, I'm good.<eos> - Why?<eos> You didn't like the last one?<eos> No, I did, too much.
Seriously? We just had this conversation outside the mall.<eos> - Aly! What are you doing here?<eos> You don't... remember that?<eos> No, no, I do, I do.<eos> - You don't, do you?
Hey.<eos> Um, did you want to order?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And you have a consult, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
The boys found your gun.<eos> They were playing with it.<eos> Your gun?<eos> You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.
No.<eos> We were just playing. It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
Every single day.<eos> When are people gonna learn?<eos> It just makes things worse.<eos> And people always say they need one for protection.<eos> - They don't.
- They don't.<eos> - Unless they do.<eos> I have a gun.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I do.
What are you...<eos> I just came by to, uh...<eos> You know, I-I had a nice conversation<eos> - with Don Heller just now.<eos> - You did?
You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> In my dreams I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
- No, I love them like...<eos> If something happened to them, I would die.<eos> Like, my heart is so wide open, and they're so fragile.<eos> I don't know how you live like this.<eos> I don't.
And that was the last thing I ever said to her.<eos> You didn't mean to.<eos> Hey.<eos> Got a late one, huh?<eos> I do.
- You can repair it, can't you?<eos> - I can try. Throw in a plasma patch, hope for the best.<eos> - "Hope for the best?"<eos> - It's experimental, but if we want to prolong this pregnancy...<eos> - Of course we do.
That's correct, yes.<eos> You go and play, drink, and flirt with women... is that correct?<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - I'm married and I don't drink.<eos> So Dr. Robbins did all the drinking and flirting.
I hear you. I've got a ventricular washout on a massive brain abscess.<eos> Sounds last-ditch. Sorry.<eos> Well, not necessarily. I... feel pretty good about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do.
And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It doesn't matter.<eos> If they don't want to be here, then... they shouldn't be.<eos> We don't want them.<eos> They don't get it, and they don't have to.<eos> I do.
And pretty soon, they were both neglecting their family.<eos> And then one of his children started to act out?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Yeah... so Dad got pissed off and tossed me out of the house.<eos> And what did your mother do?
I've never met him.<eos> Look, he goes by the name of... of Bobby B.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I thought you said this case doesn't have anything to do with your mom anymore.<eos> It doesn't.
He's right.<eos> And it appears you're in the clear.<eos> No one's investigating Andrew's death.<eos> Jake and the president took care of that.<eos> How you doing?
I'd like you to drop your investigation.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because there's still time before the primary, which means there's still time for me to change my mind and endorse someone other than Senator Grant. Say, Susan, for instance.<eos> Do you realize what you're suggesting, Governor?<eos> Because maybe you don't.
You did my job for me.<eos> You overruled me. You called my play.<eos> You were making mistakes. You were off the rails.<eos> When that happens, I have the right to make...<eos> No, no. You do not.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I... I told him about the phone.<eos> Uh, yeah, I guess you thought that was the best way to handle it?<eos> Someone's messing with us, and our choices matter, and I would like to think that you trust me enough to make my own.<eos> Of course I do.
True?<eos> I'm about to "convince" sleazy Branson to keep his mouth shut.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> You came to me because you said that I'm dark and I understand this stuff.<eos> Well, I do!
[Indistinct conversations] Cricket: Whatever you're doing's not working.<eos> Alex didn't even show up.<eos> Brought you something, Cricket.<eos> Blotter, I don't want any herbal whatevers.<eos> I do.
He'll do anything to get what he wants.<eos> But, hey. You... You got the girl.<eos> Congrats, bro.<eos> ♪ Can die without a dream ♪ You don't actually believe him, do you?<eos> Actually, I do.
You said he should be made to testify.<eos> Against whom?<eos> Against whoever hired him, obviously.<eos> You already know who it is.<eos> I do not.
They can't.<eos> According to the kid and his mom, those bugs have been making that noise for two weeks.<eos> That must be torture.<eos> If it has been going on that long, why haven't they left?<eos> Some did.
At home.<eos> A little under the weather.<eos> I guess maybe you're the guy I need to talk to anyway, to begin.<eos> Uh, do you remember that furniture we looked at about a month or so ago, that French Art Deco stuff?<eos> I do.
And weapons?<eos> Just knives.<eos> I'm good with that.<eos> You jumped to Sasha's defence pretty quickly after he ran away.<eos> Unless he didn't.
- We haven't eaten in two days.<eos> This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.<eos> He's got apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
I couldn't really blame them, though.<eos> Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
That's believable.<eos> We're not here to eat.<eos> He has apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
Is he here?<eos> We gotta disable that before we take him down.<eos> Why?<eos> How well do you know that Cuz guy?<eos> I don't.
Are we okay?<eos> Liz, it's over.<eos> There's nobody coming after us.<eos> It's just you and me. And her.<eos> We did it.
You win a championship, you got a right to be in that Canton conversation.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Don't say you ain't dreamt of having that beautiful beard in bronze.<eos> Yeah, but I don't wanna get ahead of myself.<eos> Shit, well, you do it with everything else.
No, it won't.<eos> But it will bring justice to his memory, and likely prevent another innocent life from being taken by this sociopath.<eos> He killed your cousin right in front of you.<eos> Why do you want to do him the favor of shutting up about it?<eos> I don't.
You remember, Joe, when you told me that you'd do anything possible to find the animal who did this?<eos> Yeah. Well, so would I.<eos> He did it, Erin.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
Think, Garrett.<eos> I'm on to you, you know.<eos> There's no way you were ever gonna cancel that party.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
No, I'm doing it for the safety of the populace.<eos> Please, come with me.<eos> I'm gonna get my phone and my jacket, okay?<eos> I'm gonna record every step of this.<eos> Please do, ma'am.
Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
Scotch?<eos> Uh, no, thank you.<eos> Well, I'm going to have one.<eos> I thought you quit drinking.<eos> I did.
Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
You got a front row seat to New York City's elite underground ladies' arm wrestling.<eos> One, two, three, wrestle!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I own an arm wrestling bar.<eos> No, you don't.
was it not truly frightening, what the voice and the prophesies and the... it was... I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
For love.<eos> For forgiveness.<eos> Oh... help... somebody help...<eos> But God never answered me.<eos> Instead, he did.
Enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> This has gone way too far.<eos> You do not need to answer him.<eos> Yes you do.
A sex swing is not furniture.<eos> We have to agree on what's gonna be in the common area, Maze.<eos> Fine, I don't agree with your cheesy decorations.<eos> You don't like Halloween?<eos> Of course I do.
Chest?<eos> Shooter didn't go for the head?<eos> First rule of zombie killing.<eos> Do you want to work this case with me or not?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
Mm-hmm.<eos> All good. Just on my way out.<eos> Something's seriously bothering her.<eos> Oh, I hadn't noticed.<eos> But you did.
Get ready to see the real Los Angeles on this thrill ride tour.<eos> Well, it appears I've been misled.<eos> Whoever put together this brochure should get special treatment in Hell.<eos> I don't need you to show me around the city.<eos> Well, of course you do.
He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
She won't be pressing charges.<eos> But we have their faces.<eos> Yeah, she wants to move past this.<eos> Did she tell you that, David?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I know that you're just some... some spoiled-ass rich kid.<eos> But you know everything 'cause your mom's a junkie?<eos> Okay, you didn't have to say that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Neither did you.
The only reason that I came to Berlin is because he ordered me to.<eos> I know you don't want to hear this, but your father is trying to do right by the Reich and now by you if you would give him a chance.<eos> He doesn't deserve another chance.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But maybe you do.
- I don't know. I tried.<eos> He must've said something.<eos> I don't know. I've tried everything, okay?<eos> I don't know where he put it, I don't...<eos> I don't...
Morning, Helen.<eos> Hi.<eos> Maybe it's time you and I sit down, talk about this killer you're looking for.<eos> - I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - We did.
I think I'm gonna take out my 401(k) and help her get a new start.<eos> Really, after she got you arrested?<eos> Yeah, I'm guessing you don't have a sister.<eos> I got Gabe and this case I want off my desk.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure you do.
Maybe.<eos> You don't need to do that with me... or with Helen.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> No.<eos> I don't... no.
Badly.<eos> After Buffalo, I couldn't go on anymore.<eos> I just wanted to end it all.<eos> - Who hasn't?<eos> - No, I really did.
They're friends.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that ever since Philip showed up...<eos> You're going to go there?<eos> - Tell me I don't have a point.<eos> - You don't.
- Oh, my God, you're an idiot. - Mmm.<eos> - Mm-mmm. - Yes.<eos> You just completely made that up, right?<eos> Maybe, but it got you laughing.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Marissa's your sister?<eos> Marissa's Mr Barber's lover.<eos> She is 27 years old.<eos> She occasionally stays here when Mr Barber does.<eos> When he does?
That's why you're here.<eos> Wha...?<eos> I have no idea what's going on.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Who does?
Elise.<eos> Russell...<eos> Now that I'm on the other side of this, it is pretty rude.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down,<eos> I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
When I don't have to take my other shirt off in a bar full of people.<eos> - Ten years? !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You didn't tell him for ten years?<eos> I did.
I'm gonna be really honest.<eos> Um, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.<eos> That was the most romantic story I've ever heard.<eos> And I don't want to get between them.<eos> Or do I?
Stop being scary, nigga. Figure it out.<eos> You know what, Marcus?<eos> I'ma let you go.<eos> You know my son, man.<eos> - Please don't, man.
People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
Cool.<eos> Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess. You know.<eos> No, I don't.
Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess. You know.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Stop!<eos> Mrs. Collins!<eos> The joys of breakfast al fresco.<eos> That's Italian, you know.<eos> Oh. Well, of course you do.
Anna, for heaven's sake, stop!<eos> Yes?<eos> I love your idea of bringing Gino around.<eos> But please, James should remember in his own time.<eos> And if he doesn't?
I'll pour us a jar.<eos> - It's over.<eos> - For now.<eos> - If anything had happened...<eos> - It didn't.
I bear a portion of the blame.<eos> For Anna. Rose is simply the tip of the iceberg.<eos> She's what brought it to a head.<eos> Do you see no hope?<eos> Anna doesn't, more to the point.
You're a good man, Lieutenant.<eos> I told my people what you did for me.<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - You saved my life.<eos> Do the same for your soldiers.
Okay, but that's not the way it works, and you all know that.<eos> Search of his apartment came up empty.<eos> The guy's good at covering his tracks.<eos> That's because a snake never leaves tracks.<eos> Actually, they do. What?
The guy's good at covering his tracks.<eos> That's because a snake never leaves tracks.<eos> Actually, they do. What?<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> Well, don't.
And that's where Jake is right now!<eos> Instead of up here, with me, where he belonged.<eos> Unless we wake up and stop acting like this isn't Murderville, we're all gonna end up like Jake.<eos> And we'll deserve it.<eos> But he didn't.
I mean, yeah, but she's just... she's been going through a lot tonight, so...<eos> Okay, you know, maybe we should just wait.<eos> - A lot has been going on...<eos> - Zoe, we don't have to worry about anybody else, right?<eos> But we do and you do.
Bowie lives how he wants to live.<eos> He does what he wants, and he doesn't care what people think.<eos> Listening to Bowie gave me the courage to come out.<eos> And everyone just accepted you?<eos> Of course not. But Cricket did.
I can fly the "Marauder". Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
So I don't know Max personally, but apparently he attacked this girl that he met on Mate.<eos> Way to ruin a good thing, Max.<eos> Why the ghost treatment?<eos> I thought you liked Tyler.<eos> I do.
Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
What?<eos> What did she say?<eos> No, don't worry. We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> No, no, what did she...?
I've had good nights, I've had bad nights, but I've never had...<eos> Yes, it was odd.<eos> I don't know what it was.<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - What did I...
Makes sense.<eos> Oh, um... what did you need when you came by the office?<eos> I need your list of gerrymander districts.<eos> We have a bug.<eos> You do?
They put out a comic book about how to repel a zombie attack.<eos> This was merely a way to get people who usually don't care about disease to read about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I thought I had five minutes.<eos> You do.
They love you, and I am sorry about my mom.<eos> No, no, no. Don't be sorry about your mom. Never be sorry about your mom.<eos> I'm very sorry about my shitty mother.<eos> Okay, well, I don't know her.<eos> No, you don't.
- Thanks, Dan.<eos> What are black fruits?<eos> Black fruits are like, you know, blackberries or blackcurrants, just dark berries.<eos> And how do they get them into the wine?<eos> No, they don't...
My life is a joke. - No, it's not.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Methinks you might want to make your exit now.<eos> No, I don't want to leave, actually, as it happens.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Dr. Charles wants me to be a psych resident.<eos> You?<eos> Is that such a shock?<eos> I just didn't realize that you had an interest in that.<eos> I didn't.
We couldn't open the door because of all the snow. - Wow.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - It melted, presumably.<eos> Er... stay out of this, please.<eos> Did it? It did, yes.
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
Better than that, rather brilliantly, we have made a bespoke version of that sting for every single episode we're gonna make for the next three years.<eos> How about that?<eos> But hold on.<eos> The slight problem with that is that we were so busy doing that we didn't think actually of anything to talk about.<eos> - We did.
James May, the world's slowest moving human being, has been caught speeding.<eos> Actually charged by the police.<eos> Criminal.<eos> He's actually quite proud of it.<eos> He did it on a Honda CBR 600RR sports bike.
- Right.<eos> Can we just speed this interview along?<eos> Just ask me what you want to ask, Mr. Kent.<eos> Did I have anything to do with the Venture explosion?<eos> Did you?
Boone, Lin?<eos> We're not the problem. It's Ferrous Corp.<eos> They brought a bomb on board.<eos> Now, I don't know how they got it past your scans, but you have to believe me.<eos> No. I don't.
It changed the way you think and feel.<eos> You tried to help me before you knew I could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Come on, favorite song... easy answer.<eos> Blotter already made her a mix tape.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I was hoping maybe he'd forgotten a track.<eos> He did, actually.
That's the hero rate?<eos> I've had expenses.<eos> I think Swagger just sent me a message.<eos> You think?<eos> Either he did or he didn't.
We can handle it.<eos> What about what you said? About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
You can't answer that quickly.<eos> Before, I was wrong.<eos> But now I have something to fight for.<eos> Unless you don't want to.<eos> I do.
Mitch, your father, and the Shepherds... they're working on a solution.<eos> I don't know, Abe.<eos> Even if they do figure it out, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.<eos> It will work.<eos> Yeah, well, what if it doesn't?
I'm not a boy, actually.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have eyes, right? You can tell I'm not a child, and I am definitely not your son, so don't call me "boy."<eos> I'm not sure you realize where you are, boy.<eos> Actually, I do.
No. But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
In fact, it probably tells you something about me that I don't remember.<eos> I do like fire stations, though, so that sounds like something I'd do if I had to do something, you know?<eos> Anyway, I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but either way, you can be sure this life of mine is punishment enough for the things I've done.<eos> - If you think I'm gonna forgive you...<eos> - I don't.
- It's a pleasure meeting you, Beth. - Mm.<eos> You have a hole in your pants.<eos> Annie!<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> I actually do.
You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal? No.<eos> Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.
Is... but is it even legal? No.<eos> Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> No, I-I do.
I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
Wilma is waiting.<eos> Wilma?<eos> Nasty, annoying Wilma.<eos> It says here Patricia.<eos> Hello. So, how we doing?
She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
I don't believe you.<eos> No, that's the great thing about this country. Everybody here is just doing their job.<eos> I don't have to do anything.<eos> What if I tell them?<eos> Yes. Do.
Just give me the phone.<eos> _<eos> Is that "Infinite Jest?"<eos> There's no way he's read that whole book.<eos> - Yes, he did.
_<eos> Is that "Infinite Jest?"<eos> There's no way he's read that whole book.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - No, he didn't.
I'll see you later.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Do you?
What are you doing here?<eos> I live here.<eos> Right, but where are you going?<eos> Didn't you say you lost your job? No, I didn't say that, actually.<eos> - How did you...
- Ready?<eos> You're crazy!<eos> - I'm crazy about you.<eos> She's yours.<eos> - Mine? What do I do with her?
She was already dealing with hallucinations, fits of rage, violent, recurring nightmares.<eos> There's no telling how this new round of violence could be impacting her.<eos> _<eos> Coming home doesn't mean you have to forgive him.<eos> I never do... really.
Fabulous.<eos> It's a crumbling, creepy house.<eos> Yeah, there's also a crumbling, creepy barn to match.<eos> It used to belong to the James family.<eos> Or it still does.
T.C.'s not answering any of my messages.<eos> I-I'm worried.<eos> Is that all this is about?<eos> Not our moving-in conversation? I feel like I opened my big mouth, and I scared you off.<eos> No, you didn't.
We're gonna get closed up here.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?<eos> Just between us?<eos> Yeah. You know about the missing Norco?<eos> I do.
I'm an addict, too, but you trust me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I trust you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you are not her.<eos> She didn't do it.
It's curious, though.<eos> In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.<eos> She gave him a blowjob.<eos> He didn't force her to.<eos> - No, he didn't.
He was fine. Thanks.<eos> - Good.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> You... you look... you look familiar.<eos> - I... - No, I don't.
Okay, do you want to go to the playground today? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, Joanie.<eos> Mama, does she have to come?<eos> Yes, baby, she does.
- Swings.<eos> God, you're so big now.<eos> Look at you..<eos> Do you remember when I was born?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
- It's okay.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I can. Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
No!<eos> What?<eos> I... no, of course not.<eos> Then why did you send the police to me?<eos> - I didn't.
I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> - We don't.
Meat, stay back.<eos> All right, listen, we're gonna keep you out of sight, all right?<eos> 'Cause if they knew you were down here... they'd eat you.<eos> And you don't want to be eaten, do you?<eos> No, you don't.
That's a bridge you can't uncross.<eos> Okay, so just... Aah!<eos> - Yo, Gary. - Uh-oh.<eos> I don't even think this dude wants to live.<eos> He doesn't.
You go after the prince and what?<eos> Maybe... maybe you get him, but then what, hmm?<eos> What happens to you?<eos> I don't matter.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's why I couldn't remember.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> I'm just sorry you had to go back there.<eos> At least now I know.<eos> We all do.
- Help me...<eos> - Alessio!<eos> Turn the water on!<eos> Alessio! Leave him alone!<eos> Do something, Patrizia!
Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?<eos> That nod meant no, apparently.<eos> Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors.<eos> They all truly belong here.<eos> Oh, yes they do, cutie-pants.
I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?<eos> First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire. Why would you even know that?<eos> Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.<eos> - She wrote that note.<eos> - No she didn't!
Why?<eos> To be with you.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on. - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.
To be with you.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on. - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - Yeah. I do.
I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
That's why it'd be a shame if... with everyone's eyes on you, you got this all wrong because of your bias against my sister.<eos> Bias.<eos> What could I possibly have against your sister?<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> No, you don't.
I messed everything up in my life, and this is the result.<eos> We all mess things up.<eos> You can't even imagine the things I've messed up.<eos> I was saved by an angel, you know.<eos> I don't...
You knew.<eos> You were making sure we hadn't gone anywhere in the night.<eos> Because.<eos> How could something so good ever last?<eos> And it didn't.
How do you not recognize this?<eos> I mean...<eos> Come on! I can't...<eos> I can't keep doing this.<eos> Doing what?
FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20.<eos> And the technology beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
I received a message to come to these coordinates and give support.<eos> Who delivered the message?<eos> One of the Russians.<eos> Well, that's bullshit, 'cause that would... that would kill an adult.<eos> It did.
Uh, well, if you wouldn't mind keeping me in mind for the future...<eos> Um, we're never gonna be able to offer you a job here, darling.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know why.<eos> No, I don't, actually.
You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
My perspective is entirely selfish.<eos> I just don't want to lose you.<eos> All I know is... I just need to talk to David first.<eos> I didn't realize you had someone that important to you in your life.<eos> Neither did I.
I am so proud.<eos> I made everybody T-shirts!<eos> (shrieks gleefully) So, what'd you want to tell me?<eos> I didn't actually graduate from high school.<eos> Oh, yes, you did!
I'm never going to pass.<eos> What does biology have to do with life anyway?<eos> Look, man, I'd help you out, but I met the lovely Miss Jimenez in the teacher's lounge, and I offered to help grade some of her students' Spanish homework.<eos> - I didn't know you spoke Spanish.<eos> - I don't.
For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's okay.<eos> What is that?<eos> It sounds like...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Just don't.
They'll shoot your mother and dump her on the side of the road.<eos> I cannot just sit here and do nothing! If you do anything to her, you won't...<eos> Mr Tramacca, I apologize.<eos> The woman behaved badly.<eos> Yes, she did.
Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on.<eos> There was no winner.<eos> So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next.<eos> And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on.<eos> How long did it?
Stop, Gene!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Gary!<eos> Get over here and get his arm!<eos> Do it!
It could already be too late.<eos> Gary called.<eos> He said you're sick, Mike.<eos> They didn't understand in 1988, and they don't understand now.<eos> And you do?
Had you, didn't I?<eos> It's fan-fic.<eos> It's a love letter.<eos> You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.
I rode Gypsy.<eos> I gave her an apple.<eos> Yeah? Did she have bad breath?<eos> That's because horses don't brush their teeth.<eos> But little girls do, don't they?
He can't just do that, can he?<eos> Can he?<eos> Well I have the cure for 10K fever right here.<eos> Well then, if you have this under control<eos> I do.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Your school record says your previous self was a recalcitrant bully whose only redeeming quality was a gift for something called... football.<eos> Trevor Holden wouldn't have given Grace the time of day...<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> Oh, but Trevor Holden did?
Stop the car.<eos> I need to do something.<eos> What?<eos> We gotta stop doing this.<eos> - Doing what?
And don't worry about Nana Lyle.<eos> We don't need her.<eos> Look... I know I'm not perfect, but I did the best that I could.<eos> I didn't know how to raise kids.<eos> Yeah, well... I didn't either.
So?<eos> So I'm just saying what else is she hiding?<eos> Why don't you like her?<eos> You don't like Devyn.<eos> I do now.
A bush with wheels there, smart-ass.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Next you're gonna tell me that you've got the keys, right?<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
It left the tower, and it came in here!<eos> Dana, it's inside!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What do I do?
- Jane, I'm so sorry.<eos> - We didn't know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He was supposed to be getting better, so I took a deployment.<eos> And then he didn't.
Anyone who thought they were coming back... came back.<eos> You think you're gonna die anytime soon?<eos> Honestly?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- I get it, honey.<eos> - Yeah. I get it. I get it.<eos> Listen...<eos> How did it feel to kill him?<eos> I don't...
Apparently not.<eos> Listen. Now we have the chance.<eos> Shall we just blow out of here and go to Sag Harbor for the weekend?<eos> You don't want to meet them.<eos> Of course I do.
Uh, I'll be right there.<eos> I'm doing something that's really important to me, and I would really appreciate it if you would give me the space to do that.<eos> - I give you the space.<eos> - Sorry. Do you want to do this or not?<eos> I really, really do.
A punishment given to only my people who were also destroyed.<eos> That's billions of people gone, murdered, and you... you, all this time to take your revenge and you said nothing?<eos> The choice isn't yours.<eos> God! If I didn't have this thing in my head...<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
- If I lost you...<eos> - If I lost you...<eos> Six days, I thought of nothing but you.<eos> Six days thinking of how you smell and how your skin is soft on your neck and you don't understand football.<eos> I really don't.
Cops I work with think they were deluded, but I know they're wrong.<eos> Problem is I can't explain why they're wrong.<eos> Who cares?<eos> The police don't matter.<eos> Who does?
So whatever it is that has you all chill and totally okay with dying here, I want in.<eos> I want to do your drugs.<eos> Buddy, drugs are for expansion, not escapesion.<eos> You do not want drugs.<eos> Yes... I... do.
Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
In the dream?<eos> You said, "He's here."<eos> Did I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you?
I picked up the Coco Pops and went...<eos> And she snapped and went,<eos> "Do you want me to lose this baby?"<eos> And I went, "Um, fuck, that was quick!<eos> Of course I do.
Well, let me tell you something.<eos> Black Americans have to keep fighting for good art.<eos> - A-men! Come...<eos> - We have to.<eos> We really do.
But I think our Malachi problem is not quite the Malachi problem we have been imagining.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I believe he's alive.<eos> Well, if that's true, we don't have a Malachi problem at all.<eos> But we do.
Who do you work with at Manifest Destinations, Jacob?<eos> And where can I find him?<eos> Well, you know, I can't answer those questions, but here are a couple of questions and answers I can provide.<eos> Did I invite Manifest Destinations here?<eos> No, I did not.
Well, you know, I can't answer those questions, but here are a couple of questions and answers I can provide.<eos> Did I invite Manifest Destinations here?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Did I know about or have anything to do with a heroin operation?<eos> No, I did not.
Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> It's a Department of Transportation I.D.<eos> I thought Walt gave you the day off.<eos> He did.
Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
Hi.<eos> Is A-Asha with you?<eos> Um, no. She's not.<eos> - But you got my message.<eos> - Uh, yes, I did.
- I'd be with him.<eos> - Ask him about the traffic cam.<eos> If he's innocent, how do you explain the video footage that places Oscar's car at the scene?<eos> Does this video footage capture the image of the driver?<eos> No, it does not.
I know where she is.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I wanted to understand a few things.<eos> You think her father and I gave up on her?<eos> We didn't.
Come to my place.<eos> I may not get back on a board ever again, but I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I just got to do this part on my own. That's just it.<eos> You don't have to do this on your own.<eos> Yes, I do.
She said, "Go be the hero of your own life."<eos> And you said to her, "A hero doesn't leave."<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I see her in my dreams.<eos> We all do.
One of them was called Jasper.<eos> Jasper Tudor.<eos> You may have heard of them, the Tudors.<eos> You take my breath away, you know that?<eos> Of course I do.
Well, he's a good man. And he wants the truth, n-not just a-a leak.<eos> And what's the truth?<eos> - Mr. Boch.<eos> - My guess is you have some information for me.<eos> - I do.
That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
- Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> - Is there a question?<eos> - Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> - Yeah, they sure as hell did.
So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work.<eos> They wouldn't get it.<eos> It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
It was me!<eos> It was me!<eos> It was me!<eos> I wrote the note!<eos> You did?
You're fired!<eos> What, what?<eos> No. Look, I realize you're upset, but<eos> - you have to give me another chance.<eos> - No, I don't.
I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he...<eos> - Fucking right I do.
All right, listen.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'm gonna get you some water.<eos> Did he see you?<eos> Did he?
- When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
You used to bring all the girls around.<eos> Definitely not her.<eos> You still have access to McCoy's house?<eos> Now I'm starting to feel like your partner here thinks that I had something to do with this.<eos> Did you?
Not because you asked me.<eos> Wow, you're cleaning.<eos> You really do like Sam.<eos> More like shoving and hiding.<eos> But, yeah, I really do.
This is not real.<eos> But that hickey is gonna be.<eos> I thought that we had something special.<eos> No!<eos> We do!
But that hickey is gonna be.<eos> I thought that we had something special.<eos> No!<eos> We do!<eos> We do!
Fuck.<eos> I've never really said how sorry I was.<eos> You should get the trainers.<eos> She'll say I don't know her.<eos> You don't.
I think they have to have a healthy perspective on my body.<eos> - Don't they?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I mean, I don't need to tell you, but your father is a deeply sexual man.<eos> No, you don't.
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm helping.<eos> - He is...<eos> - He didn't try to kiss you.<eos> - He did.
Fix it up yourself? Yeah.<eos> That's kind of what I do.<eos> Work on houses and stuff.<eos> You build them? You do all the...<eos> I do... I mostly do the dry wall stuff.
- I have a sister named Sarah.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> Uh-huh, yes, and have Monica call every patient that's been to the infusion center since Monday.<eos> Mm-hmm, yes, anyone with fever, chills, headaches, or nausea gets a blood draw.<eos> - How you doing?
I remember one time...<eos> You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else... what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
Go, go!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
I need cold, hard, scientific facts to back up our case during this debate.<eos> I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing. I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
I'm just glad to see you're safe.<eos> Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> I thought you trusted me.<eos> Well, I do.
And I'm talking about Aida, specifically.<eos> I mean, she did, after all, bring you and Agent Fitz back from ... well, wherever the hell you were.<eos> If a similar technology is in play, she could have a solve.<eos> What? You disagree?<eos> - I don't, actually.
We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
Hey, I helped bring little Lucy into this world.<eos> I ain't about to let anything happen to her.<eos> Believe me.<eos> So you knew my mommy?<eos> Well I sure did, sweetheart.
I ain't about to let anything happen to her.<eos> Believe me.<eos> So you knew my mommy?<eos> Well I sure did, sweetheart.<eos> I did too.
Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.
- And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> He did.
N-No, no, no.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The...fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.<eos> - You know how that goes.<eos> - I do.
Guys, breakfast!<eos> Mom, Webster told me to shut up.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Do not call him that.<eos> Everyone else always does.
I was... trying to decide what to wear, and then I realised it doesn't bloody matter.<eos> Adam doesn't give a damn whether I wear the stupid dress or the skirt or the...<eos> He doesn't give a damn whether I go to his funeral at all.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I do.
I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm... I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
Much worse than a bad word.<eos> Uh, but I don't know if I should tell anybody.<eos> Was it about the company, Jaimie?<eos> Mm-hmm. I don't want to get my mom in trouble.<eos> Of course you don't.
Who is this adorable little munchkin?<eos> Hi, my name is Hazel.<eos> I'm a Spiga Scout Leader, and I have a question for you today.<eos> Do you like chocolate?<eos> Well, yes, I do.
You're tough as nails.<eos> And your father would cut my balls off if he saw me talking to his little girl.<eos> Mm, I'm sure he wouldn't be the first to try.<eos> - See, you know me, too.<eos> - I don't.
Mm, I'm sure he wouldn't be the first to try.<eos> - See, you know me, too.<eos> - I don't.<eos> And you don't know me, either.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Please!<eos> Ow! No, please!<eos> Hey! Hey! What's going on here?<eos> This woman works for you, ma'am?<eos> She does.
We don't know what kind of firewall it has.<eos> It could kill her as soon as we try to break in.<eos> Share your wisdom with us, then.<eos> How do you propose we disarm it?<eos> We don't.
What do you mean?<eos> What if you were having a dream, and in that dream she was married to another man?<eos> I'd know it was a dream.<eos> What if it was actually true? That she had a husband?<eos> She didn't.
And I guess you found them out.<eos> Who was it?<eos> - Why would he say that?<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> - Maybe he didn't do it.
You'll deserve any medal they win as if you were right there with them.<eos> McNabb!<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> Being here for this match means the world to me.<eos> Just what old friends do.
I suppose I am in danger, aren't I?<eos> You'll be safe with us.<eos> Let's get to the hotel.<eos> But if the constabulary had more evidence, you wouldn't require my testimony?<eos> Well, we don't.
Oh, it's nowhere special.<eos> Surely the barber shop has a name.<eos> I can't recall.<eos> You, William Murdoch, the man who remembers everything, can not recall where he has his hair cut?<eos> No, I don't.
I wish I could answer more conclusively.<eos> But the attack was made in a frenzy.<eos> The stab wounds are not clean, so I can't determine exactly the width of the blade.<eos> If only Mr. Pendrick had some memory of the night in question.<eos> - Maybe he does.
Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do. You do.
Take it take it...<eos> No I don't need it<eos> Stop acting pricey...<eos> 1 know you like Raguu<eos> No, I don't
There's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
Best to give them all the theories, don't you think?<eos> So if it wasn't Al-Sakar, who blew up the Capitol Building?<eos> I don't know, yet, and that's what scares me.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> Okay, w-what do I do?
Watch this, watch this.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> That's not even remotely how this program is supposed to work.<eos> Oh, I like it when a woman takes charge.<eos> Yes, I do.
I think maybe Raymond has an interest in it. I --<eos> Do you think that, or do you know that?<eos> Well, I hear things.<eos> I don't know anything for sure when it comes to him.<eos> No one does.
Even if those arms are ray guns.<eos> That's what Cadmus wants.<eos> They're the ones handing out these weapons, They want us to be afraid of each other. to not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I just do.
- Danvers! Hey, I was hoping you'd turn up.<eos> Any interest in a game?<eos> Well, actually, I was wondering if you were still good for that drink you promised me.<eos> You told Kara?<eos> Yeah, you did!
Look, you and I, we... we... we don't know each other that well yet, kiddo.<eos> Not really, but... but I want you to know that I'm gonna do everything in my power to save her.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> After that, I don't really care what happens to me.<eos> I do.
and that didn't happen.<eos> - Mom, it did.<eos> - No. Not the way the law states.<eos> Look, "The psychiatrist shall not be the person who executed the first certificate."<eos> They didn't do that.
Longest minutes of my life.<eos> Hey, can I tell you something?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You want to know what I did to get into detention?<eos> Do I?
The Savior will be here soon.<eos> Oh, do you mean Aladdin?<eos> The thief with a heart of gold, or is it the heart that desires gold?<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
And now I have to tell parents that their daughter is dead because of a decision I made.<eos> It's a decision that saved millions of lives.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But it doesn't make knocking on that door any easier.<eos> No. No, it doesn't.
Tell me about this ray of sunshine,<eos> Tom. MARISSA: 64.<eos> Divorced.<eos> Three times.<eos> We did a motivational matrix on Tom.
I'm gonna go play guitar.<eos> I was impressed.<eos> That passion... that's what I first remember about you when you started at the D.A.'s office.<eos> Look, Amanda, you don't have to.<eos> No, I do.
How about they stop limiting our hours or docking our pay for bathroom breaks?<eos> We are not the ones who need to improve here.<eos> Yeah, we're pretty perfect.<eos> But, look, he wants to hear our complaints.<eos> Yeah, and then not do anything about them.
- Yes...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, I-I try really, really hard.<eos> I always thought you liked me.<eos> I don't.
Pop the taillight with a screwdriver gets you access to the trunk.<eos> Hand drill gets you into the back seat.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got -- records, money transfers, pictures, videos.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> When? When do we do this?
It's inoperable.<eos> One of these days, his heart's just going to explode.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know about that.<eos> Everybody does.
It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
Every time I think about the vision of my future, and I think about my trembling hand and... imagine my family having to watch me die.<eos> And I wish I never became the Savior.<eos> So I knew I could not have that thing anywhere near me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What do I do now?
I'm pretty much a genius.<eos> And I'm pretty much gonna pass.<eos> You want to try a Cacao Storm?<eos> Huh, buddy?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Hey, where's Oleg?<eos> I told him to meet me here.<eos> Sophie?<eos> You look as beautiful as the day we first did it on the sink.<eos> Damn straight, I do!
What's the route?<eos> Uh, Kahala primarily. Uh, Diamond Head to Kealaolu.<eos> That's got to be three square miles.<eos> You you like... everything... perfect.<eos> Don't you?
Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee.<eos> You want some? Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.
You want some? Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
- No, it was 150. - Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
Umm, it's when you want to hurt somebody really really badly.<eos> What's it doing in here?<eos> We'll go over sarcasm later.<eos> That's a thing that women used to wear.<eos> Some probably do actually still.
We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
Its core contains an extremely rare substance called tantalum-181.<eos> That's what they came here for.<eos> Peralta.<eos> How do asteroid guts make a bomb?<eos> They don't.
That tests have proven, without a doubt... that Simon is your biological father... and I'm your mother, but you know that.<eos> I always knew he was our father.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> - She doesn't?
I always knew he was our father.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> - She doesn't?<eos> - I do.
Stop. Thank you.<eos> You believed I could be King before anyone else.<eos> Before even I did.<eos> It meant the world to me.<eos> It still does.
Copy that.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> She's tough.<eos> Trust me, you do not want to mess with Miss Loretta.<eos> No, I don't.
But when Denton got injured in the chopper crash, Max took his place to ensure the operation would go as planned.<eos> It's because of him none of those kids were hurt... and I get to see the birth of my first child.<eos> I should've waited for a better window of opportunity.<eos> Don't, sir. Feel guilty?<eos> A little part of me does, as well.
Now we, uh... We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'm your man.<eos> Perfect.<eos> First, we'll need some supplies for your science project.<eos> I don't have a science project due.<eos> Well, you do now.
All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
He was killed during the attack.<eos> Odd to have a common criminal target naval technology.<eos> Unless someone hired him.<eos> How did Commander Owens kill the intruder?<eos> He didn't.
That girl you stalked.<eos> Was she a patient?<eos> He wanted me to see it.<eos> Thought it would scare me off.<eos> But it didn't.
Not like that.<eos> Not like you.<eos> There was my wife.<eos> She didn't know what she was getting into.<eos> Still doesn't.
Not like you.<eos> There was my wife.<eos> She didn't know what she was getting into.<eos> Still doesn't.<eos> But Suzanne does.
She said you weren't coming back.<eos> She just wanted to be the one with you.<eos> I think she gets tired, being the strong one.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
I got this.<eos> Dad-gummit.<eos> Ugh, I told you.<eos> She made us.<eos> She did not.
Was that your plan?<eos> Just to agree to whatever I wanted?<eos> And then screw me over, because as desperate as you are, you and I both know that you would never let me out of here.<eos> Do you like Batman?<eos> I don't.
It's showtime.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Who wants to see what he's gonna do?<eos> - I do!
Scott was a local distributor of farm equipment. Bridget cut hair at a salon in the mall.<eos> Yet they were murdered by a family annihilator.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> The Bergstrom family had their share of dirty laundry.<eos> Though who of us does not?
ELTs are notoriously unreliable, especially if they're... submerged underwater.<eos> We've narrowed the search field to 220 square miles.<eos> SAR teams are gearing up now.<eos> I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen, but I don't know if I have the strength to lose her again.<eos> None of us do.
That's not possible.<eos> There's only one rail line in the area.<eos> The train was going at least 40.<eos> It should've passed you two minutes ago.<eos> No, it didn't.
W-We're working on it.<eos> Hold on?<eos> We have less than a minute.<eos> All right, I found the circuit board.<eos> - What do I do?
I thought the boys got in a bit of a scrap.<eos> "Bit of a scrap"?<eos> My father trusted you!<eos> Did you even read Shane's autopsy report?<eos> You did!
Next, I have to trim his antennae... and, I kid you not, attach a teeny-tiny electrode wire to each one.<eos> Go in the hole.<eos> And all the while keeping him on ice to make sure he doesn't wake up.<eos> -How do you know it's a him?<eos> -Actually, I don't.
Look at the E. Coli in Nora's blood sample.<eos> They're covered in antibodies.<eos> No antibodies in Eugene's sample.<eos> So Nora's white blood cells produce antibodies, that can fight the bacteria and stop the toxin.<eos> Eugene's don't.
- The Russian Soyuz capsule.<eos> - Even if he could get to it, the force of gravity alone on the journey could burst his appendix.<eos> Lenny, we're gonna try to override that lockdown.<eos> But in the meantime, do you have a pulse oximeter there?<eos> - I do.

That's great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.
Yeah, it's really...<eos> No, it's terrible, because what if he asks for money? What if she can't say no?<eos> What if she gets caught up in his whirlwind of manipulation?<eos> Did she put it that way?<eos> No, I did.
Alabama.<eos> With stops in Okinawa and Hamburg?<eos> Other way around. Hamburg first.<eos> What did you major in at Yale?<eos> I didn't.
Zoom in on the wrist, Garcia.<eos> That rope, it's called shibari.<eos> It's an intricate form of BDSM bondage.<eos> The last time Mr. Scratch needed BDSM gear, he used a fake name. My name, actually. My name, actually, to buy it.<eos> Well, maybe he did the same thing with Carl Brubaker.
She could be unconscious by now.<eos> We are not alone.<eos> It's just like The Birds.<eos> Probably didn't see that film.<eos> I did.
He was poisoned.<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> Abbs, McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
And who knows?<eos> Someday we might go back to my castle.<eos> And you might be king.<eos> I kind of think I need to finish high school first.<eos> Well, of course you do.
It does make your hand a bit dirty.<eos> But, no, that's a handy reminder. It is.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No, you're absolutely right 'cause you know, sometimes you drive an unfamiliar car, you're on the motorway and you think, "Oh, did I change into sixth?<eos> Yeah, I did."
Yeah.<eos> Plus-<eos> - Plus, James May lost the tent bag.<eos> - Soz.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
You erm...<eos> You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
What are we going to ask him when he gets here?<eos> I'm gonna ask him, actually, about erm... that story he told me once when we were on holiday.<eos> No, you can't ask him about that on air.<eos> Ofcom, they won't like it.<eos> Why does Ofcom...
It was now time to get down to business.<eos> But first, we went out for some sighting laps. Whoa!<eos> It's all skiddy!<eos> - Oh, this is very narrow.<eos> - James did this.
Ford knew that if you wanted to rule in motorsport, there was only one race that mattered.<eos> The toughest and most dangerous of them all - the 24 Hours of Le Mans.<eos> Levegh's Mercedes collides and blows up.<eos> The problem was, for all its might, Ford didn't have a clue how to win at Le Mans.<eos> However, over in Italy, someone did.
All we're doing on our journey is driving three beach buggies to the Angolan border.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Which doesn't further the cause of humanity.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And this does, does it?
Why would I need an old one?<eos> I was drafted right after the wedding.<eos> So you didn't have a chance to dip, sir.<eos> You snot.<eos> I did.
Deirdre doesn't like anyone else talking in Morning Meeting.<eos> She's so in love with the sound of her own...<eos> Voice!<eos> I mean, it's got powers.<eos> It does something to me.
But the pieces are moving faster now, and I can't catch them all.<eos> I can feel them slipping through my fingertips.<eos> And soon where there used to be my granddaughter breathing and my son laughing, there will be... nothing.<eos> I know it feels like you have all the time in the world.<eos> But you don't.
Bang.<eos> Dead.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> You knew him how?<eos> I didn't.
I don't know that one.<eos> You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?<eos> I don't know it, Dad.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I don't.
Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
I'm the man I've always been...<eos> Or is that what you're worried about?<eos> Feel good?<eos> Like you proved something to me today?<eos> Because you didn't.
I can still get them, Shelby.<eos> What if they're not there when you go back?<eos> Do you think I'm not cut out for this?<eos> - I just wish you'd taken the risk.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Nixon was on it. He sounded terrified about Rittenhouse, mentioned something about a document.<eos> Destroy the doc. How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two.<eos> I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
That station's been abandoned for years.<eos> I'll call FBI S.W.A.T. New York.<eos> I'll be handling Kirk on my own, Harold.<eos> If you expect us to stand down...<eos> I do.
If you're ever gonna get comfortable with this situation...<eos> No, I don't have time.<eos> - Then just listen.<eos> - I don't have time.<eos> No, none of us do.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.

They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
Sleeping with the man who could get you fired.<eos> Why?<eos> Why compromise the entire mission for sex?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I don't.
I think you'll have your secret weapon locked and loaded before the regionals.<eos> Dr. Webber, do you think I would push her to get surgery for some silly tournament?<eos> She's tried to drop out of the team six times, and that team is the only thing that keeps the lot of us from sitting around, watching TV in the common room, and moldering away like all the other old, wet sponges.<eos> She needs to stay in the game.<eos> We all do.
by myself, apparently, because you can't be bothered to sleep at home.<eos> I've had patients.<eos> Every night for the past two weeks?<eos> - You didn't have to stay here.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...<eos> It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship when they played the Broncos.<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Anyway, I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.<eos> And I did.
Is that unusual?<eos> Well, they've been sharing the same hot tub the last nine months; you can't bust them up right away.<eos> No, I'm not concerned.<eos> Did she tell you what we named them?<eos> No, actually, she didn't.
Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> You know, but I'm also a realist, and I understand there's a possibility that she doesn't wake up.<eos> Or what if she does...
You're not the first couple to go for a home run in that locker.<eos> I'm gonna have to take you in.<eos> No, come on, mate.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> I don't?
It's not safe.<eos> We should go out and find help.<eos> If you want to leave, so be it.<eos> I'd rather not be trapped in here with fools.<eos> Don't do it, dude.
The only thing I'm planning is getting my work done.<eos> Sure, you are.<eos> Come clean, or we'll tell everybody about your mistress.<eos> I don't have a mistress.<eos> You don't?
Walter!<eos> It's no use.<eos> He's out.<eos> All right, so if he's out cold, how we gonna get the oxygen to him?<eos> We don't.
Timing has to be perfect.<eos> Sly?<eos> Do you have any idea how many variables need to be computed in order to make Cabe and Walter intersect?<eos> No!<eos> But you do.
I can't stop thinking about that guy, you know?<eos> I don't know what I would have done if I was him.<eos> All that guilt.<eos> How do you deal with that?<eos> He obviously never did.
I'd expect to see intracranial bleeding within hours.<eos> Treatment?<eos> He's been receiving transfusions for many years.<eos> If I give him another at this point, he's liable to suffer autoimmune shock.<eos> - And if you don't?
My father left me at a fire station the day I was born.<eos> He just took off.<eos> But this year, Andy, this year I found him.<eos> It took me 36 years, but I found him, and I forgave him.<eos> And my mother... She did some things, too.
And 'cause I'm an idiot.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Christopher Herrmann.<eos> He does?
Sorry, what are we talking about?<eos> The little boy, from the warehouse accident. He didn't make it.<eos> Matt came by and brought some "get well" flowers, but the kid was gone.<eos> I figured he told you.<eos> N... no. He didn't.
I mean, who knows what could happen to this patch of land over 260 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know. No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
Me.<eos> Do people ever say that to you?<eos> That you look like a young Chris MacNeil?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Well, you do.
The night of the jump, something changed.<eos> I didn't want Bennett to die.<eos> I tried to get him to call off the jump.<eos> But he wouldn't listen.<eos> He never did.
And now I know better.<eos> You can't help me.<eos> Really?<eos> You think you know everything.<eos> You don't.
This isn't you.<eos> George, it's not.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
We can do this.<eos> NYPD's gonna start upstairs with the body, They got no reason to look in the VCR.<eos> We can put the tape back in the closet before anybody notices it's missing.<eos> We just have to wait until they make it an official crime scene.<eos> What do we do until then?
Is that, is that right?<eos> Hey, whatever. I respectfully disagree.<eos> - Okay? - So, Norm. Mm-hmm.<eos> He give you any names that maybe we should get in contact with?<eos> He did.
'Sup?<eos> What's up?<eos> Roommate not home?<eos> Look, you don't got to worry about Miracella anymore, all right?<eos> But you do.
You want to talk about why you're back in here?<eos> You know, we can't help you unless you decide to help yourself.<eos> You people can't help me.<eos> You'll only make it worse.<eos> You always do.
I thought it was best for her, you know?<eos> For all of us.<eos> Somewhere along the way, I... it became what was best for me.<eos> I-I don't think I wanted to admit it, but I changed.<eos> We both did.
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
I have one condition.<eos> I need you to check in every day, no matter what.<eos> I need to know you're ok.<eos> It's understood.<eos> I don't...
You ended up working for him.<eos> My ex-husband.<eos> Do you think it was just a coincidence that he offered you the job right after we got divorced?<eos> He wanted to win.<eos> And he did.
So was Cole right?<eos> Are we measuring them wrong?<eos> No idea.<eos> Do we have any idea why a Wall Street guy was studying this stuff in the first place?<eos> We don't.
You can't build a fence around every house in the country, Bill.<eos> I know.<eos> If, heaven forbid, that monster does strike again, you will catch him.<eos> They will put him away for years.<eos> What if this time he does something worse?
Folks, this way.<eos> How's the kid holding up?<eos> He's pretty shaken.<eos> Tell me you got something.<eos> Yeah. I do.
Too many people worshipping at the altar of the Angel of Sacred Heart.<eos> Who would besmirch an angel?<eos> It's blasphemy.<eos> The hospital wants her hemophilia B cure.<eos> A lot of hospitals do...
That sounds wildly unfair.<eos> It's called the Halo Effect.<eos> Juries apply their love of local lawyers to whoever they represent.<eos> So how did you beat them the last time?<eos> I didn't.
You were a kid.<eos> You signed a binding legal document?<eos> - Benny, easy.<eos> - No, that man promised me he would find a cure for my sister.<eos> And he didn't.
Like you had a-a-a toaster and a clock, and hadn't squished 'em into one.<eos> Sure.<eos> If that helps you.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> It-it kind of does.
Hey, we just want to pay for the...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Hello?<eos> How you girls doing?
What?<eos> ! Who the heck is Torres?<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I ran from you guys.<eos> But do I look like the kind of person that would shoot someone?<eos> No. No, I don't.
See what you can do for Burton.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> It was two white kids.<eos> She didn't mean it.<eos> They never do.
- Oh. - Sorry.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> You don't have to act like you care.<eos> No, but I do.
Your daughter worked? She made the money so you wouldn't have to?<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> I swear, I don't know what happened to her.<eos> - I don't know who took her.<eos> - I do.
I know who you are.<eos> Now, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Listen, I am not here trying to cause any problems.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how you knew Sarah Keaton.<eos> I don't.
Now. And I just... for the life of me can't figure out why she would've done that.<eos> I mean, you guys were having marital problems.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Well, my point is that Sarah never called you.<eos> But someone did. Her brother.
This whole international thing you're doing here. But...<eos> I don't want a kidney from just anyone.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- Did you take my advice?<eos> - What advice?<eos> You know, about living your life.<eos> Are you asking me if I have a guy here? I don't know.<eos> Do you?
There's no stairs!<eos> I'm never gonna make it!<eos> You were standing earlier in the day next to the car that hit my wife.<eos> I would soon return to New York a changed man, because, for me, that will always be the summer that I finally put my head underwater.<eos> I did it!
It happens all the time.<eos> Tomas, St. Anthony's will be shuttered, whether you accept this promotion or not.<eos> And, believe me, it is a promotion.<eos> You don't want me here.<eos> Of course we do.
- Hmm? You've done a great job, but I'm gonna have to demote you.<eos> - Shouldn't be a manager, because you should be a manager.<eos> Are you just saying words in no particular order?<eos> We asked Donovan to bring in a couple of his "hottest friends."<eos> And he sure did.
But impossible for the human eye to detect.<eos> It was already a bloody surgery, making it difficult to see clearly.<eos> But when Robeson commanded Atticus to cut into one of the hard-to-reach fibroids, it nicked one of Erica's blood vessels.<eos> Terry didn't make a mistake.<eos> Atticus did.
Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
We've done it before.<eos> You're referring to Kitty.<eos> Kitty, who never graduated, burned a man's face off and fled the country.<eos> She had a lot of baggage.<eos> He doesn't?
Yes.<eos> I would remember that smile anywhere.<eos> I-I used to be Joyce Devlin.<eos> You probably wouldn't remember me.<eos> Of course I do, Joyce.
What did it get you?<eos> You're gonna die in here.<eos> Unless you wake up right now.<eos> But I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did. The first Mexican Pope.
I mean, did you know... did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?<eos> It's so cute, man.<eos> It would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess...<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you don't.
- Did you clean your car?<eos> I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part:<eos> I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.<eos> Who has a favorite font?<eos> The Santiagos do.
Why did I use a title page?<eos> Relax, Jake, it's okay.<eos> Actually, I'm quite impressed.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Yeah, you did a ton of research here.
- Work appointments are in Cybermart green, and personal appointments are in blue.<eos> It's a blue!<eos> It's a personal!<eos> She's going on a date.<eos> What do I do?
I will tell my son ivar to tell his brothers that you did everything you could to save me.<eos> That you and I, we are sworn friends and that king aelle was solely responsible for my death.<eos> That way, when my sons come back... And they will... They will spare you, my friend...<eos> And they will take out all of their revenge on king aelle.<eos> Then do it.
I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the Gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.
So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the Gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
I'll talk about the Gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.<eos> My people do.
Don't leave, I'm in the elevator!<eos> Where's my bullets?<eos> Where'd I put 'em?<eos> Well, why were you shooting off your gun?<eos> I didn't.
So Susie contacted you?<eos> We never met in person, but somehow she got the word that I was the man to see about decoding an encrypted message from 1963.<eos> Breaking old ciphers is something of a hobby of mine.<eos> Well, I politely declined, hoping she would drop the investigation.<eos> She obviously didn't.
Jury selection is never perfect.<eos> That's why we have a head start.<eos> This is tomorrow's jury pool.<eos> How did you get... I mean, nobody gets this in advance.<eos> We do.
It's gigantic.<eos> Charles, this is amazing.<eos> - I know, when's the last time you cried like that?<eos> You cried?<eos> - Damn right, I did.
- Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but...<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
I kind of need your help here.<eos> Okay, do you...<eos> do you recognize him? Look close, okay?<eos> Why did you break into her house?<eos> I didn't.
So keep away from the site. That out-of-body experience on her blog. I did it.<eos> - Go to hell. - Don't lie.<eos> Really!<eos> When I opened my eyes, I saw myself sleeping.<eos> Then what did you do?
There's no proof that memo wasn't just made up.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Nina kept a copy.<eos> Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?<eos> She did.
We're awesome!<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why aren't we really?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Hunched over, like he had a stomachache.<eos> I just thought he was sick.<eos> So now you're wondering if this was an addict who was in withdrawal?<eos> Well, Dr. Krieg told him to leave.<eos> And he did.
You cut the line on me again yesterday.<eos> Hello?<eos> [narrating] This became a 24-hour job.<eos> If Ali wanted to answer, he would.<eos> If he didn't, he didn't.
I don't recognize that voice.<eos> Who is that?<eos> It's a friend, Nana!<eos> I do have more than one!<eos> No, you don't.
I-I feel...<eos> I feel really bad about what's happening with the play.<eos> I know it means a lot to you.<eos> You know, I was super mad at you, but then, I realized you've got a lot more going on than people think.<eos> - I do.
I feel really bad about what's happening with the play.<eos> I know it means a lot to you.<eos> You know, I was super mad at you, but then, I realized you've got a lot more going on than people think.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do?
Come on, Jimbo.<eos> We don't have to go there.<eos> For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command!<eos> Holla!<eos> Or maybe we do.
Right? Tobes.<eos> Who is that masked mole?<eos> You ever wonder?<eos> You didn't hear a word I said just then, did you?<eos> Sure, I did.
If the hunter is foolish enough to deal with him, I doubt they will return.<eos> Did you bring the charm I require?<eos> Do you know what to do with it?<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Of course I do.
How can you function with only two eyes?<eos> Ooh! You didn't happen to overhear who Strickler brought back with him, did you?<eos> Some troll with big horns and a weird staff, maybe?<eos> - Sorry, I do not know.<eos> - Yeah, well, neither do we.
Come on!<eos> - What in the heck is going on? - Kids today.<eos> - Steve, stop this!<eos> - Why couldn't you let me win this?<eos> - But then you never do, do you?
- Who the hell knows?<eos> - Quick, let's go.<eos> - Don't use your cell phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They did.
And you, my love, are to die for.<eos> No phoners come through here.<eos> Phoners don't like English food.<eos> English people don't like English food.<eos> - Hey, I do, mister.
The school.<eos> No.<eos> We have to go back there.<eos> We don't even know where that is.<eos> Jeb did.
I must.<eos> I have to.<eos> I have to prove it.<eos> Leo, do you know what people get around here when they demand the truth?<eos> Do you?
No.<eos> He was killed in an accident.<eos> But at first you believed he was murdered, right?<eos> Sit down.<eos> At first, yes, I did.
So, what do you want? You want to take a hit out on Rivera?<eos> Oh, God damn it, you people drive me crazy.<eos> You pretend like you're this normal person, this lovable mother, this working wife and shit, and that's what makes you so dangerous.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about. - Of course you do.<eos> Of course you do.
- He was talking to the IMF.<eos> I heard.<eos> He said a referendum.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - He promised.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did.
What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
Oh, so you think he's playing hard to get?<eos> Or the more likely scenario:<eos> He lost his phone in, like, a fire.<eos> Yeah, I think he lost his phone.<eos> I do too.
Fuck is a great word.<eos> Fuck is a great word.<eos> Fuck... Ahh!<eos> Oh, man, that don't look good at all.<eos> No, it don't.
It's like the world being reborn from below while it's being eroded from above.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, when we get back I'm gonna buy you a TV.<eos> Because nobody gives a fuck about shifting tectonic plates.<eos> Well, I do.
What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No...<eos> No one does.
And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
And drugs. They think you're selling a lot of drugs.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And what did you tell them?<eos> That you didn't.
So, does your good wife know that you brought all you have in the world here tonight, and givin' it to a stranger?<eos> - No, Sir.<eos> - You're full of surprises, aren't you?<eos> So... the Essex did not return to port.<eos> - She did not.
- Sure thing. - Yeah. Somebody say "Do that shit Do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it<eos> Say, "Do that shit, do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it Say, "Do that shit, do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it
You okay to drive? No.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Good night, Andre. Nah.<eos> See, I can't help thinking, maybe you want me to come inside.<eos> Of course I do.
These are cancelled checks.<eos> They all bounced. And these are past due.<eos> Jerry took advantage of you.<eos> I know it's a lot, but you had to know the truth sometime.<eos> Now you do.
Guys, can you hear me?<eos> I made it.<eos> Ben, look at this place.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We did it.
Reed, come on!<eos> The re-entry's not working!<eos> I don't know what to do!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Reed! Do something!
They had a kid!<eos> We're fine. We're totally fine. What if one of the neighbors saw my license plate?<eos> No one saw you.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> - They didn't.
There it is.<eos> Look. We fucking did it.<eos> - I told you we could do it.<eos> - We made it.<eos> We did it. We fucking did it.
WELL... WE'RE PRETTY FREE WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> BUT, Y-YOU HAVE TO ADMIT I-I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN...<eos> LIKE, LESS FREE WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> BUT WE HAVE SEX EVERY WEEK WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> WE DO.
And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
What?<eos> Your planet is a farm Jupiter.<eos> There are thousands of planets like yours set up by families like mine to supply an ever increasing demand for more time.<eos> Are you saying you killed a hundred people to make this?<eos> Not me, but yes, someone did.
We can't hold much longer.<eos> Set a portal.<eos> Now.<eos> I don't need to tell you how dangerous...<eos> Then don't!
Be careful.<eos> Not in the habit.<eos> Not you. Him.<eos> So, all that made sense to you?<eos> It didn't to you?
- Why don't you help me.<eos> - With what?<eos> If I had 15 minutes, we'd drink tea, eat biscuits,<eos> I'd talk, you'd laugh, and we'd be on our way.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't.
Can I go see her?<eos> She's exhausted but you might be able to get in a few words.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> I know why you ran away.<eos> You do?
When?<eos> Can I call you later?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> You got a date?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't scare me.<eos> Laurel Hester gave the citizens of Ocean County justice for 23 years, and now she's asking you to give her justice in return!<eos> - You have the power!<eos> - We don't have that option.<eos> You do!
And then when she dies, I'd get her pension, no questions asked.<eos> I could pass it along to Stacie, no problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical hard ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system, or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!<eos> Look out, mices!<eos> Oh, well. Never mind.<eos> Let's do it here.<eos> Do what here?
And he took him away from me.<eos> I can't let you go back out there.<eos> Not again.<eos> I ain't afraid to die anymore.<eos> I done it already.
That's so nice of you.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> "No, you didn't. I didn't say..."<eos> Yes, you did. And thank...<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.
Socks?<eos> They...<eos> What the...?<eos> I never knew why I couldn't talk to Toby.<eos> Now I did.
- You have the...<eos> - Dana has this covered.<eos> You stay the fuck out of it.<eos> Hey, John. You can't do this.<eos> Ari, I just did.
So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.<eos> Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.<eos> 'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.<eos> - You remember.<eos> - Of course, I do.
Cut!<eos> Super!<eos> - Good! It's good, Martin.<eos> - That can't work.<eos> No, it does work.
- There is none.<eos> - What do you mean there is none?<eos> I have the phone number for the French co-producer.<eos> - Leave it be.<eos> - But I do!
It belonged to my grandmother.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> You gave it to me the night after I overdosed.<eos> Remember you said it would protect me?<eos> I sure don't.
Um...<eos> There's a lot of-- stuff in the-- in the garage to pack.<eos> She made some beautiful things, didn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
You'll give me a heart attack.<eos> She looks like a young Jackie O.<eos> - I look absurd with her. - Yes, you do.<eos> We have to make her sign a prenup, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
What fun stuff? Like...<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> Right? - No, you said a day.<eos> Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Apparently.<eos> Maybe I do need a shot.<eos> No, you don't. No, you don't.<eos> You got the kids upstairs.<eos> So what did you do, anyway? In your better days.
I haven't really gotten much sleep, man.<eos> - What are you try to ask me...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I don't fucking... I just told you...<eos> What did you do?
Tony Weeks... is caught between two monsters,<eos> - as they fire away... - What is he doing?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - What is he doing?<eos> What did he do to my dad?
Because it must have been so tough for her to get through the day with her mermaid hair and her gumdrop ass.<eos> Lay off her. You killed her.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> - You really cared about Lorelei?<eos> - Yeah, I did, actually.
Is it true, Deon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you my maker.<eos> Why'd you just make me so I could die?<eos> I didn't...
There's so many.<eos> - BURRIDGE:<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> How you doing, huh?
I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
- Sure.<eos> You work hard, Mr. Rezendes. Are you married?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And your wife doesn't mind you working all the time?<eos> Yeah, she does.
Play nice, you two.<eos> I'm not playing anything. She can't mind her own business.<eos> Only because I care.<eos> You just have nothing better to do.<eos> -Yes, I do.
- It's gonna know, okay.<eos> - I can put it in a cup.<eos> - It's got to be blessed by a priest.<eos> - Not going to make a difference.<eos> - Not doing this without the holy water, guys.
You're just like everyone else, Patrick.<eos> You don't give a fuck who hurts as long as it is not you.<eos> She's lying! Patrick! Patrick!<eos> Bitch deserved it.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Uh-huh. Nobody knows we're alive.<eos> This is our chance.<eos> These buildings. Do these look over Snow's gardens?<eos> - I...<eos> - They do.
It's a jet pack.<eos> Obviously.<eos> You made this yourself?<eos> Athena, what are you doing here?<eos> Did you or didn't you?
I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
You didn't just walk through a wormhole?<eos> You're making me feel like I did.<eos> I just met you.<eos> Then why are you acting like you know me?<eos> I don't.
The truth will set you free.<eos> The ID number matches the one that came through the wormhole.<eos> But that's probably just a coincidence.<eos> You people don't believe in coincidences.<eos> Sure we do. Yeah.
All right. I'm not afraid of that.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> - No. I don't smoke.<eos> - Doesn't mean you don't want some.<eos> Yes, it does.
Will you do that for me?<eos> I don't have a chip on my shoulder.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But don't give them a reason to say you do.<eos> I don't.
I dropped out of college after a semester, but, okay, let's have a look.<eos> You will support your daughter and her mother.<eos> Did you pay someone $1,500 to bless your house?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Did you?
Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.<eos> It is laying off about 2,500 people.<eos> Apple is continuing to lose market share with no new innovations in the pipeline except the Newton, a pet project of CEO John Sculley.<eos> If you really want to be mobile, you want a Newton PDA.<eos> But, then again, maybe you don't.
And knowing that, that's the difference.<eos> It's not binary.<eos> You can be decent and gifted at the same time.<eos> He didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You want to watch from backstage?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go, Cue 1.<eos> You remember that painting you did on the original Mac?<eos> I do.
But you insisted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Yes, you did, remember?<eos> Remember?<eos> I did.
It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer,areyouthere?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> Ifthesystemisa lie, automated, how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
Yeah?<eos> Is that what you were thinking when I was laying there dying?<eos> When you were looking at your little photo?<eos> I'm sorry, I made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
It's so bogus!<eos> I should have known something was up with this place.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> What the hell kind of summer camp has waterbeds?<eos> What do we do now?
Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
If you ever loved me, stop.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I can't.<eos> I couldn't even if I wanted to,<eos> But I really, really don't.
Get the fuck down!<eos> Back up! He loves it, he gets off on this, he loves seeing the fear In his victims' eyes, look at your daddy.<eos> You love it?<eos> You like seeing this?<eos> Oh you don't?
You want to eat panties? I have Alicia's panties!<eos> You remember...<eos> You done?<eos> Are you gonna shut the fuck up now? You remember her, Alicia!<eos> - You done?
- Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, I...<eos> I thought you moved to Brooklyn.<eos> Yeah, no, I did, I umm...
Call me Tip.<eos> It was a new home, a new country.<eos> I tried to make friends at school... but I was this nerd from Barbados.<eos> But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Tell me.<eos> I need $500,000 to buy me five years.<eos> Right now, I'm only short $499,500.<eos> - Well, luck will find you then. - I know.<eos> When it does,
If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
Did you see it?<eos> What?<eos> The deer.<eos> Where you got out, it's where we hit something when we arrived.<eos> - Did you?
A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right.<eos> You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> - I did, just not all in one place.
That's an extreme transformation!<eos> That's incredible.<eos> Can I keep this? I'm going to need to keep this.<eos> How long have you felt robotic?<eos> I don't.
Pull all night, you know.<eos> 'Cause tomorrow's the show and I don't... feel confident.<eos> I don't want to let you down.<eos> Pfeifer.<eos> I really don't
Her hair is nice.<eos> Good facial symmetry.<eos> Delicate features.<eos> Nice fashion sense.<eos> Yes, I do.
On some level, she regrets abandoning her graduate study.<eos> She's proud of her achievement in the field of entertainment gaming. But this does not supplant some imagined ideologized future in which she is a successful roboticist.<eos> Well, that's good info.<eos> She also doesn't like to be touched unexpectedly.<eos> Yeah, most people don't.
That's a laugh.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Only that I find it amusing to hear proper manners invoked by someone who tries to bust in on young ladies while they're pissing.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Mike, did you go to college?<eos> I did not.<eos> On your resume, it said that you went to Ithaca College.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I have a 3:55 appointment with Ms. ostin.<eos> 3:55?<eos> I thought she was meeting with her new intern.<eos> That's me.<eos> How you doing?
I love this house.<eos> It just looks happy to me.<eos> Like, if it was in a kid's book, it would make you feel good when you turned the page and saw it.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
Oh, relax, fellas. This is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> The key is under a flowerpot.<eos> We go in, we delete, we disappear.<eos> She doesn't have an alarm, right? Nope.<eos> She does not.
-Interrupt her.<eos> Ben, what's up?<eos> Jules, your mother has an alarm.<eos> -No, she doesn't.<eos> -Yes, she does.
- How do you know?<eos> - Because I was there.<eos> - Did you kill him?<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> He did it himself.
So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> - You don't know her?<eos> - (Chuckles) I do.
So...<eos> Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.<eos> - Yeah. - (Chuckles) Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,<eos> I'd have to say no for your sake. So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?<eos> I didn't.
- I can't leave.<eos> Look. You can't stay.<eos> We just killed those men.<eos> We didn't kill them.<eos> You did.
- I don't understand.<eos> - Prime Minister, your life is in danger.<eos> I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location.<eos> Sir. Does the name, Solomon Lane, ring a bell?<eos> Yes. Unfortunately, it does.
- It was her.<eos> Was she right?<eos> Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
- How about "none-ce"?<eos> - Shut it down!<eos> - Nope, not gonna happen.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> And you do?
- Oh, it's not-- - for the vegetarians.<eos> Has she been acting like this all night?<eos> Yeah. David, too.<eos> Look, I'm all for whatever you gotta do to get by, especially you two, with what you went through, but you didn't lose your mind.<eos> Oh, I didn't?
I should have said: Therese. Wait.<eos> Who the hell is turning around in my drive?<eos> I should go.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
- What did you do to the machine?<eos> You know, I'm just making some modifications.<eos> Modifications?<eos> Why?<eos> We did a full systems check yesterday.
Listen, I have some great news for you, Chuck.<eos> The Winter Dance is in a few weeks and I'm saving a dance for you.<eos> Anyway, Marcie put me in charge of the refreshment committee.<eos> I took it upon myself and signed you up to make the cupcakes.<eos> You did what?
Why do you hate them so much?<eos> You should ask my mother and my sisters.<eos> - I never met 'em.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> You never did.
I fucked it up.<eos> Fucked it up a long time ago.<eos> Why'd you take care of me?<eos> 'Cause I need you.<eos> We all do.
- You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, Eugene, listen to me, you did the right thing.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You did the right thing.
- You're in Spain.<eos> - And you're in a swanky suit.<eos> Jim, why are you here?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - No, I don't.
Hand up.<eos> Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found! - Well?<eos> - My grandfather did.
James, you gotta throw something back!<eos> Darnell!<eos> Save me!<eos> Attention inmates, lockdown in five minutes.<eos> What did they do to my yard?
Please, stop!<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> Just, to hell with college, to hell with growing up?<eos> Greg, don't.
What bullshit.<eos> It's bullshit and she knows it.<eos> She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.
Don't mess up!<eos> Robert, if he scores, I'll double up your 600.<eos> - I'll go to the bank right now.<eos> - Kid, it's not worth it.<eos> And if he doesn't?
You piece of shit!<eos> Killing my family pup wasn't enough for you huh?<eos> What are you gonna do now?<eos> You don't deserve him Johnny, you never did.<eos> - You never did!
Look at how he moves. Look at the shadows on his coat. Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
Swear to me that you're not going to hurt him.<eos> Swear it.<eos> Alright, I swear it.<eos> Diana, did you hear that?<eos> I did.
Finn's preparing the feeds now.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've taken it, but the more I think about it I don't think he has more.<eos> Oh, he does.
Not a single one.<eos> They don't even move in their sleep.<eos> How is your leg?<eos> Didn't you use my herbal cream?<eos> I did.
That is not even how I talk.<eos> You talk exactly like this.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Because of the wink and...<eos> It's a hundred percent "no".<eos> Dax, I swear, if this kid was not my nephew.<eos> Hey, I know you're crazy busy, but have you had a chance to check-out those demos?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.
- Honey, I really...<eos> I really want to work things out. I do. I just...<eos> I don't want to not see you because of this.<eos> You know, I don't want to lose you for stupid reasons.<eos> Neither do I.
- Yes.<eos> - Marty and Jiselle can wait.<eos> - Didn't you park over at Harold's?<eos> - How do you know Harold?<eos> - They don't.
You seem really cool to me.<eos> I DJ'ed at my college radio station, the 2:00 am slot.<eos> We played Mudhoney, Superchunk, Trip Shakespeare, I mean...<eos> No one wants to hear about your glory days in college radio, Dylan. Okay?<eos> I do.
Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.<eos> How does my wife?
You can find someone else. We can't.<eos> So don't sit there... thinking that we've not been doing anything for you... because we bloody have.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hold on, Josh, one sec.<eos> What, did I do something wrong?
- Voja says he won'! be going soon.<eos> Does he drink?<eos> -Who?<eos> Voja!<eos> - He does...
We received a report...<eos> I see you, Bashkiml.!<eos> I got here first!<eos> No you didn't!<eos> -I did!
Tell us who shot you.<eos> A Serb.<eos> Where is the gun'?<eos> I don't know...<eos> - You don't?
I'll pay.<eos> That could be awkward.<eos> Don't talk to me about awkward.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> The others do!
So how much do your parents pay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
So how much do your parents pay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> I don't.
One of these babies can go right through a man.<eos> - Mark!<eos> - You wanna see it work?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, you do.
They don't understand this.<eos> Just gonna get you stable first, OK?<eos> You're gonna be OK.<eos> - I thought I lost you.<eos> - You did.
- But the math doesn't add up!<eos> You are offering us $ 100,000 in a down economy.<eos> What was your best bid from Aflac?<eos> Look! Do you want the job or not?<eos> Yes, he does.
What a baby ...<eos> I still need to talk to you.<eos> Before you do. There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> - You do?
Before you do. There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Every one does.
Why should it matter what it's for?<eos> It's my money.<eos> I work for it, don't I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Comfort.<eos> A safe harbor.<eos> As my wife.<eos> You must at least admire my persistence.<eos> I do.
How about a drink?<eos> How about your room?<eos> How the hell did they rob a bank?<eos> They'd have to have his... He did. They did.<eos> Someone did.
- I got a seven-year-old son in New York...<eos> - You have a son?<eos> Of course I have a son!<eos> I told you about him.<eos> - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did.
You gotta totally be loving living with him then, huh?<eos> Hey, you smoke, right?<eos> What do you mean, like, cigarettes?<eos> No, no, like...<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's like being in love with some tiny little brick wall.<eos> How the hell you understand her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's really hard.<eos> - I don't.
if it's news. I print it.<eos> Misty!<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I do.
Mitch, how much further?<eos> We're ten feet from the bell. Get ready to haul him in.<eos> Mitch, hurry up!<eos> Let's go. I need you to do the cylinders.<eos> Do the fucking cylinder!
Fit as a fiddle!<eos> Oh, it's burning...<eos> I... I can't go on...<eos> Want to die...<eos> No, I don't.
- Yes.<eos> How many times I had to wipe his ass because he couldn't use his hands?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No. You want brain damage.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Only thing is, it's tough to sleep at night sometimes. My back.<eos> No matter what you do, it catches up to you.<eos> Anyway, shall we see what's new in the world today?<eos> - Hey, Rocky!<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
Anyway, shall we see what's new in the world today?<eos> - Hey, Rocky!<eos> - Hey, how you doing?<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - How you doing?
Come on, just put your gloves on and stop talking so much.<eos> We got a few things to do.<eos> It's all about you.<eos> I already had my career.<eos> I did okay.
Do you have quarters?<eos> 'Cause it cost 50 cents.<eos> What, I've got to pay?<eos> No, because it doesn't exist.<eos> Yes, it does!
I'm here for you, okay.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> I'm gonna talk you through this, alright.<eos> Put your camera in. I want to see your room.<eos> Ewf. No, you don't.
I didn't know the police were here.<eos> This is my colleague. Detective<eos> The one I fucking told you about.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did, Helen Keller!
She's only kidding.<eos> Oh my god. It was a good one.<eos> Yeah, actually I'm not.<eos> I don't have a sense of humor.<eos> - No, you don't.
Do you see that, Father?<eos> Those are words of a king.<eos> - I don't want to be king!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not.
- Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> No, in fact, I don't want anything!<eos> Yes, you do.
Pop says they're just desperate, like all folk.<eos> Well, they can catch their own goddamn food.<eos> They don't know how to trap.<eos> They don't know the spots, how to catch 'em.<eos> Not like Pop does.
Yeah, We're... We're gonna get out of here, man.<eos> - Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man. No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
Who paid for them?<eos> - Was it your employer?<eos> - No?<eos> - I-I mean, he did, but it's not like that.<eos> He did? No?
- You're outnumbered, man.<eos> - He's right.<eos> It's over.<eos> Hey. You want to live, right? Yeah.<eos> But I don't...
The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Yes, of course, she does.
Just not to him, and I do have a daughter, Emily.<eos> I didn't lie about that. How many people in here do you think were married? Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I didn't lie about that. How many people in here do you think were married? Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> We all did.
Celal!<eos> Did you let her know?<eos> A slim waist and a good set of teeth.<eos> Celal, did you tell her that you don't want a moustache?<eos> I did.
Are you small kids? Tell him... Get lost.<eos> What's wrong? Did..<eos> Marbles? - Marbles?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> - I didn't either.
The bees... Didn't do it.<eos> The bees were not to blame.<eos> It was the wasps!<eos> Roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees.<eos> And he did.
Today's Friday and the end of the month.<eos> There's plenty of payroll and pension money at the bank.<eos> 67,547 from your account, without arousing any suspicion.<eos> I don't have that much money in my account.<eos> You don't?
No.<eos> - The world.<eos> - You think the kid's on something?<eos> - Ok, listen, when you step out the door...<eos> - No, no, you don't?
Pretty good, am I right?<eos> I like this kind, too.<eos> Kind of sweet, but pretty good.<eos> You really have a dog?<eos> I do.
I've seen you staring at her tits!<eos> My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No. I don't.
My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.
I love you so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Without a doctor, your heart is useless to me.<eos> If you were not my brother,<eos> I would have done this over 10 years ago.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> But you do.
Mom makes your favorite lunch.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> And at school, you see someone with no lunch at all.<eos> What do you do?
And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
I feel like you're just silently judging me.<eos> What do you even want anymore?<eos> Do you even want this wedding?<eos> Do you even want to marry me?<eos> Maybe I don't!
That was six years ago.<eos> And you never hired me anyway.<eos> When you bought Putnam, Powell Lowe, I came with the furniture.<eos> People come in and out of our doors all the time, Ken, but they don't walk out with $4 million of Birds Eye products.<eos> Of course they do.
His code name is the Watchmaker.<eos> He's one of the most wanted assassins in the world.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> How did you know I would come here?<eos> I didn't.
Now, once again, we do not have independent confirmation... is talking about a woman in Duluth, Georgia, who has called the local police to say...<eos> Visual on them, give me 20 feet.<eos> You two, the second team.<eos> So you're saying you didn't know him at all.<eos> No. I didn't.
Theresa. I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
The story was that when the KGB learned about Nina Kulagina's ability, they performed a test with a living frog.<eos> This was back in 1970.<eos> The Soviets wanted to see if Nina could telekinetically affect the bioelectrical impulses in living tissue.<eos> To speed up and slow down its heartbeat.<eos> And allegedly, she did.
Did you tell her all about it?<eos> I told her.<eos> When you meet these people, do you say to them... do you say that she was murdered?<eos> Please!<eos> No, you don't.
She's talented.<eos> She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Wolves.<eos> This is wolf country.<eos> Here. Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
He got us all involved in that Evangelical stuff, like that would make things better.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that.<eos> What was he like when he drank?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Who am I talking to here?<eos> My captain... or my friend?<eos> Both.<eos> - Maybe you don't wanna hear this?<eos> - Sure he does.
Law number two,<eos> "Those who fail to work hard, "those who skive or malinger, "will hereby know the brooding majesty of my disapproval."<eos> Mark me well. I know no pity.<eos> No second chances.<eos> I don't do mercy.
- Open the door, whore.<eos> Dirty whore, put that door.<eos> Damn.<eos> Zooi sucks.<eos> Now do the damn door, whore.
There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do. You deserve that.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> We both do.
That was then.<eos> And this new version of me doesn't feel like being friends.<eos> With anyone.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> How you doing?
Who cares?<eos> Yeah, I love it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Full disclosure, I've been stalking it online to see if it ever went on sale.<eos> - It didn't.
It's all right. Hi. Sorry, excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We have to get to Boston as soon as possible, but your machines aren't being very helpful.<eos> Um, I'm a triple-bonus platinum flier, so you need to wait in the back of the line.<eos> No, I don't.
And I have never seen this kind of behavior.<eos> I'll tell you, if an actor showed up like this on Kelly Girl...<eos> On what?<eos> Does no one remember my fucking show?<eos> I do.
You conniving bitch!<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> If she said she didn't move it, she didn't move it.<eos> Maybe he did it.
Um, listen, Bradley about New York, I...<eos> I can't.<eos> This is my home.<eos> I kinda figured.<eos> - You did?
Hey, uh-- All right.<eos> Fuck.<eos> David.<eos> I'm not so sure you want to be me.<eos> I don't.
Hit you?<eos> Would that make you feel better?<eos> What can we do to make you feel better?<eos> - I understand...<eos> - No, you don't!
Sorry.<eos> Do you have company?<eos> I just haven't picked up.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Doing some work on the house?
What you think I want?<eos> I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.
I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.<eos> You do that.
Okay, it must be this way.<eos> I walked that direction.<eos> I could not find any trail.<eos> You don't want to leave.<eos> I do.
Without job i cannot take care of my family.<eos> So you come here instead...<eos> You do not understand my culture.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
My wife kiiro she's so smart charming.<eos> We have one daughter, fuyu.<eos> Sorry I yelled at you, earlier.<eos> Maybe I deserved. No.<eos> No, you didn't.
At least from my eye, you used to love to go down there and walk.<eos> Those orchids.<eos> You'd be down there for hours, then you'd walk back up the stairs and you'd line 'em up right across that windowsill.<eos> You remember that.<eos> Of course I do.
Do you know who he is?<eos> Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the confederacy put on the head of major marquis?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?<eos> No they didn't.
I don't think that was the original idea, but... That's the idea now.<eos> - Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy? - Yeah.<eos> Five of you?<eos> Well, well, well, looks like minnie's haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.<eos> Yes it does.
According to the Yankees, it's a free country.<eos> Genaral Sandy smithers... Boy... Oh boy.<eos> Did my daddy talk about you.<eos> I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell.<eos> Me and my boys did our part.
Did my daddy talk about you.<eos> I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell.<eos> Me and my boys did our part.<eos> Just like erskine and his boys did their part.<eos> Hell yeah, we did.
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter?<eos> I tole' you jackass to hee-haw somewhere else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> - You did say, didn't ya'?<eos> - Yeah I did.
Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers, that you chose not to acknowledge.<eos> So what you gonna' do old man?<eos> You gonna' spend the next two or three days, ignore the nigger that killed your boy, ignoring how I made him suffer?<eos> Ignoring how I made him... Lick, all over my Johnson?<eos> The dumbest thing your boy ever did...
Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?
Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?
And if you lyin, which you are, then you killed minnie - and sweet Dave.<eos> Four measly bulltes and there goes senior, Bob.<eos> That still don't get us no closer... To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though.<eos> - Does it Chris?<eos> - No it sure don't.
If you had any brains, you would be.<eos> You see... Here's the problem Daisy.<eos> In order for me to be scared of your threats, I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waiting' it out in red rock.<eos> And boy, oh boy...<eos> I sure don't.
My name's not Jessica. It's Jess.<eos> Oh, I thought it was short for Jessica.<eos> It's not.<eos> Well, aside from not knowing your name, I feel like we've got really close.<eos> I do, too.
Tell me you killed Aster. Just say it.<eos> Probably didn't even pull the trigger.<eos> Just tell me who did.<eos> I just need to know.<eos> You did, honey.
Why?<eos> I didn't want to hurt your feelings, love, and I had an emotional... one.<eos> An emotional orgasm?<eos> Why does sex have to be so goal oriented?<eos> It doesn't.
Can anybody read me?<eos> Now, that is a real shame. Because we've got a very special show... in store for you today on Radio Harmony.<eos> Chock-full of contests, interviews... fantastic musical numbers.<eos> So let's begin with today's guests.<eos> How you doing, John Doe?
[MUSIC]... did your people kill Sajid Mir?<eos> No, sir.<eos> There's no question of our men being involved.<eos> Sir, we don't have permission to do all this.<eos> Of course you don't, Roy.
Is that not enough, Claire?<eos> Do you not want me anymore?<eos> Do ye wish to live separately?<eos> I feel that's what I should want.<eos> But I don't.
Yes. Yes, I'll have you.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If you ever raise a hand to me again, James Fraser, I will cut your heart out and have it for breakfast.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you?
It's the first time there's someone new since you broke up?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> You don't meet someone new every five minutes.<eos> Or I don't.
Various narcotics, happy pills.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - Cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy. Amphetamines.<eos> You know why she did it?<eos> Do you?
Out of all of you?<eos> Not counting Arabs and Blacks.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> - We don't have an appointment.<eos> - Sure we do.
Whenever there's an attack on that place... martial law.<eos> - I've never liked that place anyway.<eos> - Like you could afford to be inside.<eos> Hell, you don't know of anybody who's ever been in there.<eos> Like you do.
I want every officer we have in the area<eos> - diverted to that facility right now.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You did it.
Identify yourself, soldier.<eos> I'm Jack, the new intern.<eos> I'm just taking out the trash.<eos> - Don't we have a janitor for that?<eos> - You do.
- Oh, you don't have the password?<eos> - No, no.<eos> I don't wanna know the password, so I'm gonna have to rebuild the excel files from scratch.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can totally help, you know.<eos> Especially after what Ted did to you.
My doctor friend has a price of $20,000 American.<eos> Look Deacon I don't have that kind of cash on hand. Do you?<eos> George, what about you?<eos> For God's sakes, no.<eos> I do.
I didn't know that.<eos> George. I owe you.<eos> So listen to me.<eos> You don't really want the list.<eos> - Yes I do.
Daredevil wire walker.<eos> I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes! -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
You do not tell any adults for one simple reason.<eos> The future of this great town lies not with the adults but with you.<eos> Now, you may think what I'm asking is unfair.<eos> You may feel like your parents deserve to know.<eos> So did Chris.
Where'd you hear that?<eos> I didn't hear it. I'm their messenger.<eos> I deliver the money.<eos> Kim Koo thinks I skimmed off the top.<eos> So did you?
Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay. We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
Not the hair!<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Relax, it's a brother-sister fight.<eos> - You know what it's like.<eos> - No, I don't.
Well, you were never home.<eos> All your life out saving the world, you forgot about me.<eos> Since I'm going to die, I'll get it off my chest:<eos> Secret agents don't have kids.<eos> James Bond didn't, or Jason Bourne.
I signed up for driving lessons.<eos> And I'm coming to India with you. Or wherever.<eos> You want to travel?<eos> Let's travel.<eos> Or do skydiving?
Did the police find something?<eos> Not that we're aware of. And we've asked them to hold off questioning you until you're feeling more like yourself.<eos> Rachel, she...<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Yes, you do.
Who made this shit'?<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't be sorry, man.<eos> Just do.
Let's go.<eos> Lance, you see that shut, you take it, copy.<eos> Cutter, I'm hit.<eos> He shot my scope.<eos> How you doing?
I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv?<eos> le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.
Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv?<eos> le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't.
le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I don't.
An ambulance is on its way.<eos> Christos lost a lot of blood.<eos> You believed it.<eos> No I didn't.<eos> You did.
- Orega-what?<eos> - Oregano.<eos> So....<eos> Something special supposed to happen?<eos> It just did.
What, are you guys ganging up on me now?<eos> You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- Yes, boss.<eos> The blacksmith left it for me, boss.<eos> When a man escapes, he takes as much food with him as he can.<eos> - He leaves nothing behind.<eos> - But he did, boss.
Hello, Reverend.<eos> You wish to see me?<eos> Yes, yes - about the church.<eos> I know what you are about to say.<eos> ~ You do?
We could be here till morning.<eos> What would you like me to say?<eos> Something truthful.<eos> You think I hate you... .. and you are right.<eos> I do.
Where's the other one?<eos> ~ You have it.<eos> ~ No, I do not.<eos> ~ You have it.<eos> You do.
I won't tell Quinn, I promise.<eos> Covering it up feels weird.<eos> Not as weird as outing someone who's not ready yet, Rach.<eos> No, if you think that I wanted this just for the show, I...<eos> I don't... no, no, no.
Oh, lunch was just too exhausting?<eos> You know that girl's father was two years older than me?<eos> He drops dead.<eos> Yeah, he had a history.<eos> You don't.
"Barfing, too"?<eos> No.<eos> I would never.<eos> And how do you know what I eat, anyway?<eos> I-I just do.
Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
I mean, 'cause it's not like he's taking girlfriend advice from you at this point.<eos> You know what?<eos> I finally found myself a ringer.<eos> If anyone can turn him, it's her.<eos> How we doing?
Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Come on, nobody is guessing.<eos> That boy is going for Grace.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, you don't...
So you and her were...<eos> For a summer.<eos> A neurosurgeon and a cop.<eos> How did that work out?<eos> It didn't.
All their texts, photos, posts.<eos> You're rebuilding the night from everything they posted on the Internet.<eos> This is what we do here.<eos> People have no idea the trail of information they expose to the world.<eos> Some of us do.
I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
The only way I can forgive you for what you did is to save Sophia.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone with him.<eos> Sounds like you're left without a choice.<eos> I love him, Tommy.<eos> No, you don't.
We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, so much for never letting anything happen to her, Tommy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So much for staying neutral.<eos> For God's sake, Catherine, if you have information about that girl's sister, you have to let her know.<eos> Do I?
Is that cat playing the magic banjo? No!<eos> She's eating pasghetti.<eos> - Why didn't you bring it home?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm left out in cold, like shabby child with nose pressed up against glass of bakery, longing for single bite.<eos> I'm sorry, Sergei.<eos> It's just for now.<eos> I know you understand that.<eos> I do, but...
I dance.<eos> What else do you do?<eos> That's it, really.<eos> There's got to be more to you than this place.<eos> What do you...
What would you like to do?<eos> We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.
We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, I don't.
Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - No, I don't!
Palm to palm, fingers on my wrist.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Right.<eos> I know that.<eos> I do.
I don't know.<eos> I haven't thought of that yet.<eos> Look, I just know when we get there you don't talk about doctors, or clinics, or anything like that.<eos> Do you understand? - Why?<eos> - Because just don't!
The last thing I need in my house is six giddy women and their deviled eggs.<eos> I'm assuming that's off the record.<eos> The gantry is moving away from the rocket as we anticipate the countdown at any moment now.<eos> - You don't smoke.<eos> - Today I do.
You're just climbing up some bloody mountain.<eos> Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.<eos> I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> No. I didn't.
He has a gun,<eos> - a pointed gun. - He's not a killer.<eos> Well, you know, he has... killed.<eos> So technically... Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> It sort of does.
Yes. Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.<eos> Mmm! I just did Molly.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You didn't actually swallow it, did you?<eos> I did.
You know about payments, right?<eos> You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?<eos> D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em look fucking favourably upon us, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Right?<eos> And you say that.<eos> I'm not very good at my job.<eos> - I didn't mean it like that.<eos> - You fucking did!
All right?<eos> - I didn't say...<eos> - All right?<eos> I didn't say anything about killing, Ron.<eos> You fucking did.
You can still look after him in prison.<eos> And he doesn't belong here and you know it.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And he doesn't belong here and you know it.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't even know what that is.<eos> Is he hitting on you? Watch out.<eos> He always hits on the new ones.<eos> I know that.<eos> We all do.
How do you know?<eos> - You didn't. - Did you look in my wallet?<eos> That's not the point right now.<eos> The point is whether or not you had one.<eos> - And you didn't.
- Non-stop.<eos> - I left him for you.<eos> - Nobody asked you to.<eos> Did I ask you to leave him?<eos> Did I?
Who wants to see a picture of my girlfriend?<eos> - Is she naked?<eos> - No, she's not naked.<eos> Normal people don't carry naked photos of their girlfriend.<eos> Damir does.
We couldn't make it back last night.<eos> And Nikola behaved very well.<eos> Tell him... that Nikola took us to his house in Dukovo.<eos> He asks if boy went into the house.<eos> No, he didn't.
(CYRUS) Ho, ho, ho!<eos> Cyrus, you need to sleep it off.<eos> I don't need to do dick, Muhammad Ali.<eos> - You're ruining Christmas.<eos> - Liam already did that.
Finest on the island, so he says.<eos> He's all right.<eos> Go on.<eos> Put my tongue in his bum, he'd tell me anything.<eos> So I did and he did.
Untie him, Belly.<eos> I don't want him to kick me.<eos> He won't. He kicks, I shoot.<eos> He knows that.<eos> Don't you, Evan?
Come again.<eos> It's just something my mom says.<eos> "Understanding Your Dreams." That's a good book.<eos> - I get nightmares.<eos> - So does my daughter.
You can, you just won't.<eos> It's Jane.<eos> - Here's fine. - David...<eos> I said here's fine.<eos> - David, I do...
Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
They'd cleaned up most of the mess by the time we got there.<eos> No, not the mess.<eos> This... feeling.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Evita would like to interview you. Really?<eos> She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?<eos> - Well, of course she does.
She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?<eos> - Well, of course she does.<eos> Of course she does.
First...<eos> You're gonna rinse... Your dishes off every time before you put them in the dishwasher.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Come here. - You want to go upstairs?<eos> - I do.
I can'! get it out of my head.<eos> That arsehole running it into the ground.<eos> You could make good money with that place.<eos> People don't have money.<eos> Sure they do.
have the time to look after a store like that.<eos> I need a partner. This place is full of half-wits.<eos> But you're smart. I respect you.<eos> Your old man was from East Germany. You know German.<eos> No I don't.
That's right. I remember.<eos> He gave me a proper hiding.<eos> Then it was your drinking mates who got him into it.<eos> - I don't have any "mates".<eos> -Yes you do!
-come on.<eos> - I'm in my (racksuit.<eos> -Doesn't matter.<eos> - I don't have any money.<eos> -I do.
~ I left you in a terrible position.<eos> ~ No, you didn't.<eos> You were ill.<eos> ~ You may not understand that, but...<eos> ~ I do.
Daddy!<eos> Don't underestimate the kids.<eos> It's dangerous to lie to them.<eos> - You had children so early?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
That's right!<eos> Tim, the car isn't yours.<eos> No, but I need it.<eos> John told Lois that you had to have a scan.<eos> Did he, now?
- You tell me.<eos> - I got to wake up.<eos> Do you want a coke or a coffee?<eos> - Well, you got a cold beer?<eos> - I do.
But if that's the plan, they also want to know, this isn't just, uh, sitting still, is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is very difficult.<eos> Do they not understand that she is 14 years old?<eos> Of course they do.
I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
I'm someone who actually enjoys listening to the J Train as it's rattling outside my window because I know that it's filled with all kinds of wonderful people that are just living their lives.<eos> I like smoggy sunsets, I like smoking pot, and I would much rather experience the world than read about it in some book.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know that.<eos> Do you?
Okay, that's it in a nutshell.<eos> The decision is entirely yours.<eos> You need time to kick it around.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't. Well, fine.
I know. We felt they weren't right.<eos> So this is coming from the President?<eos> It's coming from us.<eos> And the painting, she wants that swapped out, too?<eos> Yes, we do.
- You're out of line, missy.<eos> - Geldray.<eos> - What are you wearing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do.
- No, you're kidding me.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?<eos> - I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand. I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?<eos> - I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand. I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand. I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't, Gary.
Uh-uh. - I'm gonna redo my kitchen.<eos> Ma'am, you think you want to think about this right now?<eos> Yeah, sure. I mean, we've got time.<eos> - We've got an hour.<eos> - Do we?
I feel bad for the guys who had to guard him.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Leon.<eos> A face I never thought I'd want to kiss.<eos> - I still don't.
Jonah, I know something's happening at the VP's office.<eos> Oh. Okay, you do.<eos> I need you to tell me what's going on.<eos> And, uh, do I have to tell you that right now?<eos> Yes, you do.
- It's hard to understand.<eos> I think Pennsylvania is the real significant call tonight.<eos> Pennsylvania, you had that as a Meyer win, is that right, Matty?<eos> ( stammering ) Yeah, uh... yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
- Jesus.<eos> She said you fucked up, Ben.<eos> And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit. You need to get him out.<eos> - She didn't say that, Gary.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Matheson or Murray.<eos> Hey, did you remember to put the new build on the iPads?<eos> Uh, yeah, did I?<eos> Fuck, did I?<eos> Did you?
I just... I mean, we got to do something.<eos> Even if it's just yelling at them... telling them that they're not gonna get away with this.<eos> But you know they are, right?<eos> Well, not if I have anything to do about it.<eos> But you sort of don't.
We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
Something happened here when we were away.<eos> Something happened that led to the death of Siggy.<eos> Even Ragnar knows that.<eos> But he doesn't know what happened.<eos> And you do, don't you, Helga?
I see you are making yourself comfortable here as well.<eos> I have come to join with King Ragnar and you in the attack on Paris.<eos> Whatever else divides us, that simple fact unites us all.<eos> We will fight and perhaps, who knows, we will die together.<eos> And if we don't?
This is all of your making.<eos> - We don't want him in it, do we?<eos> - You're really asking me that?<eos> No.<eos> Do you?
- Bullshit.<eos> - I talked to the man myself.<eos> Well, I don't care. No fucking way.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Obviously, you don't, 'cause if you did...
But don't worry, he ain't going to say nothing.<eos> I think you've had enough.<eos> Don't you think you've fucking had enough?<eos> - No.<eos> - I do.
We're not going to be in November.<eos> Colin is a white congressman in a black district.<eos> He can barely win here with nothing hanging over him.<eos> That's why the Senate made sense, where there are at least white voters.<eos> Still does.
Where is he, Will!<eos> There you are.<eos> Baby, don't, don't!<eos> Did you open those presents?<eos> Did you?
- You're probably right.<eos> - He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> - Franklin! You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid.<eos> You think this guy's going to let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Are the guests having fun?<eos> Are the animals enjoying life?<eos> Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.<eos> We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.<eos> Sure you do.
Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
- Brotherhood of Steel, dude.<eos> Brotherhood of Steel forever.<eos> - I don't know, I just...<eos> I can't stand mic cupping.<eos> - Cannibal Corpse do it.
Ah, Jesus, I can't even agree with you.<eos> I don't hate kids.<eos> Look, you got to a certain point in your life and it didn't happen.<eos> I understand you're angry about it, but you've got a lot of other things.<eos> - Don't do that.
I'd like to stop at a church.<eos> Okay.<eos> I prayed that God might forgive me for all the horrible things I said when we knew.<eos> And I prayed for the strength to mean it.<eos> Because I don't.
Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
Please, open your eyes, darling, come on, come on...<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> ~ Please, come on... ~ No. ~ Please...<eos> Mercy, mercy, mercy...<eos> Don't.
.-.Than Miss Shepherd.<eos> I do miss your dad.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> I asked our Gordon, when he was a pilot, did he go behind the clouds?<eos> - Did he?
Honestly?<eos> It were all too much for him.<eos> He tried to kill himself.<eos> He thinks I don't know that.<eos> But I do.
I've already got up and gone.<eos> This is posthumous.<eos> You're not dead yet, Abel.<eos> You still have to eat.<eos> No, I don't.
You're becoming brighter, Abel.<eos> Dying hasn't dulled you one bit.<eos> The snails are certainly having a lovely experience, fattened on me in a red-wine marinade.<eos> They have no idea they're going to be eaten.<eos> We do.
It's not working for me.<eos> I'm not supposed to be someone's mistress.<eos> Nobody thinks of you as a mistress, Marn.<eos> But because nobody thinks about me at all, like, in relation to you.<eos> I do.
It's, uh...<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I don't need any more friends.<eos> Oh, so none is enough for you?<eos> Adam, I do.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.<eos> Oh. Happy to! Who do I make it out to?<eos> Seattle Police Department.<eos> I take it you know her.<eos> I don't.
What rumours?<eos> That the Peshwa's caught the evil eye.<eos> Never mind the rumours...<eos> I don't believe in superstitions.<eos> But I do...
We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
- The blood tests prove it.<eos> - I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
I just thought you deserved to know the truth.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's Soren's bear.<eos> You said he took it with him.<eos> He did.
I just hope they don't do to them what they did to my Soren.<eos> Truth is no one knows what they're doing.<eos> You may be in the safest place - They had no right to punish me.<eos> Doesn't Michael say that the true path - is always righteous?<eos> - That, he does.
There's been a new outbreak, and I know you'd like to help your friends.<eos> They're struggling without their leader.<eos> Then let me out so I can help them.<eos> In good time, provided you help me.<eos> And how do I do that?
I'm doing everything in my power to change this, Sarah.<eos> Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization?<eos> Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate, just until resources are replenished.<eos> You think you know better, but you don't have the right to make that choice.<eos> No one does.
And just like any politician, he made plenty of promises.<eos> Only difference was Pablo had the men and the money to back them up.<eos> It was becoming clear to everyone that Pablo was gonna win.<eos> Pablo! The only question remaining was...<eos> what to do about that.
"Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound... or your family is next."<eos> Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please! Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
Yeah.<eos> Stay right there. I'll be right back.<eos> You said 30 minutes.<eos> Adam, let me play. Look, you turned it off.<eos> No, you did.
- Yeah, that's not your place.<eos> I don't think Harry is trying...<eos> Let him speak for himself.<eos> I had no right to hit you, Hugo.<eos> - No, you didn't.
She'd never let me move.<eos> Who's gonna invest in a broken-down ambulance that serves wine?<eos> Hey. Oh, come on, babe, you know it's true.<eos> Junebug, we don't have a cousin named Pootie.<eos> No one does.
An Alpha cannot show his throat like this.<eos> Is not personal, is politics.<eos> There's nothing more personal than politics.<eos> You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death.<eos> And if I don't?
Jorge dealt with covering it up.<eos> And that's done.<eos> But Phillip's sister has been texting me ever since.<eos> As far as his family knows, his car crashed on the way to the airport and they assume I have nothing to do with it.<eos> You didn't.
No, and I shouldn't be calling you without Jeremy knowing, but we've got a possible lead on Malcolm.<eos> Where?<eos> Look, there's no guarantee that Malcolm has Rachel, okay?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course he does.
You're asking me to give up hope.<eos> I'm asking you to brace yourself for the worst.<eos> You would've made a great dad, Logan.<eos> You need to heal.<eos> We all do.
When are you going to tell Paige the truth?<eos> That Aleister is your son.<eos> I've hardly been able to admit that to myself.<eos> He shouldn't have survived.<eos> But he did.
She is no longer in your mind.<eos> They want to control me.<eos> If you tear your bed apart, you'll just have to sleep on the floor.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
Around 8:00 P.M.<eos> She was so excited.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to wish her a Happy Birthday.<eos> I thought I'd see her at the party.<eos> Did you?
Have you been looking for a place?<eos> It's a hobby.<eos> I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you to let yourself have a future with me.<eos> Do you want to get married? Sure.<eos> If you do.
No, no, no.<eos> I don't fucking think so.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Ricky, we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did.
- Cheers!<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - [electronic chimes]<eos> - Oh, my sweet tits! I won!<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
Ricky, aren't you afraid someone's going to find all these weeds plants out here?<eos> No one's going to be out this fucking way any time soon.<eos> This is where people say they saw the Saskatchawaunch.<eos> Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did.
Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did.<eos> It's probably a stupid bear or a dumb gorillna.<eos> Saskatchawaunches don't exist.<eos> Yeah, but what if they do?
It made sense to me.<eos> My husband was killed three months ago in a plane crash.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said I knew what you were going through.<eos> I don't.
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
L-lad I known there'll be so much of luggage, I would've got a mini bus.<eos> Do you have any medical issue?<eos> eye sight..?<eos> night b_BAR_indness..? day blindness? Glassesf?<eos> - Dad. do all this later.
That's brilliant.<eos> They sprinkled that stuff around the ship because they knew we would test it.<eos> I'm seriously impressed.<eos> - Guys, we have no answers.<eos> So, what do we do?
- Okay. Talk to you then.<eos> Bungalow 3's got that leak again.<eos> We're gonna have to replace some floorboards.<eos> I thought we fixed the AC in that unit.<eos> Oh, we did.
I can't do this thing in my boat.<eos> I can't be seen doing that. Gotta borrow one.<eos> Okay? So we have, like, a very small window. Are you listening?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - To do this thing, all right?
Phone you don't want to be traced.<eos> Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I-I-I don't know. I mean, I-I --<eos> Answer the question. Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I don't -
She's the only living relative as far as I know. Okay.<eos> All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I'll make some more tea.<eos> No. No, that's okay. I'm fine.<eos> You don't believe in the afterlife at all, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.

Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
Well, the DNA test will give us a result, And either it will be your son's blood<eos> And you'll be released to pursue a, uh, wrongful arrest And assault charge against sheriff Anderssen, Or it will be stoddart's blood<eos> And you'll be charged with his murder. Well, DNA doesn't lie, does it?<eos> You're right.<eos> It never does.
Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship With sheriff Anderssen.<eos> So, she doesn't.
It's a receipt for something he shot on the glacier that he wanted prepared.<eos> It's here somewhere.<eos> Did Pettigrew ever talk about why he was here?<eos> He might've done.<eos> Well, did he or didn't he?
- The light.<eos> - Pardon?<eos> Okay!<eos> Got it!<eos> You did?
Be firm with her.<eos> She is willful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you bought.<eos> I do.
My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
We need to know what these things are.<eos> Yes, they're witches, understood.<eos> Witchcraft has a long history in many cultures, Doctor, as well you know.<eos> As do fairies and sprites, but they don't walk about - Greater London, do they?<eos> - These do.
Language to language.<eos> Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic to 10 other obscure languages and pictographs, changing language from relic to relic. Is it the story of Lucifer, then? The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
I have lost the immortal part of myself, you see.<eos> No, I've thrown it away.<eos> No matter how far you have walked from God he is still waiting ahead.<eos> You don't believe in God.<eos> But you do.
Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
"Look at this. I'm overwhelmed.<eos> "All these kind words. "They've made up for what has been a truly rubbish day, so thank you,<eos> "and there's to be an election to take my place.<eos> "Now, come on, Pagford, "did you think I wouldn't have something to say about this?<eos> "Of course I do.
My dad needs a best buddy.<eos> And there it is.<eos> Look, Jules, not everybody needs to have people around - all the time.<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Everyone does, except for maybe serial killers.
Whatever it takes.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> After the anointing of the alphas will be the final seal of our...<eos> Gia, you don't have to do this.<eos> Sorry, but I do.
I can't...<eos> It's Sean.<eos> He wants you to meet him.<eos> He says you know where?<eos> I do.
I'm the same person I was when he loved me.<eos> In fact, I'm an arguably better person because I went away and figured out what I want.<eos> Hannah, we are going to get through this.<eos> - I want to die.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, Ray.<eos> So I guess you know what's going on.<eos> I do.
Great, are you, uh, breaking up with me, too?<eos> No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.
No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Because of the club?<eos> - Because of everything.<eos> Angie, the club being closed means my money is tight.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> Yeah, but Tasha does.
Wait, uh, can I ask you a personal question?<eos> When you've been seeing somebody for that many years, is the sex still any good or is it, like, pretty boring?<eos> Don't even ask me that, please. I...<eos> There's no way to...<eos> Just don't.
Hey.<eos> This one's for you, Dan.<eos> Oh, yes. Whoo!<eos> I don't know this song at all.<eos> I don't.
And the herd ran violently into the sea, and they drowned in the waters."<eos> (CACKLES) Yeah.<eos> Poor little piggies.<eos> But I like that very much.<eos> - You do?
Junior high will still be there!<eos> Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good. It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
I thought you might be hungry.<eos> What if someone sees?<eos> The elders are already out of line.<eos> Shunning is for guiding people back to the church. But you didn't turn your back on the church.<eos> I did worse.
I'm not used to giving orders.<eos> All right. I can help you through that.<eos> You got the keys to the van?<eos> - The keys?<eos> No. - You don't?
If he doesn't, he's your dad, he's still gonna love you.<eos> Man, you know nothing about wasps.<eos> Maybe you need to bust out the eggs again, like in the old days.<eos> Norma doesn't need that voodoo shit.<eos> Well, maybe she does.
He said we're being watched,<eos> - so it's important we don't freak out.<eos> - Too late for this one.<eos> - What did he say about Annalise?<eos> - Uh, he didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> Ask your girlfriend.<eos> She's the one who called the police that night.<eos> - You said you didn't know him.<eos> - Because I didn't.
She should be grieving instead of blowing off the cops and taking on mobster drug dealers who she cares more about than saving us.<eos> Mr. Walsh.<eos> My office.<eos> I-I didn't mean any of that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Okay.<eos> One, two, three, go!<eos> That was awesome!<eos> There's a lot of stuff back here.<eos> - What do I do? - What?
A Faraday cage.<eos> It's, like, a container that energy can't get into or out of. Right.<eos> It protects everything inside from an electrical charge.<eos> We don't have time to construct something like that.<eos> Somebody already did.
I have a very strong sense that this is the night they announce their retirement.<eos> I've been wondering the same thing.<eos> Of course, I'm not psychic.<eos> Oh, honey, you don't know that.<eos> No. I do.
Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but when Robert told me we were going in on this place together, I made him promise we would never have to be here at the same time.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because I had Sol actually write that into the contract.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I don't see Jesus.<eos> But that's the general direction.<eos> They look like they really love each other, don't they?<eos> - Do birds mate for life?<eos> - No one does.
- Why? - Why?<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Because I was bored waiting for you.<eos> Who doesn't want to know what other homos are lurking in the shadows?<eos> You don't do that?
Good. It's just... it's just all the lying and the feeling guilty and shitty.<eos> Yeah. That's just so not what I want.<eos> - Good. We want the same thing. - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Is that why you wanted to go down there?<eos> Can you put little Ted down, please?<eos> He's very fragile.<eos> He's already lost an eye.<eos> No, they didn't.
- I can't handle it. I really can't. - Yeah.<eos> This has been like going through the worst fucking break-up that I've ever been through.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> But we do kind of need to break up, Dor.<eos> We do.
No...<eos> I'm free.<eos> I work like a madwoman but I find time.<eos> - Both of us have to want it.<eos> - I do.
Dancing.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> What?<eos> - Don't want to go?<eos> - I do.
- Asshole.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't see a thing.<eos> I think he killed me.<eos> - He didn't.
He's always loved them more than me.<eos> Even Jamal, who he hates.<eos> You know he's gonna leave it all to Hakeem, don't you?<eos> And Jamal won't object, because he's too passive.<eos> But what if he did?
I got eight dates a day!<eos> Just tell me...<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> You didn't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
Mr. Lexington and I were on a working retreat when the photos published in this tabloid were taken.<eos> My sexual orientation has no bearing on his.<eos> There is no relationship of any kind other than professional.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How you doing?
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.<eos> I don't even like my sister.<eos> Just be careful, Elizabeth.<eos> You do not want World War III to break out in your home.<eos> No. No, I don't.
Give me your money right now.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Both of you, give it to me now.<eos> Okay. Okay, we will. Just please, put the knife down.<eos> Do it, and do it now!
Let's go.<eos> So where's Coke at?<eos> I thought you got her again.<eos> Shit.<eos> I did. But then my damn probation officer...
-Wait, wait.<eos> What was that?<eos> Annoying is what it was, I mean, Princeton, Yale, who gives a shit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who does?
They made strides.<eos> She can be a lot more than she is if you give her a chance.<eos> If Glory isn't enrolled in your school this fall, do you wanna be wondering a year from now what happened to this little girl?<eos> Don't you wanna make a difference in her life?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Of course.<eos> Might even bring my driving licence down, huh?<eos> Do we believe him?<eos> He didn't take advantage of her fancying him?<eos> I do, actually.
It needed to be done.<eos> - I don't even know what to say.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that costs?<eos> Yes.<eos> And yet you did it anyway!
- What's the issue? - Yeah.<eos> I have an abnormally small dick.<eos> - I have an abnormally small dick!<eos> - Okay, uh-huh. - Sweetheart...<eos> - I do.
I'm doing what we set out to do.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to keep making money, don't you?<eos> You want to keep living that privileged life of yours.<eos> Yes, of course I do.
I believe our business here is done.<eos> Good evening, Mr. Adams.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Didn't mean to startle you.<eos> You didn't.
Rajiv, do you have a clear shot?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Check carefully.<eos> Do you have a clear shot?<eos> I do, sir.
ls that enough time to forgive my mother's murderer?<eos> For God's sake, Siya.<eos> I didn't kill your mother!<eos> And you know the truth.<eos> - Of course I do.
It is very weak.<eos> Do you think it will get better?<eos> At the moment I do not think so.<eos> At first he said he did not want to study medicine.<eos> Well, I did but I did not.
You can be out here too long.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> This is my house.<eos> You don't want to go in there.<eos> Yes, I do.
And then finding out that she was and then she wasn't in the same day...<eos> Seeing her like that, it-- made it feel like none of it was ever really there.<eos> Before... this was just the dark part and...<eos> I don't know if I want to fight it anymore.<eos> You do.
I saw your pantry.<eos> You guys seem to do pretty well.<eos> Yeah, well, had some training before this.<eos> Rotc. Was nearing lieutenant when this shit blew in.<eos> - My dad did rotc.
I watched the tapes. All of them.<eos> The things those people said about you.<eos> The things you did for them.<eos> Didn't you build that wall out there?<eos> Yeah, I did, with help.
- I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.<eos> Sasha, honey, what's your favorite meal?<eos> I'd love to cook it for you sometime.<eos> I'm doing it for all the new arrivals. - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
Okay, let's move.<eos> - Yeah? - You got it? - I got this aisle.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
I don't get to meet new people very often.<eos> Maybe once every two weeks.<eos> - That's a lot.<eos> - Oh, I work at it.<eos> We do.
Two men and a woman.<eos> Davidson was their leader.<eos> Smart as hell, strong.<eos> I thought they'd work out.<eos> They didn't.
Finally, someone believes me.<eos> - Why do you believe me?<eos> - I heard the details.<eos> - Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.
- Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving.<eos> How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
When we spoke, you said the content of the memos was familiar to you.<eos> - Is that correct?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And that they reflected Colonel Killian's mind-set at the time.<eos> And they do.
- He's confessed to abusing his power... to keep some of the richest, privileged sons of Texas... from getting their asses blown off in Vietnam.<eos> Ms. Mapes.<eos> Don't you think it's possible, just possible... that some of those fine, young... "privileged men, as you call them... got into the National Guard on their own merit?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, I do not.
Corey something.<eos> I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Yeah, see you around, whatever your name is.<eos> Jamie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - ♪ Gravity gets us... ♪ - You know I'm a cop, right?<eos> I do.
I-i've never done that ever, and i'm very sorry.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> It was close. It was really close.<eos> You know, i almost couldn't explain it away.<eos> But you did it.
How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
We could have put that guy away, but now... now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
Uh, you have like 40 minutes to get ready and get out of here.<eos> Also, don't forget that Oliver's taking you, all right?<eos> Traci's gonna take me.<eos> Uh, do you have the music on your phone?<eos> I do.
You know the girl.<eos> She's probably working on one of her lists.<eos> She wants everything to be perfect before she walks through the door.<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The decision was decided by me earlier today.<eos> Do it.<eos> Go.<eos> - No.<eos> - Do it.
Holy doodle, here we go.<eos> Oi, oi, Rachel.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Never gets old, does it?<eos> Yeah, it does.
I'm Dr. Gallinger from the Knickerbocker Hospital.<eos> Here to see Dr. John Thackery.<eos> Patient.<eos> I'm sorry, we have no patient here by that name.<eos> Yes, you do.
Howard was my only friend.<eos> She made me feel so welcome in her home.<eos> Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.<eos> Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.<eos> (chuckles) She did that to me, too.
Just let me see.<eos> Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.<eos> A: surprised you know that. B:<eos> I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you. Oh.<eos> Well, you do. Oh.
Stop the bus!<eos> No, no, no, no! You can't leave this child here.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Her parents will come here to file a complaint, right?<eos> And what if they don't?
Fine.<eos> What lawyer?<eos> Ehrmantraut, who's got him and where?<eos> That way.<eos> Hey, fellas, how you doing?
You fight for the crows now?<eos> I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
It's so sensual.<eos> Get your camera.<eos> Why?<eos> I want you to take my picture.<eos> No, you don't.

Look at you, all down your nice clean top.<eos> - Molly, would it kill you to help? - I sort of need it now. Oh...<eos> Look, Cleo... if there's something I need to know, then you should tell me.<eos> Now, tell your Uncle Henry, that tone doesn't work with me, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Scotty works for Vanessa.<eos> I run a cleaner's. We do all the city centre flats. High-end, Coronation Street and all that.<eos> Scrubbers to the stars, that's us. Thanks.<eos> I've got the Sunday morning shift.<eos> We do police work too, all the deep-cleaning at murder scenes.
I'd better head off.<eos> There's this bloke at work. I think he's interested.<eos> - I might give it a go.<eos> - You don't need to tell me.<eos> Yes, I do.
But I think there's a chance.<eos> Are... Are you actually going out?<eos> We're sort of... circling.<eos> But he wants more, I think.<eos> I do.
Where did you get these, woman?<eos> Fraser, ye say your name was?<eos> That's right.<eos> My husband gave them to me on our wedding night, they're yours, if you'll help us.<eos> Did he indeed?
'Cause your boy raped and killed.<eos> He's going away. You want me?<eos> Is that why you keep coming after me?<eos> I can look like a boy if you want. I can let you call me Greg.<eos> He didn't do it.
- Wow, never woulda thought Jesus' sister would turn out to be a math whiz.<eos> Was that even a math question?<eos> And please tell me you know I'm nothing like my brother.<eos> No,<eos> I do.
Are we about to get a list of banned books?<eos> Don't be hyperbolic.<eos> This doesn't sound like you at all, Lena.<eos> I thought you had final say when it came to academics here.<eos> - I do.
Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
Right, Gabriel?<eos> It makes complete sense.<eos> I've always said that we couldn't be brothers.<eos> We look nothing like each other.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Start the interpretation now, Joseph.<eos> - Thank you, Franz.<eos> If we could travel back in time and let the ice age descend upon us the outcome would probably be different.<eos> Species, genus, breeds die out not for a reason.<eos> They just do.
We'll have the whole crew meet, tell 'em how everything gonna roll with Lobos.<eos> So I ain't comin' to the meeting?<eos> Sure, we'll still be there when you get back.<eos> I need you to reach out to the Serb, Ruiz, and Drifty, and explain to 'em Tommy on our side now.<eos> Ghost did him just like he did me.
Don't.<eos> I did anger Randall at Fort William, and I've spent the past four years of my life blaming myself for father's death because of it.<eos> But now ye know better?<eos> Aye.<eos> Hmm. Aye, I do.

Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.

- Why do you say that?<eos> Jim Norton just left a florist carrying a vase and two dozen roses.<eos> You don't buy roses two weeks<eos> - before you're going to deliver them, either.<eos> - No, you don't.
That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Woodrow Wilson High School. That's where he's hiding.<eos> All due respect, professor, how you know that?<eos> I just do.
It was his idea.<eos> Well, we were gonna have it at the strip club, but that food is terrible.<eos> Yeah, well, congratulations to you.<eos> I hope you'll both be very happy and have a good lawyer.<eos> - But we do.
Have you, uh, seen Zoe?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She's upstairs sleeping, if you want to wait.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, that is... wonderful news.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry if I got caught off guard before.<eos> I didn't realize that you and Wade had gotten back together.<eos> We didn't.
Yeah, the things we do for love.<eos> Yep!<eos> The things we do.<eos> So how'd it go last night?<eos> Well, it didn't.

Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
Yes, exactly.<eos> Why?<eos> Because scary is fun-ruining, and I like fun.<eos> Do you like fun?<eos> No, I don't.
- How's he doing?<eos> Seems okay, like usual.<eos> I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're waiting on paperwork at the office.<eos> - You know how it is.<eos> - Don't I though?
- Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
Get a load of those two, the dread on their faces?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do? - Yeah, I do.

How's Layla?<eos> She O.D.'d on pills, Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I saw you give them to her.<eos> Yeah. I did.
I've been busy putting my life back together after your ex-wife got me fired.<eos> Sorry if returning your calls isn't a priority.<eos> Look, look, I was backed into a corner.<eos> I didn't know what she was gonna do.<eos> So, how you doing?
I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
I want that contract nullified.<eos> Yeah, but Maddie is my daughter.<eos> You think I want to explode our family?<eos> You think I want to break her heart into a million pieces?<eos> I do not.
I... I just... I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Sorry I've been so short with you today.<eos> I just didn't want you to think I was the whiny, needy wife at home.<eos> I don't.

Scarlett and I used to perform together as a duo.<eos> I was pretty lost back then, couldn't write a song to save my life.<eos> But when the two of us got together, that all changed.<eos> Guess you could say she inspired me.<eos> Still does.
Hey, listen, I know this is last-minute, but Rayna had to bow out unexpectedly, and I was hoping you might fill in.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh... I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
That was pretty perfect, Dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So does this mean you're not gonna tell mom?<eos> No.<eos> No, it does not.
Friends call me Bill.<eos> I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> Oh, no, call me Luke.<eos> Uh, your son tell you he's the first artist I signed to my label?<eos> No, he did not.
How... how could you say that?<eos> He doesn't know the real you.<eos> He just knows the Will Lexington who's a rising country star, the Will Lexington who's straight now.<eos> - Nah, you don't understand.<eos> - No, I do.
I think someone is down there.<eos> Hello, Jackson.<eos> (indistinct radio police) That's my brother. - Where have you been?<eos> I figured if I wasn't here, it'd make it easier to catch him.<eos> Which... it did.

We got our full budget.<eos> ~ That's such wonderful news.<eos> ~ I'm so happy.<eos> You and Miss Webb have a good working relationship.<eos> We do.
Does chi-sucking always give a bad case of the munchies?<eos> You want pizza?<eos> You called for pizza half an hour ago.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Of course I do.
- What the fuck you're talking about?<eos> - I'm talking about what I bring to the table.<eos> - She doesn't give up. - JULIE:<eos> You better be on your way!<eos> - No, she doesn't.
I think... because he lost control in the window, he feels ashamed.<eos> But more than that, he...<eos> he survived and his men died and he feels responsible.<eos> ~ That makes no sense.<eos> ~ But it does to him.
In sickness and in health.<eos> So you are here out of duty.<eos> I'm here because I know what happened in Verdun.<eos> ~ I don't want to discuss it.<eos> ~ Well, I do.
Thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> I know everyone's a bit shaken up.<eos> Oh. I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> Then don't.
A few days after that, EMTs bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said... some guy she knew waited for her after work in the parking lot, attacked her...<eos> tried to drag her in the alley. She said she screamed and screamed, and a man in a black mask heard her... and he saved her life.<eos> So, yeah, word's getting around.<eos> And I want to believe in what you're doing.<eos> I really do.
Repeat. You'd think by my last life I'd have this figured out.<eos> Word of advice:<eos> Sometimes it can take centuries to figure it out.<eos> When did people stop hurting you?<eos> They didn't.
- What are you doing here?<eos> Well, my mom died, so...<eos> Fuck and shit.<eos> Hey, you wouldn't happen to know who the wills and estates lawyer is?<eos> I do.
Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"?<eos> Hmm? Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.<eos> I do.
I'm sure that must have been a surprise.<eos> A pleasant one.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I know I felt more than you at one point, but I won't pretend my treatment towards you after our falling out wasn't intended to hurt you.<eos> It did.
The X-ray room.<eos> I want to see what bones and organs they might share.<eos> If you want them to take their clothes off, that'll cost more if that's what you want them for.<eos> No, that is not what I want them for.<eos> Many men do.
They are making more to keep the island running.<eos> But they'd all be fresh.<eos> The heaters are for ageing them.<eos> They could never get away with it.<eos> They did.
No bumps.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You are not giving George Tucker the bumps.<eos> Whew. Thank you.<eos> Thanks for doing this.
What face?<eos> I didn't make a face.<eos> You made a "I know something" face.<eos> You know something!<eos> No, I don't.
You can't keep him here.<eos> I've told you repeatedly...<eos> What are you charging him with?<eos> I'm asking you to leave quietly.<eos> He didn't do anything.
Take a look.<eos> Oh, Robert, come on. Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
Perhaps there is so much diversity in life simply for disease to exist.<eos> What if mankind's purpose is simply to exist as a host?<eos> Just a vessel. Nothing more than that.<eos> - You shouldn't let him get to you.<eos> - He doesn't.
- People in New York are fucking nuts.<eos> Oh, fuck this.<eos> I need a real smoke.<eos> I think I hurt this guy and he's gonna come here looking for me.<eos> He already did.
It was on that subpoena.<eos> I know what's gonna be on your subpoena.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> - You know what it means.<eos> Sure as hell do.
- I love you.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> No.<eos> Liar.<eos> I don't.
He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
Bring the horses.<eos> You spoil me.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I like to be appreciated.<eos> Who doesn't?
For no side.<eos> At least... for no man.<eos> You must not say this to me, George.<eos> Oh, I must.<eos> And I do.
Is it really your business?<eos> Did you spend the night with that asshole?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Well, I care, because Captain Fucking Rayburn is the douchiest shit bag in that whole fucking family.<eos> You did.
It requires a genetic mutation.<eos> Never seen it before or since.<eos> The reason I have red hair is completely different.<eos> Hm. Do you know what the gene that causes red hair is called?<eos> I do.
The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.<eos> And I'd appreciate you not using my sacred calling in this way in the future.<eos> What, god doesn't want you solving crimes?<eos> Well, of course he does.
And what if I don't want to sell it?<eos> I'm you.<eos> Eventually, I get tired of everything and everybody and sell it out for a profit.<eos> You have the same disease.<eos> Everybody does.
- Not important.<eos> All right, the point is we're not in love.<eos> No, of course you're not in love.<eos> You don't know what love is!<eos> Oh, and you do?
Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
And listen, I don't like this any more than you.<eos> But I need to know exactly what happened, every detail.<eos> Did she suck your cock?<eos> - Fucking hell!<eos> - Did she?
You should too.<eos> Oh, fucking students, always leave the place in a state.<eos> Well, it's probably good that they get to practice though, before they start slicing up live people.<eos> - I thought they cleaned this shit up as they go.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
- Do I have to go back to St. Bart's.<eos> - No.<eos> I think you're done with St. Bart's.<eos> I told your form teacher she needed to get laid.<eos> She really does.
He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- He's had a few problems.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Shaw was shot in the line of duty seven months ago, along with his rookie partner, Ray Jones, who lost his life.<eos> A lot of cops around here blamed him for his death.<eos> They still do.
So long as we postpone the battle until the next full moon to give Athena time to convince Ares of your bravery.<eos> Very well.<eos> Tell my generals of the delay.<eos> Where did he find this man?<eos> He did it on his own.
Oh, you should be thanking me that I got to the cash<eos> - Not your decision. We're partners.<eos> Well, you promised to shut down our little operation, partner.<eos> And I know you haven't.<eos> I did!
Please, I just have a few questions. You must leave.<eos> If he catches you...<eos> Just tell me... What is this?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
Are you afraid of somebody?<eos> The only person I scared off right now is holding that gun at me.<eos> Minx, I'm Claire.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
Those are just vitamins.<eos> They aren't even mine. Should we check all of you for vitamins?<eos> If we tell you we know talia lennox, will you go away?<eos> That's gonna be your best chance. Talia ran away to her dad's.<eos> No, she didn't.
Please, Khlyen.<eos> I don't want to kill him!<eos> From where I'm standing, little bird, it doesn't look like you can.<eos> I thought you were special. I thought you wanted to make me proud.<eos> - I do.
No, I am- - I'm not going to be pressured into saying it. I'm just not going to be, okay?<eos> I need- - I need you to go home.<eos> No, I don't-- I don't want to go.<eos> I... I just--<eos> I- - I do.
If life has taught me anything, it's that... I can take a punch.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't have too much fun without me.<eos> - What am I going to do? I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
Oh, yeah. My bodyguard. Yeah.<eos> - Hello, Kala.<eos> - Papa-ji.<eos> - I had no idea you came to the temple.<eos> - I don't.
"Days later they emerge transformed, wreaking havoc and spreading terror, "commanded by an ancient order of parascientists known only as<eos> "the Dread Doctors."<eos> Sounds vaguely familiar.<eos> How does it end?<eos> It doesn't.
This place is a maze.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's, uh, here.<eos> You don't remember which unit?<eos> Of course I do.
We appreciate all the information that you've given us.<eos> But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter.<eos> Which is why you're no longer on the case.<eos> You don't have the authority to do that.<eos> Actually, I do.
Well, I don't trust him anymore.<eos> What the hell is he talking about...<eos> "Matt's lifestyle"?<eos> Oh, I think you know exactly what he's talking about.<eos> No, Tom, I don't.
You prey on parents.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> You're going to confess, or else.<eos> Okay, I made a mistake.<eos> You sure did.
There is no weekend.<eos> Oops.<eos> Damn right, oops.<eos> How are we supposed to get this thing done?<eos> We don't.
Vacation.<eos> Bad timing.<eos> - Yup. - I'm gonna need the glue gun back.<eos> I have a sideline bedazzling jeans at Barneys.<eos> Of course you do.
If anyone knew how many times my boys napped in a holding cell, I'd be locked up.<eos> It's hard being a working mom.<eos> Work a full day.<eos> You make lunchboxes at 3:00 am just so you can get another five minutes of sleep.<eos> Do laundry at midnight.
Did what?<eos> Left your son home alone.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I would never...<eos> You did.
Maybe she's got her appetite back.<eos> Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> Sure, Ted.<eos> You know where my wife is?<eos> I don't, Ted.
Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
-There it goes. You just said it.<eos> I gotta take you to taco bell sometime, they've got this fabulous new gordita.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. -Do I have the body for it?<eos> -You do.
Look, you should go to the press, set the record straight.<eos> The press don't want the truth. They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
Like she tried to kill herself.<eos> And then would take us on a shopping spree. She would sleep depressed for months. And then would throw us a big party for one of our birthdays.<eos> Should I go on? - Have you done any of those things?<eos> Police report says you stole your lover's baby and took him...<eos> I didn't.
Look, I... I...<eos> I need to go kiss Gainey's bottom, try to convince him to co-host this game with us.<eos> And I just can't do it alone.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, of course you do!
- And got inside her head... - Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah. But you did.
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't. And if they don't...<eos> Well, you didn't.
No.<eos> I took the sample before that.<eos> They're bleeding my friends.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Please.<eos> No. Oh!<eos> All right. Get a strap.<eos> Let's go. Please.<eos> Please don't.
- I suck at cooking.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one's ever taught you. That's all that means.<eos> Didn't you go to cooking school?<eos> Yeah. I did.
Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
He's, like, a super genius, man.<eos> We talk. We have long talks.<eos> He gets me.<eos> You know very well what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't!
Oh, my God.<eos> A young lady was attacked yesterday evening.<eos> I've also got a witness says he saw some men leaving this club drunk as lords.<eos> - I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> - Then don't.
A lasting tribute to your mother's memory.<eos> To build houses for heroes returning from war.<eos> Rose would approve entirely, son.<eos> - Does Serge know about this?<eos> - He does.
are nothing to me.<eos> Claire, that's not true.<eos> I'm in large part responsible for the way your life has unfolded.<eos> I-I have a responsibility to help you.<eos> No. You don't.
Hang in there, man!<eos> All right, Roderick, do this for the team.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Keep going. Just a little further.<eos> You did it.
That's a steaming load of crap.<eos> I want to be surrounded by the people who love me and the people that I love.<eos> The only person that you know how to love is yourself.<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
- A real one. You should get some clients first.<eos> Just one little sign.<eos> What could it cost? Frank, you can barely afford to pay me.<eos> I thought you were working for free.<eos> I... I did... for a day.
The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
This is what I do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Raul, we are both wanted by the law, okay?<eos> We need to be careful about drawing attention to ourselves.<eos> Yeah, we really do.
Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Why do you ask?<eos> Ursel!<eos> One... more?<eos> One... more?<eos> Okay, do one more!
I'm not gonna argue with you, Rebekah.<eos> I'm just saying maybe it's a public service, but I get why it's complicated.<eos> I mean, it makes sense why you won't kiss me.<eos> It's why I wouldn't kiss you if I wanted to, which I don't.<eos> I don't, Marcel.
You begin this spell.<eos> Prepare the battlefield.<eos> I'll bring hope to you.<eos> Your daughter will need my guidance...<eos> Just as freya did.
Apparently, he's been more yours than mine lately, so...<eos> What happened?<eos> One of our trackers sent a signal from the Starling City docks.<eos> Except we don't have any tracking devices in the field.<eos> Unless we do.
I don't know if we made the right choice, Laurel, but we definitely did the right thing.<eos> And how many people are gonna die tonight because of it?<eos> We made a decision, Roy.<eos> I know, and I know that I was outvoted, but that doesn't change the fact that we're outmanned.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The only thing I can know for sure is that everything that I've done everything that happened it led me right here to this moment.<eos> And, Felicity, if that's true then I don't know what it was all for.<eos> I do.
How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Let me hunt for you once more.<eos> Allow me to prove to you my reborn loyalty.<eos> Al Sa-Her, face your death with honor.<eos> Or at least dignity.<eos> Please don't do this.
Wait, there is a procedure that could save his life, and you're saying you won't perform it?<eos> I'm saying I can't perform it.<eos> The hospital won't permit the use of an experimental or untested technology.<eos> How do you know your invention won't kill you?<eos> I don't.
She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
I didn't know... about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> It was complicated.<eos> But I did love him.<eos> Despite everything, I still do.
I told you to back off, and you didn't listen!<eos> So kill me, go ahead.<eos> Show Felicity the kind of man you really are.<eos> I have nothing to prove to her.<eos> But you do.
Never mind.<eos> - Calm down. - Let me go.<eos> - Sorry, calm down.<eos> - I want to go. - I made a mistake coming here.<eos> - No, you didn't.
It's 800 pages.<eos> There's a lot of stuff in there, But it mostly focuses on transmutation, Which is the process of altering the structure of an element<eos> By unzipping the atoms... - And rebuilding it to create an entirely new element.<eos> - Well, the article was co-written by jason rush, Who's a grad student here at hudson university. So if anybody knows what happened to ronnie...<eos> - Maybe he does.
W-Well, that means a lot.<eos> But... how on earth did you two end up an item out of nowhere like this?<eos> I... Wait, seriously, you really don't know?<eos> No, on second thought, uh, I don't want to know.<eos> No, no, I don't.
You okay?<eos> Go home and kiss your wife.<eos> You can count on that.<eos> Thought you punched out.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You would've sent an innocent man to jail.<eos> No. (stuttering) you've been a slug for months, And this... This is the thing<eos> That gets you off of your ass? Not your family, not your fiance, Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!
It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!<eos> (scoffs) I get that you had to do what you think is right, But you could at least feel bad about it.<eos> You just massively derailed my career And you don't even care, do you?<eos> Yeah, you don't.
This is something that neither one of us have done And could be appealing to both of us.<eos> An archaeological dig in egypt.<eos> See? I-I-I'm fascinated with ancient culture, And you love adventures.<eos> Do I get to wear the indiana jones hat?<eos> We both do.
The missile fell harmlessly into the sea.<eos> Isn't that correct, commander?<eos> But we did hit something, sir. A drone.<eos> Commander Tilson, your sidewinder did not hit a drone. Therefore, the US Navy is not responsible for starting a military engagement between two sovereign nations.<eos> No, we did not, sir.
I'm telling you as a friend, that plan is kind of fucked.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> All I'm saying is if I suddenly woke up one day and found out I wasn't wanted here, man, I would walk out that front door and never look back.<eos> Our first patient together, bike messenger, I told you to do the scan, you didn't, the kid died.<eos> Today, you did the scan.
You've been leaking information to the press about active murder investigations, which could compromise those investigations.<eos> I haven't leaked anything.<eos> You sent e-mails from your work computer.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes, I did.
- That's a really nice offer, but I wanna go where I'm wanted.<eos> And if you call them, then it's not about me.<eos> I should go wash my hands before I dig in to these potato skins.<eos> Jane, we have to convince her to let me make the call.<eos> - No, we don't.
Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Um, "Star Wars," "Jaws," "Indiana Jones."<eos> I mean, I think this might be the most thoughtful thing I've ever done.<eos> There's... trains.<eos> You don't want to go to movie night?<eos> Of course I do.
If I did not touch that patient, she would be dead.<eos> - Is that what you want?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor. I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
It's gonna ruin our name. It's gonna ruin our reputation.<eos> Everything Mom and Dad ever worked for their whole lives is gonna be gone.<eos> - John, we cannot report this.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
I probably just bumped into something without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until we figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab if you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
It's the baby's, too.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> It's not even yours.<eos> Trust me, your father made me get a DNA test, just to make sure.<eos> Of course he did.
Cousin Pammy!<eos> Oh, my God, that's...<eos> Pamela... Bailey...<eos> Hi! Remember me from the Bluebell Bed Breakfast?<eos> Uh-huh. Sure I do!
Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
I'm so sorry, dr. Isles.<eos> I mean, what kinda idiot smokes a cigarette in the bathroom?<eos> That's a really good question, larry.<eos> I can't believe some dumb-ass Threw a lit cigarette in the trash can.<eos> They didn't.
I, um...<eos> Please, at least let me pay to get those cleaned.<eos> It -- it's the least I can do.<eos> You think that's gonna make right what you've done?<eos> It doesn't.
I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
This is typical, classic pirate bullshit. Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
If you have a drive, I'll dub you a copy.<eos> Fuck O'Shea.<eos> Did you see what he did back there?<eos> I don't have a drive.<eos> I do.
No. You have to save that poor girl.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I've seen what it does.<eos> You don't believe it.<eos> I do.
- You will do anything<eos> - for the cause.<eos> - Not just for the cause.<eos> - I... I doubt I have your passion.<eos> - You do.
Here, Dickie.<eos> Taste that egg you've been waiting to drop.<eos> Spent days staring at it, he has!<eos> Blackwood wants me to go again.<eos> Well, I don't!
Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> But eventually it will be.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Pictures of me.<eos> What? Of our thing?<eos> No, it's something else. This is mine.<eos> I think I might be walking into something.<eos> Then don't.
It isn't me.<eos> Hi there, handsome.<eos> You made it.<eos> You're okay?<eos> I did.
Um... Jayda, do you know who sent these?<eos> Madison's mom.<eos> Stephanie?<eos> Well, it's just that, well, Erica didn't really like her.<eos> Yes, she did.
Yep, that's what she said.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Ok.<eos> You don't have to go with us. You know that?<eos> Sure, I do.
What gave it away?<eos> When I was a kid, I used to dream what it would be like to... to live somewhere far away from Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Somewhere beautiful.<eos> What made you stay?<eos> I didn't.
What?<eos> No! No, I sign that, I can't ever talk publicly about this.<eos> Yeah... but I'm not signing it.<eos> Sergei.<eos> Who did this?
Shouldn't I dig the bullet out first?<eos> Remember what I said about this not being a movie?<eos> You cut him open and start digging around, you'll kill him.<eos> This way at least he has a chance of not bleeding out before you get what you need out of him and... it'll hurt like a son of a bitch, so bonus.<eos> All right, how do I do this?
It's not me you need to worry about. It's the city you just blew the hell out of.<eos> You... You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
We're looking into it.<eos> And I believe you.<eos> You should.<eos> I don't think you have any idea the nightmare that's coming your way.<eos> Yes, I do.
We can't leave katy with someone new.<eos> You know that.<eos> Hey, katy?<eos> Hey, sweetie, how about I make us a little snack?<eos> Yeah, do that.
No.<eos> I'm glad you're alive.<eos> Zoila, I bought you something to cheer you up.<eos> - I don't need cheering up.<eos> - Of course you do.
Well, Mrs. Fleming doesn't want people gossiping about her, so, since the Powells already had a leg --<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> Okay. Obviously, you are not dumping the hand on the Powells.<eos> No, I agree.<eos> What do I do with it?
Apparently mr. Becker had a reputation as a ladies' man.<eos> Mm. It's been suggested you might have flirted with him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It sounds like you think i had motive to murder louie.<eos> Did you?
And that's why I'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, I do.
You have a boyfriend?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'll worry about that.<eos> You just worry about Miguel, huh?<eos> Doesn't that sound nice?<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
[Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
But the truth is, I miss Zoila.<eos> No, no, no, no. You just think you do.<eos> You actually have a form of Stockholm Syndrome, where hostages empathize with their captors.<eos> Zoila never took me hostage.<eos> Well, in a way, she did.
I know it seems crazy, but the Powells really do love Deion.<eos> Letting him stay here might be the best thing for him.<eos> Listen, lady.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Actually, I do.
The problem is not the price.<eos> It's the disclosures.<eos> Your home has been the site of a murder, a suicide, and a chopped off leg.<eos> Well, we don't have to tell people about that.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
And the truth is, you need help while you're pregnant.<eos> You can't clean this big house alone.<eos> You should've talked to me about it instead of sneaking around behind my back.<eos> I tried, but you always get so defensive.<eos> I do not!
After seven years, you're not expecting a happy ending, are you?<eos> Why would I start now?<eos> I like your little hat.<eos> Guess you talked to Lucille. Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I did find some good news, though.<eos> What the fuck does that mean?<eos> Well, what it means is I found a file on Nomar and I found his phone.<eos> He was a CI working for her, yes.<eos> Nothing to do with us.
I don't buy it.<eos> I don't know his angle, but I'm not buying it.<eos> He didn't kill that Delacroix child.<eos> Okay.<eos> But what if he did?
Jacqueline?<eos> I'm her stepdaughter.<eos> And you're what, the new Hunong?<eos> I'm Kimmy, and I'm going to have to tell your stepmother that you were drinking.<eos> No, you don't.
- You have disappointed us, Adam.<eos> - Chancellor, I can explain.<eos> We'll be back in a minute. I just have to reset.<eos> You know how vital the neural connections are to us.<eos> I do.
"People say we won't stay friends later in life.<eos> In this case, it's true...<eos> See ya never."<eos> Who wouldn't want to save that?<eos> What do I do with this stack of birthday cards?
Get some weird message from me or anything?<eos> Did you leave a weird message?<eos> Not on purpose.<eos> Sss... Uh, Scott called me while I was calling you, and then I just thought that, I don't know, m-maybe the whole thing ended up on your voice-mail, but...<eos> It did not.
It's not good to keep it all pent up inside.<eos> Fine. I will leave you alone, if that's what you'd like.<eos> But, um, just know that I'm here for you, okay?<eos> [Sighs] Why does everything have to be so hard?<eos> It doesn't.
- You've got things. I know. - Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
What?<eos> You're not... you're not supposed to be in tonight.<eos> Uh, this is true.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
I mean, there's 37 other candles in the room.<eos> We're probably fine without that one. Oh, crap.<eos> - Are we out of champagne?<eos> - We don't need champagne.<eos> Wh... of course we do.
I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
Don't be mad at Marc.<eos> He didn't hide his drinking from you to be sneaky.<eos> He just didn't want you to think any less of him.<eos> I'm not sure he cares what I think.<eos> Well, of course he does.
Didn't David promise... yeah, I'm calling the bastard right now.<eos> - Call me after you talk to him. - Okay.<eos> Will do.<eos> You said that we didn't have to dress up for this.<eos> We don't.
Do I know you?<eos> You look awful familiar to me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I do know you.<eos> Yes, I do.
What do I tell them?<eos> Tell them Handsome Randolph Henderson is dead.<eos> And then he fell backwards, driving Handsome Randolph's head directly into the mat.<eos> It's a wonder he survived.<eos> He didn't, George.
This is the syringe used to administer the fatal dose of morphine that killed Mr. Henderson.<eos> And this syringe has your fingermarks all over it.<eos> You'll recall that I didn't fall for your little pen trick.<eos> You don't have my fingermarks from which to cross reference.<eos> But we do.
- He's just got to.<eos> - I know he's gonna do it.<eos> - Sweden.<eos> - Oh there!<eos> He did it! He did it!
Monica and Chandler start dating?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You are the worst time traveler ever.<eos> You tell me everything I don't want to know.<eos> And nothing I do.
Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now. Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Book isn't that fun.<eos> - No, I don't like it either.<eos> You have to speak with a story voice, and sound like a talking bear.<eos> - There aren't any talking bears.<eos> - This one does.
Nobody gives that woman perspective.<eos> - Barb has a heart.<eos> She does. - After all this, you think that... that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Organize how?<eos> We should have our own demonstration...<eos> Same place at the same time.<eos> No, they have had weeks to get ready.<eos> To do what?
I was thinking that maybe I could help fix up Matt and Gwen's place in exchange for staying there.<eos> You want to sleep in the house where Matt was killed?<eos> - Are you sure you want to... stay here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Carter comes back, tells me how Matt Skokie was all " this" and " that," "... your white bitch."<eos> Carter didn't do anything.
You should always have a new tactic against him.<eos> Never the same rifle. Each rifle has a character.<eos> You need to understand and handle the rifle as you would your wife.<eos> Do you have a wife, Captain?<eos> No, I do not.
What you think I want?<eos> I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.
I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.<eos> You do that.
What had happened ?<eos> I do not talk about it, but since then I relativize more.<eos> ls being with me better than lying in a coma?<eos> I still hesitate.<eos> Over the last years did you do it with or without a condom ?
I'm not the sheriff.<eos> What do you want, an apology?<eos> No. I would have done the same thing.<eos> You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.<eos> No, it didn't.
Uh-huh. And you do understand that everything Nick told you is all real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... uh...<eos> So you know all about...<eos> I do.
He was afraid of getting me killed.<eos> You must have been scared to death.<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom."<eos> You're lucky it didn't go off.<eos> No, no, it did.
That's true, my glory days.<eos> My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp.<eos> Never played a game.<eos> I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from.<eos> - I do.
He did it because we served together.<eos> We'd do anything for each other.<eos> Look, I get that.<eos> With all due respect, boys...<eos> Hey, I did three tours in the sandbox.
Getting some privacy.<eos> Well, your lab results came back.<eos> They show very high levels of marijuana.<eos> Could have told you that.<eos> S-so why didn't you?
- He signed the DNR.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> - Three months ago.<eos> Who knows what he would have wanted today?<eos> Actually, I do.
Call him.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> I thought that Kim said she found a home for him.<eos> - Hi, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
How 'bout I sit in on this one?<eos> You know what, it's Paul's first night in surgery, so I don't think it's... scrubs are right in there.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> You didn't have to say yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Damn, this is bad.<eos> We need to stop the bleeding now.<eos> Man.<eos> We need to get him out of here.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Carl, you did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...<eos> Yeah, we do.
All right, I will try and fast-track the paperwork on the medication, but it could still take a month.<eos> All right, so for now, add on an I.V. aminoglycoside.<eos> All right, that might work.<eos> Okay, but, uh, this sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.
She just... I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I-I'm tired and I don't feel well.<eos> This doesn't sound good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
I had to tell somebody.<eos> So, the dental work that showed up on your scan, the vertigo... that isn't from a car accident, is it?<eos> You need to get out.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> - You don't.
Hey.<eos> This the windshield guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> His wife had no idea.<eos> Still doesn't.
Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying.<eos> That's not lying?<eos> Devin, I am so sorry.<eos> And I know that this must be...<eos> No, you don't.
This can't be how you end your career.<eos> Legendary killjoy caught and caged like some kind of animal?<eos> How do you think it ends, Dutch?<eos> You think they throw us a parade when they take back our badges?<eos> They don't.
You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?
I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> I do!
W-Why, why?<eos> I tell you.<eos> No!<eos> You got provisions ready to move?<eos> Yes, we do, sir.
Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
- You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?<eos> How should I freaking know?<eos> You do, though.
And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.<eos> And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.<eos> I mean, where's the facts?<eos> An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank?<eos> She didn't.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
- Teen offenders with multiple arrests...<eos> - Why Rebecca's DNA...<eos> - The photos of Sam to pin the murder...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Michaela: Of course you do.
Hey, let me in!<eos> Since when do we ever lock this door?<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Frankie D!<eos> What it do?
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
- [Scoffs] I told you everything about me.<eos> Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what? You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust.<eos> - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
She's not.<eos> She's stoked about it. Okay.<eos> Well, what exactly did Cookie promise you when you signed with her?<eos> To do the same thing she's doing for Jamal-- protect the music and make me a star.<eos> The same thing she did for you back in the day, right?
But she was never the same.<eos> Before Whitehall, an elder would sacrifice themselves<eos> Every few decades so she could live on, carry on tradition. She would weep, scream, beg them not to.<eos> She had a good heart, Phil.<eos> She did.
That's a lovely name.<eos> Remember, a house is not a home without a pet!<eos> Thank you for doing that for him.<eos> I know aspects of the Tahiti program don't sit well with you.<eos> This does.
Anyone want to volunteer to be her mama bear?<eos> Mason, you picked a bad day to actually show up.<eos> - I don't nanny.<eos> - I lost the ability to make a joke back in '05.<eos> Today, you do.
You don't think I noticed that press conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?<eos> No, no, no. I've played with you too many times to let you get away with that.<eos> This is between you, me, and The Flash.<eos> - You don't want to play for those kind of stakes with me, Hartley.<eos> - Actually, I really do.
Thank you.<eos> Help yourselves to fig Newtons and milk and laugh about what just happened. Okay.<eos> And my brother said there's a foldout of Kathy Ireland in a white bikini looking "cold,"<eos> if you know what I mean.<eos> I don't. Me, neither.
To make some friends, i had to break some rules, and your boy was willing to do whatever it took.<eos> Why are you wearing grandma's coat?<eos> Because I'm gonna steal a dirty movie.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
You, Ian.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option. But I know what you really want.<eos> You do?
I have an interesting project, I want to make a powerful and irreverent thing.<eos> A sitcom about the economic crisis.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> I can write a script.<eos> Good, meanwhile do so.
I know how much you hate parting with good booze.<eos> Oh, come on now, what am I, a rookie?<eos> I got the good stuff in the wheel well.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course I do.
Can't catch me! - Loll? Loll, where are you going?<eos> - So what shall we do now then, Jo?<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> Go on, you tell.<eos> No, you do it.
I'm strong.<eos> Strong motherfucker. That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
This murder case -- this is just a thin edge of the wedge.<eos> Now the hope here is to use Kelvin's conviction to take the whole family down.<eos> Kelvin might be looking at the needle, which might make him more pliable.<eos> Now how said the hope is, not was, from which I surmise that you have another witness to the murder?<eos> We do.
- Yeah. - So what is it?<eos> Well, it's a hood.<eos> Thought it would, uh, you know, spice things up.<eos> When did we start wearing hoods?<eos> - We didn't. - W...
- What witness?<eos> - No idea.<eos> Only the judge and the lead attorneys were privy, and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.<eos> What about a subpoena? We don't have sufficient grounds.<eos> But I did a little snooping around.
So what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is.<eos> We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
You need more than that.<eos> You just got back.<eos> So why cross the man who's got the deputy chief's ear?<eos> Because the Montgomerys are hiding something, and you know how I feel about secrets.<eos> I do.
- Two, please.<eos> And a diet root beer.<eos> What planet am I on?<eos> I got to get down to the range.<eos> Yes, you do.
That hurts my feelings.<eos> You were not kidding when you promised long hours.<eos> Well, it's a glamorous life.<eos> Let's order in.<eos> Already did.
I can't live like this.<eos> My insides feel like gravel.<eos> I cut myself when I move.<eos> [ crying ] I can't live as this repulsive creature.<eos> Then don't.
I promise.<eos> Captain Andersen.<eos> I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy.<eos> - I don't have a daughter, sir.<eos> - No, you do not.
I've never had that before.<eos> That was possible because of you.<eos> That's all I really wanted for you.<eos> Cal, uh, Skye doesn't know when her birthday is.<eos> I do.
We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I've seen here... th-the safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> - How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> - We don't.
You want to tell me what this call's really about?<eos> I always knew the team wasn't gonna forgive me.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> But Kara?<eos> She does.
She left the line open for us. We'll have the location in a minute.<eos> - She doesn't sound like a hostage.<eos> - More like she's playing along.<eos> Mack and I can take a team... go get them.<eos> Do it.
Dr. Jeffreys is talking through his arse!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Right. Alec, I want you to run the same tests on the samples we've got from Dawn Ashworth.<eos> - I thought you had a confession.<eos> - We do!
Flippin' hope so!<eos> See ya, Mum.<eos> I fucking saw you in there, Danny!<eos> You didn't see a thing.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Why should I trust you? - Coulson:<eos> Because we all have our secrets.<eos> You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness. - Kara?<eos> - She does.
How many people who trusted you have died?<eos> See, I've seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside.<eos> He's a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - Sure, I do.
That's a lovely name.<eos> Remember, a house is not a home without a pet!<eos> Thank you for doing that for him.<eos> I know aspects of the Tahiti program don't sit well with you.<eos> - This does.
I'm Dr. Dey.<eos> Whoopee for you.<eos> Can you tell me why you're so upset right now?<eos> I made a mistake coming here.<eos> No, you didn't.
I was close.<eos> If I had known what he was before I told him about Theo and Patty,<eos> I'm not going back in that house.<eos> Something killed Raymond.<eos> Yeah. Something did.
It's what we're supposed to do!<eos> I never thought any of this was really real.<eos> Well, now we have proof that it is, and you want to run away.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Calista jumped off the Tower, and Retro Girl caught her.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I know.<eos> The girl jumped off the Tower because she thought it might give her powers.<eos> It did not.
- Did you know?<eos> - ... just not...<eos> When you jumped, did you know Retro Girl was gonna save you?<eos> Yes, I knew.<eos> I did.
Slow down, okay?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> - You're not?<eos> - No. But if you need a tutor--<eos> I don't. I...
Yeah, anytime.<eos> I told Ezra about Savannah.<eos> I thought he knew.<eos> Yeah. I should've told him already.<eos> Why didn't you?
I'm just curious.<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> You know.<eos> We both know.<eos> I don't.
The army wanted something that would keep soldiers awake for days at a time, but it failed.<eos> Caused symptoms similar to sleep deprivation...<eos> Anger, hallucinations, psychosis.<eos> If you knew all that, why use it in Finow?<eos> I didn't.
Nobody reads them like I can.<eos> You're laying out major reserves to clear the docks... to make sure the police don't come within 10 blocks.<eos> More to bribe the comptrollers to guarantee straight greens.<eos> Know how much all that costs?<eos> I do.
It's everything.<eos> It's right there.<eos> All you gotta do is put your mind to it and make it happen.<eos> You want a sip?<eos> - He most certainly does not.
- Because of this family.<eos> - No! They see it!<eos> They see you and that little bastard and they laugh!<eos> - And you don't believe in me!<eos> - I do.
Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us...<eos> Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
Goose died... and he was married.<eos> Details.<eos> Hey, do you know a good place to get a cup of coffee on campus?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, lucky for you, I do.
You really think that anyone would believe that I didn't know what you were doing?<eos> That Karen didn't know?<eos> This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.
If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
We're all done, so just take the suitcase to the car, okay?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> So you think you know me now?<eos> You think you know Hillary?<eos> 'Cause you don't.
Old Leo rushes up to see me, tail wagging, tongue out, rolls over on his back like he always did.<eos> And I put a bullet through his head.<eos> My boy... He's everything to me.<eos> The man who helps him, that man's my brother.<eos> The man who doesn't...
Okay. Okay. - Wait.<eos> - Deena.<eos> Wolfe... begged us, me and Johnny...<eos> He begged us to kill him.<eos> And we didn't.
Had to light my cigar.<eos> Show was just starting.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Nah, you didn't see nothing.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Oh, shit! I have to go.<eos> I'm meeting Jon for lunch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.
Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> You didn't, did you?
Thanks.<eos> Just seeing how far away Jon is.<eos> Where did you go when you went away?<eos> Jon has a lake house.<eos> We did a ritual.
Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
He had it rough.<eos> Talked about eating his gun.<eos> The one thing he said, he never felt so alone.<eos> So how did you convince him that he wasn't?<eos> I didn't.
- Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.<eos> - Join the club, honey.<eos> And you're using this, like, for... adult lubricating purposes?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, we both do.
What am I gonna do about your wedding?<eos> - It can't be easy for you.<eos> - It's not.<eos> I got so caught up in not being invited, I never thought about whether I actually wanted to go.<eos> Do you?
- I don't even know if you heard me...<eos> - Oh, I heard you.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
So this is it?<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
Look...<eos> When terrible things happen, you have to remember to look forward.<eos> He didn't deserve to die.<eos> I know what will cheer you up.<eos> I do.
No, I'm a lab tech. I'm just helping out.<eos> I thought I'd...<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> I had to leave.<eos> You didn't.
You stay here.<eos> Watch your brother, he's... he's in the cargo hold.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Hi, Johnny.<eos> What the hell did you do to her?
Do you remember much of it?<eos> Dutch, I remember everything.<eos> Please tell me you know I would never do anything to hurt you or John.<eos> Please tell me you know that that wasn't really me.<eos> I do. Of course I do.
That's right.<eos> I have more than a few guns.<eos> Speaking of guns, you shouldn't be shooting off guns around here. It attracts too much attention.<eos> He didn't fire a gun. I did.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Now, now, Casey.<eos> Pants on fire, I counted five, at least.<eos> Nathan, if this is you... I'll tell everyone what you told me your mum did on holiday in Weston-super-Mare!<eos> I could've put that in the tweet, but I didn't!<eos> What did Nathan's mother do on holiday in Weston-super-Mare?
I didn't know any of this.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's fucking terrible.<eos> ~ I don't need to watch any more.<eos> ~ Yes, you do, Casey.
To let him pay for everything?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I mean, if I decide to take the internship, I'm gonna keep waitressing.<eos> I'm not afraid of hard work, you know that.<eos> Rafael doesn't.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> Things just escalated.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much.<eos> - She doesn't.
Call me if you need anything.<eos> Don't be rude, mother.<eos> He's the only person who's helping us.<eos> And I still don't trust him.<eos> Well, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to give you this.<eos> It's everything I loved about your story.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> Please. No, please, I do.
Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> - You do?
But what about all that stuff that she said?<eos> Who cares if your eggs are too old?<eos> We'll buy fresh ones. Combine my DNA with anyone, and the child will be extraordinary.<eos> I love you, Xiomara.<eos> I do.
And why is that a bad thing?<eos> He was there.<eos> He provided for me.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
You have been acting so strange since I got back.<eos> I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.
I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.<eos> Of course I do.
- Expensive.<eos> Fine, it's no problem, I know. But it's a consideration.<eos> Also there's another person in the room during the birth... do you want that?<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you?
I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics Either end up in rehab, in jail or dead.<eos> I chose rehab.<eos> There is no need to give them every single detail, luisa.<eos> In any case, you need a job.<eos> No, I really don't.
I mean, with everything that's going on-- I mean, the murders and twins and mastermind criminals, This is not normal stuff.<eos> It's pretty friggin' crazy.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> But even with all that, I thought that you trusted me.<eos> And I do.
Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
Just curious.<eos> How do you know for sure you're in love?<eos> It sort of feels like...<eos> Your heart is glowing, if that makes sense.<eos> It doesn't.
Ma. Now's your chance.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry I kissed Marco.<eos> It was stupid and immature, and-and I've replayed it, like, a million times in my head, and I wish... you have no idea how hard I wish I could take it back.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I really do.
So I'm doing everything I can.<eos> I just don't want you to worry.<eos> Latin Lover Narrator: And briefly, she thought he'd say, "I love you."<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> But alas, he didn't.
He wasn't a good dad.<eos> I don't want to be anything like him.<eos> And I won't be.<eos> And I just want you to know that.<eos> I do.
I was worried about you, Cass.<eos> - Well, you don't have to be any more.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Damn it, you didn't have to leave.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you... outside the tents that night... the lights.<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
- Stand down.<eos> - Marcus, put the gun away.<eos> I gave up everything for you and this thing.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - It did work.
Every time I splinter, it feels like I'm being ripped apart from the inside.<eos> Eventually I'm not coming back, am I?<eos> If you succeed, it doesn't matter.<eos> No.<eos> But if I don't?
Jessica, you can't just say you're a realtor.<eos> You gotta take an exam, get a license.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Also, you can learn how to sell a house...<eos> Which I already did!
- Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know you're on a date, but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.<eos> Sir, please, you have everything to live for.<eos> No, I don't.
Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah... I do.
The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
Made sure you knew it was expensive.<eos> Maybe it was because we were renting off them, but I just... always felt she was looking down on us. Lee she just flirted with, but everybody flirts with Lee and he just flirts right back, so...<eos> You don't think... Did they ever have a thing?<eos> I hate her.<eos> Sorry, but I do.
Ever since you came here.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that now?<eos> Do you really think I didn't know?<eos> ~ Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> ~ Because you never did!
Erm... Yes, he was.<eos> He was arrested for obstruction and spoken to in connection with Danny's death.<eos> ~ If they're asking those questions...<eos> ~ Doesn't necessarily mean anything.<eos> Of course it does.
We bring Lee in. He gets a fright, seeing that.<eos> And then, instead of betraying you... .. you're banking on him realising that he needs to stay close to you<eos> ~ because of what you know.<eos> ~ I don't know anything!<eos> ~ I don't!
Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. Something did.
I think you're wrong about the law.<eos> I understand why, but it is a calling. It is noble.<eos> And I think... you need to get that back.<eos> ~ I don't need a tutor.<eos> ~ Yes, you do. We all do.
You hear me?<eos> Stay with us.<eos> This is how he did it.<eos> He lured his brother here knowing the lightning was gonna strike.<eos> And when it did...
Should I not have come over?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'm just wiped from the weekend.<eos> R.E.M did a two-hour encore.
Libby, you look great.<eos> Oh, thanks, sis.<eos> I'd look better with a drink in my hand.<eos> Well, you know where the bar is.<eos> - I do.
Mrs. Brady wanted me to get you for dinner.<eos> What's up?<eos> I want to leave.<eos> Just tell Mrs. Brady I feel sick.<eos> Do you?
Even when I was killing them, they just gaped at me... like fools.<eos> No understanding.<eos> Jason Lennon... killed your parents.<eos> You didn't kill them.<eos> Yes, I did.
Tumor's buried in the occipital lobe reaching into the fourth ventricle.<eos> How's he supposed to get that out?<eos> Heck, I don't know, but he's got to try.<eos> Okay, tell the surgeon I'm sending him a scan and a roadmap on how to proceed.<eos> Who did the map?
But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
Hey, remember, she's my wife.<eos> And you're the one who insisted that we all live together, 'cause you're a great friend and a great roommate.<eos> I guess I have been pretty great.<eos> I don't know if I would say hero.<eos> No one did.
You talk a lot.<eos> Hazard of the profession.<eos> If you dig up the mountain where the Lenape are, you wouldn't find any of this.<eos> They have no real Indian ancestry.<eos> Yes, they do.
I think Junior already made his move.<eos> Levi's hand was bandaged.<eos> Okay. Let's suppose he did do something.<eos> We have no idea where to look for him.<eos> - I do.
I figured his-his partner was helping him get the girls, the victims.<eos> Through the escort service.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I thought Rebecca Lowell ran Lady Aquarius.<eos> She did.
Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.<eos> She just ran away.<eos> And, Brother Larson,<eos> I think you know where she ran to.<eos> I do not.
I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.<eos> Well, one thing we do know is that Winthrop is gonna recover, and when he does, he's gonna pay for what he's done. Right?<eos> Did Lab Director Nolan call you about that job? Oh. I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah, he did. He did, yeah.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
- Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Honestly?<eos> It never occurred to me.<eos> I mean, I didn't think we were friends that told each other things like that.<eos> Oh, you didn't.
It never occurred to me.<eos> I mean, I didn't think we were friends that told each other things like that.<eos> Oh, you didn't.<eos> Well, no, not at the time.<eos> Why, did you?
For when it gets cold out.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Yes, you did.
You worked your ass off for this.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Grandma, you remember Phillip, don't you?<eos> How you doing?
Then there's Cooper.<eos> A psycho ex- compadre who likes burning and blowing shit up.<eos> Doesn't mean Cooper's part of this.<eos> You wanna bet your life on that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Merry Christmas, pally. Hm.<eos> "Fleas navi-dog," Harry.<eos> "Fleas navi-dog."<eos> You are feeling better.<eos> How you doing?
It's now just a regular biangle.<eos> You mean a line?<eos> We need to work on your geometry, Kimmy.<eos> That's right.<eos> We do.
Marshal took my car, left me on the side of the road.<eos> That's where the hell I've been.<eos> He took your car?<eos> He can't just take your car.<eos> What the hell did you do?
Like I said, I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> No, sir. The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir. I did.
Don't.<eos> But I do have to wonder, now that it's quiet... how much money are we talking about here?<eos> And how are you planning on going after it, given their actions?<eos> - I thought you said you trusted me.<eos> - I do.
- Who in the hell was that again?<eos> - That's Ava's uncle.<eos> He and the other Randolphs never did forgive my deceased brother Bowman for how he treated Ava.<eos> Doesn't seem like that bottle's gonna get it done.<eos> No, it does not.
- Damn it, boy.<eos> - Goddamn.<eos> We're gonna have to let this vent for a few hours.<eos> Now after that '90 collapse over in Joseph's Valley, didn't I hear you swear up and down on your mama's grave that you'd never go in without a good sounding?<eos> I did, indeed.
Come on.<eos> Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know. - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
You mean how it looks like premeditated murder?<eos> I mean it. I need, like, a Men in Black brain wipe.<eos> She was so angry.<eos> Noah, we both know Audrey.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Hello, Emma.<eos> Hi, Mr. Branson.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You know what I'm doing here.<eos> No, I don't.
I can't talk about it.<eos> Mr. Branson...<eos> Whatever your name is...<eos> Okay, my friends are dead, my family has been targeted, and you know why.<eos> Actually, I don't, Emma.
I am.<eos> I really am.<eos> Kieran... - After what happened to Will, I couldn't risk...<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
You texted me to meet you.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well, I didn't send this to myself.<eos> _<eos> Unless you did.
I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Miss Borden, you might not remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
Good morning, Miss Borden.<eos> We have some bad news.<eos> No... No!<eos> We don't know if he was singled out or he interrupted somebody.<eos> Somebody doing what?
~ Improve his time-keeping.<eos> ~ His bad breath in the mornings...<eos> Oh, please, Shamshad, I'm trying to eat.<eos> ~ Sita needs to know all about.<eos> ~ No, she does not.
[Trish] Can we at least try to get Madeleine Albright?<eos> It's a lifestyle show, Trish.<eos> Our audiences tune out for politics.<eos> - They do not.<eos> - Okay, I do.
We'll figure out a way to protect you.<eos> We?<eos> He's coming for me, not you.<eos> I know!<eos> You don't.
Suit yourself.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer...<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay, why did I try to kill myself?<eos> Or why did I try and kill...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I killed...<eos> No. No, you didn't.
It does?<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'm not gonna go anywhere near him.<eos> Which implies that you know where he is.<eos> I don't.
I need you to witness something.<eos> I don't like what I see when you're around.<eos> Oh, you mean that room full of cops that put their own Glocks to their heads?<eos> I don't know what that was about.<eos> I do.
To make Wendy sign the divorce papers.<eos> That's not how it happened.<eos> Then tell me he made you do it.<eos> Just tell me that.<eos> He did.
You did this.<eos> You told me to handle it.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> So you turn me into a murderer?<eos> I didn't do anything.
That's what you said.<eos> So you turn me into a murderer?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You chose to pick up that thing... and crush her skull.<eos> You did that.
I joined for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I mean, I had the hugest crush on you.<eos> - You did not.
Oh, shit. Shit. When did you even get a gun?<eos> - Why aren't we using it?<eos> - Give me your shirt, Freddie.<eos> - We didn't know who to trust.<eos> - And you do now?
It sucked.<eos> You graduate. You get over it.<eos> But John didn't graduate.<eos> I didn't ask that kid to put a gun in his locker.<eos> No. No, you didn't.
I'm orthodox.<eos> I live with a whole host of expectations.<eos> This isn't about just our kiss.<eos> - No, I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Grey House.<eos> It's one of the oldest in town.<eos> It's got quite the history.<eos> Wait till you meet the owner.<eos> He already did!
What?<eos> This... this pin...<eos> It's very "Cassie" of you.<eos> I know you didn't steal Harry.<eos> I didn't.
It was love at first sight.<eos> Let me guess. You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As.<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
- What choice do we have?<eos> - Three...<eos> - How do we know this isn't just a lie?<eos> - Four...<eos> - We don't.
I was the good student.<eos> I was the straight As, the valedictorian, and Vincent, he just has this charisma, so then my dad pays all this attention to him.<eos> It's always the same, you know?<eos> I'd come up with the ideas for the farm and then Vincent takes credit for it.<eos> Still does.
I'm already damned.<eos> I know you don't want to talk about it, but does this have anything to do with the letter the Devil mentioned?<eos> Somehow, he managed to get all the charges against me dropped.<eos> Look, even if he did something for you, you don't owe him anything.<eos> None of us do.
My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
So if Peter has feelings for Nadia, and she has feelings for him... don't stand in the way, okay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You mind if I come in?<eos> Now you ask.<eos> How you doing?
I need to change out of my uniform.<eos> I couldn't write at all to begin with.<eos> Not for the first month.<eos> But after that, I sent three letters. My mother posted them.<eos> Or maybe she didn't.
It's like the Earth-Tone city.<eos> So there's the trailer me and my dad work out of.<eos> And there's the high security area.<eos> Only certain people have access to it.<eos> I do.
-I'm still waiting.<eos> Head's the size of my fingernail.<eos> And a woman on the English throne flies in the face of nature.<eos> A woman can't lead an army.<eos> Her grandmother did.
What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who was controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl, but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
You have enough secrets, Cat.<eos> Being mad at your mom shouldn't be one of them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I still don't understand how infecting over, what, a dozen people, with a parasite that doesn't last very long accelerates their experiments.<eos> It doesn't.
So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
What about yesterday?<eos> What I said.<eos> You said what you were thinking, which I would encourage you to continue doing.<eos> Hard to stay encouraged when saying what I was thinking got me sat on the bench.<eos> It didn't.
No. I'm good, thanks.<eos> Ok. Time to call your husband.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not a party without him, is it?<eos> I don't do it.
- Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.

It wouldn't matter if Bosch had backed your story.<eos> You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You do.
You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You do.<eos> They didn't.
Well, technically, he wasn't my superior,<eos> - and I didn't feel pressured.<eos> - It was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy, was it not?<eos> How does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage?<eos> It doesn't.
You're curating the ceremony, arranging the seating charts, not to mention figuring out what you're gonna wear.<eos> Hey, at least I got my tux already.<eos> - She still doesn't have a dress.<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - You don't.
And again, I am sorry we couldn't go back to my place.<eos> My lazy landlord is finally fumigating.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I just hope that my mom doesn't come home.<eos> Or actually, maybe I kind of do.
But you know, I get it, because you and April are just friends.<eos> And what's great, dimples... Dom...<eos> Domples, is that we can be friends now, because I have nothing to worry about.<eos> You don't want April back.<eos> - I do.
No, but you believed it for a second.<eos> It's not so hard to have faith, is it?<eos> Remember earlier you said you thought Leo was just in the ground?<eos> Do you really not believe in an afterlife?<eos> But you do?
It's not so hard to have faith, is it?<eos> Remember earlier you said you thought Leo was just in the ground?<eos> Do you really not believe in an afterlife?<eos> But you do?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> He was so emotional.<eos> He cried. Dad never cried. I mean...<eos> Do you remember why he went to Baltimore?<eos> No, I don't.
He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
I was very excited to share it with you last night when I got home. But you were out like a light.<eos> Anything you want to tell me?<eos> Anything at all?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
You're asking the wrong person.<eos> Our final question is a bonus round question.<eos> Which album was famously introduced as testimony in the Tate-LaBianca homicide cases, Los Angeles, in 1969?<eos> Also referred to as the "what" murders? The "what" murders?<eos> Simon. How you doing?
It's a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn't think that it's a trap.<eos> Unless he thinks that's exactly what it is.<eos> But if he does, he's still gonna follow us, and we can control the where and the when.<eos> Okay, but what if we actually have to go through with this before he attacks us?<eos> Then we do.
He's still following us. We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till death do us part.
Are you okay?<eos> I don't know;<eos> I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Come on. Open it. Open it.<eos> Open it. You really didn't need to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
There is risk anytime we venture into the unknown, whenever we are compelled, for whatever reason... [camera shutter clicking] To push away the safety of the familiar, of family and home.<eos> As promised, my report.<eos> My assessment remains accidental death by drowning.<eos> And there is the notion that this impulse is, indeed, for the best, that whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger.<eos> Unless, of course, it does.
Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day? Come on, mom.<eos> [Chuckles, sniffles] I love you so much, Abraham. Henry:<eos> We both do.
You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
So, what does she want?<eos> Provide her with a fraudulent death certificate --<eos> Or else what?<eos> She'll go to the nypd, tell them that i'm a fraud.<eos> What do i do, abe?
We're ridiculous.<eos> A ridiculous love story.<eos> That what makes us so special.<eos> Look, I want to believe you, but every time I look at you...<eos> Then don't.
Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
No, of course not.<eos> He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it. Further proof... Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.
Yeah.<eos> My mind is still all over the place, and you need time with Daniel's memories.<eos> And you wanna be with your daughter.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Must be intimidating, having a brother in the political spotlight.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He, uh, inherited my father's Southern charm, so everybody loves Lyman.<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, of course I do.
Oh, and to think Lyman chose mental health funding as his platform.<eos> Oh, no, but we don't know he's involved.<eos> - Even the simplest implication would derail his career.<eos> This could've killed you, Louise.<eos> But it didn't.
But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
To vet my memory and your claims about Renautas on June 13.<eos> His place was a front for some kind of an operation.<eos> And then... he tried to kill me.<eos> Kill you?<eos> What did you do?
But why is he running?<eos> Why is Renautas framing, disappearing, and killing evolved humans?<eos> That's why I came to find you.<eos> I figured if anybody had answers, it was you.<eos> Do you?

If you're so curious, why don't you just ask her yourself?<eos> Of course, that would require you to actually talk, or ride the bus with the rest of us.<eos> I talk.<eos> She don't even know you exist.<eos> Nobody does.
I think I'm gonna get hit no matter what I do.<eos> I got some tough decisions to make.<eos> You once told me that winning solves everything.<eos> I don't know if I believe that anymore.<eos> They do.
No, we did not.<eos> Look, I'll have these policies ready for you first thing in the morning.<eos> So, what's the answer?<eos> Do you believe in miracles?<eos> Yes, I do.
Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide.<eos> Oh, look who paid attention in chemistry.<eos> Oh, serious crush on my teacher, Mr. Brewer.<eos> That man knew his way around a Bunsen burner, if you know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
- Detectives.<eos> - Oh, detectives?<eos> Why'd you run me off the road, detectives?<eos> Why'd you run from us?<eos> I didn't.
Well, here's the thing. This clause was unlawful when you included it in Mr. Hendricks' employment agreement.<eos> Right. As I said, I'm willing to just move past this.<eos> See, again, I don't think you understand.<eos> If Mr. Hendricks hadn't hired Mr. Dunn, or you hadn't pursued him for that hire, I'm not sure I would've noticed the violation.<eos> But you did, so I did.
This artery here, huh? You're bleeding out.<eos> I could call for help, but it's up to you. No, it's up to you.<eos> If you don't help me, you will never see your sister again.<eos> How am I supposed to know you'll let me see her, that you're not doing something terrible to her?<eos> You don't.
So, instead of saving Dennis... you saved one of them?<eos> Joanne, it wasn't like that, okay?<eos> I found him when I was looking for Dennis.<eos> He was buried. He needed help. I had to help him.<eos> No, you didn't.
Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.
It describes a completely illegal arrangement between German and American intelligence.<eos> Germany's doing an end run around its privacy laws by having the US do the spying for them.<eos> That's what the doc says.<eos> Well, how do you know it's real?<eos> Well, I don't.
Will you take some refreshment?<eos> Thank you, I'll have what you're having.<eos> Coffee.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We do, the Foundation.
-Get what?<eos> -You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it.<eos> You're stronger than me.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- A sonnet by Shakespeare?<eos> - No! - A greeting from Hallmark?<eos> - Not listening anymore!<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
If that's what you miss and that's why you want your powers back, you haven't changed as much as I'd hoped.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> If that's what I wanted, I could just tell everybody what happened.<eos> Then why don't you?
Yes.<eos> What?<eos> No, it's good.<eos> - Do you not want to?<eos> - No, I do, I do.
Yeah. You know that one who you played little board games with, Sometimes you pretend to lose...<eos> Arnold loves board games.<eos> You know that son who you adopted And then you kept safe, and happy, and loved?<eos> Well, that actually worked out really well for me, yeah. 'cause sometimes, I get to put my dick in his butt.<eos> I do not!
You haven't had much to say, have you, josh?<eos> No.<eos> Is... Is he kicking me out?<eos> Don't worry, darling.<eos> You did a good job.
I'm not.<eos> Then why does she think this is gonna help?<eos> 'Cause she doesn't know.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - Uh, it didn't.
- Jackson, let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Hey, Travis. How you doing?
I'll help take care of you, dad.<eos> I can do stuff around the house.<eos> You'll see. It's not that simple.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Of course I do.
It's a sham, gentlemen. It's a total sham!<eos> Whatever. Um, yeah, you know, you just ... you stay for the kids.<eos> You don't cut and run. Who does that?<eos> Ponytail, who does that?<eos> I don't.
Sean's opening.<eos> Are you gonna go?<eos> I got a part.<eos> - You got a part!<eos> - I did!
Okay, I did not mean to have... we don't have time for this conversation right now.<eos> Okay, right, right, but how many people?<eos> - Joel.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Okay. But just for the record, I didn't...
Who invited you here anyway?<eos> I'm-I'm running shit.<eos> - Did you shit yourself?<eos> - Would you just mind your own business?<eos> - You did, didn't you?
- I've been in a long-distance relationship for three years.<eos> That's why you don't know anything.<eos> I have sex with women.<eos> - I know how to talk to women.<eos> - Do you?
Uh, this is my girlfriend Kayla.<eos> So, "girlfriend," huh?<eos> Well, uh, sorry?<eos> Well, I just, I noticed back there you introduced me as your girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, so I did.
How's it going, fellas? - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Listen, what I'm gonna do is, we're gonna clear out of this room, get a nice meal brought in here.<eos> If you're still feeling bad this afternoon, we'll call a doctor, okay?<eos> Okay, so I'm assuming that you've all seen and heard the mess that your fellow prisoner has created for us this afternoon.<eos> So I want you all to say now, after me,<eos> "Prisoner 819 did a bad thing."

Now, you tell us that you can make it out there, but your behavior don't reflect it, nor do your behavior reflect it here.<eos> Now, I think that you're destined to be prison scum.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> You believe in God?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
'If that light goes on, I'll kiss her.'<eos> 'Turn on. Turn on. Turn on.<eos> Do you know, I think I actually know someone who lives round here.<eos> You don't know a guy called, um...<eos> Matt, do you?
Well, I don't need your validation. I know I did the right thing.<eos> I know because I'm miserable -- again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, so is Gold.<eos> It does.
Here are pictures we took after the sabotage, Here are the new, There's something going on,<eos> They build it up again,<eos> - - We blew the whole room, -<eos> - It was not enough,<eos> What did we do wrong, then?
Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You're a mess.<eos> What are we gonna do with you?<eos> What the hell did you do?
Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- I said I don't do bitches!<eos> - Get outta my face before I cut you!<eos> - We got a problem?<eos> I told her I ain't no dyke!<eos> No, we don't.
Um... [clears throat] ... I... saw Ana at my dad's.<eos> Moms aren't gonna take her baby.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - No, I don't think she knows yet.<eos> Or maybe she does.
I'm answering the questions. I'm... I'm selling the story.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I'm watching her react to you, and I'm telling you, if they get a hint that we're not being truthful, it's...<eos> Look, the point is, considering what you've been through, it's okay to tell them that you need a break.<eos> Except that I don't.
Well, my money's on the fact that these two have a history together.<eos> Reddington, Braxton-- they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you're going to find out.<eos> Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> You do now.
The kind you like... make your ass real fat.<eos> Shit, did I do that to your neck?<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Abigail was still in control when I walked in that room.<eos> Please don't do that.
And you hired a chief financial officer who cheated his way through business school.<eos> Though I suppose you can't be blamed for not digging through the official records of the Columbia University judicial board.<eos> They were never able to prove...<eos> But even when someone's profligacy and petulance is draining money from your pocket, you still don't see it.<eos> Or maybe you do.
- Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.
Opium?<eos> You know half the patients at the clinic are addicts.<eos> It's for my son.<eos> It would cost me five years of my salary to pay for a year's treatment.<eos> And if I don't do it?
- Is that what you think?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so either, friends.<eos> See, my father's teachings show us that God, well, God just wants us to love.<eos> Yes, he does.
No.<eos> No, I don't think so either, friends.<eos> See, my father's teachings show us that God, well, God just wants us to love.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Yes, he does!
Do we really know everything about each other?<eos> That old Bronco outside, you say that it's practical, but it actually cost 300 a month just to keep it running.<eos> You keep it because you don't like to negotiate, and you don't want a new car.<eos> You love Patsy Cline, and you think that you sing "Crazy" pretty well.<eos> - I do.
The same energy it has always needed, love.<eos> The energy it needed when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.<eos> - I...<eos> - You do not have that.<eos> I do.
But don't you see?<eos> Out of the ashes, a new better world will arise.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You are due another dose.<eos> What I still fail to grasp is my true motive.<eos> Cardinal Rodrigo was a man of the cloth.<eos> I had no quarrel with him.<eos> Well, perhaps you did.
Eternal God, God of our mothers and our fathers, our God, we come before you today not in sadness or despair, but in joy and in confirmation.<eos> We come affirming...<eos> Stop it!<eos> We need to pray.<eos> No, we don't, Melissa.
After I found it, it was too late to text you and...<eos> Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How? You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
I thought the government was just being paranoid. I thought we were done with all this virus shit.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But Vince doesn't have it.<eos> If he did, he'd be dead already.<eos> Hey, Vin. How you doing, buddy?
You killed them.<eos> You hired me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Now.<eos> No, we don't.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Because you're letting me. [Chuckles]<eos> (Kevin) Nobody knows what they're saying.<eos> (Lolly) Yes, I totally do.
I know that look.<eos> Not even you believe what you're saying right now.<eos> What look?<eos> How do you know my looks?<eos> I just do.
Because it's different.<eos> Because of Alison, because you've already done it once.<eos> This is not uncommon in people whose relationships began as affairs.<eos> This fear that because you've strayed once, you might do it again.<eos> I almost did.
The CIA.<eos> Now I'm working for British intelligence.<eos> You think I'm going to believe that?<eos> I mean, do I look stupid? No.<eos> You don't.
You're brave.<eos> You did good.<eos> Why are you so calm?<eos> You just killed three people and you're acting like nothing happened.<eos> Well, yeah, I did.
You're going to go back to the city, find yourself a hotel.<eos> Contact me if you need to, all right?<eos> As soon as I'm done, I'll get back there.<eos> I promise.<eos> What if you don't?
If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know where you get these crazy notions.<eos> No one is pining over me.<eos> You kissed Jack, and I'm sure if you gave Charles the least bit of encouragement...<eos> Don't you have anything more important to think about?<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
- His leg was on Evelyn's lawn.<eos> - Yeah. I can't see Taylor chopping up a body and throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> - Katy does.
Yeah, yeah, I saw those.<eos> Looks like he got into a fistfight.<eos> How old do you think those bruises are, David?<eos> Recent.<eos> I don't know-- 24, 48 hours maybe?
He and his wife.<eos> They used the original tissue to make a son.<eos> We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need.<eos> Did he ever mention a son?<eos> He did, didn't he?
You know, it's not her fault, the way she is.<eos> She's not a monster, she was just... Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
All right, you jackass, go grab that box.<eos> We got to bring it home.<eos> You know we don't leave loose ends.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
I detected a pretty friggin' big one the other night.<eos> You know, suddenly switching to kidnap mode, "I'm here,<eos> "help me!" Remember that?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, I do.
I can hear OK.<eos> I mean, do you want to go somewhere?<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.
Oh, I merit going upstairs now?<eos> I didn't want to lose momentum last time.<eos> But you're feeling a little more confident?<eos> Mm, you want to go upstairs or not?<eos> I do.
I promise.<eos> We're gonna beat this together.<eos> You understand?<eos> Hey. How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
That's because they sent us to the middle of nowhere.<eos> Pop the hood. I'll take a look.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> I'm just looking at a pretty girl.<eos> Well, don't.
Please get them off!<eos> There's no ants!<eos> He's hallucinating, okay?<eos> You're gonna have to calm him down. - Aah!<eos> - What do I do?
Not so sure I want to thank you for that so much as rip your head off and piss on your bloody neck stump.<eos> Hey, good to meet you, Billy. Dad!<eos> Okay, so enlighten me, Marty.<eos> How does a merger that gives Maya the ability to produce her electric car for the masses help me?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
MARTY: We just need to keep Maya happy until those merger papers are signed.<eos> MAYA: Ellis is the king of making grandiose promises, and never following through.<eos> Big oil magnates in the Bay Area?<eos> Yee-haw! How does a merger help me?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Look, there are some of us, we want to get out of here.<eos> We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No. I do not.
- They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance?<eos> - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
Well, the fire at the ethanol plant and at the school both happened in the electrical rooms.<eos> I apologize for earlier.<eos> Thank you for trusting us.<eos> I just want you to know how much it meant to me that you would do this.<eos> I didn't do it for you.
We have an agreement, and this is for your own good.<eos> Well, for your own good, you better remember what I'll do if this takes too long.<eos> Please tell me you had no other choice.<eos> You know damn well I didn't.<eos> No, I don't.
We give him this, it is never gonna end.<eos> Harvey, before you say another word to me, I want you to think about the fact that I just ate a big bowl of shit because you brought that kid into my house.<eos> And I had to take it, so you're going to take it.<eos> You don't need to say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- It's Scottie.<eos> - Aw, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this, and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And I gotta tell you, it is a very generous bond, Mrs. Lowenstein.<eos> Your granddaughter is a very lucky little lady.<eos> I still wonder why the Dolphins ever let you go.<eos> You should have retired here in Miami.<eos> Well, everyone else does.
They don't need anybody else.<eos> I'm their father.<eos> They're safe with me.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yeah. I do.
If...<eos> If I let you go, they're just gonna barge in here and take everything back.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We don't.
I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I don't know. Just tell the truth, I guess.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Thank you, Daniel. See you next week.<eos> Did Daniel tell you why he had gone to Florida, Mrs. Talbot?<eos> He didn't.
He told me about George Melton and Daggett.<eos> He loves you... Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Look, I'm just here to help.<eos> - And how do you know Alice?<eos> - I don't.
And you know what that's like... other people's lives seem so much better than ours.<eos> More interesting, more attractive, more alive.<eos> The way he sees it, they got something that he needs so, he's just going to take it from them.<eos> No, he's never going to stop, he's just going to keep doing it and doing it, because he'll never get back whatever he's lost.<eos> None of us ever do.
This is what it looks like now.<eos> Aww.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Of course I do.
Where's Zachariah?<eos> That's what I mean ...<eos> he's down in the mine.<eos> I thought you said he'd stopped working.<eos> He did.
You're gonna be tempted to leave that loose so as to allow a valiant escape.<eos> You best perish that thought.<eos> You got any duct tape?<eos> - Got some over here.<eos> - No, you don't.
I found her truck some down the road, abandoned.<eos> No sign beyond.<eos> Gotta suck, be that close to the prize, have it shot out of your hand.<eos> - I kinda know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
Evening, sir.<eos> Where you headed tonight?<eos> - Headed home.<eos> - You got any kin waiting on you?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
- It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
Standing Bear.<eos> Hey. I heard you was out.<eos> It's good to see you breathing the air of your ancestors.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I do, actually.
No history of violence.<eos> She just lost it.<eos> Like jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if fry girl drank max rager.<eos> She did. Tons of it.
Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
And that's how we differentiate them from Drill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Drill is not a child.<eos> He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt and fool the parents, but they didn't know what to look for.<eos> I do.
How about "I want..."?<eos> I want... A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.
Thank you, guys, again, so much. I know that I already owe you you money but I want you to know that I got a new bartending job with better hours and free corn nuts which I feel like have a small but significant resale value.<eos> I feel like everybody's talking about that haircut I gave Vicki, so-.<eos> Oh, Britta.<eos> Can I- It's okay.<eos> Do I do this too?
- I actually love that idea. - Mm-hm.<eos> I'll go with her.<eos> She's wearing my pants.<eos> I know this is crazy, but I'm gonna check the school records to see if, you know, we gave a degree to a dog.<eos> - We didn't.
We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
No?<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> I love you, Abed.<eos> Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?<eos> Yes, I do.
You know, when they see us, they'll probably stop.<eos> What are we going out there for?<eos> We'll just say we're going to Walgreens.<eos> Mike, did you lock the door?<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, you smell clean.<eos> I suppose you washed your genitals real nice for her?<eos> - Carol, come on.<eos> - Phil.<eos> Yes, I did.
With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it.<eos> Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.<eos> Uh, yes, it does.
- Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I do!
- Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I do!<eos> - Oh, I do!
Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I do!
Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
I love you. I love you!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Go! Go! Come on!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Do it!
Does... does she know...?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. But I don't think Heather fully grasps the unique... Reynolds family connection, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's right.<eos> I don't.
Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more sentient strigoi.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- What is happening?<eos> Okay. Look, I know you're confused.<eos> You had feelings for Josh.<eos> And if Josh had come here last night declaring his love for you, it would be a different story.<eos> But he didn't.
Okay. Look, I know you're confused.<eos> You had feelings for Josh.<eos> And if Josh had come here last night declaring his love for you, it would be a different story.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> - Yeah. - Who did?
No.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Hold on.<eos> He's deaf.<eos> What do I do?
Here. Take one of my pies. It looks like you could use a little bit of comfort food.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're back early.<eos> It didn't work out?<eos> No, it did not.
Admit you lied.<eos> Well, then that would be a lie.<eos> [Kimmy] Okay.<eos> Then why didn't you not un-anti-believe that the apocalypse wasn't not coming?<eos> Because I never did.
What is the endgame here, though, Spence?<eos> Is it agent? Broadcaster? Coach?<eos> You're such a star, why not own a damn team while you're at it?<eos> Well, I figured if Venus and Serena could do it, - own a piece of the Dolphins, why can't I?<eos> - Magic and Jordan did it.
You're a conundrum here.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> As long as it doesn't mean "slut."<eos> It doesn't.
How can you think that you weren't?<eos> Okay, seriously, could you put a towel on or something?<eos> Don't worry, I'm going... To catch a plane to see the woman of my dreams.<eos> A woman who loves me as much as Riley loves you.<eos> Or... at least... Did before this whole thing.
Ha! Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
You said this was the extraction point.<eos> Uh, no, I merely implied that.<eos> I have no idea where it is.<eos> Although... Ah, so you did know.<eos> No, I totally didn't.
- Really famous.<eos> He's not kind of famous. He's not even close.<eos> I'm sorry, are you Gaga's new guitar player? My God.<eos> - Does he know Gaga? - Yeah.<eos> He does.
Which one tastes like the real thing?<eos> I'm just gonna get the most expensive formula they have.<eos> No, no, no, no, that's... that's not going to work.<eos> I tried that once, and he fucking flipped out.<eos> - Well, what do I do?
Thank you, Ray.<eos> So how'd you get my father to change his mind?<eos> I'm helping him deal with Varick.<eos> Varick stealing my trust fund doesn't mean a thing to my father.<eos> Maybe you do.
Yeah, go for it.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You all right?<eos> I didn't know you remembered that stuff.<eos> Of course I do.
I'll be 18 in six months.<eos> You have to go.<eos> You out of your fucking mind?<eos> - You followed me?<eos> - Fucking right I did.
I'm sorry?<eos> Were you gonna ask how the hearing went, or would you like to talk about your hairdo some more?<eos> I was. Of course I was going to ask.<eos> I just assumed it went smoothly.<eos> Well, it didn't.
Remember the first time Helen came here and I gave her wine and she didn't touch it?<eos> She literally made a face.<eos> I doubt she made a face. She did.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> She did.
You know you can trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You know, you can... you can tell me whatever you want.<eos> You don't have to hide anything.<eos> I don't.
Come on.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you? I spent the last six weeks doing everything I promised so that we could be together, which is what I thought you wanted too.<eos> - Do you want that?<eos> - Yes, of course I do.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She wants her stuff.<eos> Seriously, do you know her?<eos> I do not.
And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Does everyone just think I'm...<eos> I don't know what everyone thinks.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, of course I don't.
No, of course I don't.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.
They don't care.<eos> Sometimes I'm worried I'm... that I'm not a real person, that I'm just a... a figment of people's imaginations. I...<eos> You know, when I was a child, I thought I would do something with my life, I would make a difference.<eos> I was certain of it, certain that I would matter to people.<eos> - And you do.
Maybe you just don't want to take responsibility for her anymore.<eos> Why? 'Cause I don't agree with you?<eos> No, because we fucked her up, and you just don't want to admit it.<eos> Helen, don't you have any memory of how you were at her age?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He needs to take responsibility for what he puts in his fucking paper.<eos> Oh, my God, stop being this guy.<eos> You are not this guy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'll cancel the whole book tour if that makes you happy.<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I just...<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
If this is true, why... why...<eos> Why didn't we know about it?<eos> Because your father didn't want you to know.<eos> He... he... he worried it would do to you what it did to him.<eos> What it did to him?
He got me pregnant.<eos> I know he did.<eos> I really care about him.<eos> I think he really cares about me.<eos> He doesn't.
You must be starving.<eos> Welcome.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> That doesn't look like good terms to me.<eos> No, it does not.
- I'll go get it right now.<eos> - No, it's closed.<eos> Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat?<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
But it was better than where I come from.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> Josie.<eos> I went to the station, Eva.<eos> I did.
_<eos> _<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.<eos> But it didn't.
What was he doing?<eos> To really know life, you've got to be part of life.<eos> You must get down and look.<eos> You must get into the nooks and crannies of existence, the... you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is.<eos> And you in fact did this?
Oh, that's what you call it?<eos> What do you want me to call it?<eos> I like spending time with her.<eos> Do I want certain things for her?<eos> Yeah. All parents do.
I told Kimberly the reason I couldn't sleep with her was... because I had to serve Jesus instead.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you didn't sleep with her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Yes, yes, I'm happy.<eos> Anita. I didn't thank you yet.<eos> For saving Toby's life.<eos> You don't need to thank me, Laura.<eos> Yes I do.
You will.<eos> We don't have genes to pass on.<eos> A species to continue...<eos> the biological imperative.<eos> Maybe we do.
We're never getting out of here.<eos> Leo. We don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.<eos> Let's go. Don't you want to find out?<eos> I do.
- Don't kill our family.<eos> Look at Leo, he'll die too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> He does now.
Then why take the oil fields?<eos> For our mutual protection.<eos> I wasn't the one who was so willing to recognize her.<eos> I could see the Widow had no interest in preserving our way of life.<eos> - And you do?
But between my book and your compass, we can figure it out.<eos> What happens to you when you can't control your power?<eos> I can. You saw it at the parley.<eos> How do I know you weren't lucky?<eos> You don't.
I saw you on TV.<eos> You said you know things hear things.<eos> Prove it.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> You did it on TV.
Hey, guys.<eos> We wanted you to be the first to know.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.
I need to call Lena.<eos> I'll let you do that.<eos> What does he think Peterson has on him?<eos> The bullet.<eos> Well, if he does, then Abbott's toast.
The hearings are in three days.<eos> Well, I think I can come up with something if...you both want me involved.<eos> No, no, this is -- this is not your problem. Wait a minute.<eos> Dennis tells me you have one of the trickiest and most devious minds he's worked with.<eos> He did, did he?
You're pretty, Norma Louise.<eos> You always this quiet?<eos> I ran out on my wedding today.<eos> You did not.<eos> I certainly did.
What do you mean?<eos> We're lucky we got away with our lives.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, I don't.
Mendoza runs his counting house out of the back of M B Sheet Metal.<eos> Kylie says this month's shipment leaves for Mexico tomorrow.<eos> So we hit it today, while the place is flush.<eos> If there are no questions, do your final checks and kit up.<eos> Hey, Kylie. How you doing?
I can... I can delay him, I can send a code that maybe damages his circuits and delicate equipment, but he'll eventually figure it out.<eos> Plus, how am I supposed to send you home if I damage all the equipment?<eos> But, if I don't stop him then he's just going to time travel and kill us all and Emily.<eos> We have to play this very smart.<eos> Yes, you do.
Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR so your suit only has it's minimal functions.<eos> Body armour, electro-taser, active camouflage.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Alec, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
Everyone's got a blind spot.<eos> She used to be mine.<eos> Hey, maybe now she's yours.<eos> Marcellus has requested additional security personnel.<eos> Oh, marcellus did, did he?
Medicine?<eos> Those are the kinds of things an army needs.<eos> Yeah, for an invasion.<eos> We have to stop it.<eos> Yeah, of course we do.
Are you going to arrest Emily?<eos> If I knew where she was.<eos> Now, I could compel you to give me her location or you could just be a good citizen.<eos> Carlos, he doesn't know.<eos> I don't.
That's pretty common.<eos> An older canvas makes the work seem authentic.<eos> Easier to pass off.<eos> - So this guy knew his stuff.<eos> - They usually do.
She would never tamper with evidence.<eos> Maybe you could just take a look at the stuff we found, see if you recognize any of it.<eos> Without labels, it's impossible to say.<eos> These could've come from anywhere.<eos> But they didn't.
Mrs. Lewis was right.<eos> Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.<eos> She was a patient of another doctor in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.<eos> - How did we miss that?<eos> - We didn't.
- Well, you never tried.<eos> - I was embarrassed.<eos> And I was traumatized... by you.<eos> - Understand how difficult things were ...<eos> - No, you don't!
- The fact that "your father"<eos> and "murder" are in the same sentence.<eos> We talk about murder all the time.<eos> Okay, it's obvious that something is going on between you and your father and has been for a long time... because you have absolutely no poker face.<eos> Yes, I do.
What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
It's couture.<eos> It's gonna make me look like big bird.<eos> A recent psychological study found that wearing warm colors makes people feel that you are friendly and approachable, so something yellow might be more inviting.<eos> - Do you really want this place?<eos> - Yes, I do.
And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He does.
I'll take him.<eos> It's what my Mom would've wanted.<eos> Well, he's a good guy.<eos> Why did you tell Mom we weren't getting along?<eos> - I didn't.
She didn't want to move Duke away from his home and training facility.<eos> Million dollars is a lot of motive.<eos> The only problem with that is I found her will in the house.<eos> The daughters don't stand to inherit the estate.<eos> - The dog does.
Yeah, Maura, um...<eos> There's nobody around to interrupt us this time.<eos> No. Um...<eos> - Yes, I, uh, I-I kissed you...<eos> - Yes, you did.
- I really liked that big guy.<eos> - Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
I'm sure for Angela...<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, she can't know anything about this.<eos> - Well, you have to tell her.<eos> - No, I don't.
Sure everyone feels safe now.<eos> - Window!<eos> - All right!<eos> Circle around the back.<eos> - How you doing?
Nick is dead!<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Charlie, you're wrong.<eos> I know you work for TKG.<eos> I don't!
Eh? !<eos> Wait at the end of the line until you're called!<eos> They're all still green behind the ears and don't seem to have what it takes.<eos> I decide what I practice!<eos> No, I do!
- Damn, damn.<eos> - Excuse me a minute.<eos> What is it?<eos> - I think I forgot my blood-pressure medicine.<eos> - No, you didn't.
You have to hear what I have to say, and if you still feel the same afterwards, then... fine.<eos> I love you so much for your concern...<eos> But there's nothing we can do about this.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
You hurt my friend.<eos> I learned it by watching you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We both do.
We've made the vow to quit<eos> There's no way around<eos> I... I was drunk...<eos> I... I don't remember anything.<eos> I don't.
And I acted really mad about the standing, so we got it.<eos> We got standing!<eos> Yeah, they think Alicia wants to sit.<eos> I just need to call Cary.<eos> No, you don't.
Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia?<eos> Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
- the individual e-mail archives?<eos> - Mm...<eos> I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I'll send someone.<eos> Great.<eos> That doesn't sound ominous at all.<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, they're under assumed names, but, uh, it's them, yeah, room 207.<eos> 207.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm right here and I have no idea.<eos> I do.
Ncgobo's going to set another meeting with Todd.<eos> We're hoping Venter shows up to kill Ncgobo.<eos> That's when we grab him.<eos> How do you know he'll go for it?<eos> We don't.
You don't have any opiates in your bathroom cabinet, do you?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> - I didn't steal Alex's drugs.<eos> The other day when Maggie said you stole those pills...<eos> - I didn't!
You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> My compulsions tell me they're keeping me safe.<eos> They didn't work today.<eos> No, they didn't.
- Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> - When we waver in our duty, monsters get loose and people die.<eos> There is no need for tempers to flare.<eos> I can't believe you let her talk you into this.<eos> I did not!
Well, I've spent most of my life trying to make my two ex-wives and a handful of girlfriends happy.<eos> And looking back on it now, I don't- - I don't even think I liked them.<eos> But I-I like this one... because she doesn't want to look backwards, either.<eos> Now, if you have some practical advice to offer--<eos> We do.
Yeah. We can do 9:15.<eos> All right. Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him? Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
Look, I came to you to bottle the smell of sex, and we came close.<eos> But... even after distilling the most potent mix, our--<eos> Our results are still erratic. I know.<eos> Some women get aroused, some don't.<eos> Hm. 75% don't.
We see it all the time in the clinic.<eos> Somebody is suffering from a sexual dysfunction and they feel like there's no hope.<eos> But then they hear about us, and all of a sudden, there's a way forward, a path toward a cure.<eos> So, we continue with the study, but tell the women the thing they're smelling contains pheromones.<eos> Because it does.
Says... Emily Post, I've heard.<eos> Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side.<eos> And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.<eos> Don't you want Paul to be happy?<eos> Of course I do.
And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me.<eos> And so, just then, I slipped.<eos> But it was just a slip.<eos> And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense.<eos> It does.
175-foot geodesic dome, re-creating the climate of a lowland rainforest.<eos> Wow. Well, so happy that you're enjoying your time as a tourist, but starting tomorrow, I need you back in your business suits.<eos> We are beginning the next phase of scent research.<eos> We don't have another round of scent research. No.<eos> We do.
- Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Oh. Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
What do I want? Well...<eos> Do I-- do I ask for a divorce right away, or do I want a separation first and then a divorce?<eos> What do I say when he asks me why?<eos> I mean, he is gonna ask me why.<eos> Well, what if he does?
So they never made up?<eos> They were just... mad at each other forever and then just never-- never made up?<eos> I was hoping it'd be better between dad and me someday.<eos> What if I ruined that?<eos> Oh, honey, of course you didn't. Of course you didn't.
Uh-huh.<eos> Do you not? All right, don't do that, okay?<eos> You do something wrong, and then somehow you turn it around and I'm the bad guy.<eos> You are the bad guy. You can't see how you're the bad guy in this?<eos> No, I don't.
I didn't ask that.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What are you doing up here?<eos> Sid, I thought everything was on the up and up.<eos> No, you didn't, Louis.
Know what this is?<eos> This. Is. Your.<eos> Oh, come... Come on, Molly.<eos> Look, I did it for your own good.<eos> No, you did it for your own good.
No, you did it for your own good.<eos> You just wanted your doting little wife back.<eos> "Doting"?<eos> Are you saying I don't take good care of you?<eos> Of course you do.
So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you.<eos> But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I did that.<eos> I never said you didn't.<eos> But did you toss him into that cell?<eos> Do you remember doing that?<eos> Because I certainly didn't do it.
What do you do?<eos> My powers haven't manifested yet.<eos> So, you don't really have powers.<eos> I just told you.<eos> I do.
You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
You made this shit from Wolfe's blood?<eos> I made it from components of his DNA that I teleported from his blood.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You fall for his bullshit, again and again.<eos> I didn't do this for him.
I made it from components of his DNA that I teleported from his blood.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You fall for his bullshit, again and again.<eos> I didn't do this for him.<eos> I did it for the Kidz.
You say we're friends, but you don't know the first thing about me.<eos> All you do is moan and groan about your own life, so forgive me if I don't want to play a part in some big phony send-off.<eos> So tell me.<eos> - You don't wanna know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Shut up. Hey, language, please.<eos> When you were little, anytime I'd put music on, you'd wear one of my old t-shirts like a dress and you'd dance all around.<eos> And, of course, we had to watch you or you'd get so mad. Really?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> I do.
If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
If this is true, and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> - They don't?
No. Let's go out.<eos> Let's go to your friends. Let's go to your friends.<eos> Well, you have your interview tomorrow.<eos> You don't want me to meet your friends? I thought you wanted me to meet your friends.<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe as soon as another news cycle.<eos> What about the body?<eos> We just leave it over there?<eos> Brett Boris knew the risks.<eos> They all do.
- We're borrowing it.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - If we stay together, you might grow to resent me.<eos> - Why would you tell Toby about the storage unit?<eos> - I didn't.
Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
I'm doing her a favor, dear.<eos> Taking her money would be criminal.<eos> She'd only crash and burn in a much more humiliating and public setting.<eos> She doesn't have what it takes to go the distance.<eos> You, however, do.
You need to tell me now.<eos> Hanna! Okay, I... I went there to move everything out of the unit.<eos> I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there, maybe her body.<eos> I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.<eos> I didn't.
The sets.<eos> So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
We need to talk.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> Jason... We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Point her out to the jury, please.<eos> She's in the third row.<eos> She's wearing a blue dress.<eos> Does Mrs. Marin work for you?<eos> She did, she doesn't anymore.
Mike, you have to keep what you know to yourself.<eos> I already made that mistake.<eos> If I had gone to the cops the night I saw the blood and told them what Mona was planning, she might still be here.<eos> Yeah, but if you bring up what Mona did, who she was helping, this could come back to bite you.<eos> It always does.
Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
I'm not... I'm just checking in, okay?<eos> I'm just... Seeing how you are and, uh, how, um...<eos> - Well, it just seems like you and Dr. Herman are getting along really, really well, and you used to complain that she was killing you, but now you're happy that she's killing you,<eos> and it seems like you really, really like her.<eos> I do. Actually, I do.
You... are right.<eos> Technically, you didn't use the word "promise."<eos> But I'm here now, and we need to talk.<eos> I don't need to talk.<eos> I do.
And the Grimms always kill the male when he woges.<eos> That would explain why they never find the female.<eos> Oh, that hurts just thinking about it.<eos> That explains why she's got no record;<eos> only Linus does.
Maybe not, sir.<eos> Look, let me work on something.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> How long do we wait?<eos> We don't.
[Continues speaking mandarin loudly]<eos> [Whispers] Oh! That sounded like the word for "the."<eos> This is madness.<eos> [Man continues speaking mandarin loudly] You know what'll impress mom and get us up on the fridge?<eos> - No, obviously I don't!
She's not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She didn't come home last night.<eos> I thought maybe she crashed at your place.<eos> Well, she didn't.
You were there, too.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> I understand, Roman.<eos> I do.
She... She came...<eos> She came looking for revenge for what we did to her man, just like you said, and I put her on a plane out of the country.<eos> Just like we did with that whore who was fucking Andreas.<eos> She... She knew that it was catch a flight or a bullet.<eos> I didn't do anything to her.
He's an obsessive compulsive psychopath.<eos> Once he knew where I was, he'd have to come.<eos> He couldn't help himself.<eos> Then how do we find him?<eos> We don't.
So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
Are you OK?<eos> Why doesn't you mom want you to draw?<eos> I don't know.<eos> – Because she doesn't love me.<eos> – Yes, she does.
That's why I grew up.<eos> Sometimes, she wouldn't allow me to go out.<eos> Really?<eos> – Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.
Swearsie-realsies.<eos> And that's pretty sacred to us, so... we'll go help you look for baby A.J.<eos> In, like, five-teen, 40 minutes.<eos> And so Conway's plan doesn't strike you as unnecessarily complicated?<eos> No, Lana, it doesn't.
In, like, five-teen, 40 minutes.<eos> And so Conway's plan doesn't strike you as unnecessarily complicated?<eos> No, Lana, it doesn't.<eos> And it doesn't strike you as "Brazilian minstrel show meets Trading Places"?<eos> No, Lana, it doesn't.
The tumor's extended all the way up between the lungs. - Someone page cardio!<eos> - It's all the way up into the pericardium.<eos> MEREDITH: Get the suction out.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Don't do anything.
He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow. I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
- Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety, Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
Watch.<eos> RICHTER: What are you saying?<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me?<eos> Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?
When I came back from 2nd K,<eos> I can't tell you how many nights I would wake up in a cold sweat.<eos> - The nightmares...<eos> - I understand that!<eos> No, you don't!
I was in a bind.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
A medical improbability.<eos> That's what he called it.<eos> And I told you we could raise Siamese cats for all I care.<eos> But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.
I grew up in Missouri in a cold-water tenement.<eos> Red blood, not blue.<eos> My mother used to scrub it out of my school clothes.<eos> See, I had to learn to hit above my weight.<eos> We all do.
Yes, although I think our most heated were on the roof of Sukaly Dorm.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh. - Oh, we had big plans<eos> - to change the world, didn't we?<eos> - We did.
Tumor's buried in the occipital lobe reaching into the fourth ventricle.<eos> How's he supposed to get that out?<eos> Heck, I don't know, but he's got to try.<eos> Okay, tell the surgeon I'm sending him a scan and a roadmap on how to proceed.<eos> Who did the map?
But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> - I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
I would never hurt you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> If we live separate lives, move on with others...<eos> I don't want to move on with others, with anyone.<eos> But... but you do?
I'm wondering why it is so hard for you to trust me.<eos> Look at yourself... he's all over you.<eos> The gown, those jewels.<eos> You may not have strayed explicitly, but clearly you want more than you have.<eos> I do...
Just take her hand.<eos> I want to stop.<eos> If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.<eos> I don't want to learn.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm sorry the rest of the world can't.<eos> Thank you, Jack.<eos> You're the only person who has said that to me.<eos> I heard you got a medal from the mayor today.<eos> I did, yeah, yeah.
Me too.<eos> Stand by. I'll be right there.<eos> So where are we going?<eos> So you don't even know who this Malcolm person really is. No.<eos> No, I don't.
Because he thinks you stayed in town to help out, buy groceries.<eos> He thinks all you're doing is errands, not, you know, me.<eos> And have I been helpful with the groceries?<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
Anyway, what I was yelling about was dinner.<eos> What's happening with that?<eos> Um... oh, I think we have leftover pizza.<eos> We do.<eos> We do.
Your honor, the conditions under which Siya was murdered.. ..her lifestyle had a big role to play in it.<eos> Please continue.<eos> - Thank you, your honor.<eos> Did your daughter have friends?<eos> - Who doesn't?
They tried to kill me, shot up the RV.<eos> Now, Carol says she saw you.<eos> That you wouldn't kill those people.<eos> Did you let any of them go?<eos> Yes, I did.
Never.<eos> I promise.<eos> Your mother and I will always be here to protect you.<eos> I believed it.<eos> I really did.
Midge "hey edie, "let's me and you blow pam's boyfriend arn<eos> Behind the goddamn grain elevator" olerud!<eos> You had a boyfriend named arn?<eos> Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--<eos> Midge and edie did.
Okay, what are we gonna do for them?<eos> Flowers?<eos> No, that's weird.<eos> Yeah, no, w-what else can we do for them?<eos> - Do for who?
For years!<eos> We saw doctors. All of them said we couldn't.<eos> And Brenda was so... Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.
We had so many plans for a life and a family, and now they're gone!<eos> They're gone.<eos> Wendy, do you believe in God?<eos> Yes.<eos> But he didn't.
Fabulous!<eos> I'm going to a party.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.
Daniel, it's great being nice, but look where it's got us.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> It's serious now.<eos> We could go see his parents and try to work out a solution.<eos> His mother'll do nothing.
You okay?<eos> I'm being all shrimpy, and you seem distracted.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> I think I know what it is.<eos> You do?
That bitch!<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Uh, it turns out the dress doesn't fit.<eos> None of this does.
So what? A God?<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> The guy Molotov-cocktailed himself.<eos> That's bonkers. That's like demon-possession bonkers.<eos> Rick did it.
- Honey, trust me,<eos> - you do not want to play with any of this.<eos> - What do you mean...<eos> - You have no idea what you're getting yourself...<eos> - Oh, yes, I do...
Yes!<eos> We were alone in the workshop.<eos> How many times are you going to ask that?<eos> Until you tell the truth.<eos> I do!
Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
It must be worth a fortune.<eos> This site's value can not be measured in money.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Ylva, how do we do now?
You're free to go.<eos> Sir? I have to admit some confusion.<eos> Dr. Grace's telegram ascertains that Mr. Graham was indeed poisoned by water hemlock.<eos> Sir, how does that prove that Jagger Brown was seen with Graham in Toronto?<eos> It doesn't, George.
- How so? - You don't want to be doing that.<eos> - What? They're just parsnips.<eos> He was going to feed us all water hemlock.<eos> He didn't know it was poisonous.<eos> No. But everyone else here does.
We're taking good care of your husband, Eva.<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> There are a lot of people in the hospital chapel praying for Don right now.<eos> How you doing?
Be good boys.<eos> See you guys soon.<eos> We have the best kids in the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We sure do.
We have the best kids in the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We sure do.<eos> Hi.<eos> How y'all doing?
That's not that good, is it?<eos> "Mon," as in you have a "monster" case.<eos> How about "mont," as in, you have a case the size of "Montana"?<eos> These medical bills are gonna be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Boy, that really hurts, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, it hurts very much.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> You do?
Nice to meet you.<eos> Chief naval therapist out of the facility at Belle Chasse.<eos> So, what's with the gray hair, old friend?<eos> What gray hair?<eos> How you doing?
Well, smells bad to me, boss.<eos> Did you take the opportunity to discuss the pension increase?<eos> Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
Then this little nothing of a kid makes his life hell.<eos> Not a mule from Columbia, or a Guatemalan assassin.<eos> Just a little kid, with his day trader parents.<eos> What do I do with that?<eos> You did it.
And that's what her superhuman experiments were designed to stop.<eos> You think that Liam's after the Ellingsworths?<eos> Look, whatever he is after, he is willing to kill everything and anything that stands in his way.<eos> Including JT.<eos> Okay, what do we do?
- [ Sighs ] It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine. I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
You can beat this, Dean.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.<eos> You know, you also believed in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.<eos> No, I didn't.
We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
It's why we send you our boys until we get set up.<eos> Thank you. (knocking) Come in.<eos> Well, there you are, darlin'.<eos> My boys treat you right?<eos> They did.
She don't get scared.<eos> Not Hallie.<eos> But me, I can't write.<eos> She say "Boy, you got greatness in you."<eos> You do.
There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
You're still here.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, I-I, I figured...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> On the upside, that means your mother's budget cuts won't affect the position.<eos> You know who my mother is?<eos> I do.
Sorry.<eos> No can do. I mean it, Joe.<eos> They come out, or I don't go in.<eos> May I remind you that you have absolutely no leverage.<eos> Sure I do.
Worrying about me when you...<eos> When we...<eos> I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> But every moment matters.<eos> It always did, I just didn't...
I don't want to know.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> I get that, but I need you to understand...<eos> Dude, stay away from me!<eos> Apparently, the FBI does transcripts of all of their interrogations.
And then what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told her I'd made a mistake and...<eos> And I could never see her again.<eos> And I didn't...
No.<eos> I thought we could do Taco night.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mom, you don't have to cook.<eos> Sure I do.
She never even mentioned you or Taylor except to say you were beautiful, which you were, but you have to remember, this was two years before you were taken.<eos> We had moved on.<eos> Dad.<eos> You have to tell mom.<eos> You just do.
You know, David, all this contempt leaves me wondering why you even bothered to come here to warn me about your boss's intentions.<eos> Well, let me be clear.<eos> I don't want this to blow up in her face, and you seem like a shrewd enough operator to keep your mouth shut.<eos> She doesn't need any more enemies in the Senate.<eos> She sure as hell doesn't.
You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- If I don't get an autograph for my nephew... - Thank you. I'll never hear the end of it.<eos> It'll be a pleasure. No problem. But first, we should take care of a little business.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> So you said you had more pictures.<eos> - My client does.
I give real estate a bad name.<eos> (Mouths)<eos> Mom...<eos> I thought dad burned down the Bon Jovi shrine.<eos> He did.
Heather Drake on one for you.<eos> Mrs. Drake, this is Detective Reagan.<eos> Did they explain to you what's going on down here with your husband?<eos> Ex-husband.<eos> And yes, they did.
Thank you, Baker.<eos> You spun me. No.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
Ooh, I like when Dad talks tough.<eos> He sounds like Dirty Harry.<eos> You got to ask yourself one question.<eos> "Do I feel lucky?"<eos> Well, do ya, punk?
All I'm asking is that you give me the break that my childhood never did.<eos> Dairy Queen closes in ten minutes.<eos> Mr. Quagmire, your story is a sad one, but that doesn't excuse your actions.<eos> I have no choice but to sentence you to 20 years in prison.<eos> Oh, no you don't!
That was my yearbook quote.<eos> I just got hired at a new restaurant that's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan, and they are looking for another day pastry chef.<eos> I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.<eos> I don't know if I have the skills.<eos> Oh, girl, you don't.
Well, with Troy out of the picture, it's your tournament to lose.<eos> Sounds like a motive to me.<eos> You don't own a rifle, do you, Mr. Scruggs?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> Everyone around here does.
She might.<eos> Listen up everyone.<eos> A Frank Pulaski of the Chief of Detective's unit will be stopping by.<eos> Apparently, somebody is under the mistaken impression that something happened between two people of differing ranks.<eos> Which it didn't.
You know, you would be the best person for me to just kick off my interviews with.<eos> Sure, ready?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Nothing happened.<eos> Actually, something did happen.<eos> No, it didn't.
Detective Soto, please, sit.<eos> And I hope this can be real quick.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Do you feel you can be completely honest when discussing Detective Diamond's relationship with Captain Broderick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Good night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You just totally used me.<eos> Yes, I kinda did, yes.
But not for herself.<eos> - For her brother.<eos> - Yeah, she thought he'd be better off in the US.<eos> - So what, she didn't pay up?<eos> - She did.
I just borrowed a copy from our nanny.<eos> But what does that have--<eos> Where is she now?<eos> At home studying.<eos> What does Charlotte--
Only 10% of Americans have computers.<eos> Only 15% of them have modems.<eos> Not to mention the fact that you're only on Commodores.<eos> I mean, how do you really know that there are enough users out there to make us all a killing?<eos> We just do.
I'm sorry.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hey, it's Gabby.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
He's darkness.<eos> I know it.<eos> You need to arrest him, you make something up, get him, throw him in the pit, and never look back.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Voight does.
That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
I'm not sure they'll ever be.<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I should just... go back to being a prisoner in my own house?<eos> I don't know, Camille.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
(groans, splutters) I gotta pee, anyway.<eos> So... how's it going?<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
Thanks anyways.<eos> Do me a favor, don't tell any of the others about this, okay?<eos> I thought you had resolved to trust them.<eos> Well, some of them anyway.<eos> Yeah, so did i.
Yeah.<eos> I met him at the Dog Star.<eos> He was looking for a girl who used to work there.<eos> Is he the person who attacked you?<eos> I don't...
Just-<eos> To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all. I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.
You were fired.<eos> What can you do?<eos> Oh, there's things I can do.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have any legal moves left.<eos> I don't.
It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Now, I-I looked into it and we can't afford it, but there would be a small stipend for anybody who knows CPR.<eos> - Oh, I know op...<eos> I could do it, sir.<eos> - I know CPR.<eos> You do?
I don't mean to brag, but I really bring it with construction workers.<eos> I mean a man that you can marry and have kids with and have this for yourself.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Okay. Right.<eos> I don't.
He wanted me to endorse him for mayor.<eos> Wow. What did you say?<eos> I said no.<eos> You don't like him?<eos> I do, actually.
Then he'll convince you to sell your company.<eos> (gasps) I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't!
Even after your uncle was arrested, I still believed you were my friend.<eos> It was finally Selina who convinced me otherwise.<eos> I never bought your stupid act. She broke into your apartment, found the file you had on me.<eos> It was clear that you'd been sent to push me to sell my company, that your entire family was corrupt, but I still had to find out what your uncle knew about my parents' murder.<eos> Now I do.
We don't have a contract with an interpreter service on the weekends.<eos> So deaf people shouldn't get hurt on the weekends?<eos> It's not my policy.<eos> What about a video phone? You're supposed to have one of those.<eos> We do.
It's nice, what you've done here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's me, Glurg.<eos> NYPD!<eos> Drop it! Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
Who is Liam?<eos> Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
- Me, having a Gypsy here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit..<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
There are no ties.<eos> Uh, it's between us and a group out of St. Petersburg.<eos> $2 billion.<eos> What are they gonna do?<eos> What do we do?
That's how you paddled?<eos> The paddle isn't fixed to the boat?<eos> No, we hold it in our hands.<eos> The current doesn't drag the boat away?<eos> No, it doesn't.
So let's go find her.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you need a doctor?<eos> She needs a doctor!<eos> No, she doesn't!
That's nice work, baby girl. Good job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, take care of yourself.<eos> Come on, you know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Miss Pearce.<eos> Well, that was certainly more exciting than most evenings in here.<eos> - Did you see anything?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> And if I did...
Miss Maxwell, your brother told me he gave you a key so you could escape from this door.<eos> Rose?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It doesn't fit.<eos> Of course, it doesn't.
[THREE grunts] [whispers] Don't worry about it, it's not where I keep the good stuff.<eos> No drinking. Ohhhh!<eos> No drinking! Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast this momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> [TWO] No. We do not.
I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
It was, you know, probably my mom.<eos> Okay. Um, I'm gonna call you.<eos> As I can't destroy every phone on Earth, that'll remain a possibility.<eos> What?<eos> Done worse.
Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
Inviting, the possibility of a real connection, but when you actually arrive at Swenson Thanksgiving's door, the whole thing is just fat and upsetting and disappointing.<eos> But since you came all this way, you figure you might as well go through with it, even though you know when you're done, you're probably going to hate yourself.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi, sweetheart!<eos> How you doing?
Can we maybe save the lecture until after breakfast, please?<eos> What the hell is this dude bitching about now?<eos> I'm bitching 'cause it looks like Tijuana up in here.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
I just put in my transfer papers.<eos> DEA won't approve it until Sid's behind bars, but, uh... it's happening.<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah... I do.
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
You didn't do it right.<eos> I shouldn't have to do this.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't.
Being accused of a crime you didn't commit is a pretty good wake up call.<eos> Seeing you again made me remember the man I used to be, before I became...<eos> A complete jackass?<eos> Sorry, I don't mean that.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you do.
It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation. Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
Yeah, you too.<eos> So down there.<eos> All right. These guys are nut jobs at best and dangerous at worst.<eos> Now, how did you know where to find them?<eos> I just did, all right?
- without being seen?<eos> - You couldn't. There are no blind spots. Cameras cover everything.<eos> Why? What gives?<eos> Well, last week at the reception when Yussef Khalid allegedly entered the building...<eos> But didn't.
--Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
I'm not... I'm just checking in, okay?<eos> I'm just... Seeing how you are and, uh, how, um...<eos> - Well, it just seems like you and Dr. Herman are getting along really, really well, and you used to complain that she was killing you, but now you're happy that she's killing you,<eos> and it seems like you really, really like her.<eos> I do. Actually, I do.
Claude is probably just a link back to the royal family for Narcisse.<eos> A road back to power.<eos> And a very beautiful road at that.<eos> Oh, I thought you didn't care.<eos> I don't.
Oh, so suddenly you owe me nothing?<eos> What about the temple?<eos> The building which, until this Jesus appeared, was the center of your universe?<eos> Do you feel nothing for it?<eos> Of course I do.
Of course it is.<eos> How are you here? Oh, Abigail,<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
Sex.<eos> You know how much?<eos> Tons.<eos> You know how they say older women are awesome 'cause they know all kinds of stuff?<eos> They do.
It was here.<eos> It happened right here.<eos> He must have cleaned it up.<eos> Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?<eos> If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it.
A fellow smartass.<eos> I can see why you're his drinking buddy, though you're gonna have to knock off the hard stuff while you're breastfeeding, mate.<eos> You know, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you hated Stefan.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What on heaven and earth are you doing here?<eos> The ranters are right.<eos> This is the end of the world, and the dead walk.<eos> I was told a friend of the Indians lives in these woods.<eos> And so he does.
I don't know.<eos> What? Speak up, Mumble Princess.<eos> You sound like you were in a car accident.<eos> I don't know how to play.<eos> You don't...
Well, Max is fine with it, so...<eos> Yeah, because he's Max.<eos> That's not how he really feels, though.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do, Tay.
Why?<eos> Why did you sleep with her?<eos> We had two little babies.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, so you want to get the stuff on the list or do you want to make up the schedule?<eos> I'll get the groceries.<eos> Did you mean what you said about us working things out?<eos> Yeah, yes.<eos> I did.
I-I took my vows barefoot in front of the earth goddess...<eos> So that I could be connected to the soil and everything cosmic.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> [Scoffs] As if.<eos> Yes, you do!
So, maybe... Under better circumstances, y-you might want to stay married, maybe?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But she doesn't want to.<eos> She signed the prenup.<eos> She didn't.
Oh man.<eos> I'm ruined.<eos> What is it?<eos> She says to do it.<eos> Do what?
I'm Senior Cadet, captain of the football team, and I haven't got there by taking no for an answer.<eos> You have no clue how bad that sounds, do you?<eos> I got the message when the police cuffed me, and they threw me in a holding cell.<eos> I left her alone after that.<eos> No, you didn't.
Oh, so it would be okay if you were the one Who got there first?<eos> It would have been okay if you got there first Fair and square, Because then I would have believed you<eos> When you said you wanted to be a team. I do want to be a team, harvey.<eos> That's why I helped you after.<eos> No, you don't!
The vic's name was Bruce Epstein.<eos> Lived in Astoria.<eos> He was hit with three precision shots to the chest, all within one inch of each other.<eos> Bianco must've knew his way around a gun.<eos> Apparently so did Epstein.
Here, baby.<eos> - You know I could take him, right? - Oh, yeah.<eos> But if he teams up with and beary and squirrely, you're a goner.<eos> Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do.
Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do.<eos> - And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right? I do.<eos> And you know that Riley's being a terrible girlfriend by making me look like a coward on national TV, right?<eos> - I don't.
She's a federal agent?<eos> And a best-selling author.<eos> She's written several books on stalking.<eos> She mostly consults until now.<eos> Anything she doesn't do?
8 pesos, Presidente.<eos> I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
It's about a tyrant we can't abide by. You know that.<eos> I ain't seen Half Breed.<eos> He comes and goes; got a mind of his own.<eos> He's a smart dog... knows when to get, which is what you got to do till we whoop Santa Anna.<eos> And if you don't?
Sam, you said you'd hold at Gonzales; you didn't.<eos> You said you'd fight at the Colorado;<eos> you didn't.<eos> You swore to Burnet that the Mexicans would never cross the Brazos.<eos> They did.
All right. All right. All right.<eos> - Knowles, damn it. - Listen ti me.<eos> Ain't you supposed to be with the horses?<eos> I know. Just listen. I was wondering, if we blow up the bridge, how are we supposed to get back across it?<eos> We don't.
Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
It's not adding up.<eos> Benji, can we borrow against your campaign fund?<eos> No, no, that's illegal.<eos> I... I don't know, I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.
It's too much excitement for one day.<eos> He'll sleep soundly now, though.<eos> He's had his fill.<eos> He'll sleep soundly because his father's home.<eos> I did a lot of thinking in prison.
Wait. I heard you talking about how you'd always dreamed of having kids, and I felt terrible.<eos> You should be marrying someone you can have children with.<eos> Joy, you're the woman I want to marry.<eos> If you don't want to have kids, that's fine.<eos> But I do.
There's the death adders.<eos> There is no country on earth where the public perception of the country is further removed from the reality than Australia.<eos> It's just tourists.<eos> Hold on, what was that?<eos> What did that?
Why?<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, you're stupid.<eos> - Because you didn't sign up for this.<eos> - I did.
It's my fault.<eos> Calvin must have gone looking for him.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy.<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
Oh... that's good... here's the thing.<eos> I don't sing.<eos> I mean a little bit in the shower, you know, here and there.<eos> Do you guys sing?<eos> Yeah... I do.
Look, the missile's coming in high.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> I-I don't know, I did the calculations, and they were right-- they're always right.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know how I messed up, guys.<eos> Maybe you didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> I was coming out of the bar, and there she was.<eos> It really is fate.<eos> Talked to her?<eos> No, I didn't.
I mean...<eos> I like Danny Wheeler.<eos> Oh my God, how crazy is that?<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
I can't even begin to tell you how many times you broke my heart.<eos> Get off me!<eos> I'm here now!<eos> That has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
I will.<eos> - Does she know about the bunker is all?<eos> - What? ! - Does she know about the bunker?<eos> - No, no. OK?<eos> She doesn't.
!<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> Which everyone does.
I went to the pub earlier, and you were all anyone was talking about.<eos> "Rae Earl's off to uni!<eos> "Aw, you must be so proud, mate." Do you know what that's like?<eos> Why would you lie to me?<eos> I didn't.
Rae?<eos> Why am I even anywhere near a pub?<eos> What's there to be happy about?<eos> I nearly killed her.<eos> You didn't!
He's a big softie, isn't he?<eos> I had no idea he was so sensitive.<eos> Well, don't you remember him from college?<eos> Never talked to me at college.<eos> No-one did.
I'll calm down eventually.<eos> If you're proud of me, please be as proud as you want for as long as you like.<eos> I'd like to say I had an inkling when we met at Brancaster,<eos> - but I don't think I did.<eos> - I certainly didn't.
Mandy has to be honest with Kyle.<eos> Honey, we need to talk to her.<eos> No. We need to stay out of this.<eos> If she is over Kyle, she needs to tell him.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
The weapons stay out of your enemy's hands.<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> I don't think like that.<eos> I know a lot of young men who won't be blown out of the sky because of what I did-- what Annelise did.<eos> What we did.
It's locked.<eos> Actually, that would be my office.<eos> Yours is the corner suite. So...<eos> You know, I still can't figure out the meaning of a motorcade crashing into a basketball court.<eos> I just, I don't...
It just seems like something's on your mind.<eos> Just...<eos> Stupid family stuff.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Actually, I don't.
Instead...<eos> I lost my wife... to the virus.<eos> Didn't even get a chance to hold her hand...<eos> Or say goodbye.<eos> My children did.
There's another way now.<eos> With us.<eos> - I killed my daughters.<eos> - I know. No.<eos> No. You don't.
- It's hilarious.<eos> - NO, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You gotta put it on.<eos> I promised my buddy I'd get a picture of you wearing it.<eos> His shop did the embroidering.
Spaghetti when you have a small pot.<eos> Rules.<eos> Look, someone's messing with my life here.<eos> I thought you guys had my back.<eos> We do.
And that's so not cool.<eos> Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly. I did.
You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a...<eos> A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know. Yeah.<eos> I do.
A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know. Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
I'm almost done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Didn't you read my arrest report?<eos> I did.
I should've finished you off when I had the chance.<eos> Keep her away from me, Nick.<eos> Well, don't you two make a cute couple.<eos> Juliette, you know how this happened.<eos> I sure do.
I need a chopper!<eos> I need search teams on every roof! Let's go!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If this is a recording, when did they get her to say this?<eos> They didn't...
McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?<eos> Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really? You didn't tell us?<eos> Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
The bourbon-- it's gone.<eos> What are you, my mother? What are you trying to prove?<eos> I don't need you monitoring my intake.<eos> Ah, it seems to me you do.<eos> Well, I don't.
- Aren't you cold, dude?<eos> I'm really fond of her.<eos> Martin's gonna play oral sex.<eos> - But it doesn't have a penis.<eos> - But someone here does.
Those are fully necrotic.<eos> They're not coming back.<eos> So, can't wake him up to ask permission.<eos> Dr. Bell... Do you concur that I should amputate these fingers?<eos> I do.
Or your head'll spin!<eos> Alex, switch it, please.<eos> - Mom, but why?<eos> - Because.<eos> Just do it.
Alcohol, drugs and women...<eos> You're an adult, you must like someone, but don't hurry to touch her.<eos> THE BOY'S GROWN UP.<eos> - Alex, haven't you listened to me?<eos> - Why? I did.
Come here.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Why are you neighing?<eos> I was waiting till police'd give me back my driving license.<eos> And they did!
What?<eos> - Are you feeling bad?<eos> - No.<eos> - Didn't you get ill?<eos> - I didn't!
- Where to?<eos> - To strip off the carpet!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do you want to have a husband?<eos> - I do!
Riley!<eos> What's up?<eos> This is our new neighbor, Joshua.<eos> Uh, he didn't know any guys in the city.<eos> Well, he certainly does now.
Trubel came back to his house last night.<eos> Juliette was there.<eos> How could she be there if she got on that helicopter?<eos> That's what I thought too.<eos> But she didn't.
- What?<eos> Chavez has an exemplary record with the bureau.<eos> Five years ago, she was given the FBI Award for Meritorious Achievement.<eos> - Got an address?<eos> - I do.
We're going to need fire.<eos> Dude, you need to answer your phone.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just... I came to see if, you know, you needed any help.<eos> No, I don't.
If I don't like anything you say, they can look all they want, but they'll never find you.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.<eos> Wait a minute; how do we know she didn't just send a distress signal?<eos> You don't.
It's a Cosworth hearse.<eos> I don't care if it's a Bugatti hearse, it's still a hearse.<eos> And what it says to the patient is, "You're not going to make it."<eos> It does, James.<eos> It does.
~ I do. How many was it?<eos> ~ 14 of them.<eos> ~ 14?<eos> ~ Don't pretend you didn't know!<eos> No, I-I didn't really, actually.
Probably turned into some potluck, poster-making, sing-along.<eos> Don't jump all over her.<eos> - What?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> No, maybe I don't.
- Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
Just winning you over.<eos> I mean, you never said no yesterday.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Come on, you got to at least give me a chance.<eos> No, I don't.
We all have a responsibility of taking care of all the children.<eos> So Gab's your niece?<eos> No, she's my daughter.<eos> Either way, you know what happened to her.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I know what they look like.<eos> I don't know where to find them.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> She did not see us.<eos> Or perhaps she did.
Gab doesn't have a car.<eos> Maybe she had help.<eos> It's also possible that someone other than Sam Poteet is the new Hector.<eos> I thought you knew where to go.<eos> I do.
"Where's the maple syrup," you say?<eos> I didn't say.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm just saying the syrup's on the way over... from Vermont.<eos> - You didn't.
Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
Don't be.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> But it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> I don't want you to think that.<eos> I don't.
I think that's maybe something that Carter should know.<eos> I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> - I don't want you to think that.<eos> - No, I don't.
I guess when you're on the run as much as she is, you pick up some survival skills.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go check out the gazebo.<eos> Max told me what happened.<eos> He did?
What's that for?<eos> This is gonna suck all that mean little bee poison that hurts so much right out of your arm.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> It just does.
Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I did.<eos> I rocked the heavy eyeliner, and I had some t-shirts.<eos> Sure you did, Robbins.
Let's not do this.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> You know what? I probably shouldn't be saying anything, but I... ugh.<eos> - I feel like I have to.<eos> - You don't.
It's not so simple.<eos> What the hell isn't so simple?<eos> She's guilty.<eos> Wolf is trying to use her to turn on me, because he thinks I put her up to it.<eos> Did you?
We have the silver iPhone 6 with HD retina display, eight mega pixel eyesight camera and charger and you got the Verizon "More Everything" plan with unlimited talk and text on the 4G LTE network, and you also got the LG Tone wireless headset<eos> Oh, hey, do you wanna look at any of the protective cases we have?<eos> Yes.<eos> You really do wanna protect your investment.<eos> I do.
- Or a hook.<eos> - A fake profile.<eos> I'm talking to the FBI.<eos> - We must make it believable.<eos> - Only we do it.
I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too, if you want to make the drive over there.<eos> You really want me to come?<eos> You're not just saying that?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Of course I do.
A few months back, I got an unsolicited e-mail from an actual Nigerian prince.<eos> ♪ ♪ The prince needed to transfer $40 million out of the country.<eos> He offered to split that with me if I paid the five grand for the transfer fees.<eos> And you gave it to him?<eos> Yeah, I did.

Nicola Sturgeon doesn't drive.<eos> ~ What, in Scotland?<eos> ~ I know, I don't understand.<eos> How do you get around in Scotland, if you haven't got a car?<eos> No idea, anyway, she doesn't.
We've got a picture of one of those, I think, somewhere.<eos> ~ Yes, there it is.<eos> ~ That's the one.<eos> You think that the Green Party boss drives that?<eos> ~ Yeah, does she?
Do it on the way home.<eos> It's incredibly cheap.<eos> Now, a few years ago, we improved police cars, and last week,<eos> ~ we improved ambulances.<eos> ~ Yes, we did.
~ Yes, yes.<eos> ~ I was wondering, do you know Coronation Street?<eos> ~ Cos that's produced...<eos> ~ I know all those shows, man!<eos> ~ You don't!
You went racial.<eos> And, so, what was your first car?<eos> It was a candy apple-red IROC Z, a Camaro.<eos> ~ Apparently you don't have those here.<eos> ~ No, we don't.
I want something different for my life, and I do nothing to change the outcome, and I was given the chance to go wherever I wanted, and I did absolutely nothing, and what does it say about me?<eos> Squad, hold us down on a personal at 4215 Roosevelt.<eos> (dispatcher) Copy that. 4215 Roosevelt.<eos> You really want my honest answer?<eos> Yeah, I do.

Yup, that's why I love you.<eos> You're a simple man with simple needs who's simply adorable.<eos> Carl, Molly doesn't want to have kids anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Of course she does.
Sweetie... it's nobody's fault.<eos> Okay? We're in this together.<eos> Yeah, but what if we can't have a baby?<eos> I just need to know that you want to.<eos> I really do. Okay!

Saw it.<eos> - Do not kill her...<eos> - Do you have something better suggestions?<eos> We must do it.<eos> What do we do with Javi?
I have never done anything to that man, and if you think I have, then what can I say?<eos> I understand you have made comments that you do believe that gay people are evil.<eos> Those are strong feelings of hate, Mr. Briggs, and hate can bring confusion to a man that wants to control everything and everyone around him.<eos> I believe in justice just like everyone else.<eos> Do you, Mr. Briggs?

For the captain's exam.<eos> - So you're gonna go for it?<eos> - Well, it's the next step.<eos> I'm not sure if it's the right one yet, but I figured I'd take the test, see how I do.<eos> And if you do well?
The Queen and I are perfect friends.<eos> Forgive my scepticism.<eos> This support...?<eos> Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks... you're an easy fellow to get on with.<eos> Does he?
Yes.<eos> I tried my hand at it, but...<eos> - Well, let's have a look.<eos> - I fear I don't have the same powers of imagination - that you do.<eos> - Well, Edna, few do.
And if he was a thief, he would have stolen the merchant's rings, - or his money purse.<eos> - What are you thinking, Will?<eos> Remember, Miss Abigail worried for the sailor.<eos> She cared for him.<eos> Yes, she did.
And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.<eos> Stone and I will go talk to the professor.<eos> Admit it...<eos> You just don't want to go to a frat party.<eos> I really don't.
And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?<eos> 'cause i didn't want to waste my time Having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No. I do.
Henry graham?<eos> I'm afraid that name doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Uh, this man right here.<eos> You don't recognize him?<eos> No, i don't.
You guys, did zhang circle back through here?<eos> No.<eos> She stormed off that way, didn't she?<eos> Yeah. Oh. You don't think --<eos> Yeah, i do -- o'donnell's boxing gym.
- Did you hear me?<eos> We have to get to the armory before they do.<eos> If we keep moving, this might work.<eos> You don't have to kill people.<eos> - Of course we do. - Carol!
Relief?<eos> Well, that means Barry's not after me.<eos> See, I knew he wouldn't betray me.<eos> Oh, you and Madden had a thing.<eos> Yes, you did.
Drop it.<eos> Drop it.<eos> You okay?<eos> I had him.<eos> Yeah, sure you did.
All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
- You, with the luck.<eos> Well, I'm gonna have to go sort things out with the Atlantic City cops.<eos> - And no gambling.<eos> - Goes without saying.<eos> No, it does not.
You're too important to me!<eos> The Machine didn't tell you to do this.<eos> She told me not to.<eos> I... I thought I could sacrifice everyone.<eos> I... I really did.
Guys, it's a note.<eos> Received by our vic the day she disappeared, one your consultant just admitted he wrote.<eos> She was a cleaner, maybe he wanted to hire her.<eos> Before we came here, you said this was a waste of time, you knew your guy.<eos> I do.
All I could get out of my buddy at the 3-5 was that some new witness came forward.<eos> Someone who said they saw Sherlock kill Maria?<eos> No, someone who says they heard him threaten her life a few days before she disappeared.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.
So you're saying you want everything?<eos> I don't know, Harvey, but what I do know is I don't want your pity.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Nobody finds out where I live.<eos> I do.
It's good that we don't share everything in common.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> G, I love you like a brother, but we basically have nothing in common.<eos> Of course we do.
She just hung up on me.<eos> Rough call?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, thank you, Mr. Beale.<eos> I don't.
I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Tim from engineering never liked me.<eos> The more probable scenario is Mr. Peterson was involved with some bad people.<eos> It seems like he hardly left his apartment.<eos> You never know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> I do.
When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Hi.<eos> Again.<eos> Didn't you use to live in the apartment below?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I don't think he's diluted that, I think he's drinking it neat.<eos> And I think it might be really helpful to just sit down and have a chat about your problems, you know?<eos> With someone who has compassionate ears.<eos> Is this cos Padraic was hiding in your closet?<eos> Sure, he does that here.
Now you're just being disrespectful.<eos> You're gonna go to your room, and you're not getting dessert.<eos> Fine.<eos> I wanted to go to my room anyway.<eos> No, you didn't.
You're gonna go to your room, and you're not getting dessert.<eos> Fine.<eos> I wanted to go to my room anyway.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, you probably did.
I need to move on before I get emotional.<eos> Can't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.<eos> With everything that's been going on, I just... I feel like she wouldn't respect me.<eos> - You want to know what I think?<eos> - No, Nick, I don't.
I'm gonna pee my pants!<eos> Somebody call the planet of "Tron"!<eos> Doesn't feel so good, does it?<eos> We have three "Tron" people over here.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> You were thinking with your heart, which you always do.<eos> At your expense.<eos> I have no problem dropping it.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't. - No?
I wasn't implying... I have a position. You have a job.<eos> You fix. That's your job. You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...
You fix. That's your job. You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...<eos> I do not.

It was really quite clear.<eos> - It's quite long.<eos> - You know, look.<eos> - We want to be socially responsible.<eos> - We do.
My face is on billboards and pens.<eos> I have a balloon budget.<eos> But none of it ever lasts.<eos> Once this place is gone, they're won't be anything I can point to and say, "I made that."<eos> What did you do?
Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
But it is always the same lie.<eos> What lie?<eos> You weren't bored.<eos> No-one runs the way you have run for so small a reason.<eos> I do.
You know, you should try and close your eyes, get some sleep.<eos> It could still be a while.<eos> Do you think I hurt her? No.<eos> No.<eos> Ruby, you did everything right.
We had an argument.<eos> But she was high on Xanax, and she fell.<eos> Yeah, she was high.<eos> She was high because she knew she had to go through something she wasn't comfortable with, right?<eos> But she did it for the cause.
And this is my husband, Mike.<eos> Mike, don't forget your cane.<eos> He's got a pain in his hip.<eos> Tell him, Mike. [Sighs] Yeah.<eos> I do.
I don't want to know.<eos> Bottom line... you're on tink time now.<eos> And that means no smoking, no texting, no sexting, no mexting...<eos> Yeah, that's Mexican texting, where you write stuff in Spanish so you think I won't understand.<eos> But yo do.
Not when there are people like Luke Hulton.<eos> The boy you fancied.<eos> The boy who bullied me.<eos> I had to lie for 17 years.<eos> Hey. Not to me, you didn't.
I'm gonna get you some water.<eos> You need to stay hydrated.<eos> I know you think I'm a horrible person, and maybe I am, but I don't have to be.<eos> You have the power to change me.<eos> How do I do that?
An interested party has been following the case.<eos> The NRA?<eos> No, private individuals who understand the importance of this evolving issue, and would be willing to underwrite Fife's defense.<eos> - We have a right to know.<eos> - No, actually, you don't.
We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> How did you get her to, uh...<eos> I called her up earlier and I convinced her that she'd forgotten your birthday the other month.<eos> But she didn't.
She's gonna wake up.<eos> She might.<eos> But if she doesn't, I'm gonna have to make some decisions.<eos> And you did this for Mark.<eos> I did.
You got any duct tape?<eos> Who doesn't have duct tape?<eos> Okay, get me a roll of duct tape, get me a fresh towel, all right?<eos> You got it.<eos> How you doing?
We can do all this bucolic stuff when we're old.<eos> We're not old? That's awesome.<eos> This gets better and better.<eos> We got to tell the kids.<eos> Yeah, you do.
We're going to get through this, and then we'll find a way out of here.<eos> I should... I should have told you.<eos> Told me what?<eos> - I saw it.<eos> - We all did.
Oh, my God!<eos> Charlie Greenfield, executive producer of "Morning Mimosa"!<eos> Did I finally get tickets?<eos> No, no. These hands don't deliver tickets.<eos> Well, this one does.
I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?

Oh. Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now? No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
Why weren't you careful Mommy?<eos> Didn't you love me, Mommy?<eos> Of course I loved him!<eos> At least you know what happened to your boy.<eos> But I don't.
Anything at all.<eos> You're a goddamn liar.<eos> Oh, yes, you are.<eos> You remember everything.<eos> Everything you did.
The Countess told me she made a mistake, and I was the one.<eos> Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.
Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I did.
Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
Like justice.<eos> Like I was punishing the man who stole my boy. But you tried to kill yourself.<eos> Because I loved it.<eos> I loved it more than anything I've ever experienced in my life.<eos> Of course you did.
Who cares?<eos> Yeah, I love it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Full disclosure, I've been stalking it online to see if it ever went on sale.<eos> - It didn't.
You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
Okay.<eos> How about me and him... Plus 50?<eos> Welcome to Sinema.<eos> We don't look old enough to be here.<eos> Neither does he.
I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
Oh, boy.<eos> Zoe, we're gonna have to reschedule the bread.<eos> Yeah, Senior was so broken up over Linda, he forgot his cell phone at home.<eos> So he didn't tell Tony he was coming?<eos> No, he did not.
UNIT will cut out the Faraday Cage with them inside and take it away.<eos> Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.<eos> So when I found out Josh had feelings for you, I panicked.<eos> I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.<eos> Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this.<eos> Yes, I do.
I hope this cow was slaughtered more humanely than you just slaughtered the French language.<eos> Oh, it's French!<eos> Well done.<eos> In the ten years since I've had this competition, not a single contestant has had the courage to try and redeem themselves with me.<eos> Well, honestly, Chef D'Arby, I didn't do it for you.
We could blow up their mines.<eos> They'd just rebuild them.<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> All you people don't know about lost causes.<eos> Mr. Payne does.
He may be, if we turn him from enemy to ally.<eos> And on a global level, we also have the possibility of ending a major nuclear threat.<eos> Excuse me, sir. You wanna broker peace talks between the Mexican government and the P.L.F.?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do it in secret. Small circle.

That's really nice, Danny.<eos> Would you mind not burping in front of my kid?<eos> The last thing I want is for her to pick up that bad habit.<eos> Sorry, dude.<eos> Do it again, Emma.
Please... my-my brother needs my help. CALLEN:<eos> Think, Dogan!<eos> Did you loan the van to anyone?<eos> Did you take it anywhere recently?<eos> I-I-I-I, I don't...
-For what?<eos> -Come on, man.<eos> I can handle it. Did handle it.<eos> -What if you couldn't?<eos> -I did.
Come on, Suze. Is that any way to treat your family?<eos> Hello, Suzie.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Huh? You don't have a plan, you don't have a defense. -No.<eos> -You did this to us.
-Is there a woman you haven't mentioned?<eos> -A woman?<eos> I'm just saying, you weren't here when I went to bed... you've been running off on your own a lot these past couple weeks.<eos> I do that.<eos> You actually don't.
I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a Codex which is a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools... and it should help crack the Book of the Damned.<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.
Now, you can deny it, and you can run from it all you want... but that bad... will always win.<eos> I'll do anything you want. Okay?<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> I do.
Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> You're telling me that Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade, is walking into that?<eos> How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
I feel your pain.<eos> Look, ama.<eos> I've gotten used to the fact that my husband is always the best-looking person in the room and that he gets all the attention.<eos> When I was pregnant, women used to go up to him and say, "Felix, you look radiant."<eos> Ohh. He did.
This is my daughter.<eos> She's my son.<eos> You know, Cris, it isn't all ama's fault.<eos> You want her to say how great you are, but I'm not sure you know it.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.
Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do.
- For another.<eos> Bash, apart from you, I've only been lied to<eos> - and betrayed by men.<eos> - Who want you.<eos> They always do.
You used to call it "peasant food."<eos> That was when I could only dream of walking through the village with you on my arm.<eos> I am amazed at your resiliency, Greer.<eos> I knew you had it in you.<eos> I didn't.
I do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you.<eos> You can't.<eos> I've already had consumption.<eos> - How did you survive?<eos> - I didn't.
What are you, an angel? Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
39 years after she last saw him. She cried like a child at this news.<eos> As did I, as she told me how she'd missed her boy -- it's her only child -- for every hour of every day of every week since she last saw him.<eos> So I'm gonna find who caused a pain that's very much alive today, who took his life, who took hers... and I want to punish them.<eos> 39 years later.<eos> Your associates here, did you do your full due diligence on them?
Yeah, from Monday midday till midnight same day.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> Robert Greaves had a relationship with Jimmy Sullivan's girlfriend.<eos> Now, if Jimmy found out, got mad... .. went round to confront him... .. who knows where that ended?<eos> Well, except maybe Jo-Jo does.
Now all he's got to look forward to is dying in some pissy prison cell with East End Arthur to hold his hand.<eos> Last night, after we charged him, I sat in my office and I...<eos> Oh, I dunno.<eos> It just felt wrong.<eos> Of course it did.
Do you recognise him, Claire?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't remember hurting him?<eos> No, I don't.
What's up, turtle doves?<eos> John, did Saga say where she was going?<eos> No.<eos> - I'm going to step out and call her.<eos> - You do that.
- The museum guard.<eos> The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures. I don't know.<eos> Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
Man or woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hard. 'Hen' hit hard.<eos> - How did you get free?<eos> - I didn't.
It's pretty much what you'd expect.<eos> Care to elaborate?<eos> You know.<eos> I really...<eos> I really don't.
(inhales deeply) Four dollars for all of this.<eos> I mean, even if the chicken is pigeon, you can't beat that price.<eos> Sure you don't want any?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Of course I do.
Trust me, Mr. Weber.<eos> There is no problem.<eos> Enjoy the beautiful day.<eos> She really said she wants an open relationship?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Suppose we can use one of mine.<eos> I'm sure The Telegraph will reimburse me.<eos> Right?<eos> This trip has nothing to do with The Telegraph, does it?<eos> It did.
I'm sure The Telegraph will reimburse me.<eos> Right?<eos> This trip has nothing to do with The Telegraph, does it?<eos> It did.<eos> And then it didn't.
The bleed is resolved, but they had to put a shunt in to reduce brain swelling.<eos> Sounds bad.<eos> She said it was a routine procedure.<eos> I don't know if Joe said what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he did.
You're not, you're looking dubious.<eos> I know dubiety when I see it.<eos> ~ Raise your objection.<eos> ~ I have no objection.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to know why? (LAUGHS)<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
It is.<eos> You have to tell me, George.<eos> I need to hear it from you.<eos> Did you kill Archibald Brooks?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
Three weeks and a day.<eos> You're counting down.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Means you want to go.<eos> I do.
The thing is, there were others.<eos> Four girls, all teenagers, the most recent killed a couple weeks ago.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> If you hadn't brought me that information, we probably would've never found them.<eos> It doesn't do those girls any good.
You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> - But nothing did.
Sometimes when I'm at parties, I'm the girl who lost her brother.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I guess you would.<eos> How do you forget about it?<eos> I don't.
Turns out when Laurel disappeared, the manager was questioned and cleared.<eos> You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> - You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Goodbye, dad. - Olivia.<eos> Olivia!<eos> Why are you working with Rowan?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
- More? Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
Tandy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Trust you've had a chance to take a look around, huh?<eos> - I did.
Or should I say "Mr. Spoiler Alert"?<eos> What are you talking about, Tandy?<eos> My surprise, which this guy just spoil-alerted.<eos> I've made us a farm, a viable, sustainable, working farm.<eos> I did that.
My surprise, which this guy just spoil-alerted.<eos> I've made us a farm, a viable, sustainable, working farm.<eos> I did that.<eos> Nope.<eos> No, you didn't.
I've made us a farm, a viable, sustainable, working farm.<eos> I did that.<eos> Nope.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Uh, I sure did, Melissa.
The drinking, Ryan, it has to stop.<eos> And the flask?<eos> Feel better? Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how we doing this? Hmm.
Clearly.<eos> That Ryan was lucky to have someone that cared that much about him, had his back no matter what.<eos> I guess I wanted to inspire that kind of passion.<eos> You did.<eos> You still do.
Went to the academy together.<eos> Walked the beat together.<eos> I known the man 25 years.<eos> In a lot of ways, we know each other better than our wives do.<eos> Did.
- And what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?<eos> - No.<eos> You are supposed to feel everything that you're feeling.<eos> - These people that you hurt, I bet you don't even know who they are.<eos> - I don't.
And you managed to miss every awful part of it.<eos> - Do you know why I missed it all?<eos> - Because you don't care!<eos> - No, I do care.<eos> And I did Trouble all of those people.
I want you to tell your little brother he's got one hell of an arm.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Hailie, you have to keep it open.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
- What did you do?<eos> - Please, think I want to be stuck here with you?<eos> That thinny was my ticket out of here.<eos> Don't pretend you don't love this.<eos> - I kind of do.
You do enough you might even get the possibility of parole.<eos> Julian Powell.<eos> That's who paid me.<eos> A doctor named Julian Powell.<eos> - To do what?
I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
Why that one?<eos> It was interesting.<eos> Yeah, that is one way of describing it.<eos> How did you know to be there?<eos> The same way that you did.
Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> I do.
So you knew?<eos> That you and Heather connected, yes, I had a feeling.<eos> But she doesn't know you.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I know I'm right, I do! And, and...<eos> I know why Ryan would lie, but what I don't get is why you would go along with it.<eos> I just have to ask, why do you care so much who Ryan does or doesn't date?<eos> I... don't care.<eos> No, you do.
We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.<eos> I feel very connected to Grace in a way that maybe you...<eos> Abigail, I know you mean well...<eos> - I do.
Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is the best option for our town?<eos> I don't have the choice.<eos> - Sure you do. No, I don't.
She left you a note.<eos> It's, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> I thought you didn't want to talk about it?<eos> I don't.
Make mine a double.<eos> I got your text.<eos> - I'm glad Grace is okay.<eos> - And I'm glad Nick came back.<eos> He did.
Yeah. One and the same.<eos> - He didn't tell you?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - I just do.
That's true.<eos> Tara is family.<eos> So, is this really about Cassie?<eos> I... I still cannot believe that you left New York for this.<eos> I did.
This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.<eos> Dan, what's going on, man?<eos> Great to meet you. Good to meet you.<eos> All right, and this is the big man right here. What's up, little man?<eos> - How you doing?
There may be a way to resolve this.<eos> A deal that even he can live with.<eos> But we're gonna need to go through back channels.<eos> And we happen to have one.<eos> We do.
Tell me again, when did you first notice Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And? Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
Aww. You missed your flight.<eos> Seeing that look on your face almost makes the past year worthwhile, the key word being "almost."<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yes, we did.
- Baby.<eos> - ... that he would come? - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Well, I'm just trying to support Dr. B. She's been going...<eos> I don't need my situation explained to me, Ms. Warren.<eos> And your support will not hasten its resolution.<eos> If you need to get that...<eos> I-I don't...
Wow, he can read a map too, huh?<eos> - What am I gonna do there?<eos> - You wait.<eos> Your contact will approach you when and if he determines it's safe.<eos> And if he doesn't?
What I would do for just a sip of human blood.<eos> You know when you're feeding on someone's neck and their artery's still pulsing?<eos> I really love that.<eos> I thought your veins felt like sandpaper.<eos> They do.
So are we gonna talk about it? - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
You keep this up, you could become his lead general. What?<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> And I want to have my way with you without worrying who might see us.<eos> I thought that added to the allure.<eos> It did, at first.
Killer with a cause?<eos> Killer with a logo.<eos> Questionable human behavior that requires further study?<eos> I thought I came in as next of kin.<eos> You did.
I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here, in the flesh.<eos> Of course I have questions.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- He's a menace.<eos> I said I've got this.<eos> Look, no hard feelings, all right?<eos> It was just starting to get a little tense there.<eos> How about we do this:
The problem is, is not everyone respects your initiative.<eos> Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling, that you're responsible for the deaths - of those two people.<eos> - What? Hey, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did. And I understand why.<eos> But Barbie doesn't.
It's an instruction manual on how to use us to keep the life force alive.<eos> She made it for her successor, the next queen.<eos> And she paired you and Eva together for a reason.<eos> Your daughter is that queen.<eos> So Christine did this.
I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
She's a baby! She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
- Ben, I'm sorry.<eos> Jack's flight leaves in 20 minutes.<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - Yes, we did.
I'm calling about what she did.<eos> They're saying that Victoria committed suicide.<eos> But please tell me that this isn't just some sort of poetic end to Emily's revenge plan, that she's not that far gone.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, Vickie did herself in.
Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
He's rich, he's forgetful.<eos> Alicia, look at me!<eos> I know of which I speak, and you don't.<eos> And you don't either.<eos> So what do I do?
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Uncle, uncle. You disgust me.<eos> Come on, babe.<eos> Hey. Thanks for having my back.<eos> I don't.
Evans, you're on door breach.<eos> Patterson... flashbang.<eos> Boyle, stop squatting like that.<eos> Sorry, I thought it looked cool.<eos> - It didn't.
Your turn.<eos> Let me see your phone.<eos> I disabled tracking and the encrypted uplink, like you could have if you'd known how.<eos> Well, don't feel bad.<eos> Not many people do.
So you are mad.<eos> You pulled the rug out from under me, Gabi!<eos> You left me like a smiling idiot at Elliot's engagement party!<eos> I told you I loved you, I kissed you, and I know that meant something to you.<eos> - It did.
Well, she was the only one in the department with access to his account.<eos> I was wondering if you guys had any other thoughts.<eos> Why would we have thoughts?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Do you?
Well, I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Hey, Melissa.<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't expect you to say it back, but I'm not gonna pretend that I don't love you.<eos> 'Cause I do.
Yeah, but that's just it.<eos> I don't want to know everything in my life.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
- Huh!<eos> But yet...my head wants to share its personal feelings with you.<eos> Go ahead, Veer.<eos> Do you know what brother did after seeing the car in this condition?<eos> What did he do?
Because your brother was a washerman.<eos> He used to wear his customer's clothes.<eos> And your dad was a mechanic.<eos> He would drive his customer's car.<eos> Just like you do.
Oh, and by the way, I had to get rid of your little Irish lapdog.<eos> - 'What have you done to her?<eos> - She'll live. Which is more than I would have, right?<eos> 'I don't know what you mean.'<eos> Yes, you do, Grandma.
I am doing it for the sake of my son.<eos> And for the record, before I came along, you guys were a disaster.<eos> You've wormed your way into Walt's head, and that is a big reason why he's MIA right now.<eos> I don't need to listen to this.<eos> Then don't!
The villa in Monaco is out.<eos> We got bumped.<eos> Are we okay with that?<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> - Of course we do.
They will have our heads.<eos> Which is why I've taken steps to ensure that if such a bill passes, it won't be with a sweeping majority.<eos> Forgive me, Your Highness, but how on earth can you ensure that?<eos> I believe you know James Holloway.<eos> I do indeed.
We were talking about the barriers that people put up, and it turned into this... this thing about clothes and how they're just... just... another barrier that we use to keep ourselves from ever really seeing each other.<eos> Wow. That's deep.<eos> So that's the kind of philosophical brilliance you come up with when you're smoking meth, Paul?<eos> Meth?<eos> They did that.
I didn't.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
Well, that makes sense.<eos> I mean, after all, you are his best friend.<eos> Hmm. Must have been hard staying friends with him, though, right?<eos> I mean, after what he did to you?<eos> What he did to me?
Not the screams in the dark, not everything breaking, but when we spoke all night until the light came in with the Dominican music from the neighbors.<eos> Kissing in the cab, in the club.<eos> Telling me your dreams about tidal waves over the phone during finals.<eos> Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room with a burning hot pipe.<eos> I do."
How do you know?<eos> Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.
Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, yes, we do.
I mean, maybe you can call it that.<eos> What about us?<eos> I thought we were friends, and then you wait until my husband's stalking people before you tell me anything.<eos> This ain't dirt on the preacher, this is dirt on the girl, and I don't think she deserves to be hurt.<eos> Pernell does?
No trust, no relationship, no job.<eos> You at least owe me an opportunity to fix this.<eos> You can't end it on one mistake.<eos> You make it sound like we need to stay together for the sake of the kids.<eos> We don't.
the-the little... the little piggies with the tusks.<eos> Look, you're probably married, right?<eos> So, you know how it is.<eos> No!<eos> I don't.
Hi. I'm guessing you guys aren't here for the Beer Pong, Panty Jam this afternoon.<eos> The Beer...<eos> No, no.<eos> I don't know if I want to know what that is.<eos> No, you probably don't.
He requested a seat in the back near the cargo hold.<eos> You saw the video.<eos> Ford was watching him, and now he's dead.<eos> Debbie, you can't tell me he doesn't meet the criteria for posing a threat to passengers and crew.<eos> No, he definitely does.
What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?<eos> This has been delightful, but I'm afraid I have to go.<eos> Um, no. You're...<eos> you're not going anywhere. You have no cause to hold me.<eos> Actually, we do.
'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.'<eos> 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.
'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - We don't?
I wanted to help.<eos> I did help.<eos> We saved them.<eos> You had no obligation.<eos> Yes, I did.
Not for you, not for anyone.<eos> 'I know.'<eos> I was afraid.<eos> And I thought.. ...maybe it could take away some of the fear.<eos> But it didn't.
Hello?<eos> Louisa?<eos> Louisa?<eos> - I told you to get a new tub. - Huh?<eos> No, you didn't.
So, you see what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, he should have seen his doctor sooner.<eos> Climb onto the table and pull your pants down to just above the knee and put your hands by your side.<eos> Give me a hand here, doc.<eos> - You do the pants.
I was just trying to compete.<eos> What do you mean, compete?<eos> All the young lads looking at me like I was over, finished.<eos> I had to show them. You understand, right?<eos> No, I don't.
- I'll be taking notes as Dr. Zuber does the evaluation.<eos> Uh... evaluation?<eos> It's something we use to see if you're a potential candidate for the program.<eos> Did Dani help you build that?<eos> Yes, she did.
I don't know.<eos> We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.
He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
Lucky duck.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Now I'm going to take care of it.<eos> Looks like you framed someone without even trying.<eos> - Isaac didn't do anything.
Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.<eos> And when I woke up, she was like this again.<eos> For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.<eos> Maybe they don't believe me.<eos> Maybe you don't.
I'm sorry about your daughter.<eos> I've been handing out fliers at the church.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Try to keep it elevated.<eos> I always do.
Go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Not you, Kara.<eos> Do you really think that I don't know what's going on with you?<eos> You do?
I'm scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of what?<eos> You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.<eos> She didn't?
She ran the Guilty Remnant in Mapleton.<eos> But she's dead.<eos> It started happening right after we found Lily when you moved in.<eos> I thought she'd go away when we came here.<eos> She didn't.
I don't blame you for saving your family, Malcolm.<eos> I never would.<eos> I blame you for lying to me about the program,<eos> Ray, and everything that I believe in.<eos> Ah, John... what the hell did you do to me?
I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would.<eos> You know? Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
Don't bother.<eos> Joe, I think we could build a case for lack of probable cause.<eos> I confessed.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I did it.
No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
He's leveraging my health, my life.<eos> Harold, you're a decent man.<eos> The man I fell in love with, and now you're asked to do something indecent.<eos> But if you are telling me that your life depends on whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants, you know my opinion.<eos> I do.
Um...<eos> I was not in a position to make any observation.<eos> But you saw Mr. Rickter being brought in to Homan Square?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> You didn't?
You need to talk to them now.<eos> Rockwell?<eos> He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
So, um, then I thought it was maybe Geneva Pine, but actually she was out of town at a prosecutors convention.<eos> Hey, Dora, you're about to spill juice on the couch.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, what are you trying to say?<eos> Um, I'm saying from what I could ascertain, Detective Prima never deleted the e-mail.<eos> Uh, no one did.
So very nice to meet you.<eos> Well, come on in!<eos> Have a seat, have some popcorn, the official snack food of the State of Illinois.<eos> I didn't know we had an official snack food.<eos> We do!
She's your friend.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - I do.
He didn't see anything.<eos> We, uh-- we went house to house, block by block.<eos> I know.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - Already did.
And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our King, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> Do I believe our enemies would dare poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
Please. Where is he?<eos> You got anything to tie him with?<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> How do we kill him?<eos> We don't.
There are some things that I have to take care of first.<eos> I will text you.<eos> Good-bye, Mr. Decker.<eos> How do I know you're not trying to kill him?<eos> You don't.
I can't stay dead forever.<eos> So that's it.<eos> What more is there?<eos> Do I really have to say it?<eos> No, you don't.
Are they making him do it?<eos> No. If anything, it looked like he was in charge.<eos> Oh, my God. He's been lying to all of us.<eos> If he's working for them, you have to be even more careful, Jules.<eos> We both do.
Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe god wanted us to know That she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that...<eos> We have to let her go. I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
Forgive me, but have we met?<eos> Er, I don't think we've met exactly.<eos> Tell us more about Hillcroft.<eos> You see, I never had any higher education and so --<eos> Who did?
Yeah, I do remember her's.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> It's just that I've been led to believe that Jane may have flatlined on the table.<eos> But when I checked the records, there's no evidence of that.<eos> Because she didn't.
Don't you think he would want us to keep looking if it led to a new discovery?<eos> But that's not for anyone to say...<eos> Not you or me or Ivan Turing.<eos> Look, Julie, I understand how hard...<eos> No, you don't.
Len, there is nothing...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I - I talked to him today.<eos> He told me what's going on.<eos> He did?
And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
There's nothing going on.<eos> Business as usual.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you adore my brother.<eos> We both do.
Lieutenant Tao, tell the owners that we want the entire history of apartment 701 for the past three years.<eos> Murder and rape.<eos> I think I'll have to cancel my dinner.<eos> Good news, everybody.<eos> The lieutenant did great!
I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.
I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.<eos> I... do.
Okay.<eos> Give me a day to get some ducks in a row,<eos> Odd how things turn out.<eos> A month ago, no one wanted to turn on bishop.<eos> Now everybody does.
Danny, what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, this is my partner, Steve McGarrett.<eos> Steve, this is my lovely ex-wife, Rachel.<eos> You didn't have to come here.<eos> Yes, I did.
Kept out of trouble.<eos> Even got himself a job as a dog-walker.<eos> That's smart-- low profile, cash business.<eos> All right, how'd you figure out that Pelham was on Oahu? Uh...<eos> I didn't.
And it's very clear... if you don't win, you're a loser.<eos> Your mom will tell you it's how you play the game.<eos> She's wrong.<eos> Got it.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And that's worth two points, right?<eos> Yes, always worth two points, unless you're beyond the three-point line.<eos> And where is that?<eos> You really want to know this stuff?<eos> Yeah. I really do.
What kind of guy gets good at darts to impress girls?<eos> Worked with you.<eos> Robert was a great darts player.<eos> I practiced all the time so someday I could beat him.<eos> I never did.
I'll speak with Mr. Holloway.<eos> As always, I appreciate your time.<eos> Pryce... I answered all of your questions - twice.<eos> But you never answered mine.<eos> No. I didn't.
But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
That's why I visited dying patients...<eos> To help them pass.<eos> So you lied to me.<eos> You said you didn't have all the answers.<eos> I don't.
I'm doing what I set out to do.<eos> I'm solving this murder.<eos> Raquel was my friend and you killed her!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, but I do.
- We violated no copyrights.<eos> - We own proprietary algorithms...<eos> You were making it up as you went, at least admit it.<eos> - Connecting subscribers in discreet<eos> - The Source does a version of that... - Delphi, CompuServe.
Well, she seemed friendly.<eos> Anything?<eos> Uh, her name is Amber.<eos> She's a criminal justice major, she has daddy issues, and she wanted to discuss my search-and-seizure techniques.<eos> She did not.
I know, Sasha. About the port, the trucks, the shipping company.<eos> I'm a businesswoman. Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Okay, now that everyone's gone, I just want to say that I am so, so sorry.<eos> It was just a stupid revenge plot that got totally out of hand.<eos> You tried to roofie me.<eos> I was jealous that you slept with Zita.<eos> I didn't.
You tried to roofie me.<eos> I was jealous that you slept with Zita.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I just said that because you slept with Felix.<eos> - I didn't.
It's Andrew, babe.<eos> Hey, there's another girl down here.<eos> I'm Sara Harvey.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.
Hey, there's another girl down here.<eos> I'm Sara Harvey.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - We don't?
It always comes down to me.<eos> And everyone would be fine without me.<eos> God, Ali, no, it's not like that.<eos> You think it yourself.<eos> No, I don't.
'You've reached Spencer.<eos> Leave a..'<eos> Dr. Sullivan. I'm so glad to see you here.<eos> I called, did your mother tell you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she did.
I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
Ah. Yeah, that's the spot, man.<eos> I tell you, after a long day in the field, the last thing you need is to hear some bimbo screaming, "Harder," through the walls, you know?<eos> Well, small world.<eos> You know, Colby, I actually do have a room opening up here.<eos> No, you don't.
I can't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> It-it is taking all that I have to forget that place.<eos> 'It is bad enough I can't even walk by the photo lab.... '<eos> What did you do with that hair dye?
- Hello. Is this your idea of a replacement?<eos> 'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you.<eos> - He did.
People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
Yeah, right.<eos> You wouldn't, uh... You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
Wow. And you definitely used your creative writing skills.<eos> When... When did I have a solo exhibit at The Brew?<eos> I might have embellished slightly.<eos> But I mean, I do have your self-portrait hangin' above my desk.<eos> I did.
By who?<eos> There was this dark car, it was going real slow.<eos> Did the car hit you?<eos> It suddenly sped up, and... the side mirror smashed into my elbow and... I-I have to clean this up before your mom sees it.<eos> No, you don't.
No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
♪ I'd like to know your name... ♪ Toby, can you just call someone at the station?<eos> Hanna, when I turned in my badge I got frostbite.<eos> I can't call in any favors right now.<eos> Okay, if Caleb has some crazy plan and you know about it...<eos> - I don't.
I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.
You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
Come on, whatever happened to "if we're not failing, we're not trying," huh?<eos> Yeah, I know, that sounds fantastic. I just, I can't... I can't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Equity's only gonna get more expensive. You're gonna regret this.<eos> I already do.
You better start knowing, otherwise we're gonna jump-start your memory for you.<eos> Arkady paid me to get some information from an inmate.<eos> Patrick Berkeley.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I didn't.
Rocket ship to Heaven.<eos> How did we barely even hang today? I'm about to start my annual Arliss re-watch.<eos> You in? I'll FaceTime you.<eos> I don't think your friends like me very much.<eos> What? ! Of course they do.
I'll tell him as soon as we have a date.<eos> See if he'd like to look in.<eos> I don't understand why you can't just leave him alone.<eos> - Daisy, that's not very gracious.<eos> - Well, I don't!
Almost half a century of change and social progress.<eos> I hope you will find it as exciting as I do.<eos> Things have changed for you now.<eos> - You must know that you're quite free if you want to be.<eos> - I don't.
Just shut up!<eos> I don't know what's happened.<eos> Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa, or maybe it's just the same old Mary who wants her cake and ha'penny!<eos> - I never meant to --<eos> - Yes, you did!
Yeah, but he's not.<eos> None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up.<eos> It still doesn't.
Do we think?<eos> Detective.<eos> Damn.<eos> What you've been through, you don't have to explain anything.<eos> Of course, I do.
Yeah, she's about to get real friendly.<eos> You drug her?<eos> Not drug her, drug her.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
She was loaded.<eos> The kind of girl that didn't have to worry where her next trip to Ibiza was coming from.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> So, this mystery girlfriend, she paid for the coke?<eos> No, Zach did. With this.
When dad died, you moved back home to take care of us.<eos> When I started getting into trouble after that, you helped mom find Charton.<eos> When mom pulled me out of honor, you asked me to be your maid of honor.<eos> I thought you'd like that.<eos> I do, but...
Yes.<eos> So does it not therefore follow that if it's in the code it's in the game?<eos> Well, no, it doesn't, it's a little more complicated than that, actually.<eos> The scene is in the code, but the players can't access it.<eos> But Wildenborg did.
What do you mean, you're not gay?<eos> Do you not like me?<eos> No, of course I like you.<eos> Do you not like me like that?<eos> No, I do.
What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Oh, I think our bathroom is leaking again.<eos> I thought the plumber took care of that.<eos> He did.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why do people like these places?<eos> Heh. They don't. Not all.
I have water, I have tea, I have wine.<eos> Liv, tell me how to help.<eos> What can I do?<eos> What do we have?<eos> - What do we...
What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know. She's gone.<eos> She ran away. - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!
Ms. Clarke, my thoughts.<eos> I will grant bail, but I do so with great concern and under the strictest of conditions.<eos> If I hear even a rumor that my conditions for release have been violated, I will have you locked up so fast your inscrutable little head will spin.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do, Your Honor.
They're running more tests, and no results yet.<eos> So they sent David home.<eos> He's doing okay, right?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry...<eos> But I wanted to see my children for one last time.<eos> But apparently, they didn't have the same desire.<eos> - Oh, Victoria.<eos> - Louise did.
I trained for four years with the most dangerous sensei I know.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> We still have to find Victoria.<eos> We don't know where she's hiding.<eos> I do. No, no.
Griff and I leave for our trip tonight.<eos> You want to try to delay us.<eos> It's funny you should mention Griff.<eos> He's the reason we're here. He gave you up this morning.<eos> Sure, he did.
Why?<eos> Why, 'cause he's your buddy now, huh?<eos> He's your pal?<eos> No, because he has... nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he does, Sherlock.
- The Department of Defense said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> They called him a terrorist in order to kill him.<eos> SOC controls the Department of Defense?<eos> Politicians do.
You know, her fiancé was in Mom's unit?<eos> She's coming over for lunch today.<eos> Do I have to come?<eos> Of course not. Only if you want to.<eos> Good. I don't.
No, no, no. I- - I'm free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough. And I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Neither of them ever came out on top.<eos> And no one knows why he's so obsessed with killing Superman.<eos> what's the plan?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> We don't.
Unless you guys have a bunch of LSD lying around, I...<eos> Figure it out. We need answers.<eos> Chief, a handful of officers were dispatched to the edge of the town to deal with a situation.<eos> Do any of the officers know about the troubles?<eos> No. Not many do.
You think this is my trouble? No way.<eos> No, you're trying to undermine me to save Nathan.<eos> No one else survived. No one.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
I love you, James.<eos> Lucy, no.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I have to. You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
But he's my son.<eos> He's your son.<eos> We can't save him.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He already did.
Way to hold a grudge, buddy.<eos> I don't remember you from grade school.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Because you don't remember Haven.<eos> No, I don't.
My tongue died.<eos> Oh, uh, is it feeling numb or painful?<eos> So much worse than that.<eos> And the scariest thing is I know why it happened.<eos> Oh, you do?
That's like asking, if a chicken laid an egg in the forest, would you hear it?<eos> I guess it was a good thing I didn't ruin your life by offering to love and cherish you till death do us part.<eos> What are you getting so mad about?<eos> You didn't want to marry me, either.<eos> No, I did.
If I hadn't killed him, Lucy would have, and then all of Mara's work, your work, would've been undone.<eos> Worse than that, the Barn would've sent you home, and I would've lost you forever.<eos> Do you think that's an excuse?<eos> Excuses are for people who regret what they've done.<eos> I don't, because everything I did, I did for you.
I think we might need to talk about something. Ah.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Croatoan's offer has to be a little... tempting.<eos> You're asking me if I want all this to be over, live behind some white picket fence, adopt a shelter dog?<eos> Of course I do.
Go.<eos> - The Aether core.<eos> - Got it.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Well, you tried to once.<eos> Yeah, those charges were dropped.<eos> But now your husband really is dead, and I want to know why.<eos> Don't you want to know why?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I hate it too.<eos> But I'm dealing with it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> No, you don't.
I think it would expand it.<eos> This is not helping.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And I have to be able to tell you this.<eos> No, you don't!
- I know that, Patrick.<eos> Besides, she's been booking solid O.R. days all month.<eos> You're two days back from mat leave.<eos> You ask me...<eos> - I didn't.
I have to get back to work.<eos> You're in no shape to leave.<eos> You could have died today.<eos> Dr. Lin, I thank you for everything that you tried to do for me.<eos> I really do.
I'm sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.<eos> Why did you say no?<eos> Why was the offer even made?<eos> I mean, Ferguson doesn't want me there.<eos> Yes, she does.
I have not...<eos> No and you have already bashed my scone in for lagging, so we are even, right?<eos> So you can shut up, ya fat arse baby.<eos> I don't have a fat arse.<eos> You do.
- of the same crime.<eos> - Your Honor, if I could speak.<eos> In 2009 we needed to prove that Mr. Tatro had a specific intent to kill Mr. Jeffrey Garrix.<eos> - And they failed.<eos> They did not...
Argue for the inclusion of the transcript now.<eos> Your Honor, the defense would like the transcripts to be...<eos> We ask that the record of the earlier trial be excluded from the records as prejudicial, Your Honor.<eos> The prosecution wants to exclude this transcript for...<eos> Yes, we do.
On the... give me a sec.<eos> Grounds?<eos> Hearsay?<eos> Mr. Cain, do you have firsthand knowledge that Lexie Bromwich was using drugs on the day in question?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, I could have.<eos> You had all this stuff, and you never showed it to me?<eos> I did try to show you, but you wanted to take the case in another direction.<eos> - You didn't try to show me.<eos> - I did.
- We have to tell the judge.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen, Amber.<eos> When we argued for the transcript to be admitted, we didn't know it was false.<eos> Yes, but we do now.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so gthis worked out, Brett.<eos> I want to learn from you.<eos> No, you don't.
I couldn't abandon him yet again.<eos> I had to stay with our son.<eos> I have a son.<eos> We have a son.<eos> We do.
Any gang member in town could have came and done this and ran off.<eos> And nobody even knows you're here!<eos> - Gretchen, I have...<eos> You get arrested for killing a cop, and you go to jail and hope they sort out what happened here.<eos> And maybe they do. Maybe they don't.
Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh. Just stop!<eos> Just stop it with the... with the inarticulation and the slack jaw and the Neanderthal gait and the...<eos> I mean, did you really think that you could unsettle me by dredging up the past, did you?<eos> I mean, is this the best you can do?<eos> Governor, I... I don't...
We're gonna take 'em. On my orders we move.<eos> What do you think you're doing, Danny?<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> You have absolutely no grounds to arrest them.<eos> Sure, I do.
Get down.<eos> Get on the ground. On the ground.<eos> Where's your boss tonight, tough guy?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What do you want?<eos> Old friend can't come by to check up on you?<eos> I told you, I don't got nothing to say to you.<eos> I got nothing to say to you either.<eos> Somebody else does.
You're good.<eos> I'll get the video equipment.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> I thought you had that mother on 24-hour protection.<eos> We do.
We do.<eos> Then how did she get banged up like that?<eos> Detail must have slipped away for a minute.<eos> Do not tell me you willfully allowed that woman to be beaten by a known gang member.<eos> I didn't.
So I came in person like this.<eos> Kim Jin-kyu.<eos> Yes?<eos> Is this because of your dad?<eos> Anyang, Jinchun, Gwangmyung, you did it.
We're gonna be upside down and climbing up a Christmas tree before we know it.<eos> He was my best man.<eos> She's my sister.<eos> (sighs) Mol, you just don't understand the kind of position you're gonna put me in.<eos> I do.
It'll cost you.<eos> How much?<eos> Ten guineas.<eos> - How do I know he'll deliver?<eos> - You don't.
- In the tunnels.<eos> - What?<eos> That's what I'm to tell you.<eos> Said he'd know.<eos> Do you?
Are you talking about tucson?<eos> Just saying that's where there are other people, phil.<eos> Carol, the only place I can't go is tucson.<eos> I mean, do you not remember me getting, like, tackled, Driven out into the desert and left there for dead?<eos> Yes, I do, I...
Are you blind as well as stupid?<eos> Look in my ear and tell me what you see.<eos> Our party. Our rules!<eos> - Mind if we join you?<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Uh-huh.<eos> Where? - Hollywood.<eos> Mostly west Hollywood and Hollywood, but I got around.<eos> Where did you get your hookup?<eos> Well, I didn't...
I'm 10 months sober now, and I don't belong in here.<eos> So if you write about me...<eos> I'm not writing about you.<eos> You want to know about Alice or not?<eos> You do.
How do you move on when the doctor is still out there and the person that you loved... is dead?<eos> That sounds like the voice of experience.<eos> And it looks like it's having an effect.<eos> Maybe you could start by telling us what happened to your daughter.<eos> What did Dr. Henson do to her?
But he... h-h-he didn't want to answer his phone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why... why... why wouldn't he answer his phone?<eos> I don't understand why my little girl...<eos> I don't...
Look, I know he's Fisher-licious, but...<eos> Liam's been gone less than a week. The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
Stitching requires finesse.<eos> A feel.<eos> And you don't think I have that?<eos> No.<eos> But Camille does?
But maybe you did, Cameron.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah, you walked right past Barbiero and the car on your way to meet us.<eos> I don't remember seeing them.<eos> I don't.
Okay.<eos> I mean...<eos> Do I wanna fuck my dad?<eos> I don't know, Tom.<eos> Do you?
Tell me where the attack - is going to happen.<eos> - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please. NURSE:<eos> (rapid beeping) The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
And the... the piano every night after bedtime.<eos> And then one night there was no piano.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> You never saw her again.<eos> No, I did.
- Mm. - What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
I should have walked her home, Jim.<eos> She said she was feeling off and I just let her go and...<eos> You know, no one in her family even knew what state she was in.<eos> The Army is probably just gonna tell them that she died a hero.<eos> She did.
What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
That's good enough, Paul.<eos> I hereby declare you a citizen of the United States of America.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> How long did it take him to figure it out?<eos> He didn't.
I heard you, Charlie.<eos> It was a bluff...<eos> To light a fire under darrow, and then he...<eos> Took things too far.<eos> He did, not me.
Are you happy with that?<eos> No, of course not. Look.<eos> By not telling him that you know, you've got an unusual advantage.<eos> You can look into this without him suspecting anything.<eos> So, what do I do?
He said you threatened him?<eos> Well, you've just got to pity some people, haven't you?<eos> Fantasist.<eos> But why would he make that up?<eos> He didn't.
- No. Hell, no.<eos> The sketches never have any endings.<eos> It's a big waste of time, just like searching this alley is.<eos> You know, Javi, I think that you need to find a way to be more positive.<eos> No, I don't.
And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> Yo. I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
By the end of the day, Ryan Hardy will be dead.<eos> I'll call you when it's done.<eos> Sorry about the mess, but something tells me your housekeeper's amazing.<eos> Hey. You don't have to be here.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That means nothing to me now.<eos> You're not being rational.<eos> When he gunned her down, she looked right at me.<eos> I can still see her face. I understand your loss.<eos> No, you don't.
About me... not...<eos> Oh, Jamie, we've got bigger things to worry about right now than your erections.<eos> It's really not a problem, sweetheart. It worked perfectly well every other night, didn't it?<eos> Right, yeah, of course it did.<eos> Last night, it didn't.
- What? What's wrong?<eos> It's jammed. It ain't budging. EXPLOSION<eos> - Somebody drives that truck into it, that might do it.<eos> Yeah, but how does the driver get back inside?<eos> They don't, hon.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know what she's gonna do.<eos> I'm trying to support her.<eos> Do you have any idea how much it costs to take care of a kid like that?<eos> Do you?
...say no to whatever is happening.<eos> Sofia, she obviously made a mistake.<eos> That's 22.66 with tax.<eos> - You just keep the change. - Oh.<eos> What the hell did you just do?
No one from 51 dropped off a regulator, Kelly.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I went to Air Mask and spoke to Jerry.<eos> You never took your regulator in.<eos> - Sure I did.
Shut the door.<eos> I went to Air Mask and spoke to Jerry.<eos> You never took your regulator in.<eos> - Sure I did.<eos> - No. You didn't.
You come after one of my own.<eos> You really think you can buy your way outta that?<eos> I'm just takin' a page from the Hank Voight playbook.<eos> You have no idea who I am.<eos> Sure I do.
Val, that was an ambush.<eos> A coordinated attack on the homeland, and now we have the upper hand.<eos> Okay, well, they're our parents. They're not enemy combatants.<eos> And don't you want to expose this marriage for the sham that it is?<eos> - Yes, of course I do.
- He was about to tell me everything!<eos> Where the hell are you goin' now?<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, Uncle Eddie did.
And forgive them, Lord.<eos> They know not what they do.<eos> You were right.<eos> They didn't know what they were doing.<eos> But I do.
The fucking Congo can wait.<eos> Oh, your troubles are weighing heavily on you.<eos> I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible. Yes.<eos> Yes. Of course we do.
I'm just not ready for that.<eos> But, I mean, if you were never right together, then why are you still, like, holding on?<eos> Because then my mother will be right.<eos> She said it would never last.<eos> [sighs] And it didn't.
- I didn't expect you to...<eos> - Aria, why would I miss this?<eos> I gave you the camera.<eos> Remember?<eos> Yes. I do.
- I'm sorry, Hayley.<eos> I know you're excited Jeff's back.<eos> But he knows that Roger's an alien, and he can't stop himself from telling everyone.<eos> So he has to die.<eos> Mom, do something.
Interloper.<eos> She would say yes only to end up watching.<eos> How many times have you done this?<eos> - You really want to know?<eos> - No, I don't.
I know.<eos> He deserved to be punished.<eos> They both did, because Devon, he betrayed you.<eos> Right? I get that.<eos> I do.
Breadsticks.<eos> Redskins.<eos> It just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if it does.<eos> It doesn't, no.
And Kate.<eos> Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door. And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right... you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
Well, as much as it pains me to say it, seems like Oscar got a lot of work done today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Speaking of home repair,<eos> I think, um... I think that you... actually have a point.<eos> I do?
Yeah.<eos> She was.<eos> She was doing great.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - He did.
Well, that's just not possible.<eos> For your Captain Alden is a very fine soldier, and judging by the taste of his Indian mistress, an even finer lover.<eos> And he may run with him to the ends of the earth, but the seed is already in the boy.<eos> You know that as well as I do.<eos> Do I?
Would you like to amend that sentence, Inspector?<eos> I identified the car as that POSSIBLY seen on the night of Stev...<eos> Of Detective Sergeant Jackie Stevenson's murder... and I pursued the vehicle.<eos> Why didn't you call for backup?<eos> We did.
I'm a... I'm a good officer.<eos> But in this world, that's not enough.<eos> In this world, you have to be able to... nod and smile and drink a pint and say, "How was your day?"<eos> In this world, no-one can be... different or strange, or damaged... or they lock you up.<eos> So, what do I do?

You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
Rosa.<eos> We trust to our peril... but to not is to be alone... and then... Oh, the silence.<eos> Is that not why you keep us all so close?<eos> You see, I understand you, Inspector,<eos> I really do. This pretence of yours.
There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me? She does.<eos> Then why is she keeping me in the dark?<eos> - I don't need protecting.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It could be black market.<eos> You should ask hunter to contact the back-alley traders he knows.<eos> Hunter's not talking to me.<eos> You know why?<eos> I do.
It was only after she told me off that I got anywhere near the emotion that I needed.<eos> And the pictures prove it, by the way.<eos> And they also prove that he wanted to see Christa take her clothes off every night.<eos> You think he's the only one he did this to?<eos> If this creep did it once, he did... eh.
Hi.<eos> I was expecting Scarlett and coffee.<eos> Well, you got me and nothing.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Mm. How you doing, babe?
Seems like you took a huge leap for nothing.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But Kevin does.
I just thought up.<eos> You came to the hospital with an agenda.<eos> You wanted this to happen.<eos> So did you.<eos> No, I didn't.
You were hurt pretty bad, Budge.<eos> The doctors didn't seem that convinced that you're ever coming back.<eos> You think I'm going to die? No!<eos> No, of course not.<eos> But the doctors do? Hey!
Just tell them you're sick and you gotta go home.<eos> God, I wish.<eos> But, you know, i have my patients, and...<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> What? We do.
I was just checking on the cake.<eos> Here, come with me. Yeah.<eos> No, no, no. Wait. Can I have your attention?<eos> I think... I may be wrong, but I think it's time to sing Happy Birthday to the most beautiful barkeep of the Bakken.<eos> But before we do, before we do...
Is this a bad time?<eos> Well, it was, and then you called.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I need to know if you meant what you said today.<eos> I did, and I do.
- And he...<eos> - He loves you, too?<eos> Is that it?<eos> You know how many of you there have been?<eos> Do you?
Come on, Lace.<eos> I got things I got to catch you up on.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know why he had to tell you like that.<eos> I do.
- What's that mean?<eos> ! - It doesn't matter!<eos> All you need to know is, you do not want to get mixed up with him.<eos> And you swear to me... you swear to me you don't know where he is.<eos> What if I did?
Just have a drink.<eos> Look, you realize if Gary wakes up and talks, we're done.<eos> That's it.<eos> That is a really big "if," okay?<eos> And what if he does?
Dad knows.<eos> I had it out with him.<eos> We're done.<eos> So if your offer still stands, I'm in.<eos> Well, of course it does.
I'm Clifton's granddaughter from the land auction and the trip to Houston.<eos> Huh, Houston.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm guessing he didn't tell you about me.<eos> No, he did not.
I'm willing to take another chance on you.<eos> On us.<eos> Look, if that's not what you want, then you just...<eos> You really got to be honest now.<eos> No, I do.
Everyone in Vega must die.<eos> I love you!<eos> No!<eos> I always loved you.<eos> No... you didn't.
You're right.<eos> That was the plan. We'll go.<eos> We'll go get mexican. That's fine.<eos> You don't want to. It's... I do.<eos> I do.
He came over. We smoked a little.<eos> Do you remember having sex with him?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> But he definitely does.
You talked about how he chose to do nothing when he was battling his cancer.<eos> You told him he could have fought the company that caused it.<eos> He could have told people about it.<eos> He could have sought better care than what he was getting.<eos> Instead, he did nothing.
If there's something else that you want...<eos> I don't want anything else.<eos> Are you gonna sign it or not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then do it.
No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you are.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
Really?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seemed like you were slow-playing us. To see if he was healthy.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm looking at pictures from the shoot this morning.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I look good?<eos> Well, I haven't gotten dressed yet, If that tells you anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> Ah, Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
It says "evolve". It's one of Dylan's designs.<eos> The neck is the "v".<eos> There's two v's.<eos> There can't be two necks.<eos> Then why even do it?
I think I got something you're gonna like.<eos> [grunts] [clears throat] Bad bitch, isn't it?<eos> - Everybody, get ready to move.<eos> - $1 million. Hey. Yo, I thought you said we own the floor.<eos> We do.
They denied all knowledge of him?<eos> There's no formal employment records at Cristal Kebabs.<eos> Most of it's cash in hand work.<eos> In fact, we're making assumptions he even worked there.<eos> He did.
Stevie asked me to give you this.<eos> Take it.<eos> There's a couple of hundred quid here.<eos> Daft bird.<eos> What she do that for?
Alvey Kalina, maker of men, father of three, and business owner.<eos> I was drunk.<eos> Yeah, you're one of those, too.<eos> Nobody reads that jerk-off.<eos> They do now.
- I'd rather you not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> - You really don't have to.<eos> - No, I do.
So I'm glad you noticed.<eos> So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?<eos> No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out.<eos> - Yeah. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Your personal Pop-Tart.<eos> It is.<eos> It's my PPT.<eos> Then I totally get it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Max. You always do.
Took me a couple weeks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, 20 years in [Chuckles] I thought I knew all the places I had gone wrong, and I didn't.<eos> It happens.<eos> Certainly does.
To admit what I am?<eos> The Mayor -- what is she up to?<eos> It's nothing good, is it?<eos> I can't see everything... .. but she thinks she's doing the right thing.<eos> They usually do.
You always care.<eos> Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> I do.
You broke in here and the Wraiths spoke to you about the Hybrid.<eos> Why did that story make you so scared?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't remember it.<eos> Sometimes you do.
I am just experimenting with my style.<eos> I'm trying to figure out this next chapter in my life.<eos> I really love that Jimmy wants to be a part of it, but it also scares the crap out of me.<eos> I mean, what if I make this huge step and it doesn't work out any better than my marriage?<eos> Or what if you don't and it still doesn't?

I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired.<eos> We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
What shall you do?<eos> In my entire life, no man has ever made a meal for me.<eos> I feel I should thank you.<eos> You know whose badge that is.<eos> Of course I do.
We got to keep at it round the clock.<eos> We can't let it grow back now.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> I need to talk to your boss.<eos> No you don't.
- You have to.<eos> But... why don't we just send them all home?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then you tell Daphne why you have a problem with Larry 'cause you're the one who said you didn't want the kids to know about our financial problems.<eos> No. I don't.
Of course not.<eos> We were just being nice to him for the discount.<eos> You're our Ash.<eos> Don't you know that by now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Everyone.<eos> Myself, I-- I wasn't crazy.<eos> I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
I didn't.<eos> There's two of 'em.<eos> Where are they? We're gonna find out.<eos> How do you know they even got away? That they didn't get taken?<eos> I don't.
And yet you have time for idle conversation.<eos> You are the punisher. Yea.<eos> Gawain Maddox.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know your name. This is true.<eos> You do not.
You shut me out?<eos> You go against my wishes here?<eos> It's not easy, Deacon, but we have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just... I'm just really upset about this bar and Deacon, and...<eos> I mean, you remember how he was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Maybe you shouldn't produce me.<eos> Okay.<eos> But just so we're clear, I'm doing exactly what you asked me to do.<eos> No, that's when I thought you got me, Rayna.<eos> You don't.
Actually, I was thinking of something else.<eos> What's that?<eos> The C.E.O. job.<eos> I thought we already talked about that.<eos> We did.
- All right, all right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You need to come out and have some fun.<eos> There he is.<eos> Wade, how you doing?
Well, you know, the... launch party?<eos> The way you made sure that photographer didn't get a picture of the two of us together?<eos> I'm not gonna lie.<eos> You've chosen a lifestyle that most of my fans have trouble with.<eos> Frankly, my wife does, too.
- I wanted to say good night. - Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Little late for a shower, isn't it?<eos> So now I have to ask permission to wash my hair, too?<eos> No, you don't.
I think I'm done pretending.<eos> I called Granddad.<eos> I'm gonna stay with him for a while.<eos> You've chosen a lifestyle my fans have trouble with.<eos> My wife does, too.
- I'll see you.<eos> Hey, uh, before you go, I just want to say... I had a really great time.<eos> I mean, it worked.<eos> We worked.<eos> Of course we did.
Oh. Ah... you meant...<eos> - I did. - Yep.<eos> Yeah. I just... [laughs] just, uh, panicked for a second.<eos> I thought maybe it looked like I was hitting on you.<eos> Uh, didn't till just this second.
Did you at least get us coffee?<eos> Oh, my God. You stole this from Simon, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes. I did.
♪ Because you're mine ♪ Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
Go ahead.<eos> Say what you want.<eos> I am not good enough.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
All right, does it... does it make me creepy that I notice that you get up every time Alex leaves a room?<eos> Or that you go on long runs in the woods by yourself?<eos> Or that you somehow seem to know this campus like the back of your hand... that's creepy!<eos> You really want to know what's creepy?<eos> ! - Yes, I do!
That's one hell of a risk.<eos> If we want to find the second bomb, it's a risk we're gonna have to take.<eos> We know that the bomber planned their attack around the Democratic National Convention.<eos> That resumes tomorrow, which means we have 24 hours to catch them.<eos> And how do we do that exactly?
Keep those coming.<eos> Look, I need a favor, okay?<eos> I just had a pretty weird moment with Natalie.<eos> You know that scar that she has here?<eos> - I do.
He's playing a game with you, okay?<eos> What... what did he say to you?<eos> What changed?<eos> You didn't see him today, Ryan.<eos> I did.
I'll make you an offer.<eos> You fail this midterm, I'll unlock your trust fund.<eos> That's 10k a month to do whatever you want as long as it has nothing to do with the FBI.<eos> You know, for a second there, I actually thought that you believed in me.<eos> I do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I knew you were right, B.T. Dubs, about that bomb being fake.<eos> No, you didn't.
Congratulations on passing...<eos> What have you done?<eos> Let's just say I know things you don't want me to know.<eos> I told you everything.<eos> No, you didn't.
There are no bombs here.<eos> He needs to give us some more information.<eos> We're running out of places to search.<eos> I know you know where it is.<eos> I don't.
I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
What the fuck?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I weighed myself yesterday.<eos> It needs to be recalibrated, okay?<eos> No, it doesn't.
You got the... the ocean and the seals.<eos> You can have your baby there.<eos> Be with your family.<eos> Your brothers miss you.<eos> We all do.
Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry it didn't work out, but you can't blame it on me.<eos> Why would you mess up that?<eos> Like, why? Why, Mom?<eos> I didn't.
No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening.<eos> And people need to feel safe.<eos> So all these APBs on alien threats... those are to help people feel safe?<eos> Look, the truth is, you don't understand what you're dealing with.<eos> And you do?
It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?<eos> What if you do what?
That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
Joe has no authority to approve this.<eos> If you could just give me two minutes,<eos> - I could explain to you what it is and I'm sure...<eos> - Listen. Listen to me.<eos> I don't do fundraisers.
Maybe the killer was, too.<eos> It's possible, but before Alisha was attacked, the couple mentioned that they got some weird e-mail, right? Well, that e-mail had a nasty virus attached to it.<eos> It chewed up the operating system like a blender. I was able to un-mangle it, and it looks like the virus was planted to track their location.<eos> Do we know of any other Inhumans who got this e-mail?<eos> Joey Gutierrez didn't.
Tonight can only help you.<eos> This is a non-sanctioned fight, so even if you lose, which you won't, it's not gonna go on your record.<eos> - A loss is a loss.<eos> - Then don't fucking lose.<eos> What if I do?
He's good at it.<eos> Whole fucking night, man.<eos> Whole fucking night to showcase Alicia.<eos> Meanwhile, I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> You... we both do.
Of course.<eos> I don't want you to feel like I'm abandoning you.<eos> No...<eos> You don't even need to think about me right now.<eos> Yes, I do.
Looking for Rico?<eos> That's right.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> They don't know where he is.<eos> And I don't, either.
Well, at least we got them off the streets.<eos> And you... you... well, it was great seeing you out there today, lending a hand.<eos> Yeah, makes me feel that my sterling personal example hasn't been completely wasted on you.<eos> Uh, didn't you say you needed to, like, bless your flock?<eos> Oh, um, yeah. Indeed I do.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Jamie!<eos> - No! No! No!<eos> What do we do?
They communicate over long distances.<eos> Oh, that was you!<eos> Yeah, I just put their newfound mutation to good use.<eos> This little guy saved our lives.<eos> We did it, rafiki.
You can say it, you know.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - "I told you so."<eos> You don't need me to tell you that getting involved with Ray was a bad idea... you know that on your own.<eos> I do.
She'll be there.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - But you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
~ Well.. he was committed.<eos> ~ Help!<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ He was determined to reach 60.<eos> But he didn't, did he?
Hi. Yes.<eos> Um...<eos> I don't know quite how to say this--<eos> I'm fired.<eos> But clearly you do.
Get set...<eos> Go!<eos> He wants to submit to you just as much as you want to dominate him.<eos> But... I don't know how.<eos> Sure you do.
Uh, no.<eos> This is a prop.<eos> Buzz is running the projectors.<eos> Oh, it looks so real.<eos> - Mm. - It sure does.
It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't.
- The gun was found in your house.<eos> - Hey, I want to cooperate.<eos> - You think they're gonna believe that?<eos> - I don't want to be blamed for any of this.<eos> - Oh, no, you don't.
[ Voice breaking ] I-I appreciate very much being able to lay Mariana to rest like this.<eos> But I just feel it's unfair, making me agree not to meet with Paloma till she's 18.<eos> Do you want Paloma to lose everything that she has, Gus?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Of course, you are.<eos> You are a great doctor.<eos> All your patients would say so.<eos> Then they don't know me, and you don't know me.<eos> Jeremiah, I do.
You're buggered.<eos> Come on, I'll run you home.<eos> That could have been me.<eos> I almost went through with it.<eos> But you didn't.
If you had any decency, you'd leave.<eos> Is that what you want from me?<eos> Decency?<eos> I have a husband.<eos> You do.
But there are still doubts over his conduct.<eos> ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
You've been stalking her?<eos> I prefer body-guardian angel.<eos> But she disagrees.<eos> You know what she's like.<eos> Actually, I don't.
- Did you fix the match?<eos> - Would I do something like that?<eos> Oh. Well, in that case, I'm going to have to pay you with one of Simon's notes.<eos> The people loved him, didn't they?<eos> Of course they did.
Found something?<eos> Wait...<eos> Easy, Tonto.<eos> The one thing, the one thing you asked was that they keep Frankie out of it.<eos> - But they didn't, did they?
Those hot spots you see are nodules... very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon, I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
Not if Sammy's still here.<eos> Look, I need to be here as long as it takes.<eos> Okay, I do, too, then.<eos> That's the thing, you don't.<eos> You don't.
Which is why we're going to stop them.<eos> - Yeah, but why us?<eos> - I'm guessing we're all they've got.<eos> You two have powers.<eos> My other agents don't.
My eyes.<eos> You may have fooled opie with that metaphor, But we both know you got duck à la shit.<eos> Okay, new girl, I don't know who you think you're talking to,<eos> But this is what I do.<eos> What you do.
I can't ask her to do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't. - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on. How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
You just signed his death warrant.<eos> Put the bag man in the box and get him talking.<eos> I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> You want to know what I don't appreciate?<eos> We really don't.
Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
Got some strange stuff in here.<eos> - Like wacko strange.<eos> - Yeah. It looks crazy, but... I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
Marvellous, ma'am.<eos> All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> Deep-Ando, conscript.<eos> Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> Well, he did.
You just called me by my name!<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!
"Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did.
Adriana took me.<eos> I told you about it.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> - Didn't you get my texts?<eos> - I did, I did.
Transcendent.<eos> You are.<eos> And you don't ever need a man to tell you that.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Darling, I do.
to my face, and then I had to get up on that podium and be humiliated in front of all my peers.<eos> You left me to die up there.<eos> If I had told you...<eos> If you had told me, I could've protected you. If you had told me, I could've turned off the cameras in the residence.<eos> But you didn't.
Did you?<eos> I like Martinis.<eos> Oh, yeah, because James Bond likes them.<eos> It's... hey, nothing to be ashamed of, Perkins.<eos> Every new spy does it.
You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
I wanna provide.<eos> I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.<eos> So much.<eos> I've missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life.<eos> What do I do?
I have thought very hard about it, Your Honor, and I'd like the next season of "Identity"<eos> to be about Greg "Slider" Rasenick, the suspect accused of murdering Mariana and who's to be a defendant in your court next month.<eos> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mr. Beck, do you have any idea how complicated a death penalty case is?<eos> - Uh, yeah, I think I have a pretty good...<eos> - You don't!
Wait!<eos> Just wait.<eos> [ Stammers ] I think I need...<eos> [ Mutters ] I need a lawyer.<eos> ♪ Yeah, she probably does.
Hamilton/Lookwood allows me to see any doctor I want with extremely low deductibles, and the prescription plan is awesome.<eos> Anything else?<eos> You said the promotion you missed came with stock options and a bonus of?<eos> The entire package was worth almost $2 million, but I don't know how that's relevant because I didn't get it.<eos> No, you didn't.
- What?<eos> - Except we'd have a general with no army.<eos> Jamal controls the treasury.<eos> I have no way to pay Solomon's soldiers.<eos> I do.
You were right, Siddiq.<eos> We will not dishonor his sacrifice.<eos> I'm sorry, Abu Omar.<eos> I overstepped my bounds.<eos> Yes, you did.
You have nothing to feel guilty for.<eos> But the guilt that you hadn't made you paranoid.<eos> It blinded you and turned you against your own family.<eos> Rami didn't kill your mother.<eos> The Caliphate did.
Yes!<eos> It's still lunch time. Keep your focus.<eos> Yes, Chef.<eos> I told you it would work out.<eos> Yes, I did it Chef.
Well, I guess it's even worse than I thought.<eos> You can't even see any future at all with me.<eos> That's not it. Don't you get it?<eos> I'm afraid because I do want a future with you.<eos> - You do?
Far enough. Why?<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> There's something that can help us in another land...<eos> A land called DunBroch.<eos> I did it, Dad.
Is it something she caught, like a virus or a cold? Is it contagious?<eos> Stef, I'm not trying to fight you here.<eos> I'm trying to fight for us.<eos> Are you asking me if I liked the attention?<eos> Because, yes, yes, I did.
And I'm not stealing Louis' client.<eos> You're not stealing me. You already handled my divorce.<eos> Are you gonna tell me that Louis is a better lawyer than you?<eos> No, I'm gonna tell you that he's a damn good lawyer, and he'd do anything to protect you.<eos> And Louis doesn't do anything quietly.
We already had what we needed.<eos> No, we didn't. We had a hearing on it in seven weeks. And that C-section bullshit was just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> Between now and then, they'd have figured out a way to put it off for another two years.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- What is it?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why are you acting like this suddenly?<eos> You said you love being touchy feely like this, remember?<eos> No, I don't.
Why the switch?<eos> What does he have on you?<eos> My loyalties lie with the monarchy.<eos> King Simon didn't need me.<eos> King Cyrus does.
Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
How do we know he's not evil like the other guy? He saved my life last night.<eos> The question is why.<eos> I'm guessing you didn't travel between dimensions just to meet The Flash.<eos> That's exactly what I did. I came here to help you, Barry, to stop your greatest enemy.<eos> He already did that.
- Okay. I don't know what you see in your girlfriend, and you're getting a little tummy.<eos> What?<eos> Oh... Oh!<eos> I mean, uh I-if I... If I stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh... Oh, no. It doesn't.
Is that why you're here, to remind me?<eos> I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah. I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> But Zeep did.
It's an assembly line.<eos> Keep the court moving... that's all.<eos> Here's the other thing.<eos> You didn't make any money today.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm deniable. No contact authorized.<eos> We have to move.<eos> So you don't know for certain - it was Saul who put my name in the box.<eos> - Christ.<eos> Do you or don't you?
Look. Let Klaus and Elijah handle this.<eos> Rebekah kept Hope safe for months.<eos> She's my friend, and she's Hope's family.<eos> I'm not gonna look my daughter in the eye one day and explain to her that I sat back and did nothing while those people just kidnapped<eos> - her aunt. - Hayley, you didn't do nothing.
I want you to sit your ass down and tell me the truth About the dream.<eos> I told you before. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I don't know who this woman was.<eos> You know what, I just opened myself up to you To show you that I know what it's like to be you,<eos> But I don't.
They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
They've been looking for you anyway--<eos> I imagine to discuss your recent adventures in Lebanon.<eos> I don't know who I can trust there.<eos> But you trust me.<eos> Peter Quinn does.
You're saying you're not?<eos> 'Cause we don't have much time.<eos> I'm talking about classified material, for Carrie's eyes alone, not for you, not for your people, not to tweet or post on your Web site.<eos> Carrie only. Do you understand that?<eos> Do you?
Laura said she might be bringing you.<eos> I could really use your help.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I want to know what I'm helping you with first.<eos> We both do.
- Try now.<eos> Entering courtyard gate.<eos> She'll be inside in less than a minute.<eos> Without ears on, we need to know that's an SVR safe house, and we need to know it conclusively.<eos> How the hell do we do that?
What?<eos> This. You.<eos> Following me around.<eos> I want you to know I don't believe what they're saying about you.<eos> None of us do.
And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
Don't worry, Dad!<eos> I'll send you a cake with a file in it!<eos> These are just the owner manuals for all our kitchen appliances.<eos> Well, guess I finally have time to learn to reset the clock on the coffee maker.<eos> He never did.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and let them do this to one of my own.<eos> What, you mean your family?<eos> Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, that.<eos> Yeah, right. Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here, set you up with my lawyer, and get these charges dropped.<eos> Well, how you gonna do that?
Mr. Murphy and his amazing zombie boy.<eos> I want to see what happens when you bite a human.<eos> Quit lying to me and show me.<eos> Murphy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Kill them.<eos> "Felicity, the magnetic-arrow gag will never work."<eos> Yes, it will, my love, because I am really smart.<eos> And guess what, Oliver.<eos> It did work.
But you said to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.<eos> Well, now I'm saying something different, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> We don't want a generation of entitled, pudgy kids, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
That's life or death.<eos> I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on. Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Ah, I don't intend on leaving just yet.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> You really know the place on that map?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do?
Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen. No one does.
No.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> I think it's what makes them all heroes.<eos> Yeah, well, heroes or not, I'm not letting anyone die for me.<eos> Then don't.
Then what is it?<eos> I think Damian Darhk has someone operating in Central City.<eos> So I sent Barry to run down a lead. This kind of lead?<eos> He didn't know what he was giving me. But I run enough tests on your blood to recognize your DNA sequence anywhere.<eos> Felicity, you don't...
Nobody likes an "I told you so."<eos> Accept apparently Star City.<eos> Your approval rating is up 10 points.<eos> I have an approval rating.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
Lily: You'll have to excuse beau.<eos> He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal. Yeah.<eos> We do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of... magical juju.<eos> Look. Can you just please help us and take away these people's compulsion?<eos> Julian: Do you know what true bravery is?<eos> Most people don't.
Oh, this looks like a decent edition.<eos> ♪ Sick of leaving things half done... ♪<eos> Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
She is my kid.<eos> I think the courts established that.<eos> Lori, you have no authority to write a book about Carter,<eos> - or about any of us.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Come now.<eos> I was drunk, dropped my mobile and fell asleep on a boat.<eos> Inget happened, so drop it.<eos> -But if something happened...<eos> Yes, but it did not!
Well, we've been separated over a year now.<eos> Not my choice, but definitely my fault.<eos> Let me guess... you're hard to live with.<eos> I have my demons.<eos> Don't all cops?
More often, they are not.<eos> But they happen because Father is an influence peddler par excellence.<eos> And if he says he can restore us, he means it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I did not.
You want insults, just wait.<eos> You'll be hearing "triple murderer" in a minute.<eos> That is what I'm implying, Ms. Von See.<eos> That without any particular skill or training with firearms, you were able to create a bloodbath here that would look like the work of a professional.<eos> You did this yourself.
Saurav! Saurav, are you okay?<eos> Saurav! Saurav!<eos> Mr. Dixit, he'll be dead in an hour.<eos> By the time, you take him to the hospital they conduct the tests and give him an antidote it'll be too late.<eos> So what do we do?
Everybody needs a little help sometimes.<eos> Let's not say goodbye.<eos> - Let's just say...<eos> - I love you.<eos> They always do.
Not gonna be me.<eos> I just thought you should know.<eos> Hey, Hank, I'm going to partner you up with Pogue until Nick gets back.<eos> I don't need a partner.<eos> Well, Pogue does.
Isn't it your job to know? My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
In the beginning, it felt quite okay.<eos> I thought... perhaps it could become really good if we had sex.<eos> But it was not. -lnte now.<eos> He could not get up it.<eos> But it did like nothing.
You blame me for his death.<eos> - Question?<eos> - Statement.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
And like a firefighter cleans his rig, you clean yours.<eos> This is Center Stage.<eos> It demands your respect.<eos> Sorry, Dr. Lorenson, but did you want to lay down?<eos> No. Uh, no. I didn't...
Get him scanned.<eos> Let me know what comes back.<eos> Dude, you could've told her your theory.<eos> - I don't have a theory.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Same one I've used to settle many a disagreement at school.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're a loser.<eos> Hey, it works.<eos> Yeah, it does, just not on the brain-dead.
But they're gonna want to Cover their bases And make sure there aren't Any pissed off Business partners, Jilted lovers.<eos> I was hardly jilted, But won't it look bad To the cops If they know I was involved with him?<eos> It'll be worse If you lie, betty.<eos> It's not the crime, But always the lie That catches up to you.<eos> So what do I do?
But he's alive.<eos> I can feel him.<eos> I have chosen this human as my hiakim, my pet.<eos> My mother, you know where she is, don't you?<eos> I do not.
This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
It won't.<eos> Oh, my god, dana, don't!<eos> Ryan, tell her you love her, right now.<eos> Dana, I--I love you.<eos> I--I do.
Thank you.<eos> Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I love him.<eos> I really do.
- Please.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Did you fill up the tub?<eos> Did you?
- Go on, back to your work.<eos> Good God.<eos> Sir, what did they do?<eos> You'll know soon.<eos> Do your own job.
He was making very good scratch from the sales.<eos> Which probably seemed like small potatoes once he found out how much bank Nina was putting away.<eos> Yeah, with all the publicity she and April were getting, he turned it into his own cottage industry.<eos> You wondered how she paid for all the makeup?<eos> She didn't.
I just wanted the money.<eos> I try to be a good Bali man, I get nothing. I try to be an American... it's much worse, man.<eos> Maybe I did something terrible in last life.<eos> After all this, Vin... you can't still possibly believe in karma.<eos> Of course I do.
No, no, no, no! No don't!<eos> Anja? Anja, you hear me?<eos> Anja, the ring ... You have to give her back the ring! Anja, the ring!<eos> Anja, you hear me?<eos> Please, do something!
I was.<eos> But then I figured out you knew it was me anyway.<eos> How?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself.<eos> But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine. You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No. We don't.
I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours. You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
Here's a novel idea.<eos> Tell the Enchanter, "No, thank you."<eos> Tell him that you love your husband!<eos> You do not understand the Omec.<eos> And you do?
Shut this place down. Walk away.<eos> - And then what?<eos> What do you think would happen to me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
You want to take back your offer for me to make him an offer?<eos> That stands separate.<eos> You mean, you didn't?<eos> No, just checking.<eos> So, you did?
But he still made them watch. Look.<eos> He positions them so they're facing each other.<eos> That aspect is important to him, almost compulsive.<eos> You think he's ok? No.<eos> I don't.
Mama, can I play on your phone?<eos> Oh, baby, mama forgot it.<eos> We're gonna get you something to eat soon, I promise.<eos> He needs to eat.<eos> We all do.
Just let it go, man.<eos> Let it go?<eos> !<eos> Do you know what it feels like to dedicate your life to something and then have it ruined? !<eos> Yes, I do.
Rigby, catch! Aahhhh! - What the...<eos> - Hyah!<eos> - Ha. You missed.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Uh, yeah, you did.
It's beating.<eos> When did it start beating again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The hard reason to do this... The "no heart rhythm" part... We don't have it anymore.<eos> No, we don't.
Lie?<eos> No.<eos> We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed.<eos> No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
Boyfriend?<eos> 'Cause, uh, this is just a ploy for me to sneak my number into your phone.<eos> Levi.<eos> She doesn't have a boyfriend.<eos> Um, actually, I do.
River Road to the park and then back home.<eos> That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now? Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
It was my bad decision.<eos> Yeah, that you made because of me.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> You didn't have to come.<eos> Of course I did.
Don't make me be this guy, walking in here, you know, talking about breaking legs or worse.<eos> Ow!<eos> Ah, ah!<eos> Do you know what I do for a living?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I have to talk to Tyler Hogan?<eos> This would be<eos> Tyler "the Hammer" Hogan?<eos> He's very nice if you get him in a good mood.<eos> How do I do that?
Can I help you?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan Scully.<eos> And I bet you don't believe any of this alien exodus crap either do you?<eos> No, we don't.
If you want free speech, go to America.<eos> Great work, Cabral.<eos> Careful what you paint.<eos> - You certainly showed them.<eos> - I certainly did.
What is it about this girl that's got everyone's knickers in a twist?<eos> Including your own.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Doesn't anybody care that I'm happy?<eos> Of course I do.
We don't have to do this.<eos> You do realize it's filled with champagne?<eos> The good stuff.<eos> And are you kidding?<eos> Of course we do.
The monument is going to happen!<eos> No, it isn't!<eos> And for your information, the King sort of runs things around here!<eos> Oh, do you really believe that?<eos> Because you don't.
No, I've been high all day.<eos> You think we have it tough, take a look around.<eos> People struggle all the time.<eos> They do the very best they can and they fight to live another day.<eos> We all do.
Come on. I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
My experience Sir... the fruit of days and nights of hard work it was a very difficult investigation...<eos> Very difficult.<eos> Ah, 'Investigation'!<eos> So you were the first one to arrive at the scene? Yes Sir.<eos> And what did you do?
70 percent of all Turkish men, lose their virginity by fucking an animal.<eos> - Whoa! - Make it more like 20 percent chief!<eos> He's a city boy, this one.<eos> I bet his daddy took him to a brothel.<eos> Did he?
We were happy once.<eos> Till my mother started making up all those...<eos> lies. What lies?<eos> She said he cheated.<eos> He didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
Damn it.<eos> - What is that?<eos> It looks like the tumor's invading the transverse colon.<eos> Which didn't show up on the C.T.<eos> No. It certainly did not.
I'm sorry I didn't protect you.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I went against my gut.<eos> I knew it was a bad idea bringing you in there.<eos> Well, why did you do it?
No, you don't.<eos> And the fact that she did this to herself...<eos> I mean, I... I can't even imagine the guilt you must feel... That there were signs you should have seen of how much she was hurting inside.<eos> But you can't blame yourself.<eos> I do.
- There it is.<eos> - Nice. Give me the clamp.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, let's tack the enema down 'cause, uh, we don't want that happening again, now, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
Congratulations on matching to Angels.<eos> You're learning from the best.<eos> I didn't mean what I said before.<eos> I don't think those things about you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sorry.<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Shh.<eos> I want to tell you how fabulous you look right now.<eos> I do?
Because that car's a piece of shit.<eos> Harvey, watch your mouth.<eos> Lil, do we have enough for an extra plate?<eos> Sure.<eos> How you doing, Bobby?
Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Does he?
Shut up.<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's just going to be a little Nick on the side, and then we go to the game.<eos> They're gonna see that it's true.<eos> They're gonna feel horrible because they didn't believe us, and then we don't have to go to anything for a whole year.<eos> - Mm. - I have to say, it makes sense.<eos> No, it doesn't!
I've been on my best behavior, and you're not holding up your end, which, for some godforsaken reason,<eos> I'm not even allowed to comment on!<eos> Oh, maybe we could have a cheat day, and that day could be... today?<eos> Know what I'd like to pound?<eos> Oh, I sure do.
I have always had an iron fist in a velvet glove.<eos> You took the gloves off and that was a grave mistake.<eos> You need to subjugate your subjects.<eos> And I, luckily for you, have a plan.<eos> - You always do.
People just love me for what I am, Mum... they don't love me for who I am.<eos> That's just not true!<eos> Eleanor, look at me.<eos> Are you saying no one will ever love you for who you really are?<eos> Someone already does.
Good police work, I guess.<eos> But feel free to take the credit for it.<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I also told them that if you had help, say an informant, that I'd be the first to know.<eos> So... did you?
So we have a deal?<eos> You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones.<eos> - Whatever those are. - One, two, three, four!<eos> - He bought it.<eos> - Yes, he did.
You okay, bud?<eos> I really miss my dad.<eos> I don't think anyone gets how much.<eos> I do, kid.<eos> I do.
But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
You're gonna help me?<eos> You say that like I've got some great, big wall around me.<eos> You're right.<eos> That's my bad.<eos> You do.
- Overruled.<eos> - Why should we believe your account - of what happened to Ms. Todd?<eos> - Objection.<eos> Mr. Crouse's background has no bearing - on what he witnessed.<eos> - And yet in my mind, it does.
Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
Well, uh, we're placing candidates with our detectives in the field immediately.<eos> It's a trial period so that we can test compatibility.<eos> It does not mean you have the job.<eos> I'm not sure I want it.<eos> Of course, I do.
- Or is that too hard to talk about?<eos> - Okay, please don't turn this into every relationship I've been in for the last ten years.<eos> Yes, it was a traumatic event and, yes, there's some stuff I need to deal with.<eos> And I will when I have time.<eos> But right now I don't.
I don't think he did it. Neither do I.<eos> But that's because I stayed for the duration of his interview, and I saw no indication that he was lying.<eos> Why do you think he's innocent?<eos> Because I'm pretty sure I know who did kill Abby.<eos> You do?
Remind me again how this is for work.<eos> Oh, it's hard to explain.<eos> I'm trying to be bro-active. Oh.<eos> Ladies!<eos> No, I don't do Mardi Gras beads.
I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
And Peter revealed that he was having an affair?<eos> So, who was he sleeping with?<eos> Someone on that list.<eos> Dean Feller, I'm sure you know why you're here.<eos> Actually, I don't.
But if I can find out what happened to him, maybe there's a way I can let her know without telling her what's in the files.<eos> Look, if you know anything, just tell me.<eos> Wh-What do you care?<eos> About Rebecca Harris's dad?<eos> I don't.
- All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, so I've had about 20 minutes in the car to process this news, and I think I know what's going on.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Marijuana.<eos> Which is still illegal in Idaho, as I recall.<eos> - And unless you want the DEA doing flyovers of every farm from Boise to Coeur d'Alene, you will give the president your support on this issue.<eos> You know we do all we can to crack down on the pot growing.<eos> Do I?
Oh, well, there you go.<eos> Don't hate on lacrosse!<eos> Pretty big party, Cayman.<eos> But you said last night you wanted to talk about work.<eos> I did?
Yeah, it's good energy.<eos> It's real.<eos> Cayman and company back there can be kind of soul-crushing.<eos> Why would you want to be friends with people like that?<eos> I don't.
Must have been hard.<eos> I knew kids who grew up in the system.<eos> They all have a hard time getting close.<eos> I wish I could tell you that I couldn't remember everything that happened.<eos> But I do.
That's how you want to play, bitch?<eos> - Yes, yes, it is.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> I really do!
That's an ear infection.<eos> She could have been snorkeling at any beach.<eos> All right, check the alibi.<eos> I'll go to work on the fiancée.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Have you and Marty ever rolled around under the sheets without any clothes on?<eos> Once.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - I do.
Do anything fun?<eos> Yeah, actually, I took a stroll, went to the market, bought some organic peaches, made a pie.<eos> It was yummy.<eos> You did that?<eos> No, I did not do that.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Does she remember me?<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Nobody does.
Thank you, Derek.<eos> Good work today.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Those sons of bitches need to pay for this.<eos> Somebody does.
That's why your blood isn't clotting.<eos> Morwenna!<eos> Your heartbeat is very irregular.<eos> Last month, the specialist gave my heart an electric shock to fix it.<eos> Well, it didn't.
Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
It's a local bird that makes its call<eos> - just around sunset.<eos> - That gives us until tomorrow night, at least.<eos> - Or it already happened.<eos> - It didn't.
Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
- Your vision.<eos> The one that has you so upset.<eos> Maybe it's a misunderstanding.<eos> - That's not how these things work.<eos> - So how do they?
I hope the two of you haven't been waiting long.<eos> We were well attended to.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was worried something happened when you left so suddenly the other night.<eos> Something did.
Yeah, thanks for the help, then!<eos> In here, Doc.<eos> It's like fate, our paths crossing like this.<eos> - Makes you think, doesn't it.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Keeps trying.<eos> You got to turn your life around.<eos> Because you got to have one.<eos> You got to live.<eos> He didn't.
Well, if that information came from inside NCIS, it's more than just troubling.<eos> - Oh, of course, I agree.<eos> - There's a good chance the mole we apprehended last year gave up this information before we got him.<eos> And we still don't know who he was working for?<eos> We don't.
You're amazing.<eos> It was one of those moments when it felt like it was all right there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I want this.<eos> Shauna, I do.
That nurse.<eos> You said she was gonna take care of my dad, not make him sick.<eos> Don't blame Sipiwe, mate.<eos> Forget her anyway. She's gone.<eos> Sipiwe didn't do anything.
I'm not calling him at work.<eos> Hi, is this Mrs. Bondi?<eos> Hi. I work with your husband, do... do you mind getting him for me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bob. Hey, how you doing?
I didn't do anything to you!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> I don't want to die!<eos> Shut up! ♪ ♪ You know who this is?<eos> No, I don't.
When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Five weeks ago, we had a blow-out.<eos> She went to Hong Kong to visit one of her friends.<eos> Um, I thought that she would just cool off and come back like she always did.<eos> But she didn't.
YOUNG MAN: Hey, your costume's really cute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I made it myself. Nice.<eos> YOUNG MAN: So how do you know Dave?<eos> I don't.
I'm not gonna repeat it back to you, but I got it.<eos> I think I would feel better if you just said it once back to me that it was clear.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna be you and repeat it back to you.<eos> No, don't just repeat my words, say it in your own words, so I know that you got the message.<eos> But if I do it as me, then all the...
Turns out that you grew up down the road from the fish farm where Nesbit's body was dumped.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So I threw his body in the pond, but after his organs were properly distributed.<eos> Are you still claiming that you didn't kill him?<eos> Of course I didn't.
Safe travels.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So should I say it now or later?<eos> Fine. You told me so.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Excuse me.<eos> Doc Wade.<eos> Says she got something.<eos> Upon examining the victim, I found several traumatic injuries, but it's likely the fatal blow was to the skull.<eos> Hey, Danny, how you doing?
What took you so long?<eos> Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
Lachlan altered the geological report.<eos> I just sweet-talked the secretary to fax over the original.<eos> Yes, that's what Scott just told me.<eos> - But how's that possible? - What? Um, have you, uh, had a chance to glance at his résumé yet?<eos> Uh... yeah, I did.
I want a lawyer.<eos> Rosie, I think we're gonna nail Ian.<eos> He had access to the bacteria that's used in...<eos> - Perfume, yeah, I know.<eos> - Of course you do.
Nonsense.<eos> I am here.<eos> You know what my name means?<eos> Tisquantum?<eos> I do not.
She was counting the days until she would see you again.<eos> Come.<eos> Do you remember her?<eos> You were very young, 'tis alright if you don't.<eos> I do, a little.
And I agree.<eos> You spoke to your sister about our situation?<eos> Well, I had to.<eos> I can't talk to you about it till after the case is over, remember?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> You recognize either of these guys?<eos> Either one bring their cars in?<eos> - No. - Nuh-uh.<eos> Joe did a huge install for some mystery guy at his house, though.
Thank you... Officer.<eos> - Impressive.<eos> - The iron fist of the law has a soft centre.<eos> Give us a go on your gun.<eos> What do I do?
The ladies who lunge are super judgy.<eos> The boss gave Isabel an unlimited budget for clothes.<eos> I took her to fashion week, introduced her to designers, but she was more into jeans and t-shirts.<eos> - I approve.<eos> - Mr. Van Doren didn't.
You did a good job.<eos> The 911 called the DNA on the broken windshield.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I thought that would convince him.<eos> It did.
Oh. Lies on top of pretense, my dear.<eos> You haven't quit because you enjoy the power.<eos> There's no shame in that.<eos> Do I look ashamed?<eos> No, you do not.
You had a plan.<eos> The boat...<eos> I wish you would have come with me.<eos> I know you went to Ressler and offered to help.<eos> Yeah, I did.

Great.<eos> O-okay, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye.<eos> She said yes.<eos> Of course she did.
I'm asking what you believe.<eos> Elizabeth Keen is not a terrorist.<eos> So you believe she's innocent?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
He initiated it.<eos> We meet him later today.<eos> In the meantime, Aram gave me a name, a gunsmith who makes Wendigo's weapons.<eos> The feds don't know how to find him.<eos> But I do.
The masses do.<eos> No Capitol Hill, no committees, no debates.<eos> I've created the purest form of democracy. By dispersing power directly into the hands of the people, no single person possesses the ability to tip the scales.<eos> I don't choose targets.<eos> The people do.
Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.<eos> My mom was innocent.<eos> I lost my mom when I was a little girl.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> You don't.

Classical. Okay.<eos> It was like... he did it to set a mood.<eos> He was into it.<eos> I've read about these women, and I know I'm supposed to feel lucky that I survived.<eos> But I don't.

I was ready to tell you Don Carlos is gone, that I will never marry.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted, too.<eos> What did Amy do to change your mind?<eos> - She knows about us.<eos> - Of course she does.

Fowler's wife, Taylor, was a murder-for-hire.<eos> I figured he took off, given the suspicion that he was somehow involved. But my APB got no hits.<eos> I'd like to take a look at anything you have on him.<eos> - If you don't mind.<eos> - He doesn't.

Honey, is it raining there too?<eos> It rained on the day you proposed to me.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Of course I do.
I never aspired to play Wembley until last year.<eos> And it was my birthday wish when I cut my cake.<eos> Can I tell you a little secret?<eos> Every wish I've made in the last five years has come true.<eos> Not to do three, just to do one.
"I love you," shit like that.<eos> Come on, when your wife is a romantic mood, do you ever think about taking one of those little pills?<eos> Cyanide?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I do actually.
I've done that joke, and they don't get it.<eos> They sit there and look at each other and go,<eos> "Oh, yeah, you can't do the same voice Peanut can.<eos> Can't do it, so..."<eos> How you doing, Little Jeff?
We brought you some clean clothes to change into.<eos> And then we'll take you to your son.<eos> What'd you do, Vic?<eos> I'd like to tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
Because my partner and I got bullet holes in us that tell a different story.<eos> Okay, settle down.<eos> I thought you and I had something<eos> - in the bank here, Leanne. - We do.<eos> We do. Dr. Rorish.
You afraid of what he might say?<eos> Look, whatever you're thinking, whatever they're thinking out there, that's not it.<eos> I took money from a guy that you don't take money from.<eos> He said he would come for me.<eos> And he did.
You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
Come round. Just come back to mine.<eos> My parents are gone all night.<eos> My mum would murder me.<eos> What, you... You don't want to?<eos> No, I do.
Shahir hasn't given me an update yet.<eos> How are you?<eos> I cleared her for work, and I shouldn't have.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I saved the life of the guy who did this to her.<eos> It doesn't.
Good bye.<eos> Captain, will they relieve us tomorrow?<eos> If they don't, they'll take us out by helicopter.<eos> But our helicopters don't fly at night.<eos> American ones do.
Carmen, we need your help.<eos> I have enough problems.<eos> The Street Kings are looking for a snitch in their crew now.<eos> Paul knows someone planted that phone in his car.<eos> Someone did.
She held me down and even choked me at one point.<eos> He asked for that.<eos> So Ms. Randolph put her own sexual desires before your safety...<eos> - Objection, counsel is testifying.<eos> - Just like she did
Meaning yours.<eos> Yours, too.<eos> That little Cuba stunt notwithstanding.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Sure you do.
Copies of my official schedule from last week, when we were meeting about the whole...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Not here.<eos> I thought Russell Jackson had her under control.<eos> He does.
I forget, is it the small hairy men or the tall not hairy men?<eos> Small hairy, but these are actual otters. Look.<eos> See, this mama otter just gave birth to twins.<eos> Now, the little one, he's struggling, but do you see the mama doting on him?<eos> No, you do not.
But it could be interpreted that way.<eos> What are you thinking? Enemies of Peter?<eos> Or you.<eos> It's a primary. - Anything could happen.<eos> - So what do I do?
H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
I mean, really?<eos> You ever hear of privacy?<eos> Hey, you want privacy, close your door.<eos> Thought we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did, Dean.
Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay. Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
Great.<eos> Uh, maybe Maddie can sleep there.<eos> That should help.<eos> It's on her face.<eos> And a hot shower does wonders.
Ever think...<eos> That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.<eos> None of us do.
Then would you be willing to abdicate as king?<eos> I would lay down my life.<eos> How'd you get this?<eos> I apologize for the Queen.<eos> She did it for me.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> She does.
- I'm gonna let you in on a secret.<eos> See, when Webber had this job, it was easier for him.<eos> And Hunt had it easier than I do.<eos> You know why?<eos> - I don't.
You married one.<eos> Very different situation.<eos> They won't receive her.<eos> It's never going to happen.<eos> It just did.
Mellie... that's what she said.<eos> I hate that you're always right.<eos> Me too.<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
You think Libertad will?<eos> Probably.<eos> But I bet Giuseppe Montolo's hit men have already moved.<eos> You're here because you think we have undercover access to a Hornet router.<eos> Do you?
He was coming to meet me.<eos> John?<eos> He...didn't kill me.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Yes, he did.
You can stand up to them and have faith in that... have faith in yourself.<eos> I have to believe that.<eos> They say he doesn't give you more than you can handle.<eos> You say that, actually.<eos> Yes, I do.
She lived with that pain and embarrassment for years... alone.<eos> She protected me, and I'm ashamed of that.<eos> It was a mess. I made a mess.<eos> And for as much pain as I caused and felt, I would have never believed that anything good would have come of it.<eos> But it did.
They tracked us through the woods?<eos> No.<eos> They're tracking him. How?<eos> I thought you frisked him. Stand up.<eos> I did. But not for a tracker.
Go! Go! Go!<eos> I'm going to be a goalkeeper.<eos> OK, Dad?<eos> - No, I don't want that.<eos> - But I do.
What?<eos> Don't make me say it twice.<eos> Why do such a thing?<eos> We picked up his trail.<eos> Why do that?
Which damns our clients even more.<eos> So comb through this discovery.<eos> Find proof that she lied about what she saw.<eos> How do you know she lied?<eos> I don't.
And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
- How can I help you, Mr. Miles?<eos> - Your friend forgot this.<eos> It had fallen behind the dresser.<eos> Not sure if it means anything to you.<eos> It does.
I was hoping to determine its range from these diagrams.<eos> Oh, if we know exact mass, we can solve for distance - using my father's equation.<eos> - Well, the plan calls for 200 pounds of TNT.<eos> I don't know the tare weight of the rocket.<eos> I do.
You handled Danny's introduction to the world with real class.<eos> I couldn't have done it better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are you gonna do about that reporter?<eos> she will.
Steve?<eos> I believe he hung up.<eos> That's terrible, because if he's not gonna come to us, now we gotta go to him which means you need to tell us where he is.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
You couldn't have stopped Ben from taking that deal?<eos> It was his decision.<eos> And it's not my case anymore... because I got promoted this morning.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> We will.
What did you get suspended for?<eos> Just put him on the phone.<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tommy, no, you won't.
I don't know.<eos> Is there something I can do?<eos> If there is, then please tell me.<eos> Do you want to turn around and go home?<eos> 'Cause we will.
He said that be aware that if we're talking to my mom about my dad, that she's gonna get a funny look on her face.<eos> So I take it that Ziggy's father isn't exactly a good guy.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.<eos> Yeah, no, he never will.
Are you sure?<eos> I want to see you again.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, w-we can wait and do it then.<eos> We will.
'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.<eos> Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.<eos> Mom, it's high school.<eos> Of course they will.
First time in two hours this baby's stopped crying.<eos> - I'm afraid to put him down.<eos> - I'll take him.<eos> - If he gets upset again...<eos> - He won't.
I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave, that you searched and found me, that you, seeing these numbers, you seemed so...<eos> We will set things right.<eos> But things are gonna get very hard before that time.<eos> We have to hold on.<eos> I will.
I made a promise, Rick.<eos> ♪♪ Do you ever think about who you've killed?<eos> ♪♪ Yeah.<eos> ♪♪ Rick: Are you ready if this goes south?<eos> It won't.
I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how I could, with what happened, with our friends still out there, still being hurt by them.<eos> I don't know how I could've said that.<eos> And now... I am trapped.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I will.
His fight fell apart.<eos> Shit. That sucks.<eos> Hey. Can I hold her?<eos> We can't fall asleep with her.<eos> I won't.
Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.
No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> The fuck I won't, John!
It's a... it's a happy ending.<eos> I'm just wondering how the hell you pulled it off.<eos> It's better you don't know. Trust me.<eos> As long as this doesn't come back and bite us in the ass.<eos> - It won't.
I was alerted the minute he boarded the plane in Tehran.<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about it?<eos> He and Saul cannot meet.<eos> Otherwise, everything unravels.<eos> They won't.
Horrifying, isn't it?<eos> But based on the images we have seen so far, we can speculate that the number of fatalities could easily be within the 100 range... Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.
It's just, you're never there.<eos> Well, my business is in Seattle.<eos> It wasn't my idea to move, but we're getting it figured out.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
This is a really big deal, Lily.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Will next Sunday work?<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
Sorry to me?<eos> For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.
I understand.<eos> I hope you do too.<eos> It's gonna take 48 hours for us to get our new passports.<eos> I'll be at the Platte City Motel out by the airport... if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You're kidding, right?<eos> You realize how far behind I am? Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up.<eos> Whaddya talking about?<eos> I'll do the wills. - No, you won't.<eos> - 'Course I will.
- I'll go to his apartment.<eos> - Got it. - Frank.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do not hurt him.<eos> - I won't.
- It's cheese on cheese.<eos> See?<eos> You know, sometimes, you got to play to your strengths.<eos> You should stitch that on a pillow.<eos> Oh, I will.
Well... we can manage it... together.<eos> You really should go.<eos> Wait. OK.<eos> What... what do you want from me?<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll...
Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him.<eos> He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
To me?<eos> To Jesus?<eos> - No one knows it was me.<eos> - I do!<eos> And Jesus will.
Ollie, in the short amount of time you've been doing this, you've done a remarkable job.<eos> Please just let me do what I have to do to help you keep doing that.<eos> Felicity told me about this Kullens thing because of something that John said to her.<eos> Thea, when you fight fire with fire, you are probably gonna get burned.<eos> I won't.
Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He will.
He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!
So I could finish this.<eos> Jay, hero among heroes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can't just leave him in there.<eos> We won't.
What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.
Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
An hour till dark?<eos> Which puts us at six hours till midnight?<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> Dean, we gotta talk about this.<eos> Okay, we will.
And I don't know why it's you.<eos> But I know that we are destined for something here.<eos> Something great.<eos> Well, I wish I had your faith.<eos> You will.
Not a very good liar, but thanks.<eos> It's all about the light.<eos> The right light will hide a multitude of sins.<eos> Leave my card here on the table. If he shows.<eos> He won't.
I've been told I'm obnoxious.<eos> But today, I felt...<eos> I felt electric.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't.
For starters, that's when she began her campaign to marginalize me... push me out of my own company, convince the board that I was unstable and had to be sidelined.<eos> And when that didn't work, she tried to have me killed... all to keep me from learning the truth about Whitehall.<eos> And you think she's gonna tell me?<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> She will.
- Finally.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is my daughter is hiding a gun in her bedroom, and that's just for starters.<eos> - I can explain...<eos> - Oh, you will.
Just keep dancing.<eos> And smiling.<eos> Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.<eos> As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.<eos> Yes, she will...
- Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us. Nothing.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> And nothing ever will.
Yeah. You're always gonna save yourself.<eos> Okay, Jason, this is highly inappropriate behavior right now.<eos> I'm just trying to help Mr. Smerconish here.<eos> I mean, if he really wants to save himself, he won't turn these quarters over to the police.<eos> Of course he will.
- What?<eos> - They're gonna come for you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They won't blame me for your bad choices.<eos> Of course they will.
Yeah.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if you got that from Audrey, um, and I... you know, I went along with it because, uh... well, because the real story sucks.<eos> Maybe Audrey was trying to keep it from you, but...<eos> I won't.
One of the perks of physical therapy.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
Oh, look at that beautiful leg.<eos> Looks like craters on the moon under that bandage.<eos> Well, better than steel rods sticking out.<eos> I still can't move my left leg.<eos> God, you will. Jeez.
Oh, this has got to be about eight years ago.<eos> - Huh. - MADDIE: There is no situation.<eos> You don't know the first thing about Clay or what he's really like.<eos> We'll talk about this later.<eos> No, we won't.
That's why it hurt so much when we opened that envelope.<eos> It still hurts, but I can take it.<eos> What I can't take is losing you.<eos> Now I won't promise not to mess up.<eos> Because I will.
How can I help?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> There's nothing for you to do.<eos> Go back to work. I'll keep you posted.<eos> Yeah, you will...
But they didn't charge him because he knew exactly what to say.<eos> Why'd they pick him up in the first place?<eos> Fishing expedition.<eos> They thought they had something. They didn't get what they needed.<eos> And they won't.
- Yeah. Feel that, though.<eos> - Ow. Man.<eos> - Ooh. My bad.<eos> Billy, don't leave me again.<eos> I won't.
Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.<eos> And it will.
We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions?" The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> He might.<eos> No, He won't.
Release her.<eos> Release her from her promise.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> I will.
Release her from her promise.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
- Nick, we got a body.<eos> Okay, I'll pick you up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Just make sure you talk to Eve.<eos> - Yes, I will.
I'm not sure, honey.<eos> We have to keep you safe.<eos> So he won't find me here?<eos> Hey... he's never gonna find you, okay?<eos> No, he won't.
It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> This will.
Nor do I.<eos> But you, your influence is great -- there's much good you could do.<eos> And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?<eos> Yes, but he too uses his power for his own ends and he would use me if I would let him.<eos> But I will not.
I will get you out of there.<eos> Don't believe him.<eos> He's a fucking liar.<eos> Okay, okay, uh, listen, make sure you tell Tasha...<eos> I will.
I can do it for you.<eos> I can take him off the ventilator myself.<eos> No...<eos> He's my patient.<eos> I will.
- They're liars.<eos> - What?<eos> Sign? Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
- and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats!<eos> You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
You pay Lidstrom to stay quiet about it.<eos> So why are you telling me?<eos> Why not just file your report?<eos> Because I want to understand.<eos> You won't.
It means God and Nature are one and the same.<eos> I am a certified teacher now, if you need a Latin tutor.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Albert may take you up on that.<eos> I will?
You called this meeting.<eos> You want something. My colleagues in berlin want to interrogate rigaud.<eos> Themselves. This is in neither of our interests.<eos> I will allow him to escape.<eos> Good. In exchange, I will no longer.
Her mother hasn't heard from her in three days.<eos> Dmitri says she'll be fired if she doesn't come to work tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> -What if she tells them about us?<eos> -She won't.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
You want me to feel sorry for him?<eos> Gabe still has two loving parents.<eos> Well, my love doesn't help my son with this seizures and his pain.<eos> Taking Jaquan's life is not gonna help him, either.<eos> Well, the money will.
I know what you've gone through.<eos> Don't.<eos> I know how much they've hurt you.<eos> And you know what they'll do to me if I break my contract.<eos> They won't.
I mean, how does that even make sense?<eos> Just 'cause you can't come doesn't mean you can't be there.<eos> You can listen in and watch.<eos> All right, but if anything goes wrong...<eos> Nothing will. Okay?
I think the GS F has them licked.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Now...<eos> Now, I should point out, there is a new BMW M5 coming later this year, but it'll have to go some to be better than that GS F.<eos> - It really will.
- Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.
All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend. [grunts]<eos> I can tell that you're telling the truth.<eos> Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out.<eos> We'll do anything.<eos> Well, she will.
Walker's a tribal lawyer.<eos> Sued us since forever.<eos> I handled it last couple years.<eos> And we beat him every time. And what if he comes back to the door now?<eos> He won't.
They went in which direction?<eos> Mercia, Lord.<eos> I think it is something more than nothing, Odda, and I am wholly tired of never-ending disobedience.<eos> But it will not ruin your appetite, Lord.<eos> It will not.
When was the last time we went out?<eos> No. Well, I know it's not the same but<eos> And Christos won't even come.<eos> He doesn't like you.<eos> Oh, he will, eventually.
I'm supposed to be growing crystals on this string.<eos> And I have to put sugar in there a couple of times a day.<eos> Hm, 'cause your life wasn't busy enough. Well, maybe they'll just appear, and I'll be done with it.<eos> So, have you given any more thought to what you want to do - for your birthday?<eos> - No. But I will.
I can't wait to see what they wished for! Yeah.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - No, no, I want to read it.<eos> - And you will.
And we've had lots of bites on the west coast, but no lead investor yet.<eos> Yeah, it's a risk-averse world out there, isn't it?<eos> But you know what?<eos> I can get you funded with just one phone call.<eos> But I won't.
We need to wash our hands of this right now, before it gets back to us.<eos> Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains, which is why we keep moving forward.<eos> It's just a setback.<eos> - And what if they catch Lozano?<eos> - They won't.
What about her?<eos> She's watching my every move.<eos> She questioned me when I forced the SEC to keep the markets open.<eos> - If she figures out why...<eos> - She won't.
I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me... If they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
The Kings will test it. They're gonna know if it's fake.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Nas, we can't use real explosives as bait.<eos> - Something could go wrong.<eos> - It won't.
I always wanted to be like Mo.<eos> Even if just for a minute.<eos> Driving around in a cool car, drinking my favorite drink, listening to my favorite record.<eos> Something I always wanted to do before I die.<eos> Then you will.
Will you relax?<eos> They're not gonna know it's us.<eos> That's why they wore these things.<eos> What if they recognize our shoes?<eos> They won't.
It's over for you.<eos> All of you, with your birthrights and your titles and your esteemed sense of privilege.<eos> You had a king who let you be corrupt and you destroyed that.<eos> You think Robert's gonna let you be that way?<eos> He won't.
- Yes.<eos> Being a reverend led me here.<eos> This is my home, my purpose.<eos> And I don't want to lose it.<eos> You won't.
Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?<eos> You know this is dumb, right?<eos> We'll all be dead before anything grows.<eos> The earth survived praimfaya once.<eos> It will again.
- Monty, I...<eos> - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
There's a bunker on that island.<eos> You're our ride. That's it.<eos> That bunker's not stocked, Murphy.<eos> You won't last 5 months, let alone 5 years.<eos> No. We probably won't.
You can't operate without my authority, ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest, and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
She was happy.<eos> She was always smiling and joking and laughing.<eos> I don't know what to say. I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what... I don't know what to say<eos> You will.
Miss, please, help me.<eos> Just try to stay still.<eos> Let me see what we're dealing with.<eos> I don't want to die alone.<eos> You won't.
- Yay!<eos> Then the human race finds a whole new mistake...<eos> But that's another story.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> But you will.
Is that something that you'd actually want to help with?<eos> You're acting like you think I'd disapprove of it.<eos> Your husband is about to welcome another husband into his bed.<eos> You're a king.<eos> Of course you will.
I do.<eos> And I know you're a good person.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> You will help me.<eos> Not under duress I won't.
We draw up a roster.<eos> Beth will still do her two nights, I'll do my one.<eos> That leaves four nights between the seven of you.<eos> - Phil won't do one.<eos> - He will.
I never said I was.<eos> You're not getting any information on a child in the system, even if she was your sister.<eos> You killed him!<eos> - What if they come looking for us?<eos> - They won't.
It's not you got us meetings with record execs.<eos> Damn, Alexandra.<eos> - Cold-blooded.<eos> - Please let the man talk.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Say it!<eos> - Just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
You don't like me, and the only reason you haven't called the cops yet is because you know exactly what I'll them that your son did to me.<eos> Perfect, let's just act like we normally do.<eos> Whatever issue that you have with my son can be handled, I'm sure, very quietly.<eos> We're not gonna have any problems as long as your son learns to keep his hands off of me.<eos> And he will.
And what if you don't come back?<eos> Then you need to take care of your sister and brother.<eos> Go to Aunt Maddie, ask for her help.<eos> She won't listen to me.<eos> She will.
I forced the team to review Landon's conviction.<eos> Sam's a liability to the CIU.<eos> This is not up for debate.<eos> Once Gerald's case is over, fire him.<eos> Or I will.
No!<eos> We're not going through my bar.<eos> Okay?<eos> don't get hot and do anything stupid with that thing.<eos> I won't if they won't.
Either way, we could be looking at a spree in the making.<eos> Wheels up in 20.<eos> Guys, hold on.<eos> I know it's gonna be hard not to think about Reid in prison, but we'll get through this.<eos> And more importantly, Reid will, too.
I promised to try.<eos> A king is not a pope, Claude.<eos> We can't go on like this, Charles.<eos> You said weeks ago that this annulment would happen.<eos> And it will.
You're a free agent now.<eos> Oh, and, um... I have all the help that I need.<eos> It's not you.<eos> What happens when he changes his mind?<eos> He won't!
Take some time off.<eos> Get some help.<eos> I don't need help, Tasha.<eos> I mean this in the most loving way possible, either you tell Weller you need some time off, or I will do it for you.<eos> No, you won't.
Grandmother, let's go.<eos> Adam is dead.<eos> Shut up, Jonah, just shut up!<eos> Mr. Foster, it may be best if you leave.<eos> I will not.
Don't play that. Hey, where you goin'?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down!<eos> No, they won't.
Barbers took care of everything above the shoulders.<eos> You didn't know that, Doctor?<eos> I don't know where all this animosity's coming from, but it doesn't change the fact that tooth needs to come out.<eos> Do it yourself for all I care.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I will.
Thanks.<eos> When I was dancing with that girl... with Kathy...<eos> I was thinking,<eos> "I'm gonna remember this night."<eos> Now everyone will.
Talk to Zhrov.<eos> See who paid him.<eos> We tried. He won't talk.<eos> Work him. Try again.<eos> Okay, I will.
You wait there, okay?<eos> I'll come by as soon as I can.<eos> Just hurry.<eos> And tell my mom I love her.<eos> I will.
Now, come on.<eos> You need to get to safety.<eos> You need to share these stories.<eos> But who will believe them?<eos> Someday... someone will.
You're much more useful to me out here.<eos> What's that mean... "useful"?<eos> Turns out, getting a Savior to give up her belief is much harder than I thought.<eos> Even if you take everything away from her, which I have, there's still that one last pesky speck of belief that just refuses to die out.<eos> And it never will.
- "We"?<eos> - Yes, we, Dad.<eos> We are cohabitating, and we do have rats.<eos> - We'll talk about this later.<eos> - Yes, we will.
And he called you fat.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna squish him!<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't take any crap from anyone.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Why don't we listen to her story?<eos> Didn't you see?<eos> He's a major asshole.<eos> Fine, don't do it then.<eos> Of course I won't.
Okay, I guess I'll go get the car.<eos> - You don't like Mars bars? - Nah.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Look, I know you said this will all blow over, but I'm telling you, I know Kirsten.<eos> It won't.
- Well, have you ever been out there?<eos> - No, so? Worth checkin' out, right?<eos> Yeah, all right, I'll get Smiles to let us in.<eos> Okay, cool. What if she asks questions?<eos> She won't.
I run a clean game here.<eos> Well, I know from personal experience that people like you vet your customers thoroughly, so I refuse to believe that you were unaware that your game was being frequented by a magician whose specialty was card manipulation.<eos> Claude paid me to look the other way when he played.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of the names of all of your regular players.<eos> No, you won't.
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.<eos> But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?<eos> Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?<eos> What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?<eos> - He won't.
- Coercion wasn't the major factor.<eos> - Really?<eos> No, it's more like he wants to prove something.<eos> Yes, well, as long as he doesn't say 'yes' as an intellectual exercise and then back off when things start to get dicey.<eos> He won't.
Yeah, well, that explains the night blindness and the tunnel vision. Follow my finger.<eos> Vitamin supplements and acetazolamide might help.<eos> But they won't stop it, and I can't afford them, anyway.<eos> - V.A. will pay for it.<eos> - No, they won't.
All right, all right, but you have to introduce us to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.<eos> Yes, he would love to meet you.<eos> Then I will consider, maybe, taking the book down until you get your stupid tenure at your stupider college.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yes, I will. Yes, of course!
Look at these comments.<eos> We have to bring a ghost back to this lab and document it, you guys.<eos> I mean, this stuff is real.<eos> We have to be able to prove it.<eos> We will.
It was strange. Yeah.<eos> Something definitely not quite... hmm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can get in a lot of trouble if you tell anybody what I'm about to say to you, okay?<eos> I won't.
You don't get credit for cleaning up you own mess.<eos> And you destroyed one of our Tugs.<eos> Uh, actually, sir. If anybody's to blame I...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus. It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
- I can be that for you, I know I can.<eos> - 170 cherry Lane.<eos> The gate will be open.<eos> Make sure they never do it again.<eos> - I will.
You roofied me.<eos> Wait, but why? I never would have tried anything.<eos> I know that... now.<eos> - You have to quit.<eos> - I will.
Read all about it!<eos> I'd like to see the view from up in those clouds.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> You will soon enough.<eos> We all will.
And neither can you be.<eos> They need to see the fraud you are, with their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> And tonight they will.
I'm sure this gentleman didn't take anything that doesn't belong to him because he knows exactly what that would mean.<eos> And so he will do what he does best when he leaves this place.<eos> He will return to his comfortable little apartment. And he will observe what is going on here.<eos> Yes, of course, Inspector.<eos> I will.
Stoudemire has got to stay on the bench.<eos> He can't sit on the bench, man.<eos> You can't build a team around both of them. You gotta just build a team around Melo.<eos> - He's not the same... - No one else is gonna put up those points.<eos> Yeah, but Melo will.
It's always fun to get something from the airport.<eos> Feels like you've traveled, too.<eos> Ma, he's turning one.<eos> Don't think he'll be discerning what gift came from where.<eos> But I will.
What in God's name is wrong with you?<eos> At least Muriel only wants to convert them!<eos> I've said yes.<eos> - She might change her mind, George.<eos> - She won't!
You and me.<eos> - C'mon, love birds!<eos> Let's get a wiggle on! We cross, then we rest easy!<eos> I'll never be able to show you how grateful I am.<eos> You will.
So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
-She called the landline three times.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's getting crazy.<eos> - I will.
You're the mother.<eos> She's just a little girl.<eos> Maybe not so little anymore.<eos> - Tell them, Lou.<eos> - I will. I will.
My mom will just give me a new one.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - I cleaned it, it's fine.<eos> - Why don't you sleep in it?<eos> - Maybe I will.
That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
I've been fucking living with you in your house... For 10 months... And it's been good...<eos> Or "maybe he's getting more accepting"...<eos> But then it's like, you won't even come up to my apartment... Whenever we're in New York?<eos> It's like this one little thing and you won't do it!<eos> You won't!
No.<eos> Never. You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!<eos> Give up our hostage?<eos> Not likely.<eos> We'll rather...
Claire's right.<eos> The soldiers will not hurt her. They'll escort her to a place of safety, then let her go.<eos> I will not give you up!<eos> Bring out the woman, or we shall set fire to the thatch and burn you out!<eos> Yes, you will, you stubborn Scot.
The soldiers will not hurt her. They'll escort her to a place of safety, then let her go.<eos> I will not give you up!<eos> Bring out the woman, or we shall set fire to the thatch and burn you out!<eos> Yes, you will, you stubborn Scot.<eos> I will not.
Say the words... meaning them, in yer head and in yer heart, and the guardianship is yers.<eos> My poor brother.<eos> I have lived my life crippled in body, and he has lived his crippled in mind.<eos> In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto her as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
I will.<eos> Miryam, will you take this man to be your husband, to live together forever in the covenant of marriage?<eos> Will you love him, comfort him, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto him as long as you both shall live?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will.
- _<eos> - Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> If you see Ren, tell him that I loved him too.<eos> I will.
You're gonna get her killed.<eos> Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday.<eos> Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there.<eos> What if Erica Kravid sees it too?<eos> She probably will.
He's running drugs.<eos> Now, the Assistant Commissioner's gonna be there tonight.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him privately, after the event.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
- All right, Arthur, come on.<eos> - Wait for me! Wait for me good self!<eos> Go on, take the photograph!<eos> - Get the bastards in the house. - I will.<eos> I will. John!
What if I don't want to live together?<eos> And don't tell me about the kill order.<eos> We can go far away.<eos> Luna's clan will take us in.<eos> No. They won't.
Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
In the same way I can choose to let you go with my blessing and tell you to bring that little girl home safe, or I can tell you right now,<eos> I can stick you on an airplane and fly you somewhere very far away.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Don't be such a donker.<eos> But I won't.
So... you're really doing this?<eos> Not my call.<eos> Prepare the patients for transport to the upstate facility.<eos> If even one of your patients were to escape...<eos> They won't.
Sweet.<eos> - Hilarious. - Neal, after you.<eos> Got some loose lips on you, huh?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - No. I will not.
Let's chop and throw her.<eos> No.<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> Assure them you won't do it again.<eos> She won't.
The outcome is in yer hands, laddie.<eos> A good soldier must learn to obey his commanding officer...<eos> As well as his general.<eos> Take care of each other... and watch out for my grandsire.<eos> I will.
Oh, it's too late.<eos> And I don't want to spend my last days wasting away in a hospital with a catheter up my dick and poison in my body, so...<eos> But who will take care of us?<eos> You can't leave us alone.<eos> I won't.
Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.<eos> The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.<eos> - You know where they're sending me?<eos> - Nope. And I never will.<eos> Nobody will.
Fine. Don't be my partner.<eos> I'm sure I can find someone who'll ride with me.<eos> Really?<eos> Show of hands... who wants to ride shotgun with Biggs?<eos> I will.
- Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
Look, no way Joey Marks is gonna let those guys skate after screwing this up.<eos> They will get what is coming to them.<eos> Do you really want the full report? No, I do not.<eos> I just hope this doesn't come back to bite us all in the ass.<eos> It won't.
_<eos> You wait outside 'til lawyer gets here.<eos> Hey, you know our system, you know it can take forever to resolve legal problems.<eos> Oh, I have no legal problems.<eos> - You will.
Dad?<eos> Carl. No.<eos> Sooner or later, we're fighting our way out.<eos> I know that you're fully aware that we will.<eos> Yeah... we will.
I can't.<eos> We need our strength to get out of here.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why is he feeding us, if he's just gonna kill us?<eos> Maybe he won't.
No, no, no.<eos> No. We don't need to do this.<eos> - No?<eos> If they come through that door...<eos> - They won't.
But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after.<eos> But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and, uh... [inhales deeply] everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
I'd love to, but it's not quite ready yet.<eos> Well, you tell Jackie to come and see me tonight.<eos> He's just trying to impress you with a great song.<eos> Tell him to bring whatever he's got.<eos> I will.
And sign here.<eos> Initial here.<eos> Initial here, here, and...<eos> I love you, my little lady.<eos> And we always will.
Instead, he woke up in a hospital with two broken arms and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.<eos> Jesus, Matt.<eos> If I take a night off, people get hurt.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> - You won't.
Dr. hale has a way of bringing out the best in me.<eos> He's prepared to submit this to the surgeon general.<eos> My contract's finished next week, sir.<eos> If you'll allow me to complete my term...<eos> I will not.
- Mm-mm. In that case, you're very welcome.<eos> Did you see us kissing again?<eos> I sure did.<eos> You're not gonna tell Ramona, right?<eos> I sure won't.
But we put these borders here.<eos> Flores, tell them... Tell my kids to...<eos> Just make sure they don't forget to listen.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir, I will.
Those goddamn fucking apes.<eos> Those fucking piles of mud.<eos> I'd like to send those sons of bitches back to that primordial ooze that they came from.<eos> And I would if I thought it would bring her back.<eos> But it won't, so...
- Listen. You find that son of a bitch who did that.<eos> And I don't care what Power it came from.<eos> You let me know who it was, and I'll find 'em.<eos> I'll crush their skull like a grape.<eos> I will. I will, Patrick.
It appears you need a new driver.<eos> Look at the three of you.<eos> Larry, Curly, could you give me a moment? I need to have a word with Moe.<eos> Jack, I have neither the time nor the patience right now.<eos> You will.
I...<eos> I heard every word he said, Gunnar, and it's not the last time I'm gonna hear them, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend every night post-show filing hate-crime reports when it's not gonna make a difference!<eos> You were attacked, and you cannot let him get away with that!<eos> Trust me.<eos> I won't.
Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
There it goes.<eos> This is my favorite place to work.<eos> I should text Cash.<eos> She would love to see it here, too.<eos> She will, all right?
I'm getting a promotion.<eos> So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.<eos> Somewhere near the beach or something.<eos> You won't come back.<eos> Of course I will.
Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
It's just unusual for pain to subside this quickly.<eos> Uh, so am I all clear?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Let Sinclair know that I said it was ok for you to go back to work, But you're benched again if I find anything abnormal in those tests.<eos> You won't.
I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, maybe it's you young guys, eating your salads<eos> - and remaking the world.<eos> No, I know how to win.<eos> But, uh... if that's not what it is anymore, then, uh... you do it your way, Bryan.<eos> Okay, I will.
Ah. Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.
The mayor was her uncle.<eos> Seems I was right about the limited gene pool.<eos> I am sorry that I rode you so hard back then.<eos> I hope we can put our differences behind us.<eos> I will if you will.
She was there an' all.<eos> I left around eleven.<eos> Went home. Early start.<eos> OK. Now, if Lee Stonnall shows his face again...<eos> He won't.
- What?<eos> - You're just going to sit there? Oh, no.<eos> Uh, no, you know I never listen.<eos> Yeah. Why don't you just make yourself busy?<eos> I will.
That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.
One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
- It's in your best interest...<eos> - ...to stay away.<eos> We don't want to hurt you ...<eos> any of you.<eos> But we will.
You gotta get your heart to catch up to your head.<eos> I feel like it's more than guilt though, you know, I feel like...<eos> I feel like I lost something.<eos> You know, I feel like I can't get it back.<eos> You won't.
This is what the Dread Doctors used to keep track of the Chimeras.<eos> It seeks out and hones in on a certain frequency.<eos> They gave the Chimeras their own unique vibration.<eos> So how is that going to help me find Deaton?<eos> It won't.
- You have to tell him.<eos> - How?<eos> Liam, he spent the last week pounding out chapters.<eos> But if he ships them to Boston before you speak to him......<eos> He won't.
You're the man I divorced.<eos> Lyla, look.<eos> I just wanted to help him, to bring my brother back.<eos> Then bring him to justice, but do it the right way.<eos> I will.
Lyla, look.<eos> I just wanted to help him, to bring my brother back.<eos> Then bring him to justice, but do it the right way.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
"Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!<eos> No, you won't.
I had no choice, it was that or let him die.<eos> A skinshifter saved his life.<eos> He must have choked on that.<eos> I won't let him harm you.<eos> I won't.
At first.<eos> Well, good luck to you.<eos> Slean.<eos> Slean, I swore to you I would do whatever I had to to see you were Thane.<eos> And I will.
He doesn't want us near his big score.<eos> This isn't his score, it's Sybil's.<eos> And the minute that it's done, she's going to kill him.<eos> - You believe him?<eos> - No, she won't.
But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
Oh, don't worry, Madame Prime Minister. I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
Otherwise this is...<eos> this is all for nothing.<eos> I will, Abe, I will.<eos> - But if your father sees this...<eos> - He won't.
During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it.<eos> Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
Don't do this.<eos> Your death...<eos> I couldn't survive that.<eos> Jocelyn, you have to go.<eos> I won't.
It's built on blood.<eos> Every empire is.<eos> I'm sorry about Violet.<eos> I hope she comes home.<eos> She won't.
It's either that or you'll be wearing orange for the rest of your days.<eos> Orange, Mother.<eos> With no accessories.<eos> You have had 30 years to make that call and we both know that you're not going to do it.<eos> But I will.
But we will return you.<eos> When we left 2016, I just assumed I would return to the exact moment I left, that Clarissa wouldn't even know I was gone.<eos> So I didn't say good-bye.<eos> And now I fear I will never have that chance.<eos> You will.
- We're hiding.<eos> Like we always have.<eos> You're the one putting us at risk. Being around humans.<eos> One slip, and you'll give us away. Someone'll see through the dumb synth act.<eos> No, they won't.
And you have to tell everyone how they're selling kids into these privatized foster homes.<eos> Yeah, I know about these places.<eos> My friend Kiara was in one of them.<eos> Then why aren't you saying anything about it?<eos> I... I will.
- I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.
Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.<eos> I will.
He still needs me. Of that, I am certain.<eos> Otherwise, I would already be dead.<eos> You can find him?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> I will.
This my personal number.<eos> Call me as soon as you know something.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> I can't believe Mr. Desai thought he could get away with this.<eos> He won't.
I know I have no warrant, but I need you to find this boy's phone.<eos> Because I am in the middle of a multiple homicide, and I am asking you to do it as a favor for me.<eos> There's a video message from Gracie.<eos> Just press the play button.<eos> Yes, I will.
I knew, he was mine.<eos> Then, that day in the park happened... Ah, just go!<eos> What are we gonna do? - Suppose Jesse tells.<eos> - He won't. I'll make sure of it.<eos> And neither will we.
- If... you convince Charles to allow me to choose my own husband.<eos> Since when did you want to get married?<eos> I am only saying, if I were to get married, I want to choose the man.<eos> Will you speak to the king?<eos> I will.
You know, this time, but the fact is, she is hurt right now because of me.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris just from some meta-human tonight.<eos> When Zoom attacks again, I need all of my speed and then some.<eos> I can't lose anyone else.<eos> You won't.
Get out!<eos> Kizzy, I swear!<eos> ♪ When I rise ♪ Kizzy, it's been a while now.<eos> And I ain't told nobody, just like I said.<eos> And I won't.
Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay,<eos> - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
But I'm supposed to meet Lommers soon.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> We owe them.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> We will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was awful.<eos> And I tried to be strong, but I-I kind of fell apart.<eos> I won't do that.<eos> You won't?
- Thank you. Thank you, Neil.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> You're such a good friend.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
You said always blackmail for something good, so I made a deal.<eos> I seduce Mrs. Powell's husband and she introduces me to a music producer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mrs. Powell knows a music producer?<eos> Yep, and now I will, too.
In a way.<eos> Adrian was my first and only love.<eos> And the night of the explosion, when I thought he'd died, I was devastated.<eos> If you repeat this, I will throttle you.<eos> I won't.
And he wasn't supposed to tell anyone.<eos> You made an innocent child pawn his dead mother's lace.<eos> That was meant for the sister that he's lost.<eos> I'll make it up to you.<eos> I will.
Go on with your lives without the plan, without me.<eos> They're going after Red Tyson.<eos> Okay, they already started looking for him.<eos> What if they stir up something about what we did to him?<eos> They won't, they won't.
I love him, Mum.<eos> Oh, Gerry, take it outside.<eos> Gerry, take him outside, now!<eos> - He'll escape.<eos> - Not for a while, he won't.
By being one less mouth to feed.<eos> Is that the best you can come up with?<eos> I sent my short story to England.<eos> - That will bring us a tidy sum. - No.<eos> No, it won't.
He doesn't own me or Christophe.<eos> We are not things to be owned and used and thrown away.<eos> I was born free, I will stay free... so will Christophe!<eos> You tell him that.<eos> Okay. I will.
You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> 'Cause I'm the one she'd ask to do it.<eos> Tell me you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> I won't.
And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
Susannah, it was a family emergency.<eos> My brother was in bad shape. I had to be here.<eos> Yes, and I'm sorry about that. But it isn't our problem.<eos> I promise it will never happen again.<eos> - No, it won't.
You think I won't tell everybody about him?<eos> I'm assuming you'd prefer to keep it a secret.<eos> No one's gonna believe you.<eos> Somebody will.<eos> Graydal will, maybe even DHS.
You'll need a partner.<eos> Nimah Amin.<eos> I trust her.<eos> You'll have 10 minutes with the asset, so ask the right questions.<eos> I will.
- She doesn't love me!<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> - No.<eos> No I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will.
I love you.<eos> You loved me.<eos> You lied.<eos> You can't do this to me.<eos> You won't.
How did you survive what he did to you?<eos> Jocelyn pulled me through.<eos> You were there.<eos> Did he hurt her?<eos> No, and he won't.
He doesn't know we came for him. We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> And, Emma, we will find him.<eos> Will we?
She's drafted an executive order mandating Keen's transport to the Federal Courthouse for a closed hearing - with Judge Trotter.<eos> - How much time do we have?<eos> Three hours, maybe less, Peter.<eos> If she tells her story in open court, then--<eos> She won't.
Go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.<eos> What if they figure out the code?<eos> - They won't.
Just check the tapes, man.<eos> It's all in the tapes.<eos> Check the tapes.<eos> Check the tapes. check the tapes.<eos> Yeah, all right, we will.
I can see him through Zolo's eyes.<eos> Burning, burning in the desert sun.<eos> We might smell his ashes in the wind.<eos> It's too bad you won't be seeing Amaru's true beauty.<eos> But I will... through your eyes.
To stop a plague like Santanico, you can't just destroy the source.<eos> You have to incinerate every single soul she's infected.<eos> Yo, man, how 'bout you suck my...<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
First, they destroy our leaders.<eos> Now they're going after our faith.<eos> (sobbing) He said La Diosa was a plague.<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
It's never gonna fucking work.<eos> So you're saying I can't pull it off?<eos> No, she took you back because she thought that you was clean.<eos> As soon as she finds out that you got back in the game, she gonna turn you in.<eos> No, she won't.
By the time it reaches him, we will all be dead.<eos> We need help now.<eos> Fear not.<eos> My stepdaughter will take care of all of you.<eos> I will?
But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yes, they will.
- No recap needed.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just try getting in touch,<eos> - see if she responds to you.<eos> - Uh, hello? Of course she will.
I merely mentioned breach of contract.<eos> What happened to his nose is just either bad luck or happy accident.<eos> Depending on your point of view.<eos> Okay, don't talk.<eos> Maybe Vernon Caldasso will.
Someday, you'll do the same thing, and if you ever cross that line, you better hope that you bust them before they actually push that button.<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> A-Are you saying that...<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> And no one ever will.
"Short attention span" Stan?<eos> That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations.<eos> Yeah. You will be fine.<eos> Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.<eos> - No, but I will.
Witch.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> John, John, John... didn't I blow you up with a motorbike?<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't take.<eos> This one will.
Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
Yes, but that's not the point.<eos> - Why didn't you go meet them?<eos> - 'Cause I'm in the zone.<eos> - They can come to me. - You have to tell them what you've been up to.<eos> I will.
I get it.<eos> Hell, I want you to. Please.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Keep walking. I can't go back.<eos> You will.
I just...<eos> I need you... I need you to tell her that I'm alive.<eos> And that I'm searching for her.<eos> And that I will find her.<eos> Ok? I will.
So who told you Malick's here?<eos> Not at liberty to discuss.<eos> So it's your friend Henry?<eos> One of these days I'm gonna have - to meet this guy, right?<eos> - One of these days you will.
It's time to walk the plank.<eos> I'll gladly walk it. Just spare Killian, please.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> He should've gone down along with the ship, like the rest of us.<eos> And now he finally will.
Don't. Please, please.<eos> Something's gone wrong, Dolores.<eos> How could I have done this?<eos> I can't.<eos> - I won't.
We see heartbreak every day.<eos> And we live our lives imperfectly as a result of that.<eos> You're a human being, Randy, and there is no shame in that.<eos> I should've told her.<eos> Next time you will.
I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Just lay low, avoid the cameras.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get word to Prince Asim.<eos> No, I will.
Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> -We have to find her.<eos> -And we will.
It's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> Well, what if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
Cuff him.<eos> Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.<eos> so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.<eos> This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.<eos> Of course it will.
I- - I apologize.<eos> No need to apologize. So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free. I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again. Mm.<eos> It won't. Okay.
We need to start fresh.<eos> I was hoping you could come up to the mountain, share a meal with me, talk about the future of Wayward Pines.<eos> You need to tell me what's happening here.<eos> Everything.<eos> I will.
Ooh, sounds like a country song.<eos> - Yeah. Pretty hopeless case. - Hmm.<eos> Well, the one thing he's got going for him.<eos> At least in prison, he'll get the treatment that he needs.<eos> Yeah, he will.
I have to hear from you if it was a confession of your feelings or not. So stop running away.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> So let go of me.<eos> - I really will.
Diane does?<eos> Well, she understands the situation.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not interested.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
That's four... times.<eos> Ha. Speak tomorrow.<eos> Maybe.<eos> No maybe.<eos> We will.
I got a serial number of a possible burner.<eos> I was trying to find the phone number attached to it.<eos> - A burner?<eos> - Yeah, and the phone call, text history... you know, whatever you can do.<eos> Okay, sure. I'll...
Ratovski's journey amongst?<eos> Ratovski?<eos> What of him?<eos> Show me. Show me!<eos> No, sir, I will not.
Right here. It'll be painful but I'll survive.<eos> They need to think that I put up a fight, and that's how you escaped.<eos> Do it and go.<eos> I could kill you.<eos> You won't.
Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
It's not easy doing what we do.<eos> Fucking hard-earned.<eos> All right?<eos> I want you to embrace the moment, Alicia.<eos> I will.
No, you flew away, like a Power, but now there are people that need your help.<eos> Your fellow Powers need you.<eos> I can't. I... I can't.<eos> Calista, I would give anything to have my powers back and get out there and stop this, but I don't have them.<eos> I never will.
When are you gonna pop the question? Hmm.<eos> Voters need a married man with a happy family.<eos> I don't have a family, happy or otherwise.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
That information will help us find you.<eos> But, Avery, I would have to drop the switch.<eos> - I mean, wouldn't that kill me?<eos> - No.<eos> No, Grace, it won't.
I was in my room.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> You were smack in the middle. You owe yourself some time.<eos> I can't go away for a month.<eos> I won't.
And then what?<eos> You know what.<eos> You know, she actually does look a lot like her.<eos> What if he gets the drop on you?<eos> He won't.
That's not important.<eos> What is important is that you find a way to get Zelena to drink this.<eos> Good luck there.<eos> After I crashed her date, I don't think she'll let me within a mile of her farmhouse.<eos> She will.
So long ago.<eos> You know you're gonna get life for the murder of Adrian, don't you?<eos> And then you'll just be forgotten.<eos> Maddy won't forget me.<eos> Oh, she will.
If I go back, they'll take my shield.<eos> Reassign me to patrol.<eos> I guess you better stay here then, help us.<eos> Why don't you think about it?<eos> I will.
I hear you are already acquainted with the Prince, Peel.<eos> The Queen is stubborn.<eos> You must convince Albert to reconsider.<eos> If the Tories fail to condone your Regency... ..I will abdicate.<eos> No, you will not. I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, looks like we're headed towards a summer trial.<eos> Well, on the upside, Howell can at least make bail.<eos> He doesn't have $250,000.<eos> He will now.
I know it's not easy.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
Throwing Mrs. Graham from her balcony seems too circuitous a route for revenge.<eos> Then keep it simple.<eos> O'Neal was trying to stop William Hull's building.<eos> Anyone check Hull's shoe size?<eos> No, but I will.
Hey, it's not complete failure.<eos> While we have not solved your scar situation yet, we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols.<eos> I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope, he never will.
It's a suspension.<eos> I'll be back at school in two days.<eos> A suspension is a suspension.<eos> - What if they fail you again?<eos> - No, they won't.
- Sure, like crazy.<eos> Hi Blu, how are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Grandma says hi and wants you to visit her.<eos> I will one of these days, okay?
We were.<eos> And now?<eos> Jesus, John. Talk to me.<eos> Listen to me. I'll take care of this, all right?<eos> Yeah, you will.
And remind him we killed the last group of soldiers we couldn't pay?<eos> No.<eos> First we pay the army, then we crush the Red Knights.<eos> But we don't have the money.<eos> We will.
Dad is holding out hope.<eos> He thinks you might change your mind.<eos> About kids.<eos> He does?<eos> I won't.
Alex is good. Norman's getting better.<eos> You don't need to check up on Caleb.<eos> This is... this is coming from some sort of wrong place, all right?<eos> Just don't... Don't do something destructive.<eos> I won't.
It's gonna tip her into end stage heart failure.<eos> That'll kill her.<eos> And if we don't operate?<eos> Beth's gonna die from the cancer.<eos> And then so will her sister.
You saved my life.<eos> Was that charity?<eos> I just wanted to stop anyone else from getting hurt.<eos> I know.<eos> You will.
No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.<eos> Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.<eos> No, give me another chance.<eos> I will find Phillip's killer.<eos> She won't.
- Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't.
I was born an Englishman and I will die an Englishman.<eos> I have decided to reward your service with a position here at court.<eos> I will be giving you the chance to work closely with me from now on.<eos> Do not make me regret that choice.<eos> You won't, Your Majesty.
Get four.<eos> And then whatever you want, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> You have to ask, not me.<eos> - I will.
You can't sit still for that.<eos> I'm sure I can find a way...<eos> Take him out.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
Gus is getting an offer to buy the bar.<eos> I know!<eos> She can't do that, can she, Wyn?<eos> I mean, she wouldn't, right, she couldn't...<eos> She won't.
They let you go!<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I must go to Caroline.<eos> Pray God she'll understand.<eos> Of course she will.
Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
I mean, I want to stop.<eos> A lot's changing this week and the kids and I, we need to move on.<eos> I just need some space to be me now or, at least, try.<eos> Are you keeping up the memory exercise?<eos> Yes, and I will.
I thought you liked rusty.<eos> I do, but that's the problem.<eos> He is an enormous emotional distraction.<eos> You think julio's priorities will change?<eos> Well, of course they will,
Uh, we're very near the end of the session.<eos> Please, let's get it over with.<eos> Oh, yes, go ahead.<eos> Well, maybe your father will show up for you at the trial.<eos> - Maybe he will.
Possible?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just didn't want your feelings to get hurt.<eos> If you don't believe me, you can ask her.<eos> Oh. Oh, I will.
T-Take it off me, too.<eos> Kensi, send 'em up now.<eos> I-I don't want to die.<eos> Take this vest off me.<eos> We will.
You said we had families?<eos> Is that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't let me die.<eos> I won't.
What? This gets better and better.<eos> Hang on. ..as they will now be sentenced to death by wild beasts in the arena.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Well, you wanted to see the beasts.<eos> Now you will. Right up close.
- Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
I promised Toby that I would stay here at the hospital.<eos> It's fine. Just get here when you can.<eos> Tell Toby I'm thinking of them.<eos> I'll let you know what I find.<eos> I will.
- You seem stressed.<eos> - Well, I am stressed!<eos> We will be curtailing Emma's privileges for the next few weeks.<eos> And we'd like the two of you to talk with her so she understands the gravity of the situation.<eos> We will.
Can we go after him now?<eos> This is Rav's investigation.<eos> If he doesn't want to pursue it, I can't make him.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - But I won't.
Come home, Caroline.<eos> - We'll deal with this.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
Yes, yes... I'll talk to Acke. The favors are starting to pile up.<eos> What does the Mink get out of this? You used to slip some cash once.<eos> Do I look like I got cash on me?<eos> Will you talk to him then?<eos> - - Of course I will.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'd understand.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will leave for Russia.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
He took our money.<eos> All that money that's been coming in from you and Jack... he took it, ran off to Florida with some woman he met a month ago.<eos> Let's get to a meeting right now.<eos> I need to make things right.<eos> You will... we will.
You can always come to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Mitch will.
BP's coming up.<eos> See, Sean?<eos> I told you... We're gonna help you out.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't, okay?
Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot Private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
- You shot me.<eos> Was I supposed to trust you?<eos> Now let Donna go.<eos> - I can't let you hurt Dr. Monaghan.<eos> - I won't.
We don't have a minute.<eos> Eric, talk deeks to me.<eos> No matter what happens...<eos> Tahir does not get out of here alive.<eos> He won't.
And the Irish boys will be back soon, so you shouldn't find yourself shorthanded.<eos> Don't let the Irish lads hold you to ransom.<eos> They know what we pay for the harvest.<eos> Don't let them take the piss.<eos> I won't.
No one thinks that.<eos> Lots of people do.<eos> I'm only 21.<eos> And what happens if I end up in a wheelchair?<eos> You won't.
I-I don't know.<eos> Okay, hey, hey, hey.<eos> You're overthinking this.<eos> I put Malik in a wheelchair. I can't make him an orphan, too.<eos> You won't.
You know, the for-profit organization that had Jack placed with Pearson and got him killed.<eos> And how'd you get this check?<eos> I would rather not say.<eos> What if they trace this back to you guys?<eos> They won't.
God. Well, then text him.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.
- I will.<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will, Jesus!
Well, if I were looking for Doyle, I'd go to the first place I saw him, too.<eos> He's not going to stop until he finds me.<eos> I just...<eos> He's not going to find you.<eos> Yes, he will.
Neither did I.<eos> I've got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Me too.<eos> Tell Jared I said hi.<eos> I will.
In time. The Black Root are coming.<eos> Your John got lucky, but the next sortie will get through, and we'll have lost our chance.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You don't give a shit about the Quad!<eos> No, but Aneela will.
We gonna make it.<eos> How are you, Acke?<eos> - - The kids who beat me...<eos> What if they come back?<eos> - - They will not!
Thanks to you.<eos> Remember, it's not Damon.<eos> This is Damon under the control of a she-devil.<eos> And we have to find a way to break her control.<eos> And we will.
She's been right in front of me the whole time.<eos> I-I should've noticed something.<eos> I-I should've felt something!<eos> We'll find them, okay?<eos> We will.
Please, Elliot?<eos> One week!<eos> We'll try it for one week!<eos> - But if she does anything...<eos> - She won't!
You two realize that if you confess to this crime, there's a good chance you both will go to jail?<eos> Whatever we face, we face together.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The one of you who didn't do it, you'll lose everything.<eos> No, we won't.
Maybe you can talk some sense into these two.<eos> Why?<eos> They're trying to break in there by themselves and free the synths.<eos> They're gonna get themselves killed.<eos> No, they won't.
- You don't understand.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> I won't see you later.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Because it's a thing you tell people and I don't have that many people I can tell.<eos> Well, you aren't telling Dad. Absolutely not.<eos> Mmm... No.<eos> Mum, ab-so-lute-ly not.<eos> No, I won't, all right?
Tasha!<eos> Get back!<eos> Tasha!<eos> We have to go back down there!<eos> We will, sir!
If I can just do one thing, one... great thing for her before I die...<eos> Maybe... Maybe make the last thing I do in this world saving her life...<eos> You made the right call in New Brunswick.<eos> I need you to make it again.<eos> Okay. I will.
I'll keep you posted.<eos> Crap.<eos> You think DeLuca's gonna say anything?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
- You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
This is what I want.<eos> What do you mean why won't anyone listen to you?<eos> Priscilla won't do it, she's afraid, but I told her it's okay.<eos> I'm gonna get one of the other ones to do it.<eos> No, you will not.
I get it, Luisa.<eos> Nice shindig.<eos> Hey-hey! - Hey, man. - Look at you?<eos> Wow. I don't want to wake him up.<eos> You won't.
You can watch him on mute.<eos> - Oh, my God, - I love Jim Carrey.<eos> He's so watchable.<eos> I'll see y'all at "Selma."<eos> Yes, you will.
Hilarious.<eos> But I'm not showing you Jimmy Jack Corn.<eos> Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.<eos> We'll see, all right.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
Brian's parents are gonna be here in a few minutes.<eos> Can you sit in on the interview and just...<eos> Make sure I don't miss anything?<eos> I will.<eos> And you won't.
All right.<eos> Go when ready.<eos> Copy.<eos> Hope the wind doesn't change!<eos> It won't for hours.
I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
- No.<eos> Lord, though I want,<eos> I've already put you in danger. I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
Substance abuse, theft.<eos> Jones's lawyers would tear him apart.<eos> Do you have any idea how many children Jones could have hurt over the past two decades?<eos> No! Because none of them will go on the record.<eos> Freddy will!
- Yes, I do. Not if I don't say so.<eos> You will. Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine. Plenty of other outlets will.
That he was wrong, but that he did it for us.<eos> And she didn't want to turn him in.<eos> You're going to stand beside a killer?<eos> Well, then I'll go to the police myself.<eos> No, you won't!
I've already told you, there's a faction in the future...<eos> No one but the director has the capability to send travelers.<eos> Tell them what you did.<eos> Tell them!<eos> Or I will.
You have no idea what I'm capable of!<eos> I know exactly what you're capable of.<eos> But you are April because you choose not to do it.<eos> You told me you wouldn't let him break you.<eos> And I won't.
Come with me or I will kill more.<eos> Who else did you kill?<eos> Can we use it?<eos> No, it has to be Charles.<eos> And he won't.
It has to be this way!<eos> Or there'll be more dads... ..and more mums.<eos> Tell Ram...<eos> Tell him.<eos> I will.
- The king, Charlie.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Please don't make me. - What?<eos> Don't make you do what?<eos> No, you'll not. No.
So is it worth it?<eos> Mhm, it's worth it.<eos> Mission control confirmed the rover is 2000 kilos over maximum payload with all of us aboard.<eos> I ran the numbers, the odds are we won't make it.<eos> Yeah, but someone will.
Then I will leave it alone. But for what it's worth, you were there for me when the victim's father lashed out at me.<eos> And so, if you want to talk about it with someone, I just want you to know that I'm here for you, too.<eos> I appreciate that, Rachel.<eos> But right now, I'd rather you spend your time finding something to get Leonard Bailey out.<eos> I will.
Uh, that way.<eos> Hey, how bad did Neil fuck up the house?<eos> It's not your problem, sweetie.<eos> It is if it falls down.<eos> It won't.
But you know what?<eos> That's it.<eos> If my dad could see how ridiculous he'd look with someone my age, he'd come to his senses and end this silliness with Renee on his own.<eos> Mrs. Wheeler, you've got to help me.<eos> Of course I will, Tucker.
My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
So, you'll tape today to air tonight.<eos> This interview is a get.<eos> Every network wanted it, but we hope Elizabeth Vargas is a friend of the court.<eos> What if she brings up the blackout?<eos> She won't, sir.
I'll come back as soon as I finish my studies.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> you must come back.<eos> you must come back.<eos> I will.
What did I say?<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Trust is not going to fix this, John.<eos> Nothing will.
They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
This Atzerodt guy shows his face, just point him out to the vice president's bodyguards.<eos> They'll do the rest.<eos> The gun's just in case.<eos> What if I freeze?<eos> You won't.
Just leave it to them.<eos> Luke, tell them. This could be about America, not just D.C.<eos> Okay. Got it.<eos> Luke, tell them.<eos> I will.
You don't think he's thought of that?<eos> The second he discovers we traced it, he'll take it away, take her away.<eos> Liz, the only way we're gonna get her is by finding where that link is coming from.<eos> I don't think he'll hurt her.<eos> Of course he will.
Serial murderers.<eos> But killing cops. Not gonna look too kindly on that.<eos> Are you saying that I shouldn't kill you two?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Okay, then I won't.
Help me, Warren.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Addy!<eos> No one's coming for you, Lucy.<eos> Addy will.
Let's talk.<eos> I know, King, I messed up.<eos> You did more than that, Christopher.<eos> Bad enough you went M.I.A. in the middle of a case... and that can't ever happen again, understand?<eos> It won't, but...
Look, here's the deal, Doc...<eos> You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
Who are we without our principles?<eos> Alex, it was an impossible choice.<eos> I know, and you had to make it and you will again, a-and the choices will always be impossible.<eos> That's not gonna change.<eos> But y-you will, and I will, and... this will.
Take a bite. I'm good.<eos> Eat some food, find out what happens.<eos> Try the food.<eos> Can you hand me another napkin?<eos> Will I or won't I? Will I or won't I?
One for your tracker, for your keys, one for your little penknife.<eos> One for some change in case you need it.<eos> -Yeah, with 10ps and 2ps.<eos> -And a tiny screwdriver for mending your glasses.<eos> -He will. Oh, he will.
Here's a box of cords I have, maybe something in here will work.<eos> ...FBI found a handwritten note pledging loyalty to ISIS.<eos> Yeah, thanks but these aren't gonna, restore your Wi-Fi connectivity.<eos> ...or how the bomber was radicalized...<eos> Okay, what will?
That you are here trying to pass the Process for the second time.<eos> You wouldn't do that to your own son.<eos> Not to a good son.<eos> I would never do that to my Rafael.<eos> But to you, I will.
After everything I've done for you and your brother, you have the gall to think I'd, what, actively sabotage her?<eos> Well, we need to find the best we can now.<eos> With a day to go? Who's gonna be available?<eos> - We have to try.<eos> - All right. I will.
There's nothing wrong with Casey except she isn't here. Now, please, leave us be.<eos> There seems to be something in common with your family.<eos> Scooped the Sun Times, did it?<eos> If they find out we've been hiding her...<eos> They won't.
But you lost.<eos> Well, Monday morning was a different story.<eos> What happened over the weekend?<eos> I couldn't say.<eos> And I won't.
Sir, I-I'm not a priest.<eos> I know. I don't care.<eos> I just need someone to forgive me.<eos> I need them to know how sorry I am and to forgive me.<eos> Will you, please?
I know. I don't care.<eos> I just need someone to forgive me.<eos> I need them to know how sorry I am and to forgive me.<eos> Will you, please?<eos> Will you?
Look, this is my Zen area.<eos> Whatever I do up here is my business!<eos> Not if your business is the Big Tobacco and Alcohol trade!<eos> My God, give it a rest!<eos> I will not.
- Cool.<eos> Pimento, you son of a bitch!<eos> You're the son of a bitch!<eos> Oh, we'll see who's a son of a bitch.<eos> Oh, yes, we will.
Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history.<eos> How are you gonna do it?<eos> I was kinda hoping you would.<eos> I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present!<eos> - Of course I will!
I don't think like Tae-sik.<eos> I'm going to make it!<eos> I can return.<eos> Su-rin, I'll go back.<eos> I will.
So, in a way, you... You did me a favor.<eos> So now, I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> So what, you're gonna talk to the police?<eos> No. No.<eos> I won't.
And only you know, what Gul'dan has planned for my people.<eos> His magic is death to all things.<eos> He must be stopped.<eos> Tell him, the black rock, when the sun is highest.<eos> I will.
Jesus, Bobbie.<eos> You're pregnant.<eos> We could get married.<eos> Baby, you don't want to marry me.<eos> I will.
Did the doctor tell you about the su*ival rate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but, you know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this.<eos> We will.
- No, it is not bad.<eos> - It looks stupid.<eos> - No, it's good.<eos> People in the cinema won't be watching though binoculars!<eos> Or maybe they will...
What is essential is invisible to the eye.<eos> He'll always be with me.<eos> I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!
They are feuding among themselves.<eos> Now this little venture of yours is counterproductive and dangerous.<eos> You have no power to stop me.<eos> You will not leave.<eos> Yes, I will.
You ready for me?<eos> I've been ready.<eos> My safe word is "Keep going."<eos> I don't need one.<eos> You will.
I'll remember it.<eos> Scratch my back?<eos> There'? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Listen, Dad... I'll buy the house as is and Kate and Haley can stay here.<eos> No, you won't.
Now, every time the phone rings I resent her a little more - and I think that...<eos> Mind your feet.<eos> - You can't live forever.<eos> - Exactly. None of us can.<eos> Oh, Marianne will.
Watch out, Claire!<eos> Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!<eos> He's not getting in.<eos> It'll hold.<eos> It will.
You can put it on a chain, you know.<eos> Huh? That way...<eos> You won't lose it.<eos> You're not gonna lose it, are you?<eos> No, I won't.
Go on.<eos> May I have some water?<eos> Go on.<eos> Tell her about them.<eos> I will.
Remember I told you about Neelu?<eos> That was her.<eos> Have some.<eos> What if she tells your father?<eos> She won't.
Incomplete pass.<eos> I say that grabs.<eos> You gotta be kidding<eos> We're leaving.<eos> We will.
I say that grabs.<eos> You gotta be kidding<eos> We're leaving.<eos> We will.<eos> We will.
- It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> - We all will.
- Bring it here, the girl walks.<eos> No, send her out now, alone, and then I'll give you what you want.<eos> We have a seat here for you, Jim.<eos> We're not gonna do anything in public.<eos> I will.
Then you're going to die.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Yes, what about your daughter?<eos> You don't have her.<eos> No, but I will... eventually.
I'm supposed to be asleep.<eos> Your mom just started working.<eos> She'll be out there for hours.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
- Yeah, sure.<eos> - All right, okay.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll look forward to that.<eos> - You know, let me know when you're clean. - I... that's...<eos> I will.
- No...<eos> Good...<eos> This cement sure is!<eos> Tell Voja lo slop by for a chat.<eos> - I will.
I'd oorne over to your place, but I have to wail for the bell.<eos> When will it arrive'?<eos> -Any day now.<eos> Tell your grandpa lo hold on!<eos> -I will.
But Master Ip you know the score.<eos> The police can't keep watch here all day.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Tell people to be careful.<eos> - I will.
This world will only be better off without you.<eos> One less Divergent ruining everything.<eos> And no one ... will ever ... ever forgive you for what you've done.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Because I will.
You might try Weatherbury.<eos> If you're looking for work, there's a farm there needs all the help it can get.<eos> Yes.<eos> The young lad there.<eos> I will.
Oak, you've become quite cynical lately.<eos> She never promised that first time.<eos> Therefore, she has never broken her promise.<eos> She hasn't promised this time, either.<eos> But she will.
What does Nancy want to drink?<eos> - I'm not sure if...<eos> - She wants vodka.<eos> The only spirit she can out-drink me on. We'll see about that later.<eos> No, we won't.
A crippled home for crippled man.<eos> Thank you, Yuri.<eos> My quarters are actually up there.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> We will.
Susan.<eos> You're a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Maybe we'll not.
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Is this okay? I think this...<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> - Phoebe, no, I'm sorry. Did you burn your hand?<eos> Just let me do the cooking, okay?<eos> - I will. Sorry.
Ye've done wrong to all the men, and ye must suffer for it.<eos> I'm yer husband.<eos> It's my duty to attend to it.<eos> I will not let you beat me!<eos> Ye won't?
What's the plan?<eos> We have to do the Cesarian now.<eos> You girl's fine. And she won't need an incubator.<eos> Will I see her?<eos> I will?
We will do everything we can to pull up the cable.<eos> It's only a few hours before daylight.<eos> We will do everything we can.<eos> Philippe, this is crazy. We're never going to finish at this rate.<eos> Yes, we will.
Let my father carry you<eos> You will carry your wife and run<eos> It's your birthday, but don't talk rot<eos> I have told him. He'll run<eos> - I won't
This is a godforsaken corner of a godforsaken country across a godforsaken ocean.<eos> I will not do it, sir.<eos> Do what?<eos> You are about to ask me to annul Tommy Barrett's marriage and Elizabeth Quinn's and...<eos> I will not, sir.
And go through all that again?<eos> ! No, we will never again see you in such pain.<eos> It will not die.<eos> ~ They have all died.<eos> ~ This one will not.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Ah, the hard-luck story.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
What is this concern?<eos> Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t-to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
Yes?<eos> Yes?<eos> Good?<eos> Good.<eos> We'll...
You have regular custom with the men of Captain Flint's crew, yes?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Just one. He won't let the others near me.<eos> Has he paid you a visit yet since his recent arrival?<eos> No, but he will.
Louise?<eos> Louise?<eos> Alan can never know I was scared.<eos> No one can.<eos> They won't.
- Under potential hazards.<eos> - Along with mines and drunken soldiers?<eos> - Right above it.<eos> You should read them.<eos> I will now.
What the fuck did you take? !<eos> - A diamond and an octopus, man!<eos> -You arsehole, I'm gonna...<eos> - I won't do it again.<eos> I won't.
-Shut up!<eos> Tentaclesl<eos> Good morning.<eos> Get a move on.<eos> - I won't!
I fear what we will find in the girl who comes to join us.<eos> Sister, I think perhaps you are confusing the new midwife with Nurse Miller.<eos> She has gone to Chichester as a postulant.<eos> But you said she would come back.<eos> And she will.
That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
No, he will not have you killed.<eos> Burgred, you and I will be joint rulers to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Does that not excite you, hmm?<eos> The Mercians may quarrel against us.<eos> No, they will not.
Under control?<eos> They breached the perimeter.<eos> We're fortunate to still be alive.<eos> You have to stop this now.<eos> I will.
Where you ready to be a mom when you got pregnant?<eos> I took my pregnancy test in the bathroom at Wrestlemania.<eos> Right, but now you've moved on from your completely insane life, and, well, you've become the best mom I know.<eos> So whatever we have to do to make this work, I promise you...<eos> we will, Jules.
Oh, my dear, your life is about to be filled with glorious purpose.<eos> My sweet girl, You're going to be the mother to a whole new generation.<eos> No...<eos> I won't do it!<eos> Oh, of course you will.
Where are the life support units?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Release them.<eos> - All of them.<eos> - I will not.
Let him go!<eos> - Put the gun down.<eos> - You put yours down.<eos> I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> I will.
They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
It's awesome!<eos> It does, eh. I'm so nervous, though.<eos> It's all I can think about.<eos> I really don't want to fuck this up.<eos> You won't, man.
I just had a contentious phone call with U.S. Attorney Sandoval.<eos> Her office was alerted by TSA about your brother's flight.<eos> She asked that we hand him over.<eos> Whoa. I mean, you said that I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> Well, you won't -- just yet.
There's so much that frightens me.<eos> I don't know how to feel or act.<eos> In the smallest ways even. How to sit and speak.<eos> Don't let me be hurt.<eos> I won't.
When do you go?<eos> After.<eos> I won't pretend I'm not sorry.<eos> - I can come back.<eos> - You won't.
Untroubling ans untroubles Where I lie<eos> - The grass below - The grass below - Above the vaultes sky<eos> I wonder if he ever found it, his silent place with God.<eos> The poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
Well, I want to get your brothers before they go to sleep.<eos> I'll call you next week.<eos> I really want you to sell that equipment.<eos> You have no idea about money.<eos> I will.
And I'm King Arthur.<eos> Surely King Arthur was more appealing than that slimy puddock.<eos> We won't be here long.<eos> Dougal will come for us.<eos> No, he won't.
Frank says she hasn't left her room since Nate was arrested.<eos> Aww. You know, we should all go give her a hug and thank her for saving our butts.<eos> How can you celebrate the fact that an innocent man might go to jail for us?<eos> I'll go talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.<eos> It's a fine place, isn't it?<eos> A fine place.<eos> I never thought I'd be settling down in a place like this.<eos> You won't.
I know you.<eos> We're different. I can't let myself--<eos> But you... I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
But, uh, my officers made some real connections with those kids at the baseball game today, and there is something there.<eos> And I'll make it stick.<eos> You know, if I left my game today to see Boz Shepherd go down, I can live with that.<eos> But if we let him slip again...<eos> We won't.
And I'll make it stick.<eos> You know, if I left my game today to see Boz Shepherd go down, I can live with that.<eos> But if we let him slip again...<eos> We won't.<eos> We won't.
Listen, I have a few things I need to attend to tomorrow morning.<eos> Can I count on you to make me Bisquick?<eos> Or will you write me a letter from my dead coach saying it'll happen, and then it'll all be a lie?<eos> I should have never betrayed your trust.<eos> - And I never will again.
We'll have that baby of yours out safely before the year's over.<eos> Do you think this means he's out of intensive care for good?<eos> If he keeps improving like this, he might be home in a few weeks.<eos> I'm so frightened I'm going to hurt him.<eos> You won't.
It's not insignificant.<eos> You have to believe me -- I-I didn't know what she was doing at Olympia.<eos> Aside from Hamada, most of the doctors and staff -- We thought we were helping.<eos> You'll have time to redeem yourself when the others come for me.<eos> And they will.
Ms Lao, I'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> You are going to give me the contents of this safety deposit box.<eos> - I will do no such thing.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
- You stand still!<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> The car, the bomb - it was you, wasn't it?<eos> I swear to God, if you don't tell me... I - I want to.<eos> And I will.
A lot of money for a man on a salary.<eos> Not for one who works hard and saves judiciously.<eos> If you have any further questions, you can refer them to my attorney.<eos> You have one?<eos> I will soon.
What will you do?<eos> Go to the police.<eos> Tell the newspapers.<eos> Tell Mother.<eos> No, you won't.
It takes all the emotion out of everything.<eos> What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't. I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.
Thank you. Maybe there's somebody else you should apologize to?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ my heart ♪<eos> ♪ keeps on breaking but ♪<eos> ♪ I won't ♪
Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
I don't know.<eos> I already signed there once.<eos> Rayna believe in me, she invested money in me, and I... blew it up.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to her again.<eos> I won't.
I find out they're pyro-pirates, I want out.<eos> But they warn me to shut up.<eos> I'm hoping it'll all just go away.<eos> You know what, Larry?<eos> It won't.
Please leave my house.<eos> And shut the door on your way out.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
They had to go to sleep.<eos> It's no use.<eos> I can't do anything. Mark it's okay.<eos> Someday, they'll wake-up and be better.<eos> No they won't Iris.
Not helping.<eos> Scorched earth.<eos> Burnt toast.<eos> Would you please just go out there?<eos> No, I will not.
Who gave those drugs to you?<eos> Who are you protecting right now? You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
Stay alert.<eos> I'm gonna get a water.<eos> I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.
I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.<eos> But if it did, she would.<eos> But it won't.
it's time for me to go.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you came back.<eos> And if they find you, you're going to lead them straight to me.<eos> No, I won't.
D'av, this is almost working.<eos> We are a good team.<eos> We could be great.<eos> So don't mess that up for us.<eos> I won't.
This officer needs help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Let go.<eos> Don't make me shoot you.<eos> You won't.
Of course.<eos> Thank you, Miss Plunkett.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> You have tickets for the theater.<eos> - I won't.
You're the Demon.<eos> I am the Demon's Head.<eos> As those were before me, and very soon, your brother.<eos> He will never take your place.<eos> He will.
You know you was conceived in the back of a truck between a church and a graveyard?<eos> I'd tell you to go kill yourself, but I know you don't have the balls.<eos> If you're here, then you're desperate, so come back with some money.<eos> Oh, yes you are.<eos> Maybe not on purpose, but you will.
So, we'll figure out a way to get along?<eos> Well, you have no choice.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I will.
I know it's not as much fun as dressing up for Halloween... - Oh, no, I want to.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll, uh, I'll work on it right away.<eos> Whatever "it" is better not get in the way - of filing that right away.<eos> - It won't.
We are dealers at that point.<eos> I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No. We won't.
How the hell could you release him, Clay?<eos> I can't hold him on what I've got. You know that.<eos> Danny must've moved the drugs before you picked him up.<eos> - You gotta keep an eye on him.<eos> - We will.
You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go! Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
All we got to do is plant a crop and it's ours. Ours, Sal!<eos> Crop? Yeah.<eos> You don't know one end of a turnip from another,<eos> Will Thornhill. Nah. I won't do it - not out there in that terrible wildness.<eos> I won't.
No, I fucked up there.<eos> I think I might be unfair to people sometimes.<eos> Stay safe. And stay alive.<eos> Please be careful. Please get out of this.<eos> I will.
Yeah.<eos> Now, we'll, uh...<eos> Drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
I'd prefer to handle this quietly.<eos> How are we on the timeline?<eos> Within a reasonable margin.<eos> Assuming we can settle with the Russians quickly.<eos> We will.
If I tell him now, he'll...<eos> Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> I will. I will.
He was wearing a mask.<eos> I couldn't identify him even if i wanted to.<eos> I don't get it, mrs. Stappord.<eos> Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?<eos> He won't.
Something I could read later.<eos> Then at least you'd be a part of the memorial.<eos> Perhaps it might help you make amends.<eos> I need to speak to Joe.<eos> And you will.
You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students.<eos> But don't worry...<eos> I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
I have to say, you're not who I imagined you'd be.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You can let yourself out.<eos> love, love love love, love love But you promised to dance with me.<eos> And I will.
He's right, Bobbi.<eos> We already took the top deck.<eos> Director Fury left orders, and we're gonna follow them.<eos> Hydra will not get this ship and its cargo.<eos> They won't.
You found her, and she's here.<eos> Uh, I forgive you.<eos> You must have had your reasons.<eos> Now take me to my Daisy.<eos> You will not!
Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they're also heralds, sent to reveal the truth.<eos> And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No. They won't.
Yeah. You're my favorite loser, that's...<eos> I'll take that.<eos> - I didn't wanna say it. - I'll take that.<eos> With Joel standing there.<eos> I'll...
I can't...<eos> I can't make that up to you.<eos> But I can do other things.<eos> Look, I'm gonna tell your father the truth about us.<eos> I will.
Crazy Sin Rostro.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I'm sorry I even asked.<eos> Please don't let Michael get between us.<eos> No. I won't.
- Yes, sir. - We shouldn't inform the press until after you land, for security purposes.<eos> Donald...<eos> - If anything should happen to me--<eos> - I'm prepared.<eos> - But nothing will.
I, too, wish that the plague had never happened.<eos> The great minds lost... your daughter, my wife.<eos> But equally, I mourn the loss of who you might've been.<eos> I would so have loved to have seen her, instead of this.<eos> And very soon... you will.
So, what now?<eos> We go ahead as planned.<eos> We overextended ourselves on all the deposits. So if we cancel now, we're out the money with nothing to show for it.<eos> - If we get caught...<eos> - We won't.
Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
Their ratings need a boost.<eos> Normally, I would never consider it, but...<eos> Well, we've just connected.<eos> And I don't want to lose that.<eos> We won't.
Can you see the van?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll catch you.<eos> - You will?<eos> - We will?
Yeah.<eos> We'll catch you.<eos> - You will?<eos> - We will?<eos> We will.
No, I didn't know that.<eos> No, I know you didn't know that.<eos> But it's not- - It's not in his suitcase. It's in my fucking hand right now.<eos> - Listen to me, Kevin-- - lf you won't do something about this...<eos> I will.
Has Jim told you he loves you?<eos> - Barbara... - Fair is fair.<eos> Well, I'm telling you all my little secrets.<eos> No, he hasn't.<eos> But he will, though, won't he?
Isn't that what they say?<eos> So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend.<eos> Yeah, she's just not responsive.<eos> I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.
He knew about the 12 Monkeys.<eos> They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
Please.<eos> - You call me...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you need me immediately.<eos> I-I absolutely will.
They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
Swept the BB.<eos> It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.
Come on! It's okay, come on!<eos> It's just their perception, Lizzie.<eos> Perception based on misunderstanding.<eos> They don't want to understand.<eos> They will.
I can't even imagine you being either one of those things.<eos> Well, it's a big country.<eos> We can go anywhere we want.<eos> He'll find me.<eos> No, he won't.
That was, uh, intense.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> You know, you answer it, they'll stop calling.<eos> - No, she won't.
I've tried it about a dozen times, it won't open.<eos> Maybe thirteen's the charm.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> Ok...<eos> I will, but...
I've been dog sitting for Daisy and Kyle while they're away.<eos> Are they in trouble?<eos> Almost done, babe.<eos> We just need to make sure Mark doesn't screw us up tonight.<eos> He won't.
You're a man who's borrowed all over Europe. I'm a man who knows your creditors.<eos> One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.<eos> Oh, what are they gonna do?<eos> Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.
Ooh... Lady Mary's out, miss, and I don't know when she'll be back.<eos> Who shall I say has called?<eos> I'll wait. Er...<eos> Lady Mary could be hours, so there's no point in waiting.<eos> I will, all the same.
How was your day?<eos> Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
Yeah, but you've got time to whip her into shape.<eos> Has Luke been giving you crap?<eos> He's been texting. I've been ignoring.<eos> If he finds out you're training Jo...<eos> He won't.
How it is does not make it right!<eos> I'm close, though.<eos> Dr. Urman said a call could come at any time.<eos> You can't give up hope.<eos> I won't.
And you just decided that this was the plan, without discussing it with me?<eos> I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up, in case we didn't get the time.<eos> Callie's gonna have to want to do this.<eos> We can't pressure her into it.<eos> We won't.
The soldiers took my phone before I could call them.<eos> When you see them, tell them that their letters kept me sane.<eos> Okay?<eos> Or... saner than I would've been.<eos> I will.
Chuck's already shot at me once.<eos> We just killed his sister, all right?<eos> He's not gonna wait around to talk. Well, I'll talk to him, okay?<eos> He'll listen to me!<eos> No, he won't.
Good to have you back, Detective Drummond.<eos> Thank you, Detective Voss.<eos> Spoken to Jill yet? No.<eos> She'll come round.<eos> No, she won't.
Nothing happened.<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, i believe you.<eos> - So can we talk?<eos> - We will.
I will not let you ruin it by shooting Nighthorse out of the sky.<eos> I was planning on waiting for him to land.<eos> Let me have the gun!<eos> Nighthorse is gonna pay for Martha.<eos> He will!
Blue.<eos> They were a very pale shade of blue.<eos> I'm sorry my show didn't honor her memory properly.<eos> I'll try to make it up to you.<eos> Actually we both will a, a, at the premier of our new show.
Jesus Christ.<eos> We should be commending him.<eos> He may have just struck a significant blow.<eos> And he'll probably be executed for it.<eos> They both will.
Ray was working on getting him compassionate release when there was an unfortunate incident with another inmate.<eos> Andrew, it's not the time...<eos> We would appreciate it if you would expedite his release.<eos> And if he gets out and fucks up again?<eos> He won't.
- Whoa, Pop. Take it easy.<eos> I was paying a compliment.<eos> We might wanna stay on her good side.<eos> Mrs. Minassian... I want us to do right by each other.<eos> And of course we will.
- Thank you. Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
I'm sure her mother is on the mend and she's enjoying home and family.<eos> I wonder if that prestigious teaching position was offered to her again.<eos> Well, she turned that job down once.<eos> But a woman can always change her mind.<eos> She won't.
I-I keep running headfirst into a wall and hoping the wall gives.<eos> Well, you're doing the best that you can.<eos> That's not enough.<eos> He could still get to Jane.<eos> - No, he won't.
You know what, just, um, go down and treat yourself to something special.<eos> I'll be back for you in an hour.<eos> Come home safe, okay?<eos> Don't you dare leave me alone.<eos> I won't.
Maybe he could help you clean the rain gutters.<eos> I thought you were calling a service.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> You should see how they've cleaned up the place.<eos> Well... You will.
I'm- - I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I'm sorry, too, about the car.<eos> So you'll reschedule with the travel-agent person?<eos> No, Tessa, I will not.
You are the reason I was not there to raise my son.<eos> I never should have saved your life when the Horseman cut you down.<eos> I never should have put you to sleep.<eos> I should've let you die!<eos> And this time, I will.
Wait. We didn't say anything about...<eos> Oh, bye bye!<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to say anything.<eos> But I will.
I concealed my whereabouts and condition from the person who did it.<eos> - An attempt by whom?<eos> - I don't have proof, Sire, so I beg your indulgence until I complete my investigation.<eos> She may not come back.<eos> Of course she will.
I need to dissect the splenorenal ligament. Metz.<eos> Hey, okay. Pierce just controlled the gastric bleeds with clips, and now Grey is finishing taking out the spleen.<eos> All right, now, um... he's upset about Dad.<eos> He's obviously having some sort of emotional breakdown, so we'll get him a psych consult.<eos> No, we won't.
Please wake up.<eos> She's gone, honey. No.<eos> No!<eos> - We have to go now.<eos> - No, I won't.
What did you do to me?<eos> I'll send the rest of your stuff as soon as you're ready, okay?<eos> Don't be sad, Julie.<eos> We'll see each other again.<eos> JULIE: Of course we will.
Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid.<eos> Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.<eos> So can we try this my way now?<eos> We already compelled him into art school.<eos> Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.<eos> He will.
I'm ok with that.<eos> Caroline is anything but.<eos> She was meant to be extraordinary, and she needs to know how proud I am of her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She will.
Marco, we've been over this.<eos> If your Uncle Joe finds out, he will kill you.<eos> And if we tell my aunt Mel, she'll tell Joe, and he will kill you.<eos> Nah.<eos> He won't.
- But you need to tell the truth. - I am telling the truth.<eos> Do you understand that William Thatcher thinks you nearly killed his daughter?<eos> I'm not gonna get Julie in trouble!<eos> He's gonna forgive her, but he will never forgive you.<eos> Sure he will.
- You should let me talk to him.<eos> - Really bad idea.<eos> Promise me that you'll stay out of it.<eos> What happens if you don't convince him?<eos> - We will.
I need you to stop beating yourself up.<eos> - Can you do that for me?<eos> - Ok.<eos> Can you say it like you mean it?<eos> I will.
What if this is one of those and... and we're deciding to do this today, when if we just...<eos> I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> I thought I could, but I can't.<eos> - I won't.
She's already angry.<eos> There's no way around this.<eos> We go to work. We hold our breath.<eos> She won't do anything stupid.<eos> She won't.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> Me either.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I'm serious. - Don't do that.<eos> - I won't.
No scratches.<eos> The Lamborghini is fine.<eos> But thanks to you, I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.<eos> Come on, we have to get this car back.<eos> We will.
Look at that!<eos> Looks like I take another monster hand.<eos> Had to protect that monster, monster hand.<eos> Try that bluff again, tough guy. I dare you.<eos> Okay, I will.
Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
Why would I do that? 'Cause!<eos> It'll give you a chance to save your beloved Catherine.<eos> Unless, of course, Carol's killed her already.<eos> I swear... if anything happens to Catherine, I'll...<eos> You'll what, huh?
Well, I'm gonna let you now.<eos> (sighs) Come here.<eos> Just sleep, okay?<eos> You'll know what to do in the morning.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- No.<eos> They're wrong...<eos> - And when I am gone, you will have no position here but that of a widow, and I cannot abandon you unprotected.<eos> - I cannot, I cannot leave you...<eos> - You won't.
A good jumper.<eos> We'll take the path beyond the chapel.<eos> Oh, I'd like that, but I have business to attend to.<eos> But I thought you said you wanted to talk.<eos> We will.
Dad, this is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> Not my abduction, not the egg donor stuff, this one.<eos> You can't just bury something like this.<eos> If you tell her now, she might forgive you.<eos> - She won't.
You can stay in my hotel room.<eos> I don't think that-- really?<eos> Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.<eos> Promise me you'll tell her.<eos> I will.
No.<eos> It's for her own good.<eos> I will not do this to my daughter.<eos> You won't have to.<eos> I will.
I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
The second it happened, i knew it, But i didn't know they were gonna do it.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will i ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
It could bring us closer to the shooter.<eos> Catherine, come on, those agents have been in and out of that room all day long. Okay?<eos> They're here, still, right now.<eos> If we get caught...<eos> We won't.
So... the police will find these letters, mmm, and they'll think, "The blind old fool really loved his son.<eos> What a wonderful father." Oh.<eos> There won't be a dry eye in the house.<eos> They'll never believe it.<eos> Ah, sure, they will.
If you bring me the name, I'll know it's real.<eos> Do you mean that?<eos> I'll call you after I talk to him.<eos> Still got to get the name.<eos> I will.
Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"... I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old.<eos> This is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> You tell her now she might forgive you.<eos> She won't.
What about him?<eos> 'Cause he's staying over there and you don't want to see him.<eos> Well, he's also working with Crash, another person I don't want to see.<eos> Well, in any case, everyone's gonna be there if you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.<eos> Well, it sounds like you guys have a lot to talk about on the ride home, so good luck with that.<eos> Yes, we will.
- Yes, sir.<eos> I hereby order you to serve in rear guard capacity.<eos> Sam, that's a very bad idea.<eos> You're most likely gonna engage Santa Anna.<eos> Most likely I will, sir.
Can I have some?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Smells great.<eos> - Go enjoy yourself.<eos> I will.
I don't have an assigned seat on the plane, and I want to make sure I get a middle one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, have an awesome time, okay?<eos> And, um, remember what we agreed to.<eos> - Ii will.
This is why mom and dad are separating?<eos> Tay, I think it's better if you ask them these questions.<eos> No, I'm asking you.<eos> Yeah, and I'm saying, I think it's better if you ask them.<eos> Fine, I will.
- I've been working.<eos> The King's welfare is never ending.<eos> - Yeah. - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine. I will.
- See you, guys.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Come by the house.<eos> I will.
When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I...<eos> I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him.<eos> - I will.
No, I mean, like treating him like he's a criminal.<eos> He is a criminal.<eos> He was a criminal.<eos> Now he just wants a clean slate, and I think, after everything he's been through, he should get that chance.<eos> - He won't.
- Your Jimmy?<eos> Tell me!<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I will.
What if we're wrong?<eos> I'm not wrong. Okay.<eos> - Ruby, you can do this.<eos> She could puncture her heart.<eos> She won't.
They obviously belong in a train-yard set.<eos> And this guy needs a hat.<eos> There we go.<eos> This will make me feel better?<eos> It will.
And this guy needs a hat.<eos> There we go.<eos> This will make me feel better?<eos> It will.<eos> It really will.
Well, Lisa, we didn't score a single point.<eos> That was surprising.<eos> Oh, you'll get them next time, honey.<eos> No!<eos> No, we won't!
You're going down.<eos> I'm getting the police.<eos> Let her go.<eos> She said she's gonna go to the cops.<eos> She won't.
Or not.<eos> A minute, 32 until impact.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Uh, please tell me you did not just drop the screwdriver.<eos> Okay, I won't.
I'm gonna go.<eos> She told me to go.<eos> - Good.<eos> Go.<eos> - I will.
- Bash.<eos> - Eventually a man will come along with enough power to make you feel safe.<eos> But until then, you or any woman is better off wed.<eos> Allow my name to protect you.<eos> I will.
I think I'm struggling very hard not to punch him in the face.<eos> - You think it's bollocks? - Yeah.<eos> I think it's bollocks.<eos> - Except whatever name he gives us...<eos> - Which he won't.
Not.<eos> You know, in America, we have this thing.<eos> It's called interagency cooperation.<eos> You should try it sometime.<eos> Perhaps I will.
But this time it's because of me.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to tell your dad what you did for me last night.<eos> He sees me a certain way and that's never going to change.<eos> Yes, it will.
I want to be with Elena.<eos> And what did Stefan say?<eos> Do you honestly want to spend your last night as a single man debating my existential crisis?<eos> Damon, tell me you told your brother of 166 years that you're planning on becoming human.<eos> I will.
I want to see his eyes.<eos> You said they were beautiful.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I wish he'd open them.<eos> He will.
Your secrets are safe with me.<eos> Of course in exchange, Helena is going to need a little favor.<eos> From one Queen to another.<eos> - If I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
What are you doing?<eos> Taking away your shame and giving you back your glory.<eos> Do you not think that this flesh has seen a lifetime of wounds and scars and the ravages of time?<eos> And yet, behold... It retains its youth.<eos> And so, too, will yours.
Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too. - Yeah?
Carolyn Bligh...<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Don't do what I think you're doing.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
And in the history of bad ideas, this ranks just above the $2 bill and jeggings.<eos> We need access to Dani's life.<eos> Most of it was in that lab and in her office... it's my only way in.<eos> But when the good doc figures out that you're faking a brain injury, then what?<eos> He won't.
- So I'm right.<eos> - It doesn't matter. You're just as dead.<eos> The only reason they killed your father instead of you is because of what he knew.<eos> Now, you keep asking questions and you're gonna end up in the same place.<eos> We... we both will.
Let me fight this for you.<eos> No, Cary. I...<eos> Finn's doing it.<eos> - I'll do it better.<eos> - No, you won't.
We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
!<eos> - She doesn't trust you.<eos> - And, quite frankly, I don't blame her.<eos> - Look, I will talk to her, and...<eos> - No, you won't.
I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.<eos> Course it will.
- Chris!<eos> Cade!<eos> I'll figure this out!<eos> Don't worry! King, we gotta do something!<eos> We will.
Where's Alison?<eos> - Is she not here?<eos> - She was, but...<eos> - We can't find her.<eos> - But we will.
Is it?<eos> Because I'm thinking of putting down my paint can and picking up a gun.<eos> Shut up, Marwan.<eos> The one thing we've always said is that violence won't bring down the regime.<eos> But graffiti and anonymous chat rooms will?
With life, there's possibility, even if we never let him out.<eos> - I'd get out.<eos> - Even if we never let him out, he could know what he's done. - He could know--<eos> - I don't want to have to kill you, Morgan.<eos> You won't.
- What happened?<eos> I was looking for a place to sleep tonight, you know, someplace safe, and a couple guys jumped me.<eos> You... you said you could help me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I will.
Who is it?<eos> Mimi died the day I kicked her out.<eos> She stopped being my daughter long before any of this.<eos> Look, if you change your mind...<eos> She won't.
That was Olinsky at Chicago Med.<eos> Victoria didn't make it.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> We'll get him.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we will.
- Did you see what we saw?<eos> - The real Greg Yates?<eos> I just hope the jury saw it.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will.
We don't know that.<eos> This is not the way I want to practice the law.<eos> Oh, what, you mean successfully?<eos> So, what if the prosecution gets to her?<eos> They won't.
N-no, doctor.<eos> We shall go, all three of us.<eos> With all due respect, Magistrate...<eos> As magistrate, it is not your respect I require but your obedience.<eos> As you will.
Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
Do you have the schematics for the circuits?<eos> I don't need the schematics.<eos> I built the circuits.<eos> Do you understand what happens if the test succeeds?<eos> It won't.
- Nothing's impossible.<eos> We just... all right, we clear a path to the east elevator.<eos> Move everything out of the way, stop all foot traffic, lock down the elevator.<eos> Can he make it that far?<eos> No, but he will.
The good news is...<eos> I've been tracking channels, And there hasn't been any chatter.<eos> None.<eos> It's almost as if they haven't discovered his body yet.<eos> But they will.
- Tonight?<eos> You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
Cody and I would just like to say thank you for the big send off, and for investing your hard-earned money in us.<eos> We're opening three laundromats in North Dakota, 'cause that place is booming.<eos> We're not gonna let you down.<eos> I promise.<eos> - We won't.
They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
You have known only the life of a journeyman, Maddy.<eos> Your rough spirit will quiet in time.<eos> And when Luca is of age to swing the ax, he will have no struggle with a settled life.<eos> Luca will not have this life.<eos> Of course he will.
All I want is full custody of our daughter.<eos> Well, that might be a little trickier.<eos> The legal system is still generally biased towards the mother when it comes to custody.<eos> If your wife chooses to fight it...<eos> She won't.
♪ I couldn't change it if I wanted to ♪<eos> ♪ ♪ Oh, I may be crazy ♪ ♪ but I still need you, baby ♪<eos> ♪ you're the hurricane and you're the thunder ♪ ♪ you're the ledge that's gonna be my fall ♪<eos> - We'll talk soon?<eos> - Yes, we will.
What's on your mind?<eos> Have you found anything on my father yet?<eos> I mean, was he even in the FBI?<eos> I told you I'd let you know if I found something.<eos> And I will.
I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
Well, those are the requirements.<eos> Well, can't you just give me a break?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Get your ex-husband to co-sign for you.<eos> He won't.
- I didn't kill him, I-I just iced him.<eos> - And screwed Coulson.<eos> He's working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two.<eos> - When she finds out...<eos> - She won't.
No, which was this really stupid mistake on their part.<eos> If the 5Ds had used a gun that we knew they owned...<eos> You'd be conflicted out.<eos> Guess they thought I'd recuse myself.<eos> I won't.
- Do you want Henry growing up, feeling that he's responsible for what you did to Chandler?<eos> Do you think that that's going to make it better for him?<eos> It won't! And if you don't talk to us, Sean, this goes to a courtroom.<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I don't have to take the stand.<eos> No, no, but Henry will.
Duck bill ready?<eos> How far along is she?<eos> 11, 12 weeks, she says.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
They should look healthier, there was a frost this morning.<eos> Frost? Frost can kill the baby vines.<eos> We should have planted earlier.<eos> Every day Bella, I look in that corner and think, that's where the winery will go.<eos> Darling, it will, just..
And he'll want to see a lot of Melly.<eos> You know how close they are.<eos> Nothing's decided yet.<eos> He might... want to come home.<eos> No, he won't, Jo.
I can help you find a name if you want.<eos> When I grow up will you take care of me.<eos> Then we'll have a bird, for then Mom will be dead.<eos> Mom won't die.<eos> Well, someday, she will.
A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
I overstepped my bounds.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I should have consulted you first.<eos> And, uh, I won't make the same mistake again.<eos> No, you won't.
Is there a reason for that?<eos> We don't work for you, either.<eos> Okay, guys, could we...<eos> Okay, I just... I don't want anything I say here showing up on "Live at 5:00."<eos> It won't.
It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, And I tell him I'll give him a piece, He'll know it's worth a fortune to him<eos> And he'll overturn the vote. And what are you gonna do when he finds out The whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
Need to be smart now.<eos> What's worrying you?<eos> We used to be close.<eos> - She'll see right through me.<eos> - No, she won't.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I heard you talking with Charles.<eos> I know Francis is dying.<eos> You mustn't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
- I can call CCPD.<eos> They can access the tip hotline, send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.<eos> - Good.<eos> - We gotta get her back.<eos> - We will.
I'm pretty sure you're someone's father, Oliver.<eos> So when we go up against Savage, you're not focused.<eos> And then, Kendra can't access her powers, and then the tech they're developing to counteract Savage's staff does not work, and...<eos> Everyone dies, Oliver.<eos> This time they won't.
Are you okay?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Please help me.<eos> Don't let him take me back there.<eos> I won't...
♪♪ Excuse me, number two, could you hand me a beer?<eos> I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you.<eos> By the end of the year, you'll be back where you belong... many paces behind me.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Fight me!<eos> Lord, we're negotiating.<eos> You will not say another word!<eos> He will not say another word!<eos> He will not, no.
- Terrified, I'll bet.<eos> If you could be brief with the ceremony, father Beocca, I would be grateful.<eos> I have business with the King.<eos> - The bride has been given her price?<eos> - She will.
You wish to become executioner, Leofric?<eos> My plea is for a fight to the death, Lord... me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the Victor and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he should win this fight to the death, - what then?<eos> - He will not.
Not to mention, it'll blow - the element of surprise.<eos> - Which won't matter if the Taliban get there first.<eos> I'd agree with you, Bess, but we promised them that their families would be safe in the U.S. before they surrender.<eos> I don't see how they're going to trust us if we change the rules of the game now.<eos> - They won't.
Hotch:<eos> But you also love your sister.<eos> We know you're sad, dana, But hurting nicole is not gonna make that go away.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Well, we were married there.<eos> Ah.<eos> So many ceremonies, so many nobles, and we barely got to dance.<eos> We will do all those things.<eos> We will.
Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> That was some night.<eos> Yeah, it was pretty epic.<eos> Um... I was kind of hoping you and I could talk a little bit this morning.<eos> We will.
Come on, sweetie. I-I think you've said everything you want to say, and maybe some stuff you didn't.<eos> [Sighs] It was the greatest moment of my life.<eos> Don't ever let me do something that stupid again.<eos> Trust me...<eos> I won't.
How's Ruzek?<eos> Go talk to the parole officer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now if you leave the city limits...<eos> - Hey, hey, I won't.
I know what Lane did to me, and I'm gonna stop him from doing it to somebody else.<eos> It could get ugly.<eos> I just want you to be prepared for the fallout.<eos> You should go home.<eos> I will.
I'm a monster!<eos> - I'm here to help you out.<eos> - Don't.<eos> I'll just say more terrible things.<eos> No, you won't.
Why not?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> My job is to provide the president an impartial opinion.<eos> If Reeves is the right candidate for the job, I'll back him.<eos> If not... I won't.
So we'll be doing this surgery endonasally.<eos> - Which is the wrong approach.<eos> - We're out of options. Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
At least four.<eos> I'm afraid of the other guy.<eos> He's the only one who can win the Ballon d'Or. Huh?<eos> The other guy could destroy everything.<eos> No. No, he won't.
It was something he heard... from me.<eos> Why would you lie about that?<eos> I knew my family would think I was crazy for raising Gerald alone, so I just made it up, so that it would seem like it was out of my hands.<eos> Well, go tell him the truth.<eos> I will.
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
You must...<eos> You must wed again.<eos> You must love again.<eos> I can't.<eos> I will never.
The camera connecting you to Meyers.<eos> It's circumstantial.<eos> Yes, but... shooting Meyers really mucked things up.<eos> You need to get ahead of NCIS before they find something.<eos> They won't.
- This won't take long.<eos> - Kelly...<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Did you get your rank reinstated?<eos> Not yet, I will.
I want to talk to you.<eos> You're the coroner.<eos> He didn't kill himself.<eos> You have to help him.<eos> Of course I will.
I mean, sorry, Chief.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I apologize.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Made him take away your job, the only thing you had left.<eos> 39 years?<eos> I understand - I understand why you'd want to make him pay.<eos> Make her pay.<eos> She won't, Rose.
Bobby come here.<eos> Pavel, can't you see I'm busy with work?<eos> Ah, yes, you're very busy with the old man.<eos> I thought we were gonna spend the afternoon together.<eos> - And we will. - Yeah?
We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He never did.<eos> He never will here.
What does it look like?<eos> Tough neighborhood.<eos> Bet your ass it is, old man.<eos> You can it back on the way out.<eos> Yeah, I will.
A proper home, like yours.<eos> Now I've got an idea.<eos> But I'm going to need your help.<eos> - This is never going to work.<eos> - (Paddington) Of course it will.
They were screaming for me.<eos> You were only a child.<eos> After that day, I swore that I would never love anyone ever again.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
"Oxford is everything we dreamed of and more.<eos> "If only you were here to share it with me, Roland.<eos> "I want to ask you to leave the army,<eos> "but I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
If you win, what are you going to do with the money?<eos> I'm gonna buy my father a new truck.<eos> I understand.<eos> You should get him a driver, too.<eos> Maybe I will.
So sorry.<eos> It can happen this fast?<eos> It just did.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> No one else will.
I save his Rolodex card.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?<eos> I won't do that.<eos> No, I won't.
-It's gonna be all right.<eos> -Got a clear shot.<eos> Standing by.<eos> -I don't want them shooting me anymore.<eos> -They won't.
Tell your parents that you'll be home for dinner.<eos> And your wife Yedé will be there, celebrating your return.<eos> You must be eager to see... your son Ravil after all this time.<eos> Of course I want to see my son Ravil.<eos> And I Will.
Colton, do you know who I am?<eos> You're not afraid?<eos> Nobody here wants to hurt me.<eos> That's right, Colton.<eos> And nobody here ever will.
- I know.<eos> Come on, men.<eos> What's the matter, baby?<eos> What's the matter? I just want you to come back early.<eos> I will.
- I lost it.<eos> - Are you fighting, Katniss?<eos> You here to fight with us?<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
It has for me.<eos> Too many times.<eos> And I'm tired. I'm afraid.<eos> - What if I stop?<eos> - You won't. - Why?
- Stop it.<eos> - Did it again.<eos> Did it again!<eos> - Dylan, stop. Stop it!<eos> - I won't.
I always wanted to see New York.<eos> Greatest city in the world.<eos> - Have you ever seen Munich?<eos> - No.<eos> But we will soon.
A break that you told her was coming.<eos> I did.<eos> And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?<eos> No.<eos> It will.
So it's $18.<eos> For now.<eos> It'll stay $18.<eos> Unless someone comes later.<eos> Which he won't.
- He hit the dragon!<eos> - No.<eos> He did, he hit it's mark, I saw.<eos> These arrows can not pierce it's hide.<eos> Actually, nothing will.
You only need to whisper the words:<eos> "more than anything in the world,"<eos> to your horse, and he will bring you here.<eos> - I will not return.<eos> - Oh, yes you will.
I wouldn't give you the ice off my eyebrows.<eos> Let him go.<eos> If you don't release me, he will break that man's neck.<eos> Yeah, well, I might do you the same favor.<eos> - You won't.
And we're back!<eos> It's only been, what, like, two years?<eos> And in two minutes, you're trying to get inside my head.<eos> Because I need to know if you're working for the russians, and you won't just tell me if I ask you.<eos> Uh... yes, I will.
- Have a nice day, guys.<eos> See you this afternoon.<eos> - Bye.<eos> My dad wants me to join the Hitler Youth Storm, like Roeland.<eos> Will you?
- Help dad with his presentation!<eos> You'll become friends.<eos> I offered.<eos> - He threw me out of the car.<eos> - This time he won't.
You'd killed him in every story.<eos> The end of story is always same that I'll kill you.<eos> You won't kill me.<eos> If you wanted then you'll shot here and not in other places.<eos> You won't me.
- A hot tub on the roof. - Oh wow.<eos> I would love to see that.<eos> When you get better, you should come visit.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I will.
I've lost more than my fair share of this wild-cat paper.<eos> You have any greenbacks?<eos> No, I spent it all.<eos> I'm sorry, Sir, I cannot accept these banknotes.<eos> Nobody around here will.
What do you want me to do?<eos> You let her run all over you, and now her boy too.<eos> Why don't you do something?<eos> They're your family too.<eos> All right, I will.
Don't come back till daylight.<eos> Listen, you're gonna be two men down.<eos> What if they attack again?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> They won't.
And they'll let me move in on the 15th.<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> It's like a half-hour away.<eos> We're not going to see each other again.<eos> Of course we will.
Many expeditions tried to find the place to verify this.<eos> With time, the legend grew disproportionately. People were undoubtedly exaggerating, as they usually do.<eos> The only thing that is known for certain is that all who tried to find this earthly paradise got lost on the way.<eos> Father, why can't I have a dog of my own?<eos> You will, Inge.
He's supposed to be here, shooting a scene right now.<eos> Oh, please, it's a Michael Bay movie.<eos> His part could be played by a can opener.<eos> Oh, believe me... we will sue you.<eos> Oh, yes, we will. Mnh.
Oh, please, it's a Michael Bay movie.<eos> His part could be played by a can opener.<eos> Oh, believe me... we will sue you.<eos> Oh, yes, we will. Mnh.<eos> Yes, we will.
So, how are people supposed to know when...<eos> Forget the when!<eos> What... what when?<eos> What I mean is, how will they know what's on?<eos> They won't.
All the crazy motherfuckers.<eos> - George.<eos> - What?<eos> Remember we used to go to Castelli and Mary Boone... and you would say... one day we'll go there to see my one-man show?<eos> And we will.
Like I said, she could still wake up.<eos> You need to give her more time.<eos> You will replace this chip with the one that works.<eos> You don't have that chip.<eos> I will shortly.
How did you feel when she threw you aside?<eos> When she's ready, get her on a boat.<eos> Captain, this isn't what I meant by cleaning up.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
No, no...<eos> I must.<eos> You can't.<eos> If you go and someone recognises you, it was all in vain.<eos> No one will.
Greg... Molly.<eos> I've just had a thought.<eos> Is that a brain?<eos> What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man?<eos> Well, he will, won't he?
So, what do you do now?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step, I swear I will kill you.<eos> No, Mrs Watson... you won't.
Like, this was not my thing, and luckily, no one had ever asked me before, so it never really came up.<eos> But he asked me.<eos> And then my grandmamma popped into my brain.<eos> Whatever he wants you to do you better do it.<eos> Or some other bitch will.
They helped me surprise Captain Hornigold's men, we took his fort, and not once were any of them burdened with the thought, "What if this were to upset Eleanor Guthrie?"<eos> Well, they're about to learn the rules, Charles.<eos> The hard way.<eos> You think I'm gonna let this stand?<eos> That Hornigold will?
- Yes.<eos> This is a good knife.<eos> It'll last you a long time if you take care of it.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
I got a deal for ya.<eos> Give me the kid and I'll let you live.<eos> Or I come in there, kill you and take the kid anyway.<eos> - Don't let him take me.<eos> - I won't.
He says he can do it.<eos> Or is that his disease affecting his judgment?<eos> Look, even if your father wasn't in a... compromised state, it would be a fool's errand to try to convince parliament to extend that lease.<eos> He has staked his entire administration on getting this done.<eos> And he will, but not here.
"Face to Face with America's Wind Tycoons." Wow.<eos> This is some seriously butter knife-dull shit, man.<eos> No, no, no. Underneath, that's grit legit.<eos> So what's WestWingMan got on the Maddox thing?<eos> Nothing yet. But he will.
He got angry and he started intimidating you?<eos> I know what you're saying.<eos> "Tell the jury that you were scared of Trent, "and it will help self-defence stand up better in court."<eos> Dean Trent... doesn't scare me.<eos> Prison will.
He's meeting with his 10:00 now.<eos> No! No! No!<eos> He has very long day ahead.<eos> - We'll wait.<eos> - No, we won't.
Pair of eunuchs!<eos> Bhaati!<eos> You shouldn't have said that<eos> I won't forget this<eos> No, I won't, Bhaati
That sounds like something Frank would say.<eos> - I'm not Frank.<eos> - He has a desk in your office.<eos> - If this bill passes in the Senate...<eos> - It won't.
To see your friends.<eos> Wait, wait. No.<eos> No, I can't, man.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> Uh, no, they won't.
- No, don't.<eos> She won't be long. She might even be on her way.<eos> We're stopping.<eos> We have no choice but to stop. We'll get caught.<eos> We won't.
What happened to us.<eos> Oh, not everything.<eos> They know enough.<eos> If they go to the police...<eos> They won't.
No one's ever stolen from Rabbit before and lived.<eos> We could do this.<eos> - He'll kill you.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> He won't.
The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
I just, um...<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> It's not their fault.<eos> They didn't properly understand.<eos> They will.
'Kay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> I don't see how this will change the fact that Caleb's gone.<eos> It won't.
They're still following us?<eos> Yes, and they're not tiring.<eos> Determined.<eos> What if we can't lose them?<eos> We will.
- Jeremy...<eos> - Shh.<eos> We can talk later, Antonio.<eos> You have to stop them.<eos> We will.
This is not what God wants.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> Open your eyes and wash the sins out.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't!
- Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - It can never happen again.<eos> - And it won't.
Let's get it over with.<eos> All right, I have no idea how you are going to take this, but I need you to keep an open mind.<eos> When I have ever not been open-minded?<eos> And you cannot tell Sharon, either.<eos> I won't, okay?
And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will.
Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
A little, at first.<eos> Then it's like, I got super focused.<eos> Should've taken the SATs right after.<eos> - If my dad ever found out--<eos> - He won't.
Tessa...<eos> I'm so sorry about the other night.<eos> That kind of thing will never happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Remember?<eos> Forgive me. Old habits.<eos> The last few months have been rapturous, Adrian.<eos> Now that we're home, don't ruin it.<eos> I won't.
It's been so long, I don't know if he even remembers.<eos> - Roman!<eos> - You invited them here after I told you not to?<eos> What if mom finds out?<eos> - She won't!
Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
Oh, right, like for a living?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, for now. But eventually you'll wanna, you know...<eos> Get your own place or something, right?<eos> I will?
Just like your father, you have no plan.<eos> Just flying by the seat of your pants.<eos> Well, that isn't gonna work for me.<eos> Come Sunday, you are getting on a plane and going back to your dad.<eos> I will not.
He likes home-improvement shows and movies about getting stoned.<eos> - Actually, I have an appointment.<eos> - Ok. Thanks for coming through.<eos> - No, we'll be with him.<eos> - Yeah, of course we will.
I mean you drove him here, I stitched him up.<eos> That makes us accomplices after the fact.<eos> But we're not sure he did this.<eos> That's why you need to wake up your boyfriend and get him to tell you the truth.<eos> What if he won't?
How rich?<eos> Four million.<eos> He's going to pay four million for you.<eos> My dad? Four million for me?<eos> He won't. - He will.
Not really, just size. (Mobile phone rings)<eos> He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.<eos> What's he done with all of it?<eos> Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you.<eos> No, I won't.
Yeah, sure, yeah.<eos> Got a pen?<eos> Here's my number.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
I deserve to die for what I did.<eos> I believe you are having a medical emergency.<eos> I'm going to call an ambulance to take you...<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Then you won't.
- You owe me.<eos> So? Talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.
Ah, Miss Adams, more than punctual.<eos> I wanted a moment alone.<eos> Today is obviously designed to see me out of my depth.<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll make of it whatever your social skills will allow.<eos> I will.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...<eos> We don't need more studies. We need reform.<eos> Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.<eos> I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
- Even if she offers to split it, I will pay the bill.<eos> - Hundred percent?<eos> - Hundred percent and 20% percent gratuity.<eos> - Will you go do some police work, please?<eos> - Maybe I will.
I'll take you to my place.<eos> - I don't need a place to crash.<eos> I need to get out.<eos> You said you'd do that for me.<eos> - And I will.
You got it.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you think she'll be okay?<eos> Until she screws up again.<eos> Well, maybe she won't.
What are you doing?<eos> 30m! -<eos> This is the only picture I have of you.<eos> You don't need a picture of me.<eos> You never will again.
You ain't telling' her nothin' and then walk out and leave her.<eos> You wanna tell her? Fine.<eos> You go on and tell her.<eos> But then you got to take her.<eos> Well, maybe I will.
Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Maybe.<eos> We can't be sure.<eos> But you will find her and catch whoever's left, right?<eos> You'll punish them for what they've done?<eos> We will.
I swiped it when I palmed her phone.<eos> If I'm gonna do this, I want to know who she talks to and why.<eos> You know how to palm a phone?<eos> - How will you return his badge?<eos> - I won't.
She was there an' all.<eos> I left around eleven.<eos> Went home. Early start.<eos> OK. Now, if Lee Stonnall shows his face again...<eos> He won't.
Stop her.<eos> How long are we supposed to wait?<eos> Will this even work?<eos> We'll find out.<eos> No, we won't.
I'll be here.<eos> [Door creaks] Put that away.<eos> You look ridiculous.<eos> I don't want to use this. But I will.<eos> No, you won't.
- Liv.<eos> - You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.
- You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.<eos> No, I won't.
Generator is up. We have power.<eos> How long will we be blind?<eos> A day.<eos> We'll have no communications. We'll have no access to surveillance systems.<eos> But neither will our enemies.
What? Are you 6?<eos> I promise you, there's a point to all of this.<eos> What?<eos> How does George eating a bag of chips help him make the team?<eos> It won't.
You two got killed trying to escape.<eos> He killed you with this.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That did not happen.<eos> No. But it will.
- My cousin.<eos> We don't need to tell you why that's a bad idea, right?<eos> You know.<eos> Nobody knows she's my cousin.<eos> Your penis will.
God, Livie, why are the cops in this town working overtime to...<eos> Where have you been?<eos> You won't believe me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I probably won't.
You know you're not supposed to separate from the group.<eos> Yeah, I know, it's my fault. Um...<eos> I just didn't want to interrupt the tour.<eos> Sorry. It won't happen again.<eos> Yeah. It won't.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!<eos> And you, I will get her everything she wanted.<eos> I will be everything she wanted.<eos> - And you, you're gonna help me.<eos> - I won't.
Because you care?<eos> What does it matter why I do this?<eos> Because you're gonna hurt her.<eos> Maybe not tomorrow.<eos> But you will.
I've spoken to senior staff at the White House who say the President's worried you want to run against him in 2016.<eos> And just today, Linda Vasquez intimated that you...<eos> Look, I fully expect that the President will run in 2016, and I hope he's generous enough to invite me to be his running mate.<eos> Impeachment, conviction. Let's say it happens.<eos> It won't.
I didn't expect to see you again.<eos> Do you know how many nights I laid awake, year after year... wondering where you were, if you ever thought about me?<eos> Did you... ever?<eos> No.<eos> I will now, though.
Why don't you just kill me?<eos> To kill you now... would be a mercy.<eos> You cannot die until you have suffered... the same way that I have suffered.<eos> Till you have known complete despair.<eos> And you will.
It's where I talk about How my father's facing prison.<eos> Laurel...<eos> This will all blow over, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> No. It won't, dad.
They do not go down!<eos> We got to call in the National Guard.<eos> That's a call for the mayor.<eos> And he hasn't made that yet.<eos> And he won't.
And now it's Olympia, whatever that is.<eos> Somebody's got to be making progress somewhere.<eos> It's not true what you said...<eos> That no one would miss you.<eos> I will.
You owe me $100,000.<eos> That's not including the car.<eos> You pay me by Friday, or everyone in East End will know what you did to your brother.<eos> And what if I decide to do the same to you?<eos> You won't.
And when things calm down, I'll come find you in Eljida.<eos> But that's not gonna happen unless you leave tonight.<eos> You were so small when they took you from me.<eos> And now I... I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Regina's back.<eos> They say your husband's alive.<eos> You bring him home.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
If it seems right, you bring him home.<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> If it's right, you have to.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
We're starting a Tumblr page.<eos> - You can do the captions.<eos> - Dude, no.<eos> What if we ruin something?<eos> We won't.
I want you to tell me how much you want me to make you feel good.<eos> Do it.<eos> Beg me.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
- No.<eos> This is on me.<eos> Besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.<eos> - She won't forgive me.<eos> - She will.
Don't break it.<eos> - Thanks, Nick.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> - Don't break it.<eos> - I won't.
He was laughing at me, Booth. What?<eos> He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.<eos> Pelant is dead, right?<eos> I will find the killer, Booth.<eos> I will.
How's Aiden handling everything?<eos> Poorly, but he's agreed not to retaliate against Daniel.<eos> What about you?<eos> How will Emily Thorne return with a vengeance this time?<eos> She won't.
Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.
It's not who I am?<eos> You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.
You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We will.
- Mum. If I see this glass empty again, I will be very - unhappy.<eos> - Perish the<eos> - thought, mum. - Now, then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> All right, then I will.
Set.<eos> Ready?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> You said the lawyer would call!<eos> Yeah, and he will.
The past is the past, Wallace.<eos> Yeah, 10, 20 years ago, I'd have told myself that too, but I've seen the pain I've caused.<eos> Two marriages, a stepson who barely wants anything to do with me.<eos> I got a lot of baggage, Donna, and I can't put you through that.<eos> I won't.
But I can't do this.<eos> I am begging you, please stop.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ever.<eos> Then I will.
So cut my throat.<eos> Leave me here to rot.<eos> I've been close to worse deaths.<eos> But do think he'll love you for it?<eos> In time, he will.
I care that you didn't honor our pact.<eos> I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Yeah, so get back out there, champ!<eos> Immediately. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna get an exclusive interview with Norwood, and I'm gonna find out where that money is.<eos> No need to know the process. Just dazzle me with the results.<eos> I will, 'cause from now on...
Yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Just tell her to call me, okay? And you call me.<eos> Call me tomorrow and tell me what's going on.<eos> Of course I will.
- He's our dad!<eos> - Vic, you're an idiot.<eos> Enough! Enough! Enough.<eos> Listen, if there's one thing... the only thing... that I'm certain of it's that we have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this.<eos> Yeah, well, then maybe we won't.
Who really deserves the iron fist of punishment...<eos> The slave or the masters?<eos> That's a sad story, but it ends the same way.<eos> - Killing me won't make a difference.<eos> - Sure it will.
It's the way we get through.<eos> I can't imagine my life without Charlie.<eos> I can see it.<eos> And it breaks my heart... but I'll survive.<eos> Of course you will.
Whysa you thinking they want Queenie so badly?<eos> As the spiritual leader of her people, the living Force inside the Queen must be very powerful.<eos> Whoever the Great Mother is, she wants that power.<eos> Well, wesa not let them have Queenie's Force.<eos> No, we will not.
Now you've gone too far. I won't have that filth.<eos> It's time you left.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> - You won't take my kidney?<eos> - No sir, we won't.
Jedikiah denies knowing anything about it.<eos> Which he would in any event.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So how will I know what I'm up against.<eos> You won't.
No, someone went to far too much trouble to try and get it for it to be ornamental.<eos> It's gotta do something, or be something.<eos> The question is what?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
The movie starts in an hour.<eos> I'll be back in 30 minutes.<eos> Please be on time.<eos> I don't want to miss the previews.<eos> Sweetie, we won't.
Do you want undignified?<eos> Then wait till you see what I do to you.<eos> You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.<eos> Your mother paid for it with her life.<eos> So will you.
Guys, we're selling the house.<eos> I-I won't have a place to live in a week.<eos> And you're gonna need some help with daily activities like showering, dressing, the whole deal.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> No. You won't.
It's too late now.<eos> Aunty, hurry up!<eos> Listen, kid.<eos> I'll come hunting to your house to rescue Pyaari.<eos> But rescue I will.
I won't do it.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> And she'll defeat you.<eos> Then I'll send The Dark One to kill her before you can.<eos> No, you won't.
Now JT- - JT is kidnapped!<eos> The man thinks he won a grant, for God's sake!<eos> You need to calm down and think this through.<eos> No, we need to save JT.<eos> And we will, together.

- Where is he?<eos> - My DEA contacts spotted him two hours ago in this border town of Mexicali.<eos> We spoke to the D.A.'s office.<eos> They're just waiting for a judge to get his extradition papers.<eos> Well, they won't.
Say it!<eos> I can't.<eos> Because I didn't do it.<eos> I will blow your head off.<eos> No, you won't.
I don't want to lie to you either.<eos> It's a secret though.<eos> You can't- You can't write about it.<eos> But, Aayan- You can't tell anyone.<eos> Okay. I won't.
I can't lose you. You could never lose me.<eos> But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother. Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
And a part of me...<eos> I think in that moment a part of me just wanted him to die.<eos> Well, I don't blame you.<eos> I guess we'll see if other people feel the same way.<eos> They will.
It's okay if you choke.<eos> It's just a different route to the same thing.<eos> I really feel great.<eos> Jessa, don't you take any of these pills after I'm gone.<eos> No, I won't.
Excuse me, I'm Henry Parish.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Captain Irving's attorney.<eos> My wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess The identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones<eos> Will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
That has signaled the starting of wars For aeons.<eos> And now is to sound the moment That moloch has grown to his full glory, To call his servants to his side.<eos> It's nice to see that you've taken up an instrument.<eos> Perhaps after dinner tonight, we can have a recital.<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.
There's always a way to expedite things.<eos> You'll find that I can be very persuasive.<eos> What else have you heard about me?<eos> Only that my wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
I guess we are kind of similar.<eos> We're very loyal to the people that we actually care about.<eos> You're my son.<eos> And we'll see each other again.<eos> We will.
I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> There are gonna be consequences, obviously, but if you choose to live, man, there's... you can make something out of that life.<eos> What if I don't?<eos> Don't you do that.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be beneficial for you to dissmis your men and join forces with army.<eos> - Father!<eos> - What is he doing with his sword out?<eos> I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!<eos> Of course they will!

Finn, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Clarke, I need to do this.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
They were screaming for me.<eos> You were only a child.<eos> After that day, I swore that I would never love anyone ever again.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
Why do you need this anyway?<eos> Well, I could take over Fedotov's position.<eos> You'd need to be buddies with everyone, and to them you're just some student.<eos> They'll say you're trying to be smart.<eos> They certainly will.
So I had the same jeweler in Berkeley make one up and send it out to the office.<eos> It's hidden in my garage right now.<eos> I'm gonna give it to her when I get back next week.<eos> I hope we sell the Giant.<eos> We will.
Van, but it's in a parking lot.<eos> What are we gonna do with Chuckie?<eos> I have to take him back to the hospital to see his mom and Frank.<eos> We're not all gonna fit.<eos> Sure we will.

I was reminded of what being married could be like, and I realized I owe you an apology.<eos> I was unfeeling to you earlier because I was afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of what might happen if Francis finds out.<eos> He won't.
Uh, Sampson, we need your login info to access the Phoenician Exchange Web site.<eos> Already have a Tor browser installed.<eos> Said I'm up for anything, but that-- that's bad for business.<eos> It could trace back to me.<eos> It won't.
Otherwise, I've got work to do.<eos> That was quick.<eos> Yeah, I left my cell.<eos> You manage to get an answer out of carver On the combustible boat?<eos> No, not yet, but I will.
Well, just the other day I was saying to my husband...<eos> Oh, did I say husband?<eos> I meant, father.<eos> I don't have a husband.<eos> Perhaps I will someday.
Oh, the military taught me that you can't make the right decision without seeing the situation up close. Thank you.<eos> I am surprised that you're letting this one get away, Victor.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> Of course the opposition's gonna try and put you through the ringer, but don't you worry-- it's just a show. I have your records.<eos> I'll...
I wanted you to leave.<eos> You chose to stay. So your priorities, they seem pretty clear to me.<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> - Hey, wait a minute if they charge you with something, they're gonna go through your records, and they are going to realize that you're not a member of the bar.<eos> No, they won't.
No, I won't do it.<eos> I won't do it, do you hear me?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I won't make your weapon.<eos> I won't.

Um, let me just say as I've said to Rusty how... [Sighs] Sorry I am to have, uh, left my little boy on his own and, uh, for you all to take care of.<eos> And I wish I had behaved better, and I hope that I...<eos> I hope that you all will let me prove that to you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course we will.

Now, then, our zoo. It's all about the animals, of course.<eos> Um... It's about protecting them and it's about caring for them.<eos> Some of these slides are aspirations.<eos> We don't have a lion or an elephant. Not yet.<eos> But we will.
I never realised how much Mew did about the place.<eos> She's got the right idea, you know. Striking out.<eos> There's little point in sinking more blood and sweat into this place if we're only going to end up handing it over to somebody else.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Of course it will.

My dad died less than ten years after his diagnosis.<eos> There was so many things he never got a chance to do.<eos> He didn't even have a bucket list.<eos> Lance, have you taken the blood test to check for the genetic mutation?<eos> No. And I won't.

I share news of danger with him alone. I disclose to the Khan.<eos> It is for the Khan to report to the Prince. That is the order of things.<eos> You want to know about Eagle's Teaching, ask Father, brother.<eos> If you know something... the burden is on you to defend him.<eos> And I will... with my life.
All right, I'll call her, and I'll see what's going on.<eos> [Ringing] Kiley: Hello?<eos> Please tell me you're on your way to pick up Micah.<eos> I can't lose him, Gunnar.<eos> And you won't.
We've lived in a state of perpetual war, surrounded by enemies.<eos> We were born fighting.<eos> That may be.<eos> But make a mistake with that, you won't even have time to know you made a mistake.<eos> No one in 100 kilometers will.
Ethan.<eos> Mr. Jackson gave us building schematics, access codes; everything you need.<eos> I uploaded your neural net. Okay?<eos> Since you're not in the system, you'll need to manually enter the codes on the keypads as you go.<eos> No, I won't.
Natasha's at your apartment? Okay. She's wanted by the FBI.<eos> Your apology was sounding a lot better a few seconds ago.<eos> She's a fugitive.<eos> What are you gonna do if she gets discovered?<eos> She won't.
Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
What?<eos> I still have it.<eos> We promised we were going to do something.<eos> Yes.<eos> And we will, sonya.
Not this time.<eos> So you're ending the date?<eos> No.<eos> But you're never gonna do anything for us like this again?<eos> No, I probably will.
Oh, uh, by the way, your wife, she barely touched her food, and, uh, what with that and the slight tremor, my guess is Adderall.<eos> You might want to look into that. Come on.<eos> - Well, so much for avoiding the big blowout. - Had to be done.<eos> God, I hope I don't blow this.<eos> You won't.

Horsies!<eos> Stop! I want to pet the horsie!<eos> Uh, we can't stop now, honey, but on the way back we can.<eos> But I want to pet the horsie!<eos> You will.
And you wake up the next day and you start living the rest of your life. Except no one's hanging you. No one's shoving a bayonet up your ass.<eos> The crowd isn't calling for your head.<eos> You just go away. You-you move your money to Switzerland or wherever guys like you move your money. Buy your own goddamn island, and you're still one of the richest men in the world.<eos> But here's the thing. I don't think you're gonna lose.<eos> - I won't?
We don't sell to kids, ever.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Oh, how principled of you.<eos> Well, if you want to go, just... just go.<eos> Yeah, I will.
He couldn't find out what he was carrying, but found out where it came from.<eos> He says it's sourced from a place no one will go.<eos> He says it's sourced from hell.<eos> A place so doomed even the Elites Zealots won't go there.<eos> So they but it from someone who will.
You can go.<eos> Got no place I got to Be.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What if I change my mind?<eos> You won't.
I'll fix it. - Alex! - It was my decision.<eos> I will...<eos> I will call my dad.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yeah. I will.
Expedite the time table just in case.<eos> Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.<eos> Honestly, how hard is it to knock?<eos> And if these people come back?<eos> They won't.
That's a good question.<eos> I'll have to ask her sometime.<eos> Unless you were a favor, somebody owes somebody something, you're the lou.<eos> Why don't you ask Beth yourself?<eos> I will.
Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
How the heck can he be?<eos> Buy yourself a nice funeral, your dirty pussy.<eos> Is it available here, ladies?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - That all men will:
Why you being so quiet?"<eos> So ask.<eos> I'm afraid she'll make me.<eos> You're ex-CIA.<eos> She won't.
Yes. I need to go slow.<eos> I don't want it to break and leave any in you.<eos> Okay, that's fine.<eos> Take your time, but just get it out.<eos> I will.
I'm just trying to give you a little context for this town, Detective.<eos> There are feuds out here that have been going on for almost a century.<eos> Between the Hodges and the Lockharts?<eos> Do yourself a favor. Read my book.<eos> Okay, I will.
They all think they're about to be rich.<eos> They've been making plans.<eos> When they find out...<eos> - Whey're not going to find out.<eos> - Of course they will.
If there's one thing I'm good at, it's surviving.<eos> Don't worry, dearie.<eos> It's only me.<eos> Sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted.<eos> They will.
You will end up at the bottom of a hole.<eos> Or worse.<eos> (sighs heavily) We've got to push back our departure.<eos> - No. - Just until things cool off.<eos> They won't.
You're using her.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It were making her ill.<eos> She won't want to come back.<eos> She will.
Stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Just... whatever you do, don't get all sensitive and tell Helen to make yourself feel better.<eos> That will help no one.<eos> I won't.
If they want to break relations with us, I say good riddance.<eos> A career official in the Foreign Ministry, Tasneem Qureishi has emerged in the last few days as a leading...<eos> Hey. You're gonna drive yourself crazy.<eos> I wish it would just happen already.<eos> Maybe it never will.
- What?<eos> If you don't want me to go on this trip,<eos> - just tell me.<eos> - Don't go.<eos> Okay. I won't.
- No, I don't lie, but there are things I don't say.<eos> I've allowed this folly to go on because...<eos> I don't know, really, because it was a nice idea.<eos> And I would have liked to come in with you, I would have...<eos> - But you won't.
I thought it was Taylor.<eos> -And where were you at noon today?<eos> -At work, till one.<eos> -Phone and check.<eos> -I will.
I think I'd rather dig.<eos> He knew about the tooth.<eos> We've no choice.<eos> And who goes to DCS Drayton to get authorisation to bring a convicted serial killer out for the day?<eos> I will.
And I saw the look on my mom's face after we met my lawyers for the last time.<eos> We've already lost.<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> But, hey, what if Ali leaves the dance early?<eos> She won't.
Which is exactly what you said he'd want.<eos> No one wants that.<eos> He made me promise.<eos> If it comes to that. - Yep.<eos> - Which it won't.
I don't care about you or the rest of humanity.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You bit me.<eos> I ought to shoot you right now.<eos> But you won't.
We're fine here.<eos> Mom...<eos> Do not say anything more to Henry about Roz.<eos> Please.<eos> I won't.
While I'm stuck in here, is there any way you'd consider house-sitting for me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Got you covered.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> I will.
~ (Squeals) ~ Not on me shirt! Get off!<eos> Come back!<eos> ~ I can't do this. ~ What are you talking about?<eos> ~ What if I mess up again?<eos> ~ You won't.
He wanted some driving doing last minute, so I just lied.<eos> Saying I'd been in hospital? It was the first thing that came into my head, sorry.<eos> Vince, he was clearly checking up on you.<eos> What if he sacks you?<eos> He won't.
Now, I made a promise to that little boy, a promise I intend to keep.<eos> You should know better than anyone that we don't make promises here.<eos> We're just gonna hang out here for a minute before they're ready for you in the O.R.<eos> Will you take a picture of my guts when I'm opened up?<eos> I will not.
- From now on, you are going to do everything she says, and beg her for your old job back.<eos> I hate you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I can't spend another night in this stump dump.<eos> We've gotta get our place back.<eos> We will, Malloy.
And, looking back, maybe none of this would have ever happened.<eos> Look, a horrible thing was done to you.<eos> But how is killing two more people going to fix that?<eos> How is that gonna heal you?<eos> It won't.
You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the dark one, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
I need answers, Bobby. [Stammers, gasps] [Camera shutter clicking]<eos> Hey, Jake, it's me.<eos> Sorry I haven't had time to talk, but I was thinking, my place for dinner tonight?<eos> I'll cook.<eos> Okay, I won't.
What you're doing here, now, this is the Christopher Herrmann School of Firefighting, learned from a lifetime on the job.<eos> I appreciate that, and I will do whatever you say, Herrmann.<eos> All I'm asking is that when we're on calls, you let me do my job.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Is there anything else you want to tell me? Is that everything now?<eos> No, that's it. It's just...<eos> CLINKING Can I call you again?<eos> You had better.<eos> OK, I will.
The investigation of Conrad's murder was heating up.<eos> I had to lead them away from you.<eos> By handing them my knife?<eos> If they link that to me...<eos> They won't.
But they'll crucify him.<eos> Cary, they're crucifying you.<eos> Look, you have to tell them that you were under orders.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then I will.
Are you kidding me?<eos> He wears it constantly.<eos> He tried to arrest the neighbors the other day.<eos> Tell him I'll give him a call when I'm in a fix.<eos> I will, I will.
How are we to know that this is in fact the defendant's husband?<eos> - Ask his wife.<eos> - The defense has no further questions.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Detective, if you will.
She was being attacked.<eos> The woman had it out for her, Meredith.<eos> If anything goes wrong, she'll go blaming her because she was an addict.<eos> You're gonna go talk to Owen, right, and clear this up?<eos> Yes, I will.
- Why don't you leave that with me?<eos> - No, I've got it.<eos> Alicia, leave it with me.<eos> - Don't let him get in your head.<eos> - He won't.
- She's just seven years old.<eos> - You're doing the right thing.<eos> No child deserves to be treated like that.<eos> I just want it to stop.<eos> And it will.
And yet you seemed right at home.<eos> I guess once a thief, always a thief.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> So, have you thought of a plan when they discover her remains are missing?<eos> They won't.
This is gonna be a great wedding.<eos> As you ready her for...<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't do this!<eos> I won't!
Thank you for making this creepy.<eos> Now find the other parts.<eos> Is it gonna hit me?<eos> It shouldn't.<eos> It won't.
I could ask Herrmann to close out for me.<eos> All right.<eos> Well...<eos> let me know.<eos> Yeah, I will...
I know.<eos> That's why I'm taking her to a thinny, an open one.<eos> A what?<eos> You can't let her through a thinny...<eos> I won't.
But what?<eos> You want to see me on TV again?<eos> How could you burden me with your last breaths?<eos> I'll be an actress, a real one.<eos> Not because of your will.
I need information on the men that carried out this attack.<eos> - Do you know where they are?<eos> - If I talk to you, they'll know.<eos> - They'll kill me.<eos> - MARY: No, they won't.
I believe that we should lead separate lives.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That we will continue to work together as king and queen, but that I will be your wife in name only.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in. Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
- You think that I've...<eos> - Martin! At least I'm legal.<eos> Yes, I value our friendship too much to complicate it.<eos> Do you plan to maintain your relationship with Jess?<eos> Yeah, of course he will.
Nobody's innocent.<eos> And we can't leave anybody able to talk.<eos> Don't go soft on me, kid.<eos> Don't leave anybody breathing.<eos> I won't.
He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the Dark One, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
Whatever haunts Broken Tooth, I know it kills Turks.<eos> You returned.<eos> No one has ever returned.<eos> It seems no one has ever had the privilege of leaving, either.<eos> Neither will you.
Spread out!<eos> Stay still!<eos> How romantic.<eos> - I'm going to have to talk to his commanding officer.<eos> -No, you won't.
Even if Bobby was coming with the money... you'd still kill us both.<eos> But he's not coming.<eos> He will be here.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.<eos> It took some tinkering.<eos> But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"<eos> Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.<eos> And now, neither will I.
To make people think they left some mark on the world.<eos> Because otherwise, nobody would ever know.<eos> I never want to end up on that wall.<eos> Have no fear.<eos> You never will.
And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep.<eos> And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend.<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
For Goddard, yes.<eos> Wyatt gave him the best years of his life.<eos> Jock lost his son Dylan to a drug overdose.<eos> So, if you talk about losing your mother...<eos> No, I won't.
You're not even in the same league with me.<eos> Just wait, hotshot. I'm going to scare circles around you this year.<eos> Okay. I'd like to see that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
I don't know. Honey, you got another bruise here.<eos> Does that hurt?<eos> That's weird.<eos> I don't know. Will you do me a favor, go see a doctor for that?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.<eos> That's exactly why I am going.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you walk into this alone?<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
- Yeah, well, that's what he does.<eos> Season's greetings from Canada.<eos> Did you say "please" at least?<eos> You know, if they call the cops, we're done.<eos> Oh, he won't.
She loved me.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her.<eos> And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
We know the truth.<eos> You poisoned the king! Guards!<eos> Get them under control.<eos> The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!<eos> We will not! Silence!
I do not think the light is daylight yet.<eos> I am content if you would have it so.<eos> I have more heart to stay than will to go.<eos> Come, death, and welcome.<eos> Juliet wills it so.
- It's gonna be real.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> I'm not believing you brought this boy to the bar.<eos> We're going to the movies.<eos> We will.
Fuck!<eos> That door is reinforced steel. They can't get through.<eos> They have power tools. They have high explosives! They can get out!<eos> If they drill the door the decompression'll kill them.<eos> - It won't.
What's Kate gonna tell the kids? Shh.<eos> I can't... I can't remember what they look like.<eos> You tell them I was thinking about them.<eos> Do that for me? I will.<eos> Of course. Of course I will.
No, no way.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> I can't even pay the rent.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> And yes, you will.
To take a gentleman on the river.<eos> However, Mr. Graham proved to be no gentleman at all.<eos> See, I feared he'd bring embarrassment to you and your lovely family, boasting as it were over his intentions towards your daughter.<eos> I... I... I resolutely refused to take a cent of your money, sir.<eos> Please, if you will...
You have exposed this office and the university to a completely undeserved scandal.<eos> If word of this were ever to get out, the damage would be irreparable.<eos> Well, I won't tell anyone.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
Like the sun.<eos> Pauline does that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't let her get away.<eos> I won't.
Yeah.<eos> Don't let her get away.<eos> I won't.<eos> Don't let her run away.<eos> I won't.
Oh, Billy!<eos> You were fantastic, my friend.<eos> I'm happy for you. I'm going to miss you.<eos> You say it as though we're never going to meet again.<eos> Of course we will.
Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
Not me.<eos> If I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.<eos> How do you know you will make money here?<eos> You haven't yet.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
You are my sun and my moon.<eos> My earth and my stars.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Marry you?<eos> Oh, my God, of course I will.
- There it is.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - In all its glory.<eos> Chester, look, I can't do this.<eos> Oh, okay. I will.
I won't let you do it!<eos> Dad?<eos> Because you have to do it.<eos> Be a man for once and fleam this wretched creature.<eos> I won't.
Boy, Bender, you sure were chock full of parts.<eos> I didn't even know you had a wishbone.<eos> I had a lot of magic things.<eos> And we'll never get them all back.<eos> Oh, sure we will.
Why?<eos> And how?<eos> How he did it, I know.<eos> But why, haven't figured out yet.<eos> I will.
What am I going to do?<eos> You know what you need to do.<eos> Oh. Stan, no.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will not.
What'd you say we let the Mama take a look?<eos> I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised... She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.
Which means I can sell her baby to either side.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm going to lose a chance to breed a Succubus.<eos> No...!<eos> - I would rather die.<eos> - You will.
No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
You know, it's really reassuring to know that my sister won't be alone out there.<eos> I'm only meeting up with her four or five times.<eos> Two or three times. Two or three.<eos> No, I don't want a gun.<eos> But you will.
Just fucking forget it. Forget everything.<eos> There's cameras at every door, okay?<eos> So why am I even talking? I'm not even... I'm not...<eos> Cops won't expect it.<eos> Nobody will.
I quit.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This ever happens again...<eos> It won't.
Right?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> You make beautiful things.<eos> - But nobody wants them.<eos> They will again. Some day.
Speech.<eos> Here's to the rock beneath us that shores up this house, and... to everything in life that may seem improbable, but is not impossible.<eos> I'll drink to that. I love the Calder on you.<eos> You should have kept it.<eos> Perhaps I will.
She's in a self-imposed media blackout until opening.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I just want to focus on giving the best performance I can.<eos> All you have to do is make it till tomorrow night.<eos> And I will.
Well, apparently I can, and you should find a way out as well.<eos> Hey, I'm not like you.<eos> This is my big break.<eos> It may never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
Okay. I'll be right back.<eos> What a jackass.<eos> Adam was right.<eos> [Sighs] I just don't want the show to get screwed up just because I broke up with him.<eos> It won't.
She got a boyfriend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you go ask her yourself.<eos> 'Cause she won't talk to me.<eos> Of course she won't.
You make it every time.<eos> He's done the coin thing, has he?<eos> You're the map maker.<eos> I thought you needed rescuing?<eos> - I will.
You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
She'll be cheered by the visit, I'm sure.<eos> Emily?<eos> What on earth is going on?<eos> Mrs Reid.<eos> I'll, er...
He is happier than even we are. With our boat and... These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of King Aelle, and King Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will. If the gods will it.
She will die.<eos> She will surprise the shit out of you.<eos> And you know, you'd think I'd get tired of watching, but...<eos> I never do.<eos> And I never will.
- What?<eos> - We do it quick, they'll never know what hit them.<eos> - No. Whoa, whoa.<eos> - We're out here to bury Donna.<eos> And we will, after.
But... we have a home, a good home.<eos> Away from the city to a new land... for our children.<eos> But you have no children.<eos> You can never have children.<eos> But we will.
There's so much more I could talk about...<eos> Philosophy, poetry, music, nanotechnology.<eos> I'd watch that show.<eos> I could do that show.<eos> But you won't.
Yeah, I've been looking into it.<eos> Did you know that... if you take every single person killed in a terrorist act around the world in the last 20 years and you add to that all the lives lost in the Middle East since 1967, the Six Day War, and you add to that every single American life lost in Vietnam, in Korea, and in every single American engagement since then...<eos> Iraq, Afghanistan... if you take all those lives and you multiply it by two, that's the number of children that die of malaria every single year.<eos> So are you saying you'll help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
♪ oh, girls, they...<eos> ♪ those girls, they... Who you thought you might be...<eos> Nobody saw you, right?<eos> 'cause if your dad found out...<eos> He won't.
It's not much.<eos> But it's the least I can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stay away from Bill.<eos> I will.
What? Uh, Shawn, I thought that you said we were going to the Le Cirque show.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is a dress rehearsal.<eos> Yes, but we promised Max that he would be seeing the show.<eos> And he will. Just without all the unnecessary excitement and entertainment.
What do you mean...?<eos> Listen.<eos> We all die.<eos> I will die.<eos> Someday you will too.
If you betray him, there is not a place in this world that his freaky little minions will not find you!<eos> Or you.<eos> Finish the job, Tamsin.<eos> Deliver the Succubus.<eos> Or I will.
How's that gonna get your mum out of debt?<eos> You're just lining his pockets, you know, Swifty.<eos> He's using you.<eos> We won't be able to move this.<eos> - Course we will.
Uh, there are multiple roosters, so it would be "cocks."<eos> - I'll drive.<eos> - No, you will not.<eos> - No!<eos> - No, you will not.
Mm.<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah. You-- you mustn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no.<eos> I won't.
Oh!<eos> Ah. You-- you mustn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
Just- - I miss it. I miss it so, so much and the missing makes me sad.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Really?<eos> You will?
I'll have it this afternoon.<eos> I'll make sure she's here.<eos> Richard... Yeah, I know.<eos> I know, and I won't.<eos> I won't.
Say yes!<eos> Bloody rascal! If you want to go, you go alone! Why are you asking her to come?<eos> I'll beat you. You ruined my mother's life for your drinks. Yes, I did ruin her life.<eos> You suspected my birth too. Are you planning to ruin her life too?<eos> Yes, I will!
No, I wanna be here when he does.<eos> You know what the doctor said.<eos> When Pa wakes up, if he wakes up...<eos> Stop it, Rosalie!<eos> Of course he will.
We're organizing an exhibition.<eos> If you would come, I would be thankful.<eos> I don't think I will have time.<eos> Well, you're obviously not interested in learning about your own culture.<eos> Maybe I will.
I was gone for 30 seconds.<eos> You know, I never asked you, but did you make that deal?<eos> Did you get that contract, Scott?<eos> You keep trying to forgive yourself.<eos> I never will.
And I lost everything.<eos> But his sacrifice won't be forgotten.<eos> Killing people isn't going to bring your husband back.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
You have to move out before anything happens.<eos> Hubby, I gotta go.<eos> No...<eos> Listen, you have to move out.<eos> We won't.
You may still catch your quarry single-handed.<eos> There, now you're a soldier.<eos> I am no soldier.<eos> Will he find you running away?<eos> He will not, sir.
We've been together for 30 years.<eos> My husband is a part of me.<eos> I can't separate myself from him no more than I can cut off an arm or a leg.<eos> I just want him to stop.<eos> He won't, not on his own.
Worst decision that you'll ever make.<eos> She says she'll be happy.<eos> Right now she doesn't need to be happy.<eos> She needs to stop using.<eos> And she will.
Learn from my mistakes, Carrie Bradshaw.<eos> Never let a man...<eos> Any man...<eos> Make your decisions.<eos> I won't.
He's more interesting.<eos> I just wish I could have found morrissey.<eos> I know I'll never see him again.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you will.
I love you, too!<eos> - I'll call you as soon as I can. - Okay. Okay?<eos> Please send that check immediately.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- Good.<eos> Well, you sleep tight, all right?<eos> - I'll see you when you wake up.<eos> - Okay. But... Will I see you?<eos> Of course you will.
It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous.<eos> Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
Here, some food.<eos> I don't want any. You have to eat.<eos> After we make the ransom video, your father will pay, then you can go home.<eos> He isn't going to pay anything for me.<eos> He will.
Yeah.<eos> Usually my favorite part about dinner is dessert, and my favorite dessert is pudding, and my favorite pudding flavor is chocolate, but my absolute favorite part of chocolate pudding is the skin, and tonight's pudding was skinless.<eos> But don't tell our mom.<eos> I don't want to hurt her feelings.<eos> It won't.
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
Jude, please...<eos> No, you get away!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> I won't go back in that hole!<eos> I will not!
I will not!<eos> - You can't make me!<eos> - Thomas!<eos> Get your sister and go outside.<eos> I will not!
But Gerri's taken Amy to her home, to Cachtice Castle.<eos> I think she's gonna kill her!<eos> I wish I could help, kid.<eos> - You can!<eos> - But I won't.
He can't come into our lives and disrupt them like this.<eos> He can't talk to us the way he does.<eos> And he can't hurt you.<eos> I will not stand for it.<eos> I won't.
I saw your face when that child was born.<eos> You were distraught, Nurse Lee, as every midwife has been before you.<eos> God help us, we're only human.<eos> But your guilt will not help the mother to bond.<eos> What will?
Selena, you need to get in your uniform right now.<eos> Well, out of all the spas in all the world, You guys got to walk into mine.<eos> And for good reason.<eos> The money from the stolen wire still hasn't turned up.<eos> Maybe it never will.
(chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine. I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
Can be.<eos> "Foreign Accent Syndrome"?<eos> No, man, that's not a thing.<eos> It's hard to believe, I know, but you can look it up.<eos> Oh, I will.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So Steve Owen said that Skylar wasn't just interested in Tommy, she was practically stalking him.<eos> Right. So he was trying to get her to back off.<eos> She won't.
Old Donald Trump.<eos> Dad...<eos> I'm getting married in six weeks and you promised.<eos> You promised that when I walk down that aisle, I'll be holding on to your arm.<eos> And you will.
- They're coming in.<eos> We're just the beginning of what's coming.<eos> You tell them, babe.<eos> You'll never be able to stop it now.<eos> Nobody will.
Your contribution won't go unnoticed, Vera.<eos> You will be reinstated as deputy.<eos> You're going to make a career change. Do I make myself clear?<eos> - What if it gets out?<eos> - It won't.
You're late.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> This is the first and last time, Jacs.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, you will.
Tell you what?<eos> What was so important that it required your immediate attention?<eos> - It was a mistake.<eos> - You pull something like that again...<eos> I won't.
The new quartermaster,<eos> Barbara L. Tottingham, will not buy us any more uni-balls.<eos> There's not one single uni-ball in this entire firm.<eos> - Please stop saying uni-ball.<eos> - No, I will not.
I love you.<eos> I love you, Sam.<eos> A lot of truth there.<eos> - But you didn't let him go.<eos> - No, I never will.
They call it the yaoguai.<eos> No man has been able to kill it, but we will.<eos> There's room on our wagon.<eos> Now who's gonna join us?<eos> Here. I will.
Look, it's not over, kid.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> Sit down and relax.<eos> You said you could fix this.<eos> And I will.
What about my father?<eos> Keep it together, Neal.<eos> You accuse me of corruption when, in fact, it was James Bennett who was the real stain on Metro PD -- a criminal posing as a cop.<eos> I'm sure you, of all people, can appreciate the irony.<eos> Oh, I will.
Ricki will never see her grandpa again.<eos> But you did good.<eos> You gave her your rabbit.<eos> She won't forget that, Abby.<eos> She won't.
- And you're the older sister.<eos> - as a dress shoe.<eos> She'll listen to you, Sarah.<eos> She doesn't listen to me.<eos> - Yes, she will.
Good-bye, brick.<eos> Hey, uh, who said anything about... about this ending?<eos> What do I care... about what people think?<eos> I'm an adult, and we are having an adult relationship, so if I want to do this...<eos> I damn well will!
You need to start right here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Steady.<eos> Promise me it will stop.<eos> It will.
Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't want that getting back to him either.<eos> He knows we trumped this up.<eos> Yep. And he can go right to Bello and tell him that the FBI knows more than they should.<eos> Yep. But he won't because...
Bug man on campus, huh?<eos> Yeah, the biggest. I don't think you got the cojones to go for it.<eos> Sure do.<eos> Cojones grande.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
I'm just trying to find out about Danny.<eos> He did a newspaper round for you, didn't he?<eos> Are you gonna leave nicely or do I have to ring the police?<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
I'm just going to work. I'll see you tonight.<eos> Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.
Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.<eos> Of course we will.
You got a boyfriend?<eos> I mean, I know it ain't this guy.<eos> Right?<eos> Anyway, maybe we'll go out for drinks tonight?<eos> Yeah, we will.
Kids made that for you.<eos> That thing in there is a donkey.<eos> Travis is big on donkeys these days.<eos> Tell him I love him.<eos> I will.
Hey.<eos> Any word on Deb?<eos> Yeah, Dr. Vogel says she's still day-to-day.<eos> Let her know I was thinking about her.<eos> I will.
I still do.<eos> That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me.<eos> I had no choice. You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.
What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
He has to compensate for all the other things he doesn't have.<eos> He's banging scared.<eos> If that's true, I'd be the best lay on the planet.<eos> I just don't want to lose her.<eos> Oh, you won't.
Amanda targeting the Director of the CIA?<eos> That's a little crazy, even for her.<eos> Amanda targeting our closest ally in the government-- it's not so crazy.<eos> We need to get those files.<eos> We will.
Oh, that's true.<eos> Well, as your manager, I insist you concentrate.<eos> Okay. Uh, excuse me.<eos> Riley made you her manager?<eos> Yes, she will.
I'm Jason Cole.<eos> Then I'll kill you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need a drug to do it.<eos> I will.
I'll have Karl sit on Stephen Doppler's hotel.<eos> I'll take Melissa Enfield.<eos> We'll be in radio contact the entire time.<eos> If Lorelei tries to go after one of them--<eos> She will.
So take a hard look, because this is your future.<eos> This is you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> He won't.
Cover up his role in holly's death.<eos> Congratulations, Joey.<eos> You helped him get away with murder.<eos> Now I'd beat your skinny little ass for being so stupid if it'd change anything.<eos> But it won't because, well...
Oh, get some sleep.<eos> This isn't all on your shoulders.<eos> It shouldn't be.<eos> It is right now. If I can't, you know, if I can't talk the nurses into staying...<eos> You will.
Hello!<eos> Ladies.<eos> So, what are you a doctor of... gorgeousity?<eos> Do get in touch if it's not eased off by the morning.<eos> Certainly will, ha-ha!
I hereby declare this Stabby Eye Day!<eos> Oh, Adam, I'm so sorry!<eos> Carol, I love you and I can't live without you.<eos> Please, never let this happen again.<eos> I won't, Adam.
We don't know where they dropped it.<eos> The ocean is big.<eos> What if I knew someone who specialized in just that sort of thing?<eos> I'd say I didn't know you if the wrong people found out.<eos> They won't.
Because don't, please, don't take this the wrong way, babe - but you're not getting any younger.<eos> - You said a rocket launcher?<eos> - I did. I did say a rocket launcher.<eos> - Then give this to whosits.<eos> - I will.
That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Wh-? Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
She's the evil one.<eos> They're her people, dearie.<eos> You're gonna have to be content with their fear.<eos> They'll never love you.<eos> Yes, they will.
Wait a sec.<eos> There's a lot of guys wanting to get out of relationships before Valentine's Day, right?<eos> That way, they can avoid spending all that money and taking things to the next level.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - I will.
It's a letter of recommendation.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I feel awful even asking.<eos> It's like I'm cheating on you, but the best Doctor Young could do is put me back in the temp pool until I get a new boss.<eos> And you will...
We better keep an eye on her.<eos> We're not going to hurt her or you.<eos> We just need to know what we need to know.<eos> Clients-- I talk about 'em, they come back and make sure I can't talk again.<eos> This one won't.
Really?<eos> I-I'm using a new lotion.<eos> Let me see.<eos> You will try anything, won't you?<eos> I will.
Oh, no communication there yet either, but believe me, I've got eyes and ears all over that one.<eos> If they make contact, I'll know.<eos> Whatever you do, you cannot let Padma know<eos> - that you're on to her.<eos> - I won't.
The agent who died because of you had a wife and a six-year-old son.<eos> And you think this is the justice that they were looking for?<eos> No, but it prevents others from needing to seek justice at all.<eos> This must end.<eos> It won't.
Hmm. I do not have time for that.<eos> I have two bondage parties tonight.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Get rid of it. Oh. How about you help me out to the car?<eos> No, I won't.
I just realized... You can't control everything... No matter how hard you try.<eos> Let's just say I made peace with that fact.<eos> Peace?<eos> You love Elena.<eos> You always will.
- Yeah, she is.<eos> My family got to Texas. They're, uh... waiting for me.<eos> Well, then, you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know... I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
I promise you, mother. We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
He needs to be locked up.<eos> You know, I say we call the FBI right this second.<eos> We're not gonna do that, Emma.<eos> But don't we have to move quickly?<eos> Yes, and... and we will, honey, we will.
Their competitors.<eos> I got all the other fast-food places in town to donate food.<eos> I know black tie and chicky tenders isn't the best mix,<eos> - but-- - No, Tom, I love it.<eos> And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens.
Look, given that you were held at gunpoint in this very room little over a week ago, I thought, perhaps, a test of your ability to defend yourself was in order.<eos> It was.<eos> You have much to learn about the art of self-preservation.<eos> Okay, if you ever do that again, I swear...<eos> You'll what?
What I'm telling you is that girl is in possession of a laptop that belongs to me.<eos> Now if you can return it intact, I'll see to it that your own ambitions are rewarded far beyond your current ability to imagine.<eos> Uh, Mr. Ryan, I will need assurances that she has neither the intention nor the ability to ever come after me again.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> She won't.
Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
!<eos> Well... ISIS has a certain reputation.<eos> Hey, whoa! Not cool, Payne Stewart!<eos> Oh, my God, if Malory ever hears about this -<eos> Which she won't!
We're consolidating resources.<eos> Jessica didn't approve the investigator?<eos> Jessica approved anything we want, for one case.<eos> What? No, we have to fight them all.<eos> And we will.
He just asked me for Mary of Burgundy but I said no.<eos> Imagine what would happen if we let him loose with Flanders!<eos> He is accusing me of murder, Edward!<eos> And if you're not going to do anything about it, then<eos> I most certainly will.
Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this. I...<eos> I don't want this.<eos> One day maybe your son will.
Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
Shall we get on?<eos> You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
Yeah, well, not everybody does the Reagan bidding.<eos> Really? That's all you have?<eos> Miss Reagan?<eos> You try taking my picture again, I will shove that camera...<eos> Hey, he won't.
She's so innocent.<eos> So pure.<eos> She's my little angel.<eos> You can't let anyone hurt my family, Ray.<eos> I won't.
We did not do anything, there is room for everyone.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> What does he want?<eos> I do not understand!<eos> This will.
Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
Kev's on his way over here now.<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> If he doesn't know you're following him, he'll lead you straight to 'em.<eos> What makes you think he'll lead me anywhere other than his mum's house?<eos> He won't. He won't.
Come on! You'll never screw up.<eos> But you are going to kill me?<eos> You cocksucker!<eos> Fuckit I won't.<eos> I won't.
I just keep thinking...<eos> What if somebody shoots henry?<eos> No one's gonna do that.<eos> - But they could.<eos> - But they won't.
Now you're just making up words.<eos> Look, you have to take them no matter what, all right?<eos> Or you'll lose the kidney.<eos> You can't miss a dose.<eos> She won't.
I gotta meet him, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I know, but you're never gonna meet him.<eos> But I really have to.<eos> Oh, that's different.<eos> You never will.
I need to, uh...<eos> I need to think.<eos> Well, think about this. One more dead body isn't gonna solve any of your problems, Harry.<eos> No?<eos> Maybe three more will.
Well, that may be true, but I don't believe in ruining people's lives to get it.<eos> Katherine, if my methods have caused you to waver in your support, then I want to apologize to you<eos> Listen, victory in this town without... without you by my side is just gonna mean so much less.<eos> So, I can do things differently.<eos> And I will.
- That's not what it's for.<eos> - Then, damn it, Uncle Bobby, you tell me what it's for!<eos> He killed your brother, my father!<eos> We cannot let him get away with this!<eos> And we won't.
Angie, at these temperatures, a human body would've been completely reduced to ash in three hours.<eos> So either the temperature of the fire wasn't that hot or it burned for a much shorter period of time.<eos> Yeah, about half the time.<eos> Listen, I'm not gonna be insulted if you run a simulation and check my math, but...<eos> Oh, I will.
"The Victorians thought it was Lake Victoria,<eos> "but today we know this huge body of water is fed by many rivers.<eos> "One of them is the true source, and even today, in 2012,<eos> "experts have not been able to determine which it is.<eos> "You will."
Baby.<eos> We'll call you when we get settled in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go heal my baby.<eos> I will.
Green simply won't be back at Downton again.<eos> Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham as to why he has a different valet?<eos> I suppose not.<eos> So you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit.<eos> And will he, m'lady?
I'm totally confused right now.<eos> Eric, relax.<eos> What did you find?<eos> You should probably read it.<eos> I will, I will;
So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with my mom.<eos> Tell her that I don't want to sit next to Uncle Rod at Thanksgiving this year.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Maybe his parents should have named him something that was a great idea, like "nuclear holocaust."<eos> Xander is dead.<eos> Why?<eos> That's not gonna help, Sonia.<eos> Nothing will.
Tomorrow morn, I'm headed to Virginia to bring Sara's mother to New York.<eos> Excuse my candid speech, Dr. Freeman, but I thought you were an educated man.<eos> A negro trying to break into the south in the middle of this war is madness.<eos> And I take no offense, Mrs. Morehouse, but I vowed that I'd bring my wife's mother home and that is what I intend to do.<eos> No, you will not.
Oh, um, I was bringing in some beef tips, but I don't think they're gonna taste that good raw, so we can do some pimento cheese sandwiches...<eos> How about Al's beef?<eos> Okay, all right. We'll do Al's beef.<eos> - Call it in.<eos> - I will.
You paid to have him nobbled, but it's my fault?<eos> He was a wreck.<eos> He forgot his bloody net.<eos> I thought he'd get over it.<eos> Maybe he will.
I've contacted the judge in that case.<eos> The conviction is under review.<eos> The matter will be resolved before Devereaux is sentenced in your case.<eos> Provided, of course, you get a conviction.<eos> I will.
She's learning how to do waxing and needed someone to practice on.<eos> I got a free haircut, too.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just ask.<eos> Oh, we will.
I am very clear on where the line is between you and me and what we do here.<eos> - It is for the work.<eos> - I don't need you to tell me that.<eos> So then whatever goes on between us can't affect Libby.<eos> It won't.
Maybe the handyman?<eos> I've never had any secrets from him.<eos> But now I have you.<eos> And I want to keep you to myself and at the same time, tell everyone.<eos> But you won't, right?
I know this great inn that you would love.<eos> And you can teach me how to make your abgoosht.<eos> I am so sorry that... I was too busy last weekend.<eos> You are gonna get through this, Arastoo.<eos> You Will.
Me and my boys beat you at "brain burst," you lay off of Allie.<eos> You and these guys are gonna beat me at "brain burst"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do I get if you lose?<eos> We won't.
- Do you still have feelings for her?<eos> - This isn't even about Katherine.<eos> This is about Jeremy.<eos> What, you think that killing her will take all that pain away?<eos> It won't.
- The marriage wasn't consummated?<eos> -Nothing happened. Nothing happened?<eos> Nothing at all? But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> - And it will.
Why not what?<eos> Some of us are going on to the Embassy later.<eos> Oh, what fun.<eos> Oh, well, you can come, if you'd like.<eos> I will.
Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
I'll er... send a letter to myself tonight and tell Marjie it's about an old friend of mine who's died and asked for me to take the child.<eos> She won't question it.<eos> Then nobody but you and I will know.<eos> Mr Drewe, would you do that for me?<eos> For you and the little girl, My Lady, yes, I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
I love you.<eos> Yes?<eos> Pick me up in an hour.<eos> - What if he wakes up?<eos> - He won't.
What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
Why don't you ever listen to your mother?<eos> You can at least do this one last thing!<eos> Mikasa!<eos> No... No!<eos> all three of us will...
What the hell's going on here, Byrne?<eos> You work the count room in the Savoy, correct?<eos> I'm here to offer you a deal.<eos> If you agree to testify to how their count room skim operates, the state of Nevada is gonna drop all the charges against you.<eos> - Like hell it will.
Fired...<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> Absolutely fired.<eos> But you need to know what will happen if you ever decide to talk.<eos> I won't.
Great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> I love the Jedi mind trick on Danny boy.<eos> But it'll all be for bubkes if I can't break the Falcon.<eos> You will.
Aren't you?<eos> We can't defend ourselves until we feel safe in our own skin.<eos> Do you... Feel safe in your own skin?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
Unless you got a problem with that.<eos> Almost got it.<eos> What if Grace is right?<eos> What if we end the world?<eos> We won't, Aaron.
If this goes bad, I'm worried about what it'll do to Nikita.<eos> Make her understand that her family, the one that she's built, is there for her.<eos> She started this journey by herself.<eos> I need to know she will not end it alone.<eos> She won't.
What are you doing?<eos> Explanation of social processes, communication, conflicts, decision-making, cooperation...<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I don't remember any of that.<eos> At your age, I probably won't either.
It's our first Victoria Day. You should have the day off.<eos> Well, the constabulary never rests, Dr. Grace.<eos> Particularly on official holidays.<eos> Uh, I'm free to escort you if you'd like.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, you won't.
I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
Hey, this was not my idea.<eos> Unattended minors can get into trouble, and I think you'd be interested in the girl that your foster son is about to ask out on a date.<eos> Oh, he's not going to do that.<eos> I bet...<eos> One month of absolute civility that he will.
You gonna watch her die, son?<eos> I think you're out of moves.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> You didn't want anybody to see what was on there anyway, right?<eos> Now nobody ever will.
I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
I'm sure Mrs. Johnson can provide a stamped envelope.<eos> Tell her to remove the pins from her hair.<eos> They'll interfere with the leads from the electroencephalogram.<eos> Which, actually, we won't be using tonight.<eos> Actually, we will.
Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.
- A pitching machine, Your Honor.<eos> I also have an affidavit from the maker stating it's been properly calibrated for its consistency.<eos> If you turn this courtroom into a batting cage, Mr. Bash, I'll run you.<eos> Your Honor, a little leeway.<eos> We won't.
Abuse...<eos> The blue medicine.<eos> It's time for you to forget.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Methadone would make it easier.<eos> Has to be cold turkey.<eos> Where he's going, we need him functional.<eos> Even if it kills him?<eos> It won't.
Not the third.<eos> She was a shot of life.<eos> And for what it's worth, I was noticing, there's actually plenty of room in here.<eos> Oh, my God! Kick them out already! I will.<eos> I-I will.
We're gonna save him, I promise.<eos> The DNA was a perfect match.<eos> You handled yourself well.<eos> What happens when I refuse to cooperate?<eos> You won't.
You wasted a valuable asset.<eos> We can't see this through as designed without Peller in place.<eos> We have the Stuxworm.<eos> We can improvise.<eos> Oh, I will.
She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.
You'll be with me? The entire time.<eos> Dr. Bates, will you please read these words?<eos> Now, Betty, close your eyes.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will not.
I'll see what I can do...<eos> But ultimately, it's up to you.<eos> I can't make people trust you, Lenny.<eos> You have to earn that.<eos> I will.
They won't even notice.<eos> All I need is his pin. Or hers.<eos> They'll think it's online fraud or hackers.<eos> But what if they found out?<eos> They won't.
Don't doubt yourself.<eos> We don't get to anymore.<eos> Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.<eos> - We need to do something.<eos> - We will.
After what he did to our family?<eos> I know killing's wrong, that's all.<eos> We take him to a hospital, he turns Bunch in for shooting him.<eos> Maybe he won't.<eos> Oh, he will.
Good.<eos> Now tell us what you see.<eos> Tell us everything.<eos> But I can't control it.<eos> Neither of us will.
Oh, nonsense, sweetheart.<eos> Carter, let me tell you a little story about a friend of mine who got so busy at work, he took his eye off his lovely daughter.<eos> And she ended up dating a bartender!<eos> I bet he never let that happen again.<eos> No, he won't.
It really fucked up Terry and it really fucked up me.<eos> How does Ray feel about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you fucking ask him?<eos> All right, I will.
No, but I think it helps.<eos> Maybe you just don't want to move to Arizona.<eos> You were gonna let your mom take the fall, weren't you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> She most likely will anyway.
Please...'<eos> You can trust me. I'm a doctor.<eos> No!<eos> You'll let them in!<eos> 'We won't.'
Yes, we do. Jack, I read every police report on everyone who died in that fire.<eos> There was a kid, he had trials for West Ham the next day.<eos> His whole life, just starting to take shape.<eos> Granger needs to know what he's done. He needs to pay for it.<eos> He will.
Honey, it's only fair.<eos> We had Daphne for weeks.<eos> She's still here and Regina's back.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in with Regina for good?<eos> She won't.
You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
What do we do?<eos> - We fix it.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we will.
Did Jerry video me having sex with that guy like he did the others?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you gonna watch that video?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Thank you.<eos> And why's she playing G.I. Joe?<eos> No clue.<eos> Why don't you ask her when we find her?<eos> Oh, I will.
Fire!<eos> Fife-Eagle Cop,<eos> You're dying.<eos> All I ever wanted was to have a place in history.<eos> You will.
Hey!<eos> Tell me where Elijah is.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Tell me where he is, or I will kill you!<eos> No, you won't.
I am not getting better.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> No.<eos> No. I never will.
Well, you're not doing a very good job.<eos> The prime suspect is out there poisoning other students.<eos> What are you gonna do about him?<eos> John, can you just look into what might've happened with those files, please?<eos> Okay, I'll...
They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.
What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.<eos> I mean, it'll be weird,<eos> - but she'll understand.<eos> - No no, she won't!
Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
It's not going to change.<eos> There's got to be a way.<eos> The girls have never lived this long before.<eos> I don't think I can take losing them again.<eos> We won't.
- They'll release him?<eos> - No. I tried.<eos> There are protocols in place.<eos> No, they need to release him.<eos> They won't.
No, nothing.<eos> What if the penalty for this devotion of his was death?<eos> If we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execution?<eos> Don't be ridiculous. He'll just stop praying.<eos> No, he won't.
That's all that matters.<eos> This is the real thing?<eos> You know your forgeries.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
She isn't gonna stop with the peasants.<eos> She's going to come after the people who are closest to me.<eos> I will stand by your side no matter what.<eos> Even if it means our death.<eos> Which it probably will.
It's time to let go of old grudges.<eos> He's made mistakes, but he's our only chance.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
Hey, what schools are you applying to?<eos> Don't even try it, Walt.<eos> It's not gonna happen!<eos> God, I hope she doesn't out me.<eos> She won't.
No, you can't start thinking like that.<eos> We already have four dead.<eos> If that hospital goes, we're talking a lot more than that.<eos> But what if Duke killing you. Doesn't cure Aiden's Trouble?<eos> Of course it will.
Get over here.<eos> Open the register.<eos> No! Please!<eos> I won't talk. I won't talk.<eos> No, you won't.
After this, you and me... we will still be okay.<eos> No, I was with you when your brother died, after your brother died, everything that you went through.<eos> Look... - no.<eos> No... we were supposed to have our flavored-coffee commercial tomorrow with all of this stuff behind us... William, that stupid door.<eos> We still will.
You know what they'll do.<eos> We've broken every rule there is.<eos> Yeah, but we've had so much fun doing it.<eos> Mara, they'll take you from me.<eos> No, they won't.
I've been there.<eos> You're coming to the lighthouse.<eos> No.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't!
Yes, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> Tidy up.<eos> Don't let it happen again.<eos> It won't.
Good luck, Cyrus.<eos> I won't leave you!<eos> There's no time to argue.<eos> When Jafar learns you witnessed my escape without alerting the guards, he will kill you.<eos> No. He won't.
Be direct and explain to Walt that this interview's really important.<eos> No.<eos> What I have to do is figure out how to be in two places at once.<eos> You're never gonna pull this off.<eos> Sure I will.
Ah.<eos> Sorry, Castle.<eos> If Gates were to find out...<eos> Yeah.<eos> She won't!
Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun Until she tried to strangle me with her stocking. I'll get a warrant.<eos> You'll have it by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk, and even if she did, What would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know seth's location.<eos> She won't.
This is bad, Jackie.<eos> We got a very, very busy week ahead of us.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to finish that conversation.<eos> We will.
- Really sure.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Nobody saw you, right?<eos> - 'Cause if your dad found out...<eos> - He won't.
Irish will die before they get caught.<eos> Aye. And if this shit goes sideways, they're gonna blast a very bloody way out.<eos> We're so damn close.<eos> I don't want our last push out of guns to end in a pile of dead cops.<eos> It won't, brother.
Troops do too.<eos> I can sneak Aaron past, right out to Monroe.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> What if they search the wagon?<eos> - They won't.
- I don't know.<eos> I hate to say it, but I'm not even looking forward to Thanksgiving this year.<eos> My family just fights all the time.<eos> You should come to my house for Thanksgiving.<eos> Okay, I will.
Did you and your... dad find a house?<eos> Oh! Um, not yet.<eos> Sorry about the other day, rushing off like that.<eos> If you want some help, let me know, because we've just listed a couple of fantastic properties.<eos> I will!
Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Brandy? What?<eos> I-I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> Yeah. It won't.
This isn't a game, Will.<eos> I need to trust you. I need men around me who can keep their wits.<eos> I know.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
And I thought so too until now.<eos> Now I know it was me.<eos> Whatever this is, clearly I can't control it.<eos> What if I do something like that to Cynthia?<eos> You won't.
That monster, it was Bastien. And the voodoo queen sent him here for me.<eos> What do you think, I don't know that?<eos> Just keep that information to yourself, you understand?<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> You weren't going to leave without me, were you?<eos> I should kill you right now!<eos> You won't.
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
She'll call you, she will, she just needs a bit of space right now.<eos> Okay, okay, Mrs. Sanders. - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Tell Morgan... - I will.<eos> I will.
No, I just got waxed and my shorts are sticking.<eos> I did that.<eos> So you're the Devil, huh?<eos> Tell your buddy Barack he's doing a hell of a job.<eos> I will.
There was no job in Mexico.<eos> There was nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> I don't want to leave you.<eos> I won't.
- All I meant was...<eos> You don't pick your family or their faith.<eos> And it doesn't matter whose blood flows through your veins.<eos> You choose your own path.<eos> Or your King will.
I can take a few no's along the way.<eos> I do like you, Trouty Mouth.<eos> (giggles) Well, this is awesome. Okay, this is so awesome.<eos> I'll get those, - uh, pictures taken right away.<eos> - Uh, no, no, no, you won't.
We land in half an hour.<eos> Good.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work.<eos> I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
Olivia Pope knows about Remington, and now she's working for Josephine Marcus.<eos> If she thought she needed it, she'd use it against us.<eos> She'd let Marcus use it against us.<eos> She thinks she knows. She thinks she knows because of Ballard, and he's yet to come across anything concrete.<eos> And he won't.
Why don't you wait a year, okay?<eos> Move into the dorms.<eos> I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.<eos> And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won't say a word.<eos> Yes, you will.
Once they've walked through the entire store.<eos> And Christian will be here to capture a memento of their experience.<eos> Thank you, Denise.<eos> We haven't done it yet.<eos> But we will.
Let him stay with me for a few days.<eos> Of course, if Ismail doesn't mind it.<eos> He won't.<eos> You can tell him that we went to the social services center.<eos> I will.
I need to know, if I ask her to do this, it's going to work.<eos> That he'll die right away and will it be traceable?<eos> Will it look like he's dying of natural causes?<eos> I need to know that, uh, she won't get caught.<eos> She won't.
You would trust this Circe after all she has done?<eos> You would be lucky to return with your life.<eos> Then we have to find another way.<eos> Do not worry my love, for you are everything to me... ..and I will not lose you.<eos> I will not.
All right, guys, time to find a new family dog.<eos> Hey, Chris, you're kind of a creep.<eos> You should get a ferret.<eos> You're right, I am.<eos> And I will!
Your wife is a very sick woman.<eos> I warned you to stay away from my family.<eos> I took the safety valve off.<eos> I can dump 20 cc of morphine into her before you take another step.<eos> You won't.
I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
Do me a favor.<eos> Sure.<eos> You want me to make shrimp dumplings Or pork dumplings?<eos> Then you'd better work harder.<eos> I Will.
Yes.<eos> All right, I'll dial it back a notch for the lunch.<eos> Good. So no crazy character voices, no fruity orders...<eos> So Dandy Randy and his Banana Band won't be ordering the beet salad with the culinary foam?<eos> They will not.
I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
Please let me stay for a while.<eos> I beg you.<eos> First, don't touch anything in this house.<eos> I won't touch anything.<eos> I won't.
I mean, the banter, especially Inspector Michaud.<eos> And his son Olivier.<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> Come, come. You must meet everyone.<eos> Oh, I will.
Do you still hate me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you can leave me.<eos> But I won't.
I need you to leave, let's go.<eos> Here, pass this around.<eos> Here, Don't listen to those cocksuckers.<eos> We think it is in everyone's best interest that you resign.<eos> I won't.
Do you not want me?<eos> Do you not want to do those things to me?<eos> She is not even my mother.<eos> She need only say a word.<eos> She won't.
I tried to be a good mother to you.<eos> I wanted to be perfect, but this is a musician's life.<eos> We rehearse and we practice and we perform.<eos> Unfortunately, that's how it's going to be for you, too, you'll see.<eos> No, I won't.
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.<eos> This is an abomination.<eos> I'm telling Todd.<eos> - No, he won't believe you.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
- Don't be afraid.<eos> They just want to see you.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> They will kill me.<eos> - No, they won't.
By the way, I know guys that would've done him real slow.<eos> - When this is over...<eos> - You wanna do this dance?<eos> - I won't have a have a choice, will I?<eos> - No, you won't.
- Don't worry.<eos> He'll talk.<eos> - Just tape him up. We've done enough.<eos> I know that it's not easy to watch, but it will work.<eos> - No, it won't.
Not today.<eos> It was the first deer I've seen in a year.<eos> Now I have nothing. Okay.<eos> What if they did? Just one year. What if everyone just stopped watching?<eos> - They won't, Gale.
Listen...<eos> Of course I know where you're coming from.<eos> But you gotta trust me to figure this out.<eos> - Don't do this again, please.<eos> - I won't.
Negative.<eos> If you want to talk about anything..<eos> I don't.<eos> If you change your mind..<eos> I won't.
No, it's different, slightly.<eos> - Would you mind telling me what rap is?<eos> - Tell me what opera is.<eos> No, yes, uh, well, yes, I will...<eos> I will eventually.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - There's some change, Ms Horton.<eos> No, you keep that.<eos> Could you give this to Mr Paget?<eos> - Of course I will.
- Is she here?<eos> - I haven't seen her in weeks.<eos> Tell her to call me or something if you see her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I don't think so.<eos> Come on, Ellis.<eos> Why don't you spend some of that allowance money your parents send you for being the perfect boy?<eos> - If you change your mind...<eos> - I won't.
This is about me.<eos> Who I wanna be.<eos> Who I am.<eos> Tell me what to say so I will not lose again.<eos> It will not.
It's too dangerous.<eos> So, they're gonna do what?<eos> Just sit there and let Sharif sail away with even more money?<eos> They make a move, they're dead. Then we have to make a move.<eos> We will, but not right now.
You need to lose weight immediately!<eos> My pockets are empty.<eos> I could poo.<eos> That won't be enough to make a difference.<eos> Yes, it will.
Those good friends?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna do anything to ruin our relationship.<eos> It's ruined. Okay? So stop calling everyone.<eos> Stop embarrassing yourself.<eos> Okay, I will.
I will retrieve them!<eos> You can rub my tummy!<eos> All off-topic.<eos> What I need you to do is many me.<eos> Yes, I will.
And I don't need to know this?<eos> No. Really, you don't.<eos> Not gonna lose you again.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then you won't.
You lack a dick.<eos> Boys, please tell us what's going on here.<eos> Uh, well, it would seem that a Virgin Mary has appeared... in the syrup of a local man's pancake.<eos> No, it has not.<eos> Uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
We really wanted you.<eos> Honest?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> So tell Pierre to stop bugging me.<eos> L certainly will.
50 hours in surgical room.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Even for you.<eos> Do you think he will forgive me?<eos> He will.
I know.<eos> I just - I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.<eos> Why don't you talk to Claire?<eos> Oh, if I open up to her, she'll leave me.<eos> – No, she won't.
Oh. Charlie has got a gun now.<eos> What will he do?<eos> Shoot me.<eos> Come on, shoot me.<eos> You will surely, but not so easily.
She's been there the whole time.<eos> My God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you the truth. You said you wouldn't shoot me.<eos> I won't.
Kate.<eos> There's some kind of control room through there.<eos> We can use it as a base.<eos> We need to find David.<eos> And we will.
- It's Halloween.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - He will not.
- I really should kick his ass.<eos> - Don't do that here.<eos> - It's your sister's party.<eos> - But when my arm is cured, I'll give him a...<eos> No, you won't!
– Ok alright, let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you, they're staking out all my houses anyway,<eos> I'll stay with you, until... until... you know un- un- until the hearing.<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.<eos> I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> Jack, they won't.
Mitch, you heard him.<eos> That man is unstable.<eos> What if he does it?<eos> What if people find out we knew?<eos> They won't.
She needs more than faith on her side.<eos> She needs you.<eos> Will you hang tight a minute, Kyle?<eos> I can't miss my bus.<eos> You won't.
If you don't want me to call you a liar, you're gonna have to stop lying to me.<eos> I want to know where he is, what he's up to, now.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> You can.<eos> You won't.
Maybe I need a change of pace too.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Uh, call me.<eos> Let me know.<eos> I will.
She doesn't know anything.<eos> Don't do this, Ike.<eos> It demeans both of us.<eos> - You know how this works. - I can't let you kill her.<eos> I won't.
Don't do this, Ike.<eos> It demeans both of us.<eos> - You know how this works. - I can't let you kill her.<eos> I won't.<eos> - You won't?
I'd milk every penny I could get.<eos> What are you... ohh! No talking!<eos> Have you not heard of honor among thieves?<eos> We gave our word, Nathan Scott, that you would die.<eos> And so you will.
I don't know.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> I'll say we just got in an accident.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Of course it will.
You got over your...bump in the road.<eos> Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony. You will.
For one final time, I'm going to tap into the dark magic I used a thousand years ago.<eos> Like my husband Mikael before him, I will make Alaric into a true hunter, the vampire to end all vampires.<eos> You can't create another original.<eos> What if he turns out to be an even bigger monster than your children?<eos> He won't,
Because if who we are is who we came from then I am destined to be the worst mother in the world.<eos> Who doesn't care about anyone but herself who can leave her children without a glance back.<eos> Okay, no, I didn't-<eos> Okay, and I won't do that to a child.<eos> I won't.
How kind of you, Dawn.<eos> This is an excellent meal, as always, mother.<eos> Seriously, it's amazing.<eos> You need to teach me how to cook this, grandma.<eos> All right, I will.
If you all meet, the truth will come out<eos> Guards!<eos> Bring Minister Yoon and Kwon-yoo at once!<eos> That won't happen!<eos> Yes, it will!
♪ We had to learn how to bend ♪ ♪ Without the world caving in ♪<eos> ♪ I had to learn what I got and what I'm not ♪<eos> ♪ And who I am ♪<eos> ♪ I won't give up ♪<eos> ♪ No, I won't ♪ ♪ On us ♪
That's all we want.<eos> Ah, well, thank you, thank you everyone. Thank you very much.<eos> I um, well, I'm lucky, I suppose. I... ..have some good staff and they, they don't make too many mistakes.<eos> So I guess I'll be sharing this with them. Thanks very much, thank you.<eos> Bullshit you will!
He's um, yeah he's a nice guy. And he seems to really like me.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is my little secret, you can't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
But then they are well aware that they are top dog.<eos> If Zeeland really are threating to pull the plug there is not a damn thing we can do about it.<eos> You don't think this is right either.<eos> But I hope you will change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Simran. Like one of those heroines out of Yash Chopra, Raj Kapoor films. Now like today.<eos> Fakir, Panti...<eos> What's...<eos> You're marrying Simran? - Yes... She said yes.<eos> She will.
She's not ready to give this up.<eos> You wouldn't have to run.<eos> Stay on Mother's good side.<eos> We can have what they have.<eos> And in a thousand years, we will.
Now look here, don't be obtuse, Tietjens.<eos> Dammit, man, is the department's duty to support Waterhouse and make his case to the house.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Minister has to show the figures for the insurance bill will balance.<eos> Well, they won't.
Here...<eos> Tell her I did my best, and tell her that Alo helped me cos he does computer shit on his PlayStation.<eos> All right.<eos> And tell her that you're a mean old cow who probably never gets laid.<eos> I will.
Do you understand?<eos> Now get the fuck out, you deluded loser!<eos> I don't know what teenage drama you've got yourself embroiled in, but try for a bit more professionalism next time, OK?<eos> I'm so sorry, Gregory, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it fucking won't.
And Franky!<eos> You need to tell her.<eos> Tell her I'm coming home!<eos> Tell her I...<eos> I will.
Enjoy the CD.<eos> So, what do you think would happen to you if you fail to find what you're looking for?<eos> It's never happened.<eos> What if it did?<eos> It won't.
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.<eos> Who gave you those clothes?<eos> Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?<eos> If my clothes offend you, I will change them.<eos> You will.
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.<eos> Like me, Ser Davos.<eos> You want me.<eos> You want to see what's beneath this robe.<eos> And you will.
Marty, what are y...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> They all want me to change back.<eos> - But I won't.
Does he know we were in his office?<eos> We didn't get to that part.<eos> I just told him football players talk a lot when they're not on the field.<eos> - Okay, Mona, he cannot know that we were...<eos> - He won't.
And, sadly, we're gonna have to have the whole thing repaved.<eos> Ooh, that sounds expensive, George.<eos> Oh, it will be, and if George doesn't pay for it, we'll sue.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - But we will.
And that's usually a telltale sign, but...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You do know.<eos> - You can't out me.<eos> - I won't.
You've got one in the oven.<eos> Is it any wonder?<eos> There's things you can do, Mare.<eos> Things you'll have to do.<eos> And what if I won't?
You can't do this to me!<eos> Yes, General?<eos> Your associate seems to be missing.<eos> Well, if you find him, have him give me a call.<eos> I will.
Some C4.<eos> Good.<eos> If we put C4 in the main engine, we can blow up the ship and the queen with it.<eos> We might not make it out in time.<eos> At least they won't.
Cat.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> What...<eos> What if she says something?<eos> She won't.
Just stay with your aunt.<eos> No, I gotta go.<eos> My mom needs me.<eos> Okay, I'll come with you.<eos> We all will.
I'm due.<eos> Know what Dan would have said.<eos> I better help the new guy with the truck.<eos> He'll probably fuck it up.<eos> Fucking will.
Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me, because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else...<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
N-no. No. No.<eos> No. You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Surely he'll understand.<eos> Perhaps, but not everyone will.
Really.<eos> Are you sure, Bae?<eos> Yes. I'm fine.<eos> Well, I suppose it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Where is he?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> He's had 24 hours to run his mouth already.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He won't.
I don't know, we didn't come home.<eos> Who would raise the kids?<eos> What-what would happen then?<eos> Honey, we don't have a baby, let alone babies plural.<eos> Not now, but we will.
- Okay, welcome. How you doing? - How do you do?<eos> Sam, I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Can you hop on this trauma for me?<eos> If I stand next to Lenny, he'll totally pick up on my break-up vibes.<eos> - No, he won't.
God, you're so fucking hot.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.<eos> Shh. I don't want Ian to hear us.<eos> He won't.
The 24 minute gap.<eos> They're all over it - fingerprints, DNA.<eos> Bag and contents.<eos> I won't ask how you...<eos> No, you won't.
- What?<eos> I don't.<eos> Yeah, well, you might someday.<eos> You're right, McNally.<eos> Maybe I will someday.
But I also know that she'll go home and open that always-gigantic mouth of hers around Ithaca, which means it's just a matter of time before our parents are sobbing over the phone, insisting how they always knew we'd work things out someday.<eos> So I wanted to make sure that... you wanna tell Chelsea too.<eos> I wanna say the right thing here.<eos> Well, don't by--<eos> - No, I won't.
(Vehicle passing by)<eos> (Gurgling)<eos> Please don't let me die.<eos> You don't wanna die?<eos> Well, you never will.
Pullbrook.<eos> And they will find him.<eos> But if they don't?<eos> Then I'll decide what to do.<eos> Or we will.
I mean, this place isn't exactly Buenos Aires.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But there is a lot more to Chance Harbor than the guidebooks suggest.<eos> Well, then you should come back.<eos> Well, then I will.
And if everything he says about Leslie... makes her sound like a great mother.<eos> You did the right thing, Ade.<eos> You couldn't keep her.<eos> Do you think she'll ever forgive me?<eos> She will.
No.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Maybe he sent his new information to my old e-mail account at New York Hospital!<eos> I'm gonna check it.<eos> Uh, no, you won't.
Lieutenant, U.S. Navy.<eos> - Serial number 653...<eos> - Knock it off.<eos> I'm never going to figure out lighting.<eos> Sure you will.
You think this makes difference?<eos> My death will not heal the scars you bear.<eos> Nor erase memory of my cock inside of her, or all those that followed.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
Bree?<eos> After everything we've been through, I promise you can trust me.<eos> I don't want you to know.<eos> You're the only one who still believes in me.<eos> And I always will.
Okay, time to try dresses.<eos> Oh, not me, right?<eos> No, no--dresses no--oh, my god.<eos> No, mom, this is so crazy--we need to talk.<eos> And we will.
We're not gonna get that 1.6 million, are we?<eos> When the courts release it, it will go into your account for about nine minutes, and then it will mysteriously disappear.<eos> Don't try to stop it.<eos> - We won't accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
I've created one.<eos> All right.<eos> Get ready to jump out.<eos> If I get caught...<eos> You won't.
I think he might.<eos> Come here.<eos> What will I do with myself?<eos> You'll figure something out.<eos> We will.
Come here.<eos> What will I do with myself?<eos> You'll figure something out.<eos> We will.<eos> We both will.
Thanks.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> And to play alongside you?<eos> Just hope I can keep up.<eos> Eh, you won't.
Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.<eos> She has.<eos> Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't. - Yes.
You didn't have to.<eos> It means so much.<eos> I wish I could have done more.<eos> Oh, and Raj, please, give your parents my regards.<eos> I will.
My sergeant raped me.<eos> I think we can do without these.<eos> Right?<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
It's good.<eos> And I have a copy, if you need it.<eos> You want me to read it?<eos> Not if you don't have to.<eos> Then I won't.
Oh, screw it.<eos> I can't-I can't do this.<eos> I won't do this.<eos> I will not say good-bye to you.<eos> I won't.
Wear your slippers.<eos> We'll be taking the car, not going bare-foot.<eos> "Beloved "<eos> By the way, you like driving, don't you? You know, so do I.<eos> You won't any more.
My brother!<eos> Brother, he's the right guy. Who will finish the last round?<eos> Come on, son.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I will.
I didn't really know her very well in the last year or so.<eos> You know, she was out there.<eos> Making her own life.<eos> And she hadn't come back to us yet.<eos> And now she never will.
Τhat's why the gold was here.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Τhere must be more than this.<eos> I can't go back with nothing.<eos> You won't.
I think you'll agree that I've given you everything you asked for.<eos> This call is a silver bullet for Ellen Parsons.<eos> She gets her hands on it, your case is sunk.<eos> Then she better not hear it.<eos> Oh, she won't.
We want to take it as far as we can.<eos> I think you guys are gonna stay here because you're my band and you're not going anywhere.<eos> You don't think we should go on tour?<eos> Ok.<eos> Maybe we won't.
- What's this?<eos> - What's this?<eos> I'm an outlaw and the government has my family,<eos> - so I have to kill another outlaw.<eos> - No you won't.
Previously on Falling Skies...<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
You are surely not in love with Christopher Tietjens?<eos> You mustn't be.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> But when he comes home, he will make me his mistress.<eos> Or he won't.
Okay, I'm just going to try this and see how it goes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can get into bed with him.<eos> I'll mess up his lines.<eos> No, you won't.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
Take my coat?<eos> Wilfred, Wilfred, I know what this is.<eos> You want to get to know Amanda better, but now isn't the time.<eos> I need everything to run smoothly tonight.<eos> And it will.
We have to hurry.<eos> What the fuck are you doing out?<eos> - Shift.<eos> - I'm not gonna leave her.<eos> We won't.
But you can't, okay?<eos> Is Meredith all right?<eos> I don't know how to talk to her, Richard.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> Yeah, I will, I will.
I imagine you already know that.<eos> Well, I'm sure Raylan Givens paid you a visit, and you just pussed out.<eos> Nothing to do with the fact that you've spent the last 20 years looking for a way to hang me out to dry.<eos> I asked you to deal with the marshal, and you didn't deal with him.<eos> - Now I will.
It's the very thing that makes us human.<eos> Captain?<eos> AI designation: Vision.<eos> You are to surrender by the order of Iron Man.<eos> I... will... not!
- Don't know what that means.<eos> - Again, man up.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I will have one of those beers.<eos> Yeah! Yeah, you will!
You had a drink. You gambled. You lost your company.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> What I should do is walk through that door and make you live with this.<eos> Well, you won't, will you?
Part of magic is suspense and expectation, right?<eos> What could it be?<eos> Voila.<eos> I didn't want to forget you.<eos> And I won't.
Do you not want me?<eos> Do you not want to do those things to me?<eos> She is not even my mother.<eos> She need only say a word.<eos> She won't.
Dee Ann.<eos> Me?<eos> This guy I'm seeing... It's just fun.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
It's a bit cheaper.<eos> This one's got, like, a biscuity flavour.<eos> It's more expensive.<eos> I don't think anyone's gonna notice the difference.<eos> Someone will.
You got her the grant money.<eos> Look, I know you did.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> It'll help things between you guys.<eos> - No, it won't.
Weddings, funerals, uprisings - everything has a date.<eos> I'm good at dates.<eos> You won't stump me on anything. On any fucking thing, remember that.<eos> - Will you remember that?<eos> - I will.
I don't know what to do.<eos> Can't eat, can't sleep.<eos> Every time I look out the window, the police are there.<eos> Hey. They'll give up soon, all right, they'll go away.<eos> No, they won't.
That's just loose change.<eos> Hmm.<eos> So what are his options?<eos> Well, he could walk away.<eos> But he won't, will he?
And did Ridley recognise you from the hotel?<eos> Don't worry, son, we'll sort it.<eos> So what are his options?<eos> Well, he could walk away.<eos> But he won't, will he?
I... I get it.<eos> I got scared today. I actually got scared.<eos> I mean... some numb-nuts knocks me down, and all I can think about is losing what I never thought I'd have... so from on, I will ride the desk, all right?<eos> And I will even try and like it.<eos> No, you won't.
You're not gonna die on me, are you?<eos> There are kids out there.<eos> It's all there.<eos> You can check it if you want.<eos> I will.
He's the one who cheated on his wife behind her back.<eos> He's the one who said he loved you and then disappeared when it got tough.<eos> I'm the one who found you barely alive.<eos> I hope you're not expecting me to thank you for that.<eos> Because I never will.
I'm on my way.<eos> Brenda, you have to go back to work at this hour?<eos> Mama, I am so sorry, but I've got a deadline.<eos> Hmm, I thought since Clay was feeling better, you and I could have a little talk.<eos> And we will.
- Really? - Really.<eos> Hey, I am a good campaign strategist.<eos> But I need to know if you're divorcing Peter.<eos> Donna Brazile will not agree to the keynote - if you are.<eos> - She won't...?
I know, but you didn't.<eos> So I decided to call you.<eos> Okay, um, let me get all my ducks in a row, sir, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Sir?<eos> No, you won't.
I've been hearing that.<eos> Ralph: Name's Samantha Meade.<eos> She was found dead next to some motorcycle tracks.<eos> I got a man out there right now checking to see if those tracks match your tires.<eos> Which they will.
Pokolistani tweaked about England's support of Bialya.<eos> You're killing them!<eos> Stop!<eos> Can't just let them get away with it, though, can we?<eos> We won't, but not like that.
And Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.<eos> Checking. Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.<eos> Get me an address.<eos> I'll go and talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
We could move up to ten million before anyone else starts asking questions.<eos> Well, I'm not so sure.<eos> I think it's all happening too fast.<eos> What if they realise why we buy what we do?<eos> They won't.
There's a situation at The Red Pony.<eos> Let him figure it out.<eos> It's your day off. I'm all he's got.<eos> I flew home especially to see you.<eos> And you will.
Hold on.<eos> If I help you, will you be sure that Diego gets to keep playing?<eos> Please.<eos> Will you help my son stay on the team?<eos> Yes, I will.
Yes.<eos> I don't know if I believe you.<eos> You were at her house last night.<eos> I thought that if she knew how much I cared about you, then she would back down a little.<eos> But she never will.
If she sings, you lose tonight I won't lose<eos> You leave from here?<eos> Disappear?<eos> Fine<eos> And if she won't?
There is no door number three.<eos> I was ready to die.<eos> I was supposed to die, I don't... I don't want... I can't be a vampire!<eos> If there's something that Bonnie can do, we have to try it.<eos> We will.
We'll miss you." It--it was sweet, but I've heard it.<eos> I told 'em not to bother this time around.<eos> Okay. Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.<eos> I will.<eos> Okay. But I won't.
Just because I don't come in early and stay late every day...<eos> And where were you last night?<eos> - McHale's bar. - Huh.<eos> - They know me. You can ask.<eos> - I will.
You forget about me?<eos> Something came up.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No...<eos> It won't.
I've broken more bones and spilt more blood than this before.<eos> I like you a lot, Ben.<eos> But it could never work.<eos> Why?<eos> It just won't.
He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.<eos> He won't get in anymore trouble.<eos> He's not a bad kid. Dylan's still circling around.<eos> Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her.<eos> No, I won't.
I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you.<eos> But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
This whore shit all over our club.<eos> Got my mom locked up.<eos> This is our get.<eos> We got to send a message, make sure the other pussy thinks about doing it.<eos> I will.
Mm, I can't wait.<eos> I've been using Billy to develop a more stable thermite.<eos> A patent could mean millions.<eos> If the thermite in your burn matches our victim...<eos> It won't!
No, I need to go out and find her.<eos> No, you need to stay put in case Lacey comes home.<eos> Get out there right now.<eos> I can't lose her, Bud.<eos> You won't.
Don't you dare make excuses for Kyle Parks.<eos> You are way past that.<eos> I know.<eos> So, snap out of it, girl.<eos> I will.
I've got feeds from all the CTV cameras,<eos> ATM and security cameras.<eos> There is no sign of Kagame so far.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> They will.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
Darling, it's been everywhere for five bloody years, hasn't it?<eos> Will we, won't we?<eos> Will it be built, won't it be built?<eos> Will we win?<eos> No, we won't.
I am so crazy nuts about you guys.<eos> Promise me this is not the last time we're gonna play poker together.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - We'll just have to make the time.<eos> - Of course we will.
Okay, eliot, hardison, kanack is sending muscle to the location.<eos> Make sure you beat him there.<eos> Yeah, we're on it.<eos> Not gonna win any races in lucille.<eos> Oh, we will with this.
This Massimo!<eos> I don't see you together.<eos> Actually, I've never seen you together.<eos> - When can I meet him?<eos> - You will.
I'm definitely glad to Actually be able to talk to you.<eos> When colton said to vote for You,I didn't really want that,You know?<eos> colton said that? yeah.<eos> Yeah. and... Don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.
When colton said to vote for You,I didn't really want that,You know?<eos> colton said that? yeah.<eos> Yeah. and... Don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
Eat.<eos> Kanji bhai, even I believe that God's like a father-figure. - Yes.<eos> So, will he appear before me?<eos> Do you believe in temples, idols etcetera? Yes, I do.<eos> - Then He won't.
get me everything you can on that guy.<eos> thanks for helping me, giancarlo, but you're not taking me back to rome, not while she's in ravello.<eos> the lawyer?<eos> cia couldn't make her talk.<eos> but you will?
That w what you said last time in Seattle, but then the doctors fixed her.<eos> Right, but, Mason...<eos> They can't help your mom there any more.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> Somebody will.
Well, it's all right.<eos> You just tell her.<eos> She'll have a laugh,<eos> Set fire to his car, and move on.<eos> I will.
OK.<eos> If that's what she wants to do, then we will do nothing.<eos> And don't say anything, because it's going to be a surprise.<eos> I won't tell her.<eos> And this time I really won't.
Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other.<eos> Okay. Well... It's a good start, I guess.<eos> We'll talk. We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
Well, that'd be bad for, gosh, everybody drawing a paycheck from Uncle Sam.<eos> You do realize that, right?<eos> You listen to me, you lowlife SOB.<eos> Whatever you've got up your sleeve is not gonna work, not today.<eos> It will, though.
And he's paying me.<eos> Just like he pays you.<eos> Only difference being, I don't got to kill nobody.<eos> So when you coming back?<eos> Maybe I won't.
Yeah, but you're our witness now.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> We need to prepare you for anything that Ellen Parsons might throw at you.<eos> And what if she asks about Torben and Herreshoff?<eos> She won't.
Get back to work.<eos> Find out who's funding Channing McClaren.<eos> Channing wants to tell Ellen Parsons about you.<eos> That cannot happen.<eos> It won't.
Hey, man, my guys could do it, but it'd take them hours.<eos> You can do it in ten minutes. Ten minutes.<eos> I could do it quicker than that.<eos> Great.<eos> So will you?
She'll bring you down.<eos> And that makes me scared for you.<eos> Well...<eos> I made a promise to my sister that I'd never give up on her.<eos> So... I won't.
I love you, too, Mason.<eos> Coop.<eos> Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed. Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Well, if I dribbled, I'm sorry, but come on.<eos> It was ten years ago!<eos> You really won't give me her number?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You really won't?
He'd throw acid in my face.<eos> Even thinking of now I'm shaking.<eos> Poor Siobhan.<eos> You won't say anything to her, will you not?<eos> I won't.
You say that was the last one and you remember what it was like.<eos> I swear, that was it. That was the last one.<eos> Please Janet, I don't have anywhere to go to. No.<eos> I'd lose my job.<eos> You won't.
Are they okay with the hand?<eos> Yeah. I'd finish the rehab up there.<eos> They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.
Okay. That sounds great.<eos> Can you hear my voice, Mr. Delaney?<eos> Oh, man, you should've just kept going.<eos> I know you want to die.<eos> And you will.
How do you know us, Alec?<eos> From the news.<eos> That must be it.<eos> - We should...<eos> - We will.
Sim! Where's your man McLean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He always seems to wander off when new stock comes in.<eos> Tell him I want to see him.<eos> I will, detective.
You like Henry, he's been showing up for years unannounced.<eos> He doesn't bring pot with him when he comes.<eos> I don't like her parents showing up unannounced, snooping around.<eos> Henry's parents have never shown up unannounced.<eos> And they never will.
Interesting girl. And she's a redhead.<eos> I love redheads.<eos> So ask her out.<eos> I'm going to.<eos> I will.
Thanks for making this happen so last minute.<eos> No worries. Nothing I like more than making dinner for six unexpected house guests.<eos> This is getting serious, Annie.<eos> - I really could lose this job.<eos> - But you won't.
History shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> You see that?<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> We will.
And then I stopped. Well, it's not exactly easy for me to get here from work, so...<eos> It's not that hard.<eos> I take the bus to the train.<eos> Yeah, well, you never sleep here.<eos> - So... - Well, I will now.
Hey.<eos> I-I parked far away, I left all of my electronics at work.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'll...
Oh, this is bad.<eos> This is bad, this is bad, this is bad!<eos> This is catastrophic.<eos> - If Alvin gets that book...<eos> - He won't.
I love you.<eos> At least one of my girls is still sweet.<eos> Now you go get ready for bed, okay?<eos> Only if you say good night.<eos> I will.
How's sculpture?<eos> Amazing-ng-ng.<eos> Oh. My boyfriend likes that artist you work for.<eos> - Tell your boyfriend he can talk to me if he wants to buy something.<eos> - I will.
- New places are good for you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You should travel, Fran.<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
- No, no.<eos> But Marty gave 'em your address.<eos> So what? We're not there. Well, they sure as hell know about Hayden, and they knew to look at the shop, so you might want to be a little more concerned.<eos> We have to finish this.<eos> We will.
That's usually how it works, doctor.<eos> Yeah, this kid's 24 years old.<eos> He's got his whole life ahead of him.<eos> I can't screw it up.<eos> You won't.
You're gonna go to the next grave on your list, and you're gonna leave a flower that says, "Surrender yourself to the FBI."<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will arrest you.<eos> Oh, cut that out, now.<eos> You will not.
I went to work.<eos> I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.<eos> I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.<eos> You can check surveillance.<eos> I will.
There was no deal in the world that was that good.<eos> I cannot tell you how many emails I've got from fans saying:<eos> "We want to directly support you. How can we do it so your label doesn't get the money?"<eos> Give people awesome music and then make it very easy for them to help you.<eos> And they will.
I make the demands.<eos> You follow them.<eos> The bean's now mine.<eos> You have to give me something for it.<eos> Oh, I will.
My grandpa has me on a curfew.<eos> I know, it's humiliating, but...<eos> Good night, Lavon.<eos> Don't take these without food, and if it happens again, just give me a call.<eos> Thanks, I will.
When that Overlord invaded my mind he couldn't keep his thoughts completely walled off.<eos> Two-way street.<eos> I saw, felt what these aliens are all about.<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
I'm not them.<eos> They weren't them either until they became them.<eos> No!<eos> No, she did not use the metronome.<eos> And she won't.
But under the rules of professional conduct we have to report the juror communication to the judge.<eos> If the judge declares a mistrial, who knows what happens with a new jury.<eos> Since when are you such a stickler for rules, anyway?<eos> - The point is, if this gets out...<eos> - It won't!
Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um... Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family...<eos> I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
No, they won't.<eos> These aren't mercenaries, Mr. Mayor. They're radical fundamentalists, they're messianic.<eos> And they still have the virus, and they will come back here... and they will try it again and again and again.<eos> And we will face those challenges, Frank, as they present themselves.<eos> No, we won't!
You could obtain the kind of documentation that would put him in a cell right next to his good friend Bernie Madoff.<eos> Whatever it is you're asking me to do, I won't do it.<eos> Take a day. Think about it.<eos> We don't want to ruin you.<eos> But we will.
And you look beautiful.<eos> Babe, we're gonna be late.<eos> I guess she told you I'm the notorious Drake thief.<eos> Actually, no, she didn't.<eos> And I won't.
I should not have thought a large drawing room much compensation.<eos> Why dwell on that now?<eos> Because I want the pleasure of saying "I told you so".<eos> Now, the moment you feel tired, you're to tell me and I'll take over whatever it is you're doing.<eos> Oh, will you, now?
For him.<eos> And for Sybil and this family.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Let me know if Sybil gets in touch.<eos> She won't.
There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
You are our only hope to defeat the Observers.<eos> And I'm gonna be here with you every step of the way.<eos> Please, son.<eos> Whatever happens don't let me go.<eos> I won't, Dad.
Unless you want to pay the bob back and make a day of it.<eos> Hello.<eos> I used to live here, you know. The Lamptons.<eos> Do you remember them?<eos> Your Mum and Dad will.
So who were we working with this whole time?<eos> Some Troubled person impersonating Tommy and killing people with a bolt gun who was also looking for my son.<eos> I got this.<eos> You go find whoever...<eos> We will.
Yeah, no way you're taking leggy.<eos> This isn't about the bird, Skeezer!<eos> Stop acting all gangsta, dude.<eos> You're not going to kill anybody.<eos> Maybe I will.
Well, you close him.<eos> Then, we'll talk. That's not so reassuring.<eos> You came to me. I didn't come to you.<eos> I'll see you on the first tee.<eos> No. You won't.
At the time of the first Thanksgiving, our Serbian ancestors were having a Thanksgiving of their own.<eos> They were thanking God for sparing them from the wolves while giving each other the plague.<eos> That fact wasn't fun, was it?<eos> Oh, you'll get 'em next time, kiddo.<eos> She will not.
We're on.<eos> You got quiet all of a sudden.<eos> I know, I just...<eos> I want this to work.<eos> It will.
You know you're the smartest person in most rooms.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Am I required to tell you?<eos> Well, I'm just a consultant. You don't have to tell me anything.<eos> Then I won't.
Try it.<eos> Try.<eos> Get out of that chair right now and punch me.<eos> At least you can.<eos> - Well, maybe I will.
Ah, that was uncomfortable for all of us.<eos> I can't believe I killed the real Bigfoot.<eos> He was completely innocent, as are all animals.<eos> How will I ever forgive myself?<eos> You probably won't.
She promised that when I finished the plan to defeat the Observers, she would help me remove the pieces of brain that they put back in.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea, Walter.<eos> I don't want to lose you, Peter.<eos> I don't want to lose any of you.<eos> And you won't, Walter.
My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.<eos> And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us.<eos> Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it.<eos> Ben, don't you dare hurt her.<eos> I won't.
Ben, don't you dare hurt her.<eos> I won't.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> She means it.<eos> Okay, I-I won't.
It's the people without those three who lose first.<eos> I don't know which of the three you have.<eos> But you've been spared because you do.<eos> You mustn't forget that.<eos> I won't .
I've written down specifics about him, too.<eos> Though hopefully, you won't have to go there.<eos> What if he doesn't buy it?<eos> What if he starts digging deeper?<eos> He won't.
Do not shrink to console them.<eos> Do not look for friends here.<eos> You won't find them.<eos> None of these people have the capacity to understand you.<eos> They never will.
You won't get away with this.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?<eos> You think that they're gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?<eos> Beckett will.
I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> All righty then.<eos> You know, uh, we should do this again.<eos> Oh, we will.
Yeah, that she is.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm a callous egomaniac.<eos> She's gonna leave me.<eos> No, she won't. No, she won't.
Absolutely not.<eos> You are gonna wear a wire.<eos> You cheated.<eos> Prove it!<eos> Oh, I will.
Well if it doesn't work out with your mom, does he like old black ladies?<eos> Because my grandma will do a lot more for a lot less.<eos> These are the best seats ever.<eos> You know, if we wanted to, we could actually trip the guys on the other team.<eos> But we won't, right?
But we won't, right?<eos> No, no, I'm just saying.<eos> But we'd probably get on TV.<eos> Woo! It's so hard not to trip them now, because I'm-I'm thinking about it.<eos> I won't, I won't, I won't.
We're not here to kiss each other's asses, madame butterfly.<eos> We're here to do business.<eos> She's not taking a penny less than ten bucks for that blender.<eos> But for $15, you get back your crock-pot, and you can take home these penis-shaped ice cube trays.<eos> $11. $12, and we'll...
Who was it who bested you?<eos> The swan girl.<eos> Emma.<eos> Rest assured, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
You can't get there.<eos> You haven't been under a sleeping curse.<eos> Well, then put me under one.<eos> If we do that, there's a chance you might never waken up.<eos> Sure, I will.
True love's kiss.<eos> Yes, but it won't work in there.<eos> We have to get back.<eos> If we don't...<eos> We will.
Yes, but it won't work in there.<eos> We have to get back.<eos> If we don't...<eos> We will.<eos> We will.
I know.<eos> That's not the concern.<eos> The concern is her.<eos> She won't go?<eos> No, she will.
Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> Right now you have nothing to compare it to.<eos> But you will.
You'll destroy them.<eos> I've worked so hard to keep them safe.<eos> Biba, if you care about either one of them, you will not tell them the truth.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I won't.
I'll say it was an elaborate prank.<eos> I punked him.<eos> And send.<eos> That'll fix it.<eos> No, it won't.
You're never alone.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's blackmail.<eos> That Bible-thumping bitch is blackmailing me, and I don't want to give in to her.<eos> I won't.
I can't imagine how hard this is for you.<eos> I keep hoping that I can will her to wake up.<eos> None of the doctors can agree as to when that might be.<eos> But as long as a chance exists, I can't give up.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, well, you need to take care of yourself, son.<eos> Okay. Well, okay, just, um, please... Tell her I love her.<eos> - I will, dad.<eos> - Please.<eos> I will.
For no one, no one will leave Julia in the lurch!<eos> Let's clear!<eos> No I was called Salome!<eos> Just to make it even more lacking!<eos> Will walkie-talkie?
Let's clear!<eos> No I was called Salome!<eos> Just to make it even more lacking!<eos> Will walkie-talkie?<eos> Will walkie-talkie?
In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power.<eos> You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
Before that, I have something to tell you.<eos> Actually, I am not a courier.<eos> A reporter?<eos> Aren't you going to negotiate with him?<eos> You will for sure.
Well, you can't be sure.<eos> It's all in how you present yourself.<eos> - No, that won't make a difference!<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because it just won't!
Fuck you!<eos> It was all I could think of at the time, okay?<eos> Meg?<eos> Do you really think I'll meet someone...<eos> - Yeah, you will. - ...someday?
I've planned this out with extreme precision.<eos> Your arrival today has thrown everything off.<eos> It was just four minutes.<eos> I'll tell you what, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
But could we please get this over quickly?<eos> Rachel, are you all right with this?<eos> I need you to be honest with me... I know I lost it in there, Dr. Rosen.<eos> I will not let that happen again.<eos> But it will.
You're never gonna get another job after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.<eos> You'll have to explain to your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.<eos> I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.<eos> Fuck you, Billy.<eos> Now I will.
Is this a joke to you?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I shouldn't even be here.<eos> We've almost been killed multiple times.<eos> I will probably die on this quest.<eos> Courtney definitely will.
Oh, I knew better than to trust you.<eos> Now, you let me walk out of here with my money, or I will pull this pin, and we all die.<eos> Go ahead. Pull it.<eos> I'll do it, I swear to God.<eos> No, you won't.
Come on, Dog, you can do it.<eos> Let's go, come on.<eos> -Good jab.<eos> Good jab! -There we go!<eos> No, he won't.
It's not a paper.<eos> It's my graduation speech.<eos> Save your money.<eos> No one gives a shit about those things.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom will.
What is he saying?"<eos> "He wants your underwear!"<eos> My work here is done.<eos> So, I have to go back to New York for a few days, but call me if you need anything.<eos> Okay, I will.
I know it by heart. - 밫he Seagull?<eos> ..<eos> - Masha! Masha, confidently:.<eos> 밐e will, ask him for them...<eos> He will.?
Yeah.<eos> Are their older?<eos> No, no.<eos> You can tell them how much I miss them?<eos> I will.
It's like they're always trying to get rid of me or something.<eos> But when I get out, I'm gonna get a job.<eos> I'm gonna get enough money to get an apartment... and we're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay, Milk.<eos> As long as we don't say nothing. And I never will.<eos> I never will.
Gavin, please don't do this.<eos> I never told Shana I loved her.<eos> - You tell her for me.<eos> - I will not do it.<eos> Yes, you will.
Well, they haven't met Winter.<eos> Listen, Dr. McCarthy is looking into some new materials, right?<eos> He says he can have a new tail ready by...<eos> What if she rejects that one too?<eos> She won't.
Um, definitely gin fizz.<eos> Just a couple of Cokes, Mom. - And some beers.<eos> - Beers. Great, Sheila. Thanks.<eos> So what if your dad comes back and sees me here?<eos> He won't.
- Yeah.<eos> He sleeps here.<eos> As the court has determined, he doesn't know where you live.<eos> If you want a phone...<eos> - I will not.
I thought you were with your family.<eos> I was, then I realized you wouldn't make it through the big night without me.<eos> - Wow, I'm really touched. - Heh.<eos> I'm trying not to say this, but if I screw up...<eos> - You won't.
Here's what you've got to do.<eos> You gotta touch her again...<eos> No, man.<eos> No way!<eos> I won't!
It's too late for me, but you're just starting out.<eos> It's not too late for you.<eos> Tell your friends.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> She won't.
I love you. I love you.<eos> Kate, water 15th, power 20th. I know.<eos> I got it.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother.<eos> I will.
I want to do a paper on this -- on you.<eos> Nothing flashy -- just a dry academic one.<eos> But I think we can help some people.<eos> How would a paper help anyone?<eos> Probably won't.
It belongs to a client.<eos> Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.<eos> Nobody will.
Let me guess.<eos> You're trying to find someone to tell you that I'm crazy.<eos> When I find you, you're dead.<eos> You'll never find me.<eos> No one will.
In my home, the decision has already been made.<eos> You don't have to ask who will guide my family, because by God's grace, I will.<eos> You don't have to ask who will teach my son to follow Christ, because I will.<eos> Who will accept the responsibility of providing and protecting my family?<eos> I will.
You don't have to ask who will teach my son to follow Christ, because I will.<eos> Who will accept the responsibility of providing and protecting my family?<eos> I will.<eos> Who will ask God to break the chain of destructive patterns in my family's history?<eos> I will.
But I am.<eos> It's my life, Damon.<eos> My choice.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire will sacrifice one of each.<eos> - Where do I fit?<eos> Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger to your death.<eos> - I can't lose you.<eos> - You won't.
Shh.<eos> I made the wrong choice.<eos> You tell Stefan I'm sorry.<eos> Ok?<eos> I will.
- It's only six blocks.<eos> Six blocks of opportunity for some crazy l.D.S. Nut to make good on that fatwa against us.<eos> Your mother's right, sweetheart.<eos> You should have called.<eos> Okay, well, I will next time.
Yes, she will.<eos> Keep rehearsing.<eos> What if it gets technical?<eos> Like, what if they ask me the difference between procuring and soliciting and befriending?<eos> They won't.
Please, just tell me what you want!<eos> I want you to suffer... every moment of every single day for the rest of your life, just like I do.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise you, Mr. Forte.<eos> You will.
Just go ahead and scoop it up with your hands... I don't want to do that. ...and then wash it.<eos> I don't really want to do any laundry.<eos> I'm just coming in here so you'll play me a song.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I won't.
- Mm-hmm. I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> Buddy, you don't have to be scared of anything.<eos> You're doing great, and you just... yeah, you keep on truckin'.<eos> Could somebody else do it?<eos> I will.
And I know she likes dinner.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> I will invite her to dinner.<eos> Of course you will.
Christ, Dickie!<eos> How the hell am I gonna explain this to Genny?<eos> Just say we were out hunting and I accidentally shot you.<eos> She ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Sure she will.
Think of this as a business deal.<eos> If I take down Dickie, you and Boyd can have free rein over all of Harlan county.<eos> Don't matter what I do.<eos> Mags won't give Dickie up.<eos> Yes, she will.
LISTEN, DANNY, I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL, AND YOU DON'T KNOW ME THAT WELL.<eos> BUT I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF GIVING A CLIENT FALSE HOPE.<eos> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M ALREADY PAINTING THE PLACE.<eos> SO I NEED TO KNOW THAT NO ONE IS GONNA COME HERE AND KICK ME OUT--NO ONE.<eos> AND NO ONE WILL. NO ONE?
We should act like one.<eos> Family protects itself.<eos> I thought you had to protect Melissa and your bundle of joy.<eos> I do...<eos> And I will.
I told her I had a brother named Jason.<eos> I lied my ass of.<eos> You know what you should do?<eos> You should go tell her right now.<eos> No, I will.
Let me tell you something, ghost lady.<eos> It's the living you wanna watch out for.<eos> Not the dead.<eos> There she is. Now try to forget all about it.<eos> The headmaster will.
And she'll call you up, too.<eos> Of course she will.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She won't call me.<eos> Sure she will.
Okay, great.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> You can also let him know that he'd better be serious about that promotion.<eos> - You can tell him yourself tomorrow.<eos> - I will.
I need someone who can open it without setting the charges off.<eos> Luckily, I already know the best.<eos> That's why you're here, Neal.<eos> - And if I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
Today, we pledge our allegiance to the King of all Britons;<eos> the one who removed the sword of the gods.<eos> I present to you, your undoubted King.<eos> Will you solemnly swear to rule the peoples of this realm according to their laws and customs and cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?<eos> I will.

For the gas meter.<eos> In case I'm late for supper.<eos> Freddie, darling.<eos> Would you come home with me, please?<eos> No, I will not.
But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
Really?<eos> You can't mess this up, Malcolm.<eos> He's giving you another chance.<eos> You need to make this work.<eos> I will.
You can't mess this up, Malcolm.<eos> He's giving you another chance.<eos> You need to make this work.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
You're here now. Do your best.<eos> Yes, but I need you to know that I got in on merit.<eos> And I need to know that the false things other students say about me<eos> - won't affect the way that you judge me.<eos> - It won't.
I do.<eos> Why do you have a problem?<eos> Coply intuition.<eos> If I set it up, will you talk to him?<eos> I will.
Feels like I've been away too long already.<eos> He's just trying to steady the boat.<eos> And we don't need you jumping all over it.<eos> We'll have to see what Glickman says about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
It's him I should be talking to.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> I'm due to make a large purchase off you people.<eos> I know.<eos> And you will.
He got away!<eos> And no-one even knows what he looks like!<eos> We'll find him.<eos> How?<eos> We will.
Threaten us?<eos> Call her!<eos> Tell her!<eos> Tell everyone!<eos> I will.
And the only way you can make back your money is to allow me to make back mine.<eos> And the only way we can do that is if we set up that line together.<eos> So, come after me, you'll get nothing.<eos> Work with me and you'll make far more than a million.<eos> We both will.
Which didn't kill you.<eos> - Which still might.<eos> - Hasn't yet.<eos> But is that what you're afraid of?<eos> That it will?
Yeah, well. Let's just see who they call, shall we?<eos> All this just to find Andy Dixon?<eos> - He was there.<eos> - What if he's got nothing to say?<eos> Oh, he will.
- This was everything.<eos> - I know.<eos> Now take your throne, my queen.<eos> Will you swear to rule this realm according to the laws and customs of its people, and to administer justice with mercy?<eos> - I will.
Now take your throne, my queen.<eos> Will you swear to rule this realm according to the laws and customs of its people, and to administer justice with mercy?<eos> - I will.<eos> Will you uphold too the laws of God and the true teachings of his gospel?<eos> - I will.
Do you think it happens in other villages?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Wherever it is we have to stop it.<eos> - We will.
I just want to know what your intentions are about my daughter.<eos> I love her.<eos> You need to call her. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I definitely will. Thanks.
Well, whatever you say, be sincere. My mind doesn't seem to be working.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Ifshe comes back, will the property be mine again?<eos> Can't you keep the property out of this? Fine, now will she come back?<eos> Yes, she will.
And it's gonna hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell... tell people that you liked me.<eos> I will.
Rush wants us to take a cautious approach.<eos> Who cares what Rush thinks?<eos> He's not our boss.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> I will.
You need to tell them about your problems and your "kurludges" and the little bugs and all the problems.<eos> They want the same thing as you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Marcus.<eos> I will.
Oh, oh, oh! I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's nice and wet.<eos> I can- oh, oh, oh. - No, no, no!<eos> I'll just--I'll just, uh- no, no, no.
So this has nothing to do with the anomalies?<eos> This is just because you wanted to punish Danny? Why are you so interested in me?<eos> I thought you were somebody else, but I was wrong.<eos> That should hold him until you figure out what's going on and we can send him back home for good. If I figure out what's going on.<eos> You will.
Happens all the time.<eos> You've had these thoughts before.<eos> They've always passed.<eos> It's hell while it lasts, but... It'll get better. Everything will be fine.<eos> Except it won't.
First and foremost, we need to look after each other.<eos> Let's get this panel off and look for the electrical short.<eos> You're not the dictator of GD anymore, Number Two.<eos> No one's going to follow you down here.<eos> I will.
It's changed a lot since the version that I started with.<eos> It's not right.<eos> You should be at the lunch.<eos> - Harcourt should know you. - He will.<eos> He will.
Maybe I should just retire and...<eos> What is it retirees do?<eos> I can't believe I'm hearing this.<eos> Look, I won't let you just give up.<eos> - I won't.
I'm before the board of bar overseers, and you actually suggested that I lie about an illness or a family tragedy, something more clever to get away with turning on my client.<eos> It's all just a big game.<eos> And you lecture me about moral integrity.<eos> Only real question before you today is, will she ever pull this again?<eos> I won't.
[Screaming] [Henry]: I spent a lifetime more or less human.<eos> [Biggie]: You've yet to discover your gift.<eos> You only see the curse in it.<eos> The difference between you and me is you can control your power.<eos> And in time, so will you.
No bad habits, no bad reviews.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Will somebody please take Tim?<eos> If you're so keen, why don't you take him?<eos> All right, I will.
You don't trust me, remember?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I'll break your fingers.<eos> No, you won't.
What, the deal?<eos> No, I'm pretty sure prudence does not know the deal.<eos> And I think--I think that you should tell her.<eos> Or what?<eos> Or I-I will.
My zoop. Uh... Ooh, you've been drinking.<eos> Ohh. Ooh, you've been drinking a lot. Ohh.<eos> Whoa! Whoa. Okay.<eos> Okay. Okay, well, when she wakes up tomorrow with a gigantic hangover, tell her that I had a fantastic time.<eos> I sure will. Okay.
Promise me one thing.<eos> You'll give me five minutes alone with this guy.<eos> I'll do the same thing to him he did to her.<eos> That's what he deserves, not jail, and he has to pay for what he did to my mother.<eos> He will.
Well have fun and let me know if you need anything okay? Anything at all.<eos> I'm not going to call you while I'm gone.<eos> And I don't want you to call me either.<eos> Why does it feel like I'm never going to see you again?<eos> You will, Bo.
And when have you, della Rovere?<eos> Majesty, I understand that you have recently signed a treaty with the King of England.<eos> But what will Henry VII say, what will the other Christian princes say, if word is bruited abroad that you besiege the Vicar of Christ and claim to judge him?<eos> The very man to whom God has committed the judgment of all men?<eos> What will your wife,
Oh, look at those feet.<eos> I just want to taste those arches.<eos> You can-- you can go right ahead.<eos> You can do that.<eos> Oh, I will.
Susan had a d.N.R.<eos> Listen to me. You did the right thing.<eos> You did what susan wanted.<eos> Bizzy's never gonna forgive me.<eos> Oh, e will.
I'd love to chat with you, Lisbon, but there's a man here with a large gun, who wants to talk to you. Who's this?<eos> Mr. Crosswhite, this is Agent Lisbon.<eos> Let's just take it easy, okay?<eos> You tell all those cops to stay out of here.<eos> I will.
He'll be thrilled.<eos> You don't know what it'll mean to him.<eos> I still want to know more about him.<eos> Have you found out anything?<eos> No, but I will. Good.
We're running out of time.<eos> He needs surgery.<eos> So w-what are you waiting for?<eos> Patricia wants to manage the swelling with drugs in hopes that Corey will heal naturally and regain his full brain function.<eos> And will he?
But this is nothing. Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - I am. You understand the size of the array we're building, the amount of fuel we're going to need?<eos> - This operation needs to work.<eos> - It will.
This whole time I've wanted to ask you.<eos> 'Cause I think she's still out there.<eos> Truth is, what else I got to do?<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We will.
Don't worry.<eos> We'll be alright.<eos> When will it explode?<eos> The man said it'll explode if ..<eos> It won't!
First door on your left.<eos> Okay. Here's your ID.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice flight.<eos> I will.
Take this.<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> No, no, it's OK.<eos> - I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> - You won't.
About what?<eos> About... About the new you.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, you need to talk to her.<eos> - I will.
Bye.<eos> I don't care what the fucking DNA test says.<eos> You're not taking Liam.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Okay, enough.<eos> Take off the hood.<eos> It's working, Mr. Lusek!<eos> The world must see that I have cured you. Now, take off your hood.<eos> And they will.
I just wanted to make sure you were all right.<eos> Ricky's not, that's for sure.<eos> I told Julia that she'd find somebody else.<eos> - But... I'm not sure I believed it.<eos> - She will.
My God, Dr. Hartman, isn't there any other way?<eos> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Griffin.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> What?<eos> I'll...
What? ! Mm-hmm.<eos> I never cheated on you.<eos> Then why you showing up here with your tail tucked between your legs?<eos> I came to tell you I don't have a high school diploma.<eos> And now, thanks to lumpy, the study partner, I never will.
I didn't forget.<eos> I didn't forget, dearest.<eos> Would I?<eos> What way is that to talk?<eos> OK, first thing tomorrow I'll..
That sad, conflicted girl.<eos> Sad?<eos> May we all be as satisfied.<eos> His Holiness will not allow her to remain in the convent of San Sisto because he wants to secure her.<eos> Yes, he will.
So enjoy this place while you're here, because one day you're gonna go off into the big bad world, and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
My car accident... was my whip.<eos> It broke me.<eos> And it... brought me back to Lacey.<eos> What if I screw up again?<eos> You won't.
It broke me.<eos> And it... brought me back to Lacey.<eos> What if I screw up again?<eos> You won't.<eos> You won't.
So let me fix it, then.<eos> If I pay, it means I have accepted it was my fault.<eos> But he has consented.<eos> He won't let us be.<eos> - He won't, anyway.
And you want to feed these rumours?<eos> What is all of Rome talking about now?<eos> Hmm? - I will not have him in her house!<eos> - You will-<eos> You will not?
Foolish man.<eos> He will go hunting.<eos> I find the more confined husbands become the more... tolerable.<eos> I could write a book about it.<eos> Perhaps I will.
You know what I mean?<eos> Maybe we should be a little easier on her.<eos> She's trained to do this, Chuck.<eos> Do not let her manipulate you.<eos> Okay, fine, I won't, I won't.
I'm angry.<eos> Too angry?<eos> Just angry enough.<eos> Because I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John.<eos> They won't, Martin.
It's about Sadie. It's about Abby. It's about Jason.<eos> It's about all the others that will be next if we mess this up.<eos> Listen, DS Ripley knows that and he wouldn't have it any other way, so if you respect him at all... just get back to work.<eos> What if Pell regards your silence as weakness rather than strength?<eos> He won't.
What's wrong?<eos> Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out.<eos> Don't do that. Just explain to her what happened.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.<eos> - Sure, she will.
Who was driving the van?<eos> I can't say.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of now.<eos> He said he'd hurt my mum if I told.<eos> He won't.
Wait, that's our project?<eos> This is exactly what I was talking to Lemon about.<eos> Three years, millions on rewrites, $20,000 in first-class flights for the drill.<eos> And we still have nothing to show for it.<eos> And we never will.
Nope.<eos> Because I already got one.<eos> You want me to sing?<eos> How's singing My Bonnie going to help you see inside my brain?<eos> It won't.
You know...<eos> She was turning into a wolf and everything.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> Do either of you wanna switch for a little bit?<eos> Sure, yeah. I will.
- Bye, I'll see you later.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Young man...<eos> - Okay. - Enjoy yourself.<eos> - I will, I will.
Which I'm only doing for the wetlands.<eos> Wetlands, profits, whatever.<eos> Yeah, sounds like a win-win.<eos> Just get out there and do your job.<eos> Yeah, I will.
There are 538 Concordia sites being built around the world.<eos> - But there are only 29 mother ships.<eos> - Yeah, do the math. More on the way.<eos> - If those ships land...<eos> - They won't.
But how can anyone just snatch my land from me?<eos> The government wants to sell this stable and build a warehouse here.<eos> But we all know who is using this excuse... to demolish our stable school... and why.<eos> But this time we won't let it happen!<eos> We definitely won't, guruji.
What type of flag are we talking about?<eos> Dratschev received a shipment of nukes here tonight.<eos> Three guesses who the customer is.<eos> If the iranians get their hands on those missiles...<eos> They won't.
She is fighting to live, And we have a chance to save her if we can get to her right now. We're doing Fitz first.<eos> Look, I understand your feelings, Sir.<eos> I do. But we prioritize patients based on Their best chance of survival, not--<eos> Then this time, we make an exception!<eos> Sir, respectfully, we will not.
Mr Carson, might I have a word?<eos> I'm busy with this dinner for tomorrow night.<eos> Well, that's just it.<eos> I don't expect you'll be using Mr Lang.<eos> Not after last time. - I will not.
Not me.<eos> But why did you do it?<eos> Next time, if you want to know anything, just ask me.<eos> Well done. Very well done.<eos> All right then I will.
If you must know, she thinks we're very foolish.<eos> So, at least we have something in common. I won't allow it!<eos> I will not allow my daughter to throw away her life!<eos> You can posture all you like, Papa, it won't make any difference.<eos> Yes, it will!
He looks like a douche.<eos> Fine, forget it.<eos> All right, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, of course I'll help you.<eos> I will, okay?
The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.<eos> - We don't know what's going on inside.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - We have got to do something!<eos> - And we will.
- Exactly.<eos> If I can't figure out the cause of death Dr. Brennan's going to be tossing me into that machine.<eos> Right.<eos> You're supposed to say, "No, she'll understand."<eos> Oh, but she won't.
Well, generally we recommend further counseling before starting hormone therapy.<eos> I don't need counseling!<eos> Honey, we just want to make sure.<eos> What if you change your mind?<eos> I won't!
Okay, I am not going back to maximum security.<eos> I cannot talk to my daughter through three inches of plexiglas.<eos> Erica, I don't want to go back there, either, believe me.<eos> But I don't want to ruin the best work release program we could find.<eos> I won't.
No.<eos> I'll be fine, Mom.<eos> All right.<eos> If you change your mind, you--<eos> I won't.
Well, for what it's worth, I'm really sorry I wasn't around, you know?<eos> To see you get naked in court.<eos> Another time.<eos> Take care.<eos> I will.
It's not a small thing, Naina.<eos> And people who treat this as a small thing... should be slapped right and left!<eos> Because they are responsible for encouraging such behaviour.<eos> You think you'll change everyone, Jai?<eos> Yes, Naina, I will.
I don't want to hear it, okay?<eos> I gotta go find Sam and uh..<eos> Shit.<eos> Y-you do not tell Sam ever.<eos> I won't. - Ever!
No, no, nothing like that.<eos> Then why are you asking these questions?<eos> I just...need to find them.<eos> If you know anything important about this little girl and her mum, you should go to the police.<eos> I will. Maybe I will.
- Are you in Homicide yet?<eos> - I'm on my way right now.<eos> Remember, it's lieutenant Morgan that is leading this attack against us.<eos> You must get to her.<eos> - I will.
Got it.<eos> - You gonna go to the E.R.?<eos> - On my honor.<eos> Stop with the sarcastic bullshit, all right?<eos> No bullshit, I will. Really.
I killed you.<eos> Stay back!<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> How's the world going to end if the beast is still alive?<eos> It won't.
I'm fine with that.<eos> I just wanna be with you.<eos> Yeah, well, no matter what we want,<eos> I don't think your parents would ever let us live together.<eos> No. They will.
And what, he'll deny it?<eos> Maybe but if I tell him he's freaking you out he'll stop.<eos> I know he will.<eos> Talk to him then.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I made a promise.<eos> You made a promise?<eos> I will not take her to the hospital.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I will.
Adrian is just--<eos> The mother of your baby and your soon-to-be wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, guys, that's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
You can even wait until the baby is older.<eos> Like when the baby is 16?<eos> Look, I haven't changed my mind, and I'm not going to change my mind.<eos> But if you do--<eos> I won't.
Explosion, smoke, fire...<eos> And then our father and uncle Kolya decided to escort them...<eos> Will father come back?<eos> Yes.<eos> When will all the birds.
Vanya is adult now, he understands everything.<eos> Uncle Kolya? Can you bring papa from Canada on your plain?<eos> Not by MiG.We need an other plain for this.<eos> You will have to wait, Ivan.<eos> I will.
You're way, way too young to be moving in with a guy. It's not just me moving in with a guy, it's my son, John, and me moving in with his father and my boyfriend.<eos> You guys are my best friends.<eos> But you have a new best friend.<eos> Adrian. That's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
Looks that way.<eos> Better make sure you stay in my good books hadn't you?<eos> Don't pretend you won't enjoy it.<eos> What if I say no?<eos> You won't.
16-year-old runaway.<eos> We managed to help her, but there were others we couldn't save.<eos> We can rescue them, then take down Pajaro's entire operation, but not if you kill him.<eos> He can't hurt another girl.<eos> He won't.
Perhaps he was trying to do something that would look like hospital malpractice so he could sue.<eos> That is the most idiotic thing I've ever...<eos> What?<eos> You try it!<eos> - Okay, I will.
He's an important witness. Do you know where he is?<eos> No.<eos> Well, when you see him, can you get him to phone me at the station?<eos> Urgently.<eos> I certainly will...
Well, yes, you could say that.<eos> I always imagined him going on the golf course.<eos> Well, not that he's actually gone yet.<eos> Don't worry, Gloria.<eos> - He will soon.
I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> You don't have to do this, Mark.<eos> Killing him won't do anything for you or your father.<eos> He can't get away with murder!<eos> - He won't.
You don't have to do this, Mark.<eos> Killing him won't do anything for you or your father.<eos> He can't get away with murder!<eos> - He won't.<eos> - Of course he will.
Someone, uh, taking you home?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna get a ride with Traci.<eos> Andy... you can't stay at your dad's.<eos> I've been to your dad's.<eos> Fine, then I'll...
You see, that's where you're wrong and that is what worries me.<eos> Because it's all right being independent, but what are you gonna do when you really, really need help?<eos> Ben.<eos> He'll tire of it, Caitlin.<eos> He will. No, he won't.
!<eos> And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
But I'm hoping he won't be here long enough for you to find out.<eos> I'm gonna make sure he gets home safe.<eos> He didn't come here to hurt anybody.<eos> I just wish they could understand that.<eos> Well, maybe Valentina will.
I won't. Takumi!<eos> Just do what everyone expects!<eos> anyway?<eos> Just give me one last chance.<eos> I won't.
Panic over, yeah?<eos> For now. Yeah.<eos> He adores me, you reckon? Yeah, he does.<eos> So you let me know how you get on with that test.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I will.
That's not nothing.<eos> Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all. It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
Okay, so what do I do?<eos> Fight fire with fire.<eos> Take me as your date.<eos> Well, no. I wouldn't wanna-- I wouldn't wanna ruin your night.<eos> I... You won't.
Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and... that was all she wrote.<eos> So, we didn't actually...<eos> I did.<eos> Penny, please, please promise me you won't tell anybody about this.<eos> Of course I won't. No, I won't.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Okay, so, what, so this whole thing is like a lesson?<eos> I'm in distress, Doc!<eos> We will talk about this at your appointment.<eos> No. We won't.
Mom, what is going on with you?<eos> I'm not gonna leave till I clean up this mess.<eos> No, this is my mess.<eos> I'll clean it up.<eos> No, I will.
A girl and a boy.<eos> My father swore on his father's grave to end their bloodline.<eos> She died not far from here on a beach while her son played.<eos> He won't go easily.<eos> No, he won't.
-Anything?<eos> Give him a piece of your salary.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> Give him your salary.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
That's where my boat left from, when I came over from Ireland.<eos> I'm going to do that, too.<eos> Sail a big ship like Sinbad straight over the waves.<eos> Mind you don't get seasick, now.<eos> I won't.
You ok?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe I should take you home.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble with mom and dad.<eos> You won't.
This might seem all quite miraculous to you, but what you're experiencing has nothing to do with the divine.<eos> This is a result of his ability.<eos> His Alpha ability.<eos> You should let him show you.<eos> Uh...well, maybe I will, Nina.
I am sure his men were keeping a watch outside my house.<eos> Tonight he will definitely attack me.<eos> That's when we will know his identity.<eos> Yash, what if he doesn't show up?<eos> He will for sure.
I wish I could take you both to the final round.<eos> But there's only one rose left.<eos> Yes, we know.<eos> Would you please just tell us who it is already?<eos> I will...
And we were taught never to stray from them.<eos> You did. You taught me to look at things in a different way.<eos> I just thought that he was the one who got me.<eos> He did.<eos> He will again.
I'm glad I bumped into you.<eos> I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Looks like they're friends.<eos> If those two hook up and she starts asking him about that night, and he remembers--<eos> - He won't.
You don't know that.<eos> I know that you need to rest.<eos> You need to listen to the doctor.<eos> I need to swim.<eos> Hey, you will, babe.
Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
You can't get anything the damn supermarket!<eos> Here you go.<eos> On the house.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
Speaking of which, how soon will this video get out to the national media?<eos> I'd say... a year and a half-ish.<eos> A year and a half?<eos> But you said people would see me.<eos> Oh, people will.
I knew I was in love with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> And when you're talking to Jack, remember you're in love with me.<eos> I will.
Go ahead, hit me.<eos> I could use the money.<eos> You talk to the police, Marcus?<eos> - Why don't you ask them.<eos> - Oh, I will, I will.
Of course.<eos> And what were you... honest businessmen doing between 10:00 P.M. and midnight on the night Jane was killed?<eos> We were home, watching television.<eos> Please feel free to speak to any of my household staff if you wish to verify this information.<eos> We will.
Well, you might remember this the next time you're screaming at an intern for skipping the fundamentals.<eos> Will you just do it, please?<eos> Take your time.<eos> It'll come back.<eos> No, it won't.
No.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're free.<eos> I hope I never see you again.<eos> Oh, you will.
The point is you can't choose where you were born.<eos> But you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
Mm. What a bitch.<eos> Well...<eos> If it helps, I smelled that one coming a mile away.<eos> Doesn't help.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
Just give me a chance, and I...<eos> By midnight, or I'll tell andrew everything.<eos> Your call.<eos> - I won't do it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
Oh, yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's got a couple stitches in his head.<eos> He's gonna give a statement to Internal Affairs.<eos> All right, well, you tell him that we're all thinking about him.<eos> I will.
Unless you want to see that school teacher dead.<eos> His man's got Miss Catherine, Dan.<eos> He'll kill her if we don't give him the bank's money.<eos> Did you tell him that we don't have it?<eos> But we will by the end of tomorrow.
Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that?<eos> If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But he will.
And the law is far from clear as to...<eos> Then let's go to court.<eos> Look, the judge doesn't want to clutter up his docket.<eos> That's why he empowered me to keep you here as long as I want to reach a compromise.<eos> And I will.
You cannot trust her.<eos> Well, uh, obviously, it depends on the circumstances.<eos> But the point here is... She would never hurt her family.<eos> Do not let Hap leave this house.<eos> I won't.
And on his right olecranon.<eos> The victim struggles with his assailant and then is struck multiple times on the right side, with something that approximates a tiny saw.<eos> Good work, Dr. Edison.<eos> But I have no answers.<eos> You will.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It's you, I recognise your voice, the cut on your hand...<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> No-one can know.<eos> (WHISPERS) I won't.
Thank you.<eos> It's in the U-bend of the sink of the downstairs bathroom. OK, OK.<eos> He says don't try and get it out yourself. You'll only make a mess of it.<eos> Get a plumber. OK.<eos> I will.
So he's gonna be able to fly without you!<eos> Wow! What a great gift.<eos> What if he never comes back?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course he will.
All right, what do you think?<eos> He could be telling the truth.<eos> I only played him to the easy level.<eos> I can't tell.<eos> And you never will.
I'm counsel for the club. If she's really sitting on<eos> Bruno's murderer, she's gonna be surrounded by Feds. You think they're gonna let John Bianchi walk in that door?<eos> Fine.<eos> Do it. But if I don't have a name by the end of the day...<eos> You will.
I'm in love with Violet.<eos> I see.<eos> I just can't take her brother away.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I will.
Push, honey!<eos> God, I love you.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I never wanted to lose you.<eos> You never will.
If I catch you peeping in my windows one more time, I'm going to send Travis out to ruin the other half of your face.<eos> They're selling the house.<eos> No matter.<eos> I've told you... no one can own this house.<eos> No one ever will.
No.<eos> I'm not going to wear them.<eos> I'm not going to pull a splinter out of your feet.<eos> - I don't have a splinter.<eos> - You will!
Chicks love that.<eos> You're lucky the game was postponed.<eos> Otherwise I'd be pounding you right now.<eos> - I'd like to see you try.<eos> - Oh, you will.
You know, just give me a second.<eos> Of course.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I don't want to mess anything up for you.<eos> You won't.
Dispatch patrols at first light.<eos> Scour every inch of the forest.<eos> Yes, sire.<eos> We will find him, Gaius.<eos> We will.
Every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo from some dumb college buddy.<eos> Krystal Ball and the reindeer nose.<eos> - Well, she lost.<eos> - Yes. But she didn't release it.<eos> You will.
And... and I know you are more comfortable sticking than being the guy who leaves, so, um...<eos> So I'll... I'll leave you.<eos> If you can't do it but that's really what you want, if you don't love me...<eos> If you don't love me anymore, then ask me to leave...<eos> And I will.
Hey. This nice lady is going to ask you some questions, okay?<eos> But Hoppa, I want to be here when Mommy wakes up.<eos> We're going to see about that, okay?<eos> Please look out for my daughter.<eos> I will.
very hard, but it's not cutting it.<eos> So obviously you're going to have to figure something else out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're a smart girl.<eos> You will.
What are you doing here? Did you finish the race?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was exhilarating.<eos> I've never done anything like that.<eos> And I never will again.
That's weird.<eos> - I don't know how to. - Uh-huh.<eos> Maybe you should come back when Lucy's back?<eos> - She'll be back tomorrow.<eos> - No, she won't.
She's seven.<eos> Seven? A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy.<eos> Mm. So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will. Will she? Mm-hmm.
You don't wanna be buried in a Mexican cemetery either.<eos> The joke is on you, because my corpse will be unrecognizable.<eos> Only you would spend hundreds of dollars on a tattoo just to get a free 99-cent food item.<eos> Well, it also affords me the ability to threaten to get food on your clothes every day.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.
No calls except to us. And no calling Jimmy Patrick.<eos> That's that Christian kid she was with?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'll talk to him.<eos> No, I will.
I understand your good intentions, but I'm sorry.<eos> I don't need your understanding. It would be good if you just come.<eos> If it's not your father's funeral or something serious like that, then please stay and join us.<eos> She definitely won't come.<eos> She will this time.
No matter how many times you time leap, you can't get past the 1% barrier! We don't know until we try!<eos> You'll just see Mayuri die!<eos> Again...<eos> It'll destroy you.<eos> It won't...
I didn't come here to give you that.<eos> Didn't I tell you to come for it?<eos> All the songs you wrote are in there.<eos> What if I pretend I wrote them all?<eos> You won't.
You should leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I called you strident?<eos> Yeah. You should leave.<eos> Okay, I will.
Father...<eos> If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
I've lost him!<eos> You must find my wallet.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I have to get it back.<eos> And you will.
It becomes dangerous.<eos> It gets crazy.<eos> We can be kicked out of school. We may even die.<eos> Who is on a prohibited completely mad dip?<eos> I will not.
All I need is a few seconds for you to listen to it.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's taken me a while here, but I finally found a way to make this place work.<eos> I got it, and it'll take all of 2 minutes.<eos> -It won't.
I need you to sign this.<eos> No.<eos> I am not gonna help you sue your brother.<eos> For the sake of the family, would you just give up your lawsuit?<eos> I will not.
- You're gonna bust a cap in my ass?<eos> What if I get the ratings up?<eos> We've got six weeks.<eos> What if I move that needle just enough?<eos> - You won't.
I - I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I... I have to get going.<eos> Well, where are you headed?<eos> Just got to tell my wife that we've lost everything.<eos> But that's not what our broker statement says.<eos> No, but the next one will.
I don't know.<eos> Then bring him here.<eos> I need to look him in the eye.<eos> I already asked him to come.<eos> He won't.
- pleasure..<eos> Oh Jigar.. you did it again. It was fantastic!<eos> Thanks Shimmer.. I was a little nervous.. as always.<eos> Jigar, When will you teach me to dance?<eos> I will.. I will!
That's just not good enough.<eos> Thank you for asking for leniency for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you, I did it for your mom.<eos> My mom won't forgive me.<eos> She will.
- But think of the billions that you're gonna saved.<eos> I can guaranteed you that goddamn Jena tribe casino will never opens.<eos> And before you know it, the Jena tribe gonna be back selling moccasins.<eos> You know, Mr. Abramoff, we can't afford to lose this one.<eos> You won't.
Well, I think it is.<eos> I like Zoo-wee Mama.<eos> You know what? If you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
He had a heart attack last month, my dad.<eos> Look how she mugs him off.<eos> Disgusting.<eos> Well, if you like the bastard so much, why don't you go and visit him when you're in America?<eos> Perhaps I will.
can't feel my toes.<eos> She said you might have trouble with your circulation.<eos> Your hands are warm.<eos> I don't wanna die alone.<eos> You won't.
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?<eos> I care about power, you pinheads!<eos> And I'm gonna get it. Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> - Some stupid park for families to picnic in? - No. No.<eos> No. I care about power, you pinheads!<eos> Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
I think the two victims were just a decoy.<eos> The guard is gonna kill her.<eos> I need to be in that elevator right now. Move. Right.<eos> Please don't let him kill me, Ben.<eos> I won't.
I think if you want to.<eos> I wanted to get better last time, though.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I know. I failed you that time.<eos> But this time, I won't.
- I know. You told me.<eos> For your family, right?<eos> I don't have family.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe one day I will.
You know, no matter what.<eos> No. You know, we'II figure it out.<eos> We'II just figure it out.<eos> I know that you keep saying that we're gonna figure it out but we haven't.<eos> But we will.
She just won't admit it to herself.<eos> I can't tell you if you're right.<eos> Then let me ask you something.<eos> If she chooses me...<eos> She won't.
But Daddy won't let you go hungry.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you know that pain.<eos> I won't let you know the pain this world's got.<eos> I won't.
Do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> A billion years of Time Lord history riding on our backs.<eos> I will not let this perish.<eos> I will not!
No no no.<eos> I'm gonna be all right.<eos> We're right next door if you need anything.<eos> Please let us know the minute you hear from Bobby, okay?<eos> Okay, I will.
Sure. T-ú is by eating the lamb. There's nothing like few kilograms of lamb to reduce excess weight.<eos> It is part of the experience the road.<eos> You can not come to Spain and not eating roast lamb.<eos> "Where will cross the path of the wind with the stars."<eos> What size waist will this guy?
I'm so scared.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You could turn into one of those things.<eos> What?<eos> No, I won't.
What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know why I do what I do.<eos> You ought to stop, Whatever you're doing,<eos> Maybe I will.
Where is it from?<eos> - From the TV stand.<eos> That won't hold your TV.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> It won't.

We can live with that, can't we?<eos> i can't.<eos> easy, little sis. drop it, ewan.<eos> we both know you're not gonna shoot your older brother.<eos> no, but i will.
You ain't gotta love him.<eos> You lie under him, bear his kids, keep his bloodline going.<eos> -Especially now that you done ruined mine.<eos> -l can't go back there.<eos> I won't.
And we all is used to lesser religions.<eos> I'm gonna have to sit this one out.<eos> I guess I don't have the endurance that you all have.<eos> Oh, not to worry.<eos> You will one day.
Send his first Lieutenant, Scott? How do you know I'm someone aboard Destiny? That's a fair question.<eos> You can make this stop.<eos> If I answer your question, you're gonna kill me.<eos> Either way I'm dead.<eos> I won't.
We'll do more once your breath pick up a bit.<eos> Jen, I have to be going.<eos> You want to come say bye to me?<eos> Troy, just still take good care of her.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Not a single soul,<eos> - And don't you tell anybody.<eos> - We have to turn him over to the f.B.I.<eos> You can't ask me to do that.<eos> I won't!
- It is none of our business.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You need to tell Bill.<eos> Well, you're assuming she hasn't already.<eos> All right, I will.
Sonia?<eos> I'm Amy Pindus.<eos> You left me a message?<eos> I need to get him to accept his hand.<eos> He won't.
We've been a family for six years.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Raymond, but you and Cydie's mother weren't legally married, and since you didn't petition to be the child's guardian...<eos> I love that kid like she's my own.<eos> I don't need no piece of paper.<eos> The court will.
You have to let yourself off the hook.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> I'll go home with you and we'll pack up Yelena's stuff together.<eos> Listen, Veronica, thanks again for everything, and please tell reverend Todd that I said I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> That's why I'm sitting in an alley, shivering, puking!<eos> Is there a drought?<eos> - Ain't talking without no cash in hand.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'm not sure, sir.<eos> .. running out of men.<eos> Uh, yes, Commissioner.<eos> Promise me you will help.<eos> Yes, sir, I will.
{\$CARTON}<eos> If you ever wanna help more of us, there's a place I'd like you to visit.<eos> We could use a doctor... And a siren.<eos> This'll help get you there.<eos> - I will.
See?<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're trapped here, forever.<eos> We got to do something with her.<eos> That we will, eli.
I can't do that again.<eos> Sure, you can.<eos> That cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
Can't feed a child sheet music, Will.<eos> I suppose you could for a while, but... they'd be dead in a month.<eos> - I'd like to buy you a beer.<eos> - [Scoffs] No, no. I want to convince you that you're wrong.<eos> - You won't.
This is my family we're talking about here.<eos> It's the only way to keep him safe.<eos> Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.<eos> If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.<eos> I will, devon.
No.<eos> No, not unless...<eos> Why can't I sell you next year's wool?<eos> - You haven't got it yet.<eos> - But I will, in the spring.
To hell with it.<eos> This is amazing, isn't it, Jim?<eos> - Yeah! You'll always remember today, won't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I can't lose him again. - I can't.<eos> - You won't. Once he knows the whole story.<eos> Walter. You saved his life.<eos> I am sure that he will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
Does Peter know?<eos> Have you told him?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm going to.<eos> - No. You won't.
You don't know how things will be changed by your actions, but they will.<eos> It's not our place to adjust the universe.<eos> And you will never be able to look at her again without knowing that, just like every time I look at my son.<eos> I have traveled through madness to figure this out.<eos> And you will too.
She's waiting for me.<eos> Then go and be with her.<eos> Tell glen he was always right About family.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> I will.
He's saying that the love you need to find Isn't romantic love; That you can't find it with somebody else.<eos> That sounds grim.<eos> Tell her it's all around her.<eos> It's in her heart right now, Waiting for her.<eos> I will.
My hair often makes horns.<eos> - That rubber spider didn't scare a five-year-old girl.<eos> Yes, it did.<eos> Mike's been trying to scare her since the third grade, But he never has.<eos> And he never will.
Good.<eos> Now, who should my lawyer talk to?<eos> Lawyer?<eos> You have a lawyer?<eos> No, but I will.
I was misguided... to let one of my father's girlfriends<eos> To hope things may be different.<eos> Your real mother would never turn her back On a chance to know you.<eos> I don't have a real mother, blair.<eos> I never will.
Which is why you must take the disk to Padmé.<eos> Blast it.<eos> Where will you be while I'm in the Senate?<eos> - What if they find you?<eos> - They won't.
I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the Vamp Bar and Grill.<eos> Where are we You brought me to a bar?<eos> I'm not old enough.<eos> They're not gonna let me in.<eos> Sure they will.
Yeah, gonna put in a request to transfer next church.<eos> That in's on Tig, brother.<eos> We'll make it happen.<eos> All right, man.<eos> We will?
- Benny did.<eos> Ah, Benny did!<eos> Bring him up here, I'll kick his fucking head in.<eos> - He's all right. - Is he fuck, mate.<eos> You'll fucking what?
All right, Eddie.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I don't care what you guys are into.<eos> If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again.<eos> What will?
You know I can't do that.<eos> And tomorrow morning, when you wake up, you'll be really relieved I didn't.<eos> Ah, you know, I'm good-looking, I'm rich.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Not to worry. I'll...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> All right, well, you know, you could have just done it with a phone call.<eos> Sure.<eos> And I will.
- I'll do that!<eos> Now I go visit my grandchild.<eos> You know, I have little baby.<eos> - Oh, give them hugs from me!<eos> - I will. Goodbye.
Thanks.<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> Nagato...<eos> Are you going to wait in that clubroom?<eos> I will.
We have to deliver it to the dentist, later.<eos> And that's the tooth haha..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Bob, I want to speak the truth, and I will.<eos> - No, you won't.
And that's the tooth haha..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Bob, I want to speak the truth, and I will.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> I will.
He said we could do them at the same time.<eos> You need to check with your dad.<eos> No. I told the minister you're Charlie's Godfather.<eos> Maddie, your father won't allow...<eos> Yes, he will.
I called the minister.<eos> He's going to do the Christening.<eos> I told the minister that you're Charlie's Godfather.<eos> Maddie, your father won't allow...<eos> Yes, he will.
I am... too far in.<eos> I understand that you're scared, and all the reasons that you don't trust.<eos> Don't you know by now, Peyton, this is what I want?<eos> I have never lied to you.<eos> And I never will.
You tell me.<eos> Oh, come on or do we have to pretend you don't already know?<eos> It might be more fun.<eos> Sir Edmund's such a weasel, I should probably leave you to it.<eos> But you won't.
- Oh, is that how you wanna play it?<eos> - Yeah. Fine!<eos> Keep your stupid bounty, then!<eos> And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.<eos> I will.
Yeah, we'll, uh, be right there.<eos> There is absolutely no way i'm calling riley... To reminisce about a relationship... That just completely blew up.<eos> Owen likes the dynamic in the script.<eos> What if he senses, like, the major tension between us?<eos> No, no, no, he won't, okay?
Mum, if the grocer gives you a penny too much in change and you keep it, is that a lie or a fib or a mistake?<eos> That, Minnie, is thieving.<eos> Mmm. I usually find, child, to avoid painful entanglements, the best approach is to keep it simple.<eos> Just tell the truth at all times.<eos> I surely will, mum.
I think I know how to get us out of here.<eos> It would mean me getting out first.<eos> That's a slice of luck.<eos> And then I'd come back for the rest of you.<eos> Of course you will.
You have one here?<eos> Coal-fired.<eos> Get yourself scrubbed up and we'll talk further.<eos> You have to take me with you. I can't stay here.<eos> Of course we will.
I'll get to it when I have a chance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> I will.
Hey, this is my first time on american soil In over five years.<eos> I'm gonna walk on it, if you don't mind.<eos> So this is it.<eos> Yep. Unless you want me to do something else for you,<eos> Because honestly I will.
We were kind of a family for about five years.<eos> But, uh, when the relationship ended, um, we both decided that it would be best to have a clean break, so the last time I saw Annabelle was when she was seven.<eos> And now... she's scoring the winning goal for Brown against Princeton.<eos> Let me know when Karen's done with her first round of treatment.<eos> I will.
Do you have siblings?<eos> Two younger brothers.<eos> When Lisa's husband left her, I thought it would be a good idea to bring her down here to have some fun.<eos> I'll never forgive myself.<eos> Yes, you will.
Tell us why.<eos> Because it's tearing you guys apart!<eos> We love you.<eos> And even if it doesn't sound like it sometimes, we love each other.<eos> And we always will.
I made a terrible mistake with Marty.<eos> But I made a worse mistake when I asked you... to keep my secret my lie, from your father.<eos> - And for that I am truly sorry.<eos> - It's fine. I'll just quit the National Team.<eos> No, you will not.
What?<eos> You haven't invited them?<eos> No.<eos> - You told everyone they were coming!<eos> - And they will.
I'm in a text-only relationship.<eos> How'd he do on the scanner?<eos> Uh, good, but I need to get him to O.R. before his arm hemorrhages again.<eos> That dressing won't last much longer.<eos> No, but that will.
Really?<eos> Well, it's just so sudden.<eos> I'm worried you might be moving a little fast.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll walk from here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Home -- something you don't have right now.<eos> If you don't trust me, you can check my anklet.<eos> I will!
Oh, they were looking for this egg, this little jeweled egg that Ava had in her pocket, and I called Reynolds and he's gonna put it into the system and see what he can find out.<eos> What's so bloody important about an egg?<eos> Ava won't talk about it.<eos> Well, she'll talk to me.<eos> No, she won't.
How's Scott?<eos> Trying to get better.<eos> Checked himself in somewhere last night.<eos> I hope he does. I do. You want to say I told you so.<eos> But I won't.
Understand?<eos> I thought he was with his friends.<eos> He was. Just not in a good way.<eos> You want to speak to him.<eos> I will.
- Yeah.<eos> - Please don't say it.<eos> I'm still feeling queasy.<eos> Who's going to start?<eos> I will.
So what do you want me to do with these guys?<eos> Give 'em to a sick kid.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> What if your dad comes back to visit?<eos> He won't.
Look, I ain't making no excuses.<eos> You know, I know what I did.<eos> I've spent every day trying to make up for it.<eos> That won't bring the pastor back.<eos> No, it won't.
Not if we move quickly. Thank you.<eos> Any luck getting those medical records<eos> I told you there's no history of anything like this.<eos> Okay. We'll figure out the cause.<eos> We will.
No-one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself!<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
I have to say no.<eos> Oh. Oh, I see.<eos> You're trying the "no" thing on me.<eos> You really think that's going to work?<eos> 'Cause it won't.
It's time to end this!<eos> Will you vacate or do we have to take the door down?<eos> It's unlocked.<eos> Will you step outside?<eos> No, sir, I will not.
You're not even dresd yet.<eos> Everyone's waiting.<eos> Joe, the girl I've been dreaming about-- e one your cousin strangles-- she's r daughter, Joe.<eos> We don't have a daughter. I mean, not yet.<eos> But we will.
You know, unless a local cat does something funny.<eos> Diane, please, please, don't do this!<eos> I won't tell anybody, I swear to God!<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
Plus, what else are you going to do?<eos> All that's on TV are shows about people who want to dance or can't dance or do dance with overly tan celebrities.<eos> But what if Cameron thinks this is a date and falls in love with me?<eos> Just watching you go through that was so annoying.<eos> He won't.
It's all right.<eos> We can mend it.<eos> Don't look so fearful.<eos> But you said we must win, Mrs Brown.<eos> We will, girls.
Well, you're not in it alone.<eos> We're a team. You got me. Hey.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you. But I don't think talking me off a ledge is gonna help us solve our technical difficulties.<eos> Okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.
Have them take her to touro.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?<eos> - All right.<eos> Dominique, call them now, As soon as I hang up the phone, okay?<eos> I will.
Yeah, hi.<eos> Barry dillon, ease.<eos> Yes, I'll hold!<eos> Oh, d just wait till I get to odin.<eos> I will!
This isn't a game.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, tell him, please.<eos> I will.
Her old court documents from when she was a prosecutor have case numbers, criminal code numbers, and then there are zip codes.<eos> Well, that's great and all, but you know, it's not gonna be any good if you starve yourself to death.<eos> She was laughing at me, Booth.<eos> I-I can't let her win.<eos> She won't.
No one really ever tells the truth, do they?<eos> Yeah, some people do.<eos> Like me, for example.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> All right, I will.
I never thought you had the stomach for a partnership.<eos> I'm no longer a part of this agency.<eos> You there, get my shoes.<eos> Bert, calm down.<eos> I will not.
It's a two-year-old's birthday party, and you'll have help, and no one cares.<eos> Is he coming?<eos> I told him about it.<eos> Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.<eos> Well, he won't.
Yeah. Even bobby, sort of.<eos> Well, that, my friend, is what it feels like When you don't have to keep a secret anymore--<eos> Relief.<eos> I just feel like everything's gonna change.<eos> It will.
No more come on (laughs)<eos> All right...<eos> Now get your game face on!<eos> You are going to have to tell her sooner or later Brian!<eos> And I will!
There's a shorthand that exists between us experience together at a level that, quite frankly, I'm just never going to reach with Gale.<eos> Look, Mr. Fring when I accepted your offer, I was told the lab is mine.<eos> And I know best how to run it.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Yes, I will.
Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages.<eos> Sorry, big Phil.<eos> When it comes right down to it, we're Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.<eos> Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.<eos> He won't.
When it comes right down to it, we're Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.<eos> Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.<eos> He won't.<eos> And the pizzas never showed up.<eos> And they won't.
For us.<eos> But we are not that far off.<eos> We might just finish this thing by the time you have to leave.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Why?<eos> You look fine.<eos> Do you want to remain unmarried all your life? - Yes.<eos> And what if you find a strong and fearless man like me?<eos> Still you won't. - No.
Are you getting married for mother or yourself?<eos> - Both.<eos> You must have invited the entire village.<eos> Won't you invite me?<eos> - Of course I will.
I mean...<eos> I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't. Aah!
Some... Better way.<eos> It's okay, Will.<eos> It's fine.<eos> My hope is that, uh... You know, when this whole thing is over, we can... Somehow, you know, find some way to - to keep our relationship.<eos> We will.
You need to sit somewhere.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> - How could David--<eos> - I'll fix it, ma.<eos> I will.
- and you're invited.<eos> - I am?<eos> But I really don't think we should say anything to Sue about it.<eos> Then how will she know to come?<eos> She won't.
- I dropped it.<eos> - You couldn't pick it up?<eos> Well, I dropped it in a drain.<eos> If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
Glenn worth that to you?<eos> What life I have I owe to him.<eos> I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank.<eos> He could have walked away, but he didn't.<eos> Neither will I.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, tell you what, while you're here, why don't you go and pick up an application.<eos> The bureau's always looking for a few good men, and, I mean, with your service record...<eos> Tell Jenny in Personnel that I sent you.<eos> I will.
Dad, he's gone. Theodore?<eos> When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,<eos> I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.<eos> Oh, he's not gonna hate you. He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
I love you, Ty.<eos> Either way.<eos> Please trust that.<eos> You need to go talk to your mom about this.<eos> Yeah, I will.
It's not nothing.<eos> You said you'd take care of it, and you did, and appreciate that.<eos> So does Jason.<eos> Tell him you're welcome.<eos> I will.
Something's brewing.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> Can you tell him I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I will.
Peter mustn't know about us.<eos> No, no he mustn't.<eos> We must never tell Peter anything about these Sunday afternoons we have and what we get up to, must we?<eos> Never, ever.<eos> No, we won't.
How cold do you think it's gonna get tonight?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We are.<eos> We will.
Obviously.<eos> Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> Not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.<eos> Nothing will. Mm.
Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> No!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
She tried to kill jenna.<eos> We can't let her get away with that.<eos> Yes, we can. If it keeps us safe, then we can.<eos> What if she tries something else?<eos> She won't.
Okay, fine.<eos> Then you know what?<eos> You tell her that, Adam.<eos> You tell your daughter that.<eos> Okay, I will.
The two guards I dispatched to retrieve the hybrid's parents were killed.<eos> Release a Soldier.<eos> No Soldier has ever touched foot on Earth.<eos> If the humans become aware of the level of destruction they are capable of...<eos> They won't.
I hate being in this place to begin with and now all I see is her standing at the door.<eos> Look, I've changed, Saul.<eos> The whole family keeps telling me that, so why won't she give me a chance?<eos> - Why can't she see that?<eos> - Well, maybe she will.
Look, sweetheart, you have to talk all of this out.<eos> - That's what you have to do.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Honestly, she'll come back...<eos> - No, she won't, Mom.
Yeah. And I guess because I was raised at a time when a real relationship between two men, much less marriage, seemed impossible, you and Kevin were living my dream.<eos> And when I found out what happened, I just... Suddenly, everything seemed less possible again.<eos> Saul, everything is still possible.<eos> Don't let what I did make you give up hope.<eos> I won't if you won't.
I'm bringing an n.F.L. Team to Los Angeles.<eos> And it won't affect this company, by the way,<eos> Except we all might have really good football seats.<eos> Mike Ovitz couldn't do it.<eos> I will.
He's dead.<eos> Walt's no angel, but he didn't deserve this.<eos> The cops better find out who did this.<eos> Someone's got to bring them to justice.<eos> Someone will.
You know, I just, um, you hear things, you know.<eos> You meet people.<eos> So, uh, I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
- Yes.<eos> He told me that you came up to him and said that you wanted to blindside me now because you don't think you can win against me and all this other stuff.<eos> He's such a liar.<eos> But I'm not voting you tonight.<eos> I won't.
I'm out.<eos> Can you believe they threw out my script and did this?<eos> It's vulgar.<eos> We're so going to win.<eos> No, we won't.
You have to bring him here.<eos> The doctors don't make house calls.<eos> If he is hurt, call the police.<eos> - Maybe they will bring him.<eos> - They won't.
It's up to you, Lauren. She's walking with death<eos> I know it's eight hours later in France, but call me.<eos> As soon as you know anything.<eos> I don't care what time it is.<eos> OK, I will.
Yeah.<eos> He's gonna be all over the news.<eos> Once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
- Okay. Then how about a favor instead?<eos> Convince Ted they should complete Their adventure without me.<eos> - What? Why do you need me to tell him that?<eos> - 'cause he'll say no to me.<eos> - And he won't to me?
We want to continue to retain your services.<eos> To do what?<eos> Infiltrate a terrorist group known as the Fifth Column.<eos> And if I say no?<eos> You won't.
Good plan.<eos> Either way, you lose money.<eos> Oh, so you're already giving her the loan, huh?<eos> She hasn't asked me for a loan.<eos> But she will.
Then finally we are ready.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Merlin suspects me.<eos> Has he told Arthur?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
Deserved?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Leave that shit to God and look after business.<eos> She starts shooting her mouth off...<eos> - She won't.
It means I'll be married, right?<eos> May it bring you better luck than it did me.<eos> The First Lady of the United States.<eos> What will you do, Nan, if he doesn't send for you?<eos> Well, of course he will.
Don't get sensitive on me.<eos> I fucking suck too right now.<eos> I'm in the darkest Third World hole I've ever been in in my entire life about a thousand hundred million miles from where I should be and the only way for me to get back there is for us to join forces.<eos> If we can make enough noise down here then just maybe, everyone in America will hear us.<eos> Everyone will.
This man has actual insight into the psyche of a woman.<eos> I saw all the Emmanuelle movies, including the one where she changed races.<eos> I got plenty of insight into the female psyche, thank you.<eos> Now, will you admit that your book is dated, and that I have more game than you?<eos> I will not.
Gus and I built it from scratch in auto shop.<eos> Spencer, you don't want this case.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> - But you can't have it.<eos> - Oh, but I will.
You're gonna be okay, Gail.<eos> Hold the fort down while I'm gone.<eos> I will.<eos> And don't let Christina get her paws on it.<eos> I won't.
We're always working.<eos> It's just too late in the season.<eos> It's a waste of time.<eos> Well, we need to try.<eos> And we will, okay?
And you and Ricky?<eos> No. No, I don't think so.<eos> I know Ricky's never going to forgive me.<eos> Some day.<eos> Some day he will.
We're here to help.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Keep those photos.<eos> I will.
I knew this would happen.<eos> Listen, of all the things that happened tonight, the one thing that I can't get out of my mind is the look on your face when you thought I had finally done this great thing for you.<eos> And then all I did was disappoint you.<eos> I wasn't a good friend, and I will never forgive myself for that.<eos> Of course you will.
'How strong you felt.<eos> You were as strong as me.'<eos> 'Now, pick one.'<eos> 'Because if you don't...<eos> I will.'
Marry him because... you want his face beside yours in a scrapbook your grandkids are looking through, because you can't stand the thought of not waking up next to him when you're 80.<eos> You're making him your life.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> You're scaring me, like we're not gonna see each other again.<eos> We won't, baby.
You're screwing his sister, ty.<eos> It sort of complicates things.<eos> Yeah, okay. I know.<eos> I can handle this, Alex. What if he tips her off, tells her you're a cop?<eos> He won't.
Wait, Jiao.<eos> Sasha, hold on.<eos> Without a paddle, you can not canoeing.<eos> He paddle like a wimp.<eos> - Will you? .
I can do that better.<eos> It's reality. Rough edges are great.<eos> K.K., you've got visitors.<eos> I love Chelsea.<eos> I always will.
I really believe that.<eos> So we're too late?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, if she did lie and she was pregnant and she did get an abortion, but we don't know that that's what happened, and if she wants to tell us that that's what happened, then she'll tell us, and if she doesn't tell us, then we leave it at that.<eos> Maybe some day she will.
You gonna get involved then?<eos> She's not going to do that.<eos> You never know, son.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She won't.
He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come.<eos> She will.<eos> - No, she won't.
Thought you said there was blunt-force trauma?<eos> There was, but that's not what killed him.<eos> You'll never guess.<eos> He drowned.<eos> Or maybe you will.
I wish we had bigger signals.<eos> When you're a kid, you see these things instantly.<eos> When you grow up, you have other things on your mind, you don't walk with your head in the ground.<eos> If I make it...<eos> Of course you will.
Look, I can't help it if Trent likes me.<eos> OK, first of all, you don't actually know that he likes you.<eos> And I can't believe you think I'm even still thinking about that.<eos> You should go to the thing.<eos> Great. I will.
Do you really think I didn't try to fix this thing with Aife long ago?<eos> I have rooms of books filled with my blood.<eos> Every time, something horrible went wrong.<eos> I can't use my blood again.<eos> I won't.
I'm not mad.<eos> Astor, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.<eos> I should have brought you back here, like you asked.<eos> If you want to move back here, then we will. We'll find a way to make it work.<eos> No, we won't.
Tough.<eos> Silent.<eos> Do not let her get under your skin.<eos> She's, she's not.<eos> She won't. What?
Tell me, do you enjoy thinking about the cow that was skinned to make them, or do you just block that part out for the sake of being fashion-forward?<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Curse words were invented by people too stupid to think of an intelligent response.<eos> - You should print that on a T-shirt.<eos> - Yeah, maybe I will, Rebecca.
I'll try not to.<eos> The most important thing you can do right now is take care of yourself.<eos> Find some time to release your own energy.<eos> Do something for Dexter.<eos> Dexter will.
Rita wouldn't have liked it, but if you want to get rid of them.<eos> If you know Rita wouldn't have liked it, why would you bring it?<eos> It was just an excuse to come round because of what's happened.<eos> - If you don't want it, don't use it!<eos> - I won't. Thanks.
You ok?<eos> Hotch...<eos> What if I mess up?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You won't.
We're closer than ever!<eos> Susan, get off of me.<eos> Violence isn't the answer.<eos> We can't let him get away with this.<eos> We won't.
You're looking for the men who hurt you.<eos> So, what, you're spying on me now?<eos> What are you gonna do if you actually find one of these guys?<eos> Maybe...<eos> What you won't.
You need help?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Tell... Tell... Tell Maryann...<eos> Tell Maryann...<eos> I will.
Pop it back in the wrapper, nip it back round in morning.<eos> You don't have to give me the full quid back, just 50p or summat.<eos> I'm telling you now, mate, smelling it won't do fuck all.<eos> - It will.<eos> - No, it won't, mate.
While you fled the country.<eos> I'm going back, Hanna.<eos> I'm going to take our country back.<eos> And I promise you... you will have your revenge.<eos> We both will.
Keep out of it!<eos> It's not good to steal!<eos> Would you look at what's going on here!<eos> I'll sort it out...<eos> Will you now? Bastards!
Ben, I thought it was clear when I didn't return your 57 messages that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, but apparently you can't accept that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, so I'm just calling to let you know<eos> that I will talk to you at some point, but not over the phone, okay? When I get back, then we can talk face-to-face.<eos> Until then, please stop calling me.<eos> So, you will see me and talk to me when you get back?<eos> Yes, I will.

I can't change anything.<eos> Hey, we just did, at the party just now.<eos> We can make our own fate.<eos> We can stop this.<eos> And we will.
- Did you call all my clients at the mall<eos> And cancel all my business While using the "f" word?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> And I'm gonna do the same with all of your clients.<eos> - No, you will not.

I might have gotten it after her.<eos> You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna do that.<eos> - Then I will.
You can't do that.<eos> - Just watch me. - Oh, yeah.<eos> I know the law around here.<eos> What kind of syrup are you packing?<eos> - Oh. - I... I won't.
He makes the rules.<eos> Why didn't you tell him about the Internet?<eos> He's got a gun pointed at my wiener.<eos> - He's not gonna shoot you.<eos> - Oh, yes, I will.
Now, that man Is honest as the day is long.<eos> And had he not been honest, I never would've Found out he was long.<eos> God, I love your grandma.<eos> You may not believe this now, But you'll get over this man.<eos> Yes, you will.

Centennial academy, which is mostly white...<eos> And cyrus garza, which is mostly black.<eos> - But the question is why.<eos> I mean, we need to prove that the county Is intentionally dividing the students.<eos> - And we will.
I'm sure it isn't.<eos> Let's hope he lives that long.<eos> I don't know what we do.<eos> I could try and persuade Arthur to withdraw from the contest...<eos> He won't.
Nah, that's up to you.<eos> We all have our secrets, right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - But if it ever happens again...<eos> - It won't.
How much time would you think before my bowel is completely healed?<eos> No, if you do this again, you could die.<eos> - Do you understand that?<eos> - Only if I make the same mistakes.<eos> I won't.
Fucking fix it in Pro Tools!<eos> Uhhh, I don't know there, Willy. It's uuuuuh...<eos> I'm sorry, are you being insubordinate?<eos> Do you want to tell Charles you're insubordinate?<eos> Because I fucking will!

You gonna read me my rights?<eos> Offer me a phone call?<eos> I assume you'll want to call your lawyer.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> But you will.
Say...<eos> "Ah..."<eos> Wow!<eos> I can't wait to see it.<eos> Well, hopefully you never will.
Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.<eos> Well, how do you know they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?<eos> It's nothing personal, chief.<eos> It's just, you could have asked.<eos> Next time I will.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> How do you know what the killer's family is thinking?<eos> You said they'll want to apologize?<eos> They will.
In the meantime, try to tell Toki that you don't appreciate being hit.<eos> You tell him!<eos> He won't listen to us.<eos> We know he won't.<eos> No, he won't.
we should get you a wheelchair.<eos> I walk outta here on my own steam Unless I'm in a body bag or a coma.<eos> Don't you people have somewhere to be?<eos> don't let me fall.<eos> I won't.
Please, let me do this.<eos> Okay, so that was...... a little harder than it should've been.<eos> For an uncharted African nation, they've got tech that's decades ahead of anything we've got.<eos> If HYDRA gets their hands on any of this...<eos> They won't.
How so? Did I tell you to go out there in the middle of the night?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Uh, I'll go to the police.<eos> I'll explain things to them. They'll see it's a misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, sure, they will.
If you're going to play detective, I'd prefer you find my car.<eos> Which was stolen a year ago and the reason I'm riding a bicycle in the first place.<eos> We'll have two breakfast specials.<eos> You'll have whatever I bring you and you'll like it.<eos> Yes, we will.
I understand.<eos> Then you understand why I have to fight.<eos> If Uther is killed, so what?<eos> How many of our kind have died at his hands?<eos> How many more will?
If we're to go down, we'll go down fighting.<eos> For the love of Camelot!<eos> I have a feeling I won't be seeing you again.<eos> No.<eos> You won't. Oferswinge!
Oi, you're on the camera.<eos> Get over here.<eos> I couldn't handle 18 months, so no way can I do 18 fucking years.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> And you won't either.
Butwhatmovedhis headabit - it is so for a reason!<eos> Withlove,aman goestomarry !<eos> I will not, dear Prince!<eos> As you wish, prince, I do not let you go!<eos> I will not!
Just get down on your knees.<eos> Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...<eos> First, you get down on your knees, all right? All right?<eos> I want to go back to my cell.<eos> You will soon enough.
But right now, we really need your help.<eos> You need to tell us where they are,<eos> what they want.<eos> If you tell us that, he's gonna let you live.<eos> No, he won't.
But until then, you the gate-opener motherfucker.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Thought that's where you put it.<eos> - How's that gonna help us?<eos> - It won't.
Does anyone need water?<eos> Does nobody want to sing?<eos> Eh?<eos> Nobody?<eos> I will.
Then I'm going to do it.<eos> On my own time.<eos> - I can't stop you.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - But I won't.
This one girl, she...<eos> You know, I hope you're taking this seriously.<eos> I mean that I hope you are trying with all your might.<eos> I cannot lose you to this.<eos> You won't.
If I can't find her and convince her to renounce the lies she speaks against me, I will put your wives and children on the stand to testify to her credibility, and everything that you're trying to hide about your life will come tumbling out in open court.<eos> Don't you dare try to drag my family into this.<eos> I am an innocent man defending himself.<eos> You come at me, I will do everything in my power to see you locked up for the rest of your life.<eos> No, you won't.
I love her.<eos> I know.<eos> Tell her...<eos> Tell her that I'm sorry I kept her a secret.<eos> I will.
I'll be right there.<eos> Did you mean what you said ... about putting the past behind us?<eos> Of course I meant it.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
How's he doing?<eos> Hard to tell.<eos> Larry, so many people have died today.<eos> We cannot let their deaths be for nothing.<eos> We won't.
Tell him what we discussed.<eos> Go ahead and wake him up.<eos> Please, I can't do this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
We could not have gotten this far if it wasn't for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> No one would blame you if this was just too much for you to handle.<eos> Maybe you should get out.<eos> Maybe I will.
Listen, the FBI recovered that database you told me about, the list of names.<eos> I'm in the process of deleting it.<eos> I'm going to erase every trace of it.<eos> I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list.<eos> They won't.
Robinson.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> I promised him.<eos> I promised him he'd see me again.<eos> And he will, but not in this world.
Um, heh... You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.<eos> speaking of, she's walking up right now.<eos> I'm gonna run, okay?<eos> - Tell her I said hi.<eos> - I will.
- I love you, Tycho Brohe.<eos> Okay. Okay. Right.<eos> Let's continue here.<eos> - I so wanna marry you.<eos> - You will.
Because she is gone.<eos> And this family can't be fixed.<eos> And that is it.<eos> And what if one of us freaks out like that?<eos> We won't.
Shocked and saddened.<eos> You can bring him to play at the flat.<eos> And what about your Xbox?<eos> No, he'll trash it.<eos> He won't.
I mean, it's not like he's a relaxed kind of guy.<eos> I suppose this is different.<eos> You're not old enough to have enemies, Luke.<eos> Not...real ones.<eos> But you will, one day.
OK, I want you to stay here with Mina.<eos> When I get back, we'll think of a better plan.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> He'll come.<eos> No, he won't.
We've got 10 minutes to find a dolphin, feed it, then ride it.<eos> Plus, my dad being sick and not being able to chaperone, the fates are with us.<eos> It's a perfect storm.<eos> I don't want to miss the otters.<eos> No, we won't. Um...
Is it true, Lamis?<eos> - No, I was just kidding. God!<eos> - No, she's not.<eos> She's gonna put the tape back there when you leave.<eos> No, she won't.
You don't get it, do you, man?<eos> I want to change my life, bro.<eos> No more shit... just a good life.<eos> Well, I hope it works out for you.<eos> It will.
Come on. Come on.<eos> What?<eos> I heard something. - What?<eos> - Just go check it out.<eos> - I will, in a sec.
It could be airborne.<eos> We'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus. Beyond even.<eos> Exposure to a patient, whether viral, or through touch... that spreads more slowly, but pretty soon, that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs.<eos> Well, we need to know what it is.<eos> Yes, well, we will...
- Great work.<eos> I probably should have stayed home.<eos> I'm not much in the mood for socializing.<eos> You should go and talk to Diane.<eos> I will.
We need to go find that sorcerer.<eos> Well, I hope you're right.<eos> 'Cause right now, I don't trust myself.<eos> What if I do something like that again?<eos> You won't.
Well,I was thinking.<eos> Maybe we can take him to the Valley of Thandor.<eos> The duty of the Sisters of the Light is to protect the children at Thandor.<eos> They'd never take in a male Confessor.<eos> No one will.
Uncle ted is dead?<eos> I shouldn't have left him alone.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> We'll find him, suse.<eos> We will.
Look, I would've called you earlier, but I kept hoping we'd be done.<eos> We're probably gonna be here all night.<eos> You're upset. I can tell you're upset.<eos> Just remember this the next time you're mad at me 'cause I have to put my work first.<eos> I will.
- I thought your word was your bond.<eos> - It totally is.<eos> Definitely.<eos> I just don't have the money at this particular moment.<eos> But I will, soon.
- About what?<eos> She came from nowhere. Drunk.<eos> - They should talk to her, not me.<eos> - Tell them that.<eos> I will.
The pentagon refused to build my design, They called it excessive and unnecessary.<eos> This is a weapon that would eliminate war.<eos> If you wanted Bin Laden dead, Just push in the coordinates and it was done.<eos> But you see nobody listens Unless something horrible happens.<eos> And now, once again, It will.
We had to keep the human race going.<eos> And you did.<eos> No, we did.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you, Dee.<eos> You will this time too.
And good luck to you too, Captain.<eos> Have a safe trip out there, Chief.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
Ok!<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't I go to the village and convince Grandpa to transfer all the property on my name before the wedding.<eos> Has my father-in-law ever listened to anyone that he will listen to you?<eos> He won't.
Eric, you don't know what's going on. Just give it to me.<eos> Well, you better fucking tell me then.<eos> If I don't get that to him, yeah? I'm in the shit. We all are.<eos> You better go and tell him to fuck off.<eos> Or I will, all right?
I don't eat much when I'm working.<eos> I'll unpack the rest.<eos> Come on, let's go before you miss your flight.<eos> You'd better call me.<eos> Oh, of course I will.
- I've made a deal.<eos> And I've seen what they're capable of.<eos> If I don't go today, it won't be the end of it.<eos> - So you won't say anything?<eos> - I won't.
- I guess.<eos> I know you had to relive something today, Jessi.<eos> Something that you saw that was really bad.<eos> You don't have to tell me about it.<eos> - I will.
He killed her!<eos> She's dead!<eos> My mother is dead.<eos> We need to find out why he did it.<eos> We will.
Take it all.<eos> Battering rams, flares.<eos> Everything.<eos> Sir, who got the battering ram?<eos> -I will.
Raid all the Naxal villages.<eos> Shoot at sight, if need be.<eos> That scoundrel burnt so many Naxal villages.<eos> The villagers will lose faith in us.<eos> No, they won't.
(GROANS) What?<eos> He's dead, he can't feel this.<eos> I wonder if they sell cars here with those seats that warm your ass.<eos> Well, why don't you ask him?<eos> Maybe I will.
- He was drunk.<eos> I would hope so.<eos> Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.<eos> Did he pay you back?<eos> No, but he will.
Mr. Reyes has been notified.<eos> And that's my only legal obligation.<eos> Yes, and we both know Mr. Reyes is innocent, don't we?<eos> Do you have evidence to prove that Mr. Sheridan had any involvement?<eos> I will.
Look,what they did to you...<eos> It was...<eos> Awful.<eos> But hurting Courtney is not gonna fix any of this.<eos> Yes,it will.
The light.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Tell Lucy we're sorry.<eos> Tell them all we love them very much.<eos> I will.
You can go hang out with your buddy Robert Logan.<eos> Oh, actually, you can't. He's dead.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> I don't want to end up like Logan.<eos> You won't.
Uh-huh, thanks. It's almost as if we planned it that way.<eos> All right, take it easy.<eos> So, Liz met with the second dealer.<eos> He's in. I really think this plan's gonna work.<eos> - Of course it will.
Hey, Berta.<eos> Chelsea's not feeling well.<eos> Could you make her tea and English muffin?<eos> Sure, I could.<eos> But you won't.
Hero cops, remember?<eos> It doesn't quite add up, does it?<eos> It's your investigation, Hunter.<eos> I want to talk to them.<eos> And you will, but not just yet.
You just keep it together, lad.<eos> I am not going to be the fucking goat!<eos> There's always a goat. It ain't gonna be me.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> Fucking right, it won't.

- Really?<eos> - You're a good writer.<eos> I think you should keep writing.<eos> Thanks, Andrew.<eos> I will.
Uh, mayer?<eos> I, uh, would appreciate it If you wouldn't talk about what we talked about.<eos> I wasn't planning to.<eos> Good, because I'll deny it if you do.<eos> I won't.
I just can't swing it.<eos> We've got to do something.<eos> My editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves.<eos> Could you pick up some extra shifts?<eos> Oh, yeah, I will.
When something goes wrong, this stuff burns like crazy, and I'm not going to have an uncontrollable blaze at the foot of Manattan.<eos> Yeah, a blaze to the foot would be bad.<eos> Charles, my parents are hosting a little soiree at their place tomorrow night for investors, potential partners.<eos> We would love it if you two could come.<eos> Well, then, maybe we will.
[Alex] That's what you need to hold on to for the next couple of hours, OK?<eos> is that a tumor?<eos> He's gonna need more aggressive treatment.<eos> - He'll have to tell his daughter now.<eos> - He won't.
Let's get this thing out.<eos> I never thought it would come day I would have to do something.<eos> Could you give me coverage?<eos> - I never used it in my life.<eos> I will.
And Guy?<eos> Father, may I?<eos> - Robin...<eos> - I want to make the shot.<eos> And you will, but not because of the bow.
Very well.<eos> Go to Nottingham, have the deeds drawn up.<eos> Thank you, my lord.<eos> Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.<eos> And they will.
Arathorn, wait!<eos> Now the line of Kings ends!<eos> The line is not broken. There is still hope!<eos> They will return, Gilraen.<eos> They will.
In this village it is impossible.<eos> - How is your father?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Please, give him my regards.<eos> - I will.
Captain Industry should be behind bars, but now I'm here.<eos> Arthur, why is it so important that you capture Captain Industry?<eos> He killed my mother.<eos> When will I see Mommy again?<eos> You won't.
Is that him?<eos> Why not my place?<eos> It's too small.<eos> We'll disturb you if you want to watch TV.<eos> No, you won't.
- Just a second, listen to me!<eos> - They are savages!<eos> They will kill me. They want their expenses immediately!<eos> - They will wait<eos> - No, no, no they won't!
Meg, will you take one of these and pass it down, please?<eos> What's this? I'm starting a new advocacy group.<eos> The quahog animal equal rights league.<eos> Our first meeting is tomorrow night, And I'd really appreciate it if you guys Would come and show your support.<eos> Well, of course we will, Brian.
KIotz.<eos> Wider path, please.<eos> The King approaches.<eos> You're never going to tell her you love her.<eos> I will. When?
After all I've done, to recant now?<eos> The King can't forgive you if you don't.<eos> ETHAN: I don't want his forgiveness.<eos> I want him to change his mind.<eos> He won't on the land.
It just drops off me when I'm happy.<eos> You blackmailed him into this.<eos> Jack accepted my proposal freely, happily, once he saw the damage it would do you.<eos> It will never happen.<eos> Of course, it will.
I'm just trying to protect you from what could happen to him.<eos> We have evidence that the case against him is a lie.<eos> If I take the stand, I can provide an alibi that proves his innocence.<eos> I will not have brother cross-examine sister, tear her apart, destroy her credibility.<eos> Because I will.
I don't think you can risk putting Will - through what Michael's going through.<eos> - I can't risk putting Will through what Jeffrey's gone through.<eos> I lost one child to autism.<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> - Arlene, you won't...
Whom would the Poles. would listen to more than the best teacher?<eos> We aren't so nad've to believe that the death rate. will drop by the mentioned 95 per cent.<eos> But the number of people saved will be immense.<eos> Unless the Polish Parliament turn their backs on Jesus.<eos> They won't, Father Editor, they won't!
Let's see what we have here.<eos> You'll have to help me.<eos> There's no way I'm dragging all this cheese and jam back to London.<eos> Will you have some red wine or a drop of- what is this- whisky?<eos> No, I won't, thanks.
- If they get us, it's your fault.<eos> - You never listen to me.<eos> - I always listen to you.<eos> - Don't... Don't let them get us, okay?<eos> - I won't. I won't.
I don't know.<eos> Farnsworth.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
That's all right, Alf.<eos> It's my own fault for supposing I have a right to know your affairs.<eos> I'm glad for you.<eos> Truly. I hope I can meet Rose sometime soon.<eos> Oh, you will.
Yes. I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.<eos> How about that?<eos> You call him!<eos> You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.<eos> Yes. Yes. I will.
And you'll be talking to our lawyers, all ten of them.<eos> Fine. Fine. You go ahead and do whatever you u want, but it's not gonna get a book out of me!<eos> Because... I give up.<eos> I can't... I can't go back there.<eos> And I won't.
- Well, he is if they don't do the surgery.<eos> Please, you've gotta do this.<eos> Give us our son.<eos> I can't. I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
I don't believe this. You gotta tell them.<eos> It's the only chance you have of not getting fired.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> They won't find out.<eos> Lightman will.
Hello..<eos> Come on!<eos> Now I have to start all over again.<eos> What if Kewal calls AGM?<eos> No he won't.
Marry me.<eos> Marry me, Dorcas.<eos> Don't say a word now.<eos> I don't have the necessary ring.<eos> But I will, within the hour.
We have no cook now.<eos> I just know following cook book.<eos> And my sister doesn't want to be a cook, too.<eos> If this goes on, our restaurant... It will be closed sooner or later.<eos> And this family business will...
I can't just leave her here. Your priority is to get your little girl off this island.<eos> Now, Shea, crank that sucker.<eos> Thank you...<eos> and tell Trish that I...<eos> I will.
So that no one will come looking for us.<eos> So that we can live our lives together.<eos> Jimmy will sign a confession.<eos> No, he'll never do it.<eos> No. Yes, he will.
So that we can live our lives together.<eos> Jimmy will sign a confession.<eos> No, he'll never do it.<eos> No. Yes, he will.<eos> Yes, he will.
A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
I didn't want this, clark.<eos> I even killed myself to try to escape this life, but the darkness... it doesn't come out when chloe's around.<eos> She makes me... human.<eos> What happens when that changes?<eos> It won't.
- Not with Nathan and Haley. He'll be reading and dribbling first.<eos> They are gonna be amazing parents.<eos> And you are gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> You should have that one day.<eos> And you will.
We'll have a whole new family.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew she'd back out.<eos> She won't tell anyone before we're off-world.<eos> She won't.
People being fired-- Times are tough.<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
And it happens all over again.<eos> I should not have come into work today.<eos> You can't pick the days, Nancy, or what happens in them.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
- I was wrong.<eos> - No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through, but there's still a side of Davis that's human.<eos> So, then what if the plan fails?<eos> It won't.
Nursery schools.<eos> It's going to be great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, all we got to do is survive.<eos> We will.
You look exhausted.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.<eos> Get the information we need and make some informed decisions, and we report...<eos> Could you please stop people running around activating every bloody system they can get their hands on?<eos> I will.
I'm more of a colin farrell, ya know?<eos> Dangerous, yet vulnerable.<eos> Well, if doesn't work out-- uh, it'll work out.<eos> But if it doesn'T.<eos> It will.
You might want to call your clients,too. Tell them they're gonna have to clean their own pools today.<eos> We gotta take your truck.<eos> Yeah,right.<eos> You guys do whatever you got to do.<eos> We will.
Do you've somewhere else you can hide?<eos> I have a shelter up between the hills.<eos> Yes... stay there hidden until I come back.<eos> - You'll never come back.<eos> - Of course I will.
Don't we?<eos> - Please.<eos> I don't wanna die.<eos> - Let him go.<eos> I will.
No brothers.<eos> Just me. My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.<eos> Well, he must be proud of you.<eos> Well, did protecting the President of the United States turn him around?<eos> Yeah. This won't.
- I must go first!<eos> My investigation must go first!<eos> These attempts to pull rank are embarrassing, unacceptable, and potentially an obstruction of justice.<eos> I've a federally mandated responsibility to determine why an LAPD Officer discharged his weapon, which supersedes Chief Johnson's objections, as well as yours, sir, - if it comes to that.<eos> - It won't.
You know they won't let that happen.<eos> If they cancel you...<eos> I won't want to live.<eos> I'll step in front of the first bullet_BAR_shot at me.<eos> No, you won't.
This is a couples thing.<eos> My wife is very excited.<eos> - As was I. - What's really going on with you?<eos> - What if your wife doesn't like Marlo?<eos> - Of course she will!
about my biological clock.<eos> But, you know, he's fully qualified to do that, because he has such a deep understanding of womanhood.<eos> Shouldn't you be defending me?<eos> Talking up my good points?<eos> Well, yeah, I will later.
- Not me. - You were late.<eos> You were early.<eos> The target made you, and you got yourself killed.<eos> I love you, Sam.<eos> I always will.
- Ma'am, what's the problem? - They're out of chicken nuggets.<eos> I've eaten them every day for 15 years.<eos> You called 911 because they're out of chicken nuggets?<eos> - What am I supposed to do? - I don't know. But right now you need to bring it down.<eos> - No, I won't.
You can cut into my brain again.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can do it, but...<eos> I don't want to end up a vegetable.<eos> Izzie, you won't.
Stay where you are!<eos> Drop to the ground with your hands up!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Take another step, and I'll blow your brains out!<eos> No, you won't.
What the hell. It's all gonna melt when I cook it.<eos> Maybe I'll freeze it then.<eos> - Mama, what the heck are you doing? - Hot sauce.<eos> Oh, God. Nobody's gonna eat that.<eos> He will.
Blondie's due date is right around spring break.<eos> You and I are gonna have a little ladies' week... at a spa down in Cincy that caters to the prenatal set.<eos> But in reality, we're gonna be camped out at Woo's office with Quinn... until that high school hussy drops. Oh.<eos> That's a great plan... except for the fact that Quinn won't give us her baby anymore.<eos> But she will, dummy.
I mean, no one's hiring.<eos> I almost got in at olive garden, But they said I was too tall to be a busboy.<eos> Somewhere in that pea brain of yours is a man.<eos> Access him and tell him to prove to me That I chose the right guy to have a baby with.<eos> I will. I
My babies just need a place to feel safe at night.<eos> We don't make a mess or nothin'.<eos> You ain't gonna tell?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
You're too close to this.<eos> I'm not the only one too close.<eos> She say anything yet?<eos> Nope.<eos> She won't.
There's no doubt in my mind that Nikki shot me and Frank.<eos> Mine either.<eos> Are you talking about going on the record?<eos> And what happens later if you decide you're still confused?<eos> I won't.
Spencer, I need you to shut up.<eos> Come on, people!<eos> If we don't do something right now, we're done!<eos> He's right, we got to do something. [crowd gasp in shock] Now, I don't want to have to do that to anybody else...<eos> But I will.
Fine. -I will help you.<eos> -Oh, my gosh. Thank you.<eos> After I slam his dick in this drawer.<eos> -Let's go. He's not gonna help.<eos> -No. No. I will.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> And for your information, it's a gallon of strawberry ice cream.<eos> Oh! Oh, I see.<eos> Well, you have a good night.<eos> I will.
Maybe you can trade it for a dog.<eos> I still want a dog.<eos> We're not getting a dog once we get back in the house. Exactly.<eos> Who knows if we'll get back in the house?<eos> Sure we will.
He is not!<eos> Oh, honey. I was just kidding.<eos> Aw... Honey!<eos> If dad finds out about tonight I¡¦m dead.<eos> - He won't.
They just got him stabilized.<eos> He's in surgery.<eos> Which way?<eos> They're not gonna let you back there, Olivia.<eos> Like hell they won't.
No, no.<eos> I have those. But Kerrigan saw them.<eos> And there's just one problem.<eos> We're screwed if he wakes up.<eos> He won't.
All right, I'll let you work this one case with me if you promise to leave me alone when it's over and not to weasel your way back in.<eos> Deal.<eos> But fair warning, detective.<eos> I will make you change your mind.<eos> - I won't.
- I found the perfect spot.<eos> Right here.<eos> After the reading from Ecclesiastes and right before We've Only Just Begun.<eos> - I am not doing that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Traveling with her sometimes does have its perks.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> What if he recognizes me?<eos> He won't.
I teed this one up for you.<eos> All you got to do is sell Murray on it and the credit's all yours.<eos> I get it. All I got to do is tell Murray Berenson that Bob Saget wants to fuck in his office.<eos> I don't believe it and I'm just not gonna do it.<eos> Then I will.
You know, for the first time in 5 years, When i get dressed in the morning, I don't automatically reach for black or brown or navy blue.<eos> I'm wearing pink today, cal, pink,<eos> Because i like pink.<eos> I'm divorced, and i'm free, and i'm happy, And if you do something to screw that up--<eos> I won't.
How?<eos> I'm not going to Nationals.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Sasha will cool off, And tomorrow he'll forget all about it.<eos> No, he won't.
I am not some junkiewho needs drugs to get through the day.<eos> I am a guywho got in over my head,and with a little help,<eos> I am getting out... that is,if you will help.<eos> Hank?<eos> Of course I will,but not this way.
I'm only halfway there.<eos> I didn't get to see the finish line.<eos> I'll show you. Not much room, but you don't mind, right?<eos> It'll be too heavy. You can't win.<eos> Yes, I will!
- no kidding.<eos> I mean, if i were you, i would change my name.<eos> Like now.<eos> They'd probably let you do it over the phone.<eos> - no, they won't.
It is our will that she also die by confession.<eos> CROWD:<eos> Yes.<eos> Will the Mother Confessor abide by the wishes of our elders?<eos> I will.
But I was wrong.<eos> Dean I was wrong.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> Say yes.<eos> But you won't.
Zoe, can you see if there's any more cartridges in the back, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> Vincent will get us out.<eos> No, he won't.
You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not gonna let some college counselor who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings get in my way.<eos> I just have to find a way to get into CU.<eos> And I will.
So you want mom to know?<eos> You want to destroy her life?<eos> Your mom finding out that I had an affair won't destroy her.<eos> Her finding out that you knew about it?<eos> Yeah, that will.
You mean Mom?<eos> Your words, not mine.<eos> Look, uh, your mom and I are a team, and she- we feel like this is a chance for you to show some responsibility.<eos> Don't make us look like jerks here.<eos> I won't.
It's the only one they had.<eos> Tthank you, Monk.<eos> I realize how hard this must have been for you to have Natalie buy it for you.<eos> Okay, I bought it, but Mr. Monk paid for it.<eos> Or he will.
We're just going to find out what daddy's up to, aren't we, baby boy?<eos> Yes, we are!<eos> And if he's got nothing to hide, he won't mind if I go through all his stuff, will he, baby boy?<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
I'll back you up, man.<eos> Hey, thanks, man. I tell you what will help.<eos> Shotgun a beer?<eos> That'll calm my nerves.<eos> It sure will.
Midnight.<eos> Mm.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I'm not sure I'm going to have enough time.<eos> Of course you will.
Mm.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I'm not sure I'm going to have enough time.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> Of course you will.
Now, please, give me the spell.<eos> Close your eyes and open your mind.<eos> Few men have ever been gifted such knowledge.<eos> Use it wisely.<eos> I will.
Once.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell him I don't know if we were good for each other...<eos> But he--he was the best thing I ever had.<eos> I will.
They offered two, and we ask for four?<eos> It's how the game is played, Nate.<eos> You're sure they won't stop playing?<eos> Buddy, trust me.<eos> They won't.
This is a matter between gentlemen, Mother.<eos> Please, give us the room.<eos> As you wish.<eos> This will not happen, Snot!<eos> Indeed, it will, Steve.
Is that a bad thing? what do the shadows<eos> Have against going into the light? I'm taking a huge risk just being here.<eos> Hold on! are you saying the shadows<eos> Had something to do with what happened to aiden? All i'm saying is if you and melinda Aren't careful, they will.<eos> They will.
why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road?<eos> a forensic countermeasure?<eos> covering his tracks by sheer distance?<eos> so the geographical profile won't do us much good.<eos> no, it will, just not with the victims.
He loves you and me. He's struggling between us.<eos> Forget about him, first...<eos> They have come, you said he'll not but I said he will.<eos> He told him.<eos> - He will not.
No, Erica.<eos> He broke up with me last night, so... so, no, there's absolutely nothing going on.<eos> You need to go to the principal about this.<eos> Jenny, you have to go to the principal about this.<eos> Or I will!
May I now kiss the bride?<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Can you really do this without consulting your mother first?<eos> Please, focus on getting that money back.<eos> Oh, I will.
I am.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to govern the people of Camelot, to uphold the laws and customs of the land?<eos> I... do.<eos> Will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?<eos> I will.
I mean, the flutter that you get in your stomach when you first kiss someone and your lips part your tongues...<eos> Stop. Just stop.<eos> I gotta sit.<eos> I need it, too, but if you tell anybody...<eos> I won't.
Okay, maybe it's not my egg, but it's got your DNA.<eos> Honey, it's your child.<eos> It's not that I don't love it. I do. But ght now...<eos> I love you more. I can't even think about losing you.<eos> But you will.
I was dead.<eos> I made sure that I was pronounced dead on the premises.<eos> Where were you for the last nine months?<eos> I can't tell you now. But when the time is right,<eos> I will.
I took the day off today so we could be together.<eos> After all, abby, We're a team.<eos> There's no "i" in your team.<eos> You'll resist at first, And maybe I'll wait for you to come around.<eos> Or... Maybe I won't.
But then again, these elevators can take forever.<eos> Cyrus, enough.<eos> Yes, enough.<eos> I will. I will tell her.<eos> I will.
How do we fight that many?<eos> We don't.<eos> These are the men who killed our fathers.<eos> We can't let them live.<eos> We won't.
Fine, between friends.<eos> You know, I probably shouldn't leave Naomi for too long since she's my date and all.<eos> I'm sure she'll survive.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course she will.
Then you'll know what to do.<eos> I meant what I said today.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> And I need to do what's best for Jack.<eos> You will.
Don't shoot!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Don't come any closer.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> But they will.
All right.<eos> Then take it off.<eos> We don't need it.<eos> But it could blow.<eos> But it won't.
That's life. You can't change the world.<eos> Have you ever tried?<eos> That attack could have been gang-related.<eos> They'll find you and no one will help you.<eos> But you will, won't you?
And then?<eos> And then we have to make sure the father in law reads it.<eos> But then won't he ask his son, 'Were you suspecting it too?<eos> '<eos> He won't.
Because it's wrong.<eos> So then you've learnt a valuable moral lesson.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> And you'II never do anything wrong again, as long as you live.<eos> -No, I won't.
And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time.<eos> Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.
So you could grand me a tiny portion of her land?<eos> She never marry you.<eos> Your blood is not noble enough.<eos> - You are leaving today for Denmark.<eos> - I will not.
But he had what he needed.<eos> He had love.<eos> He never lost sight of what was really important.<eos> - Easy with that. Careful.<eos> - And neither will I!
That was the problem.<eos> Nobody else did.<eos> Of course I can tell you what my film is about. I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I'm going to cast and the music I want to use.<eos> I can tell you everything.<eos> But I won't.
-Yeah.<eos> I'd rather sell it.<eos> Seems like you could give it away or something.<eos> -You should check into that, Daddy.<eos> -All right, I will, SJ.
Or it would be if the other one of us wasn't so desperate to get married... ... atThePlaza,becauseThePlaza is the only happy memory... ... shehasof herchildhood.<eos> So, oops, that's--<eos> Right.<eos> One of us will have to move her date.<eos> Yep, one of us will.
Why give her the satisfaction?<eos> Wouldn't give her the pickings out of me handkerchief.<eos> - He's not saying much, is he, Tom Cruise?<eos> - He's keeping his head down, hoping it will go away.<eos> - Well, it won't!
You have me.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll take the kids.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> - I will.
This is rough.<eos> But what can I do?<eos> If I make him choose between you and me, I know the best I could do would be to tear him in half.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't.
No, you can't do this.<eos> I have to, Saul.<eos> She's dying. And we both know it.<eos> As your XO, I can't let you do this.<eos> I won't!
Come on, guys, whoever did it, just confess so we can get out of here.<eos> Why are you looking at me and Lutz?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I think Lutz will tell you that, uh, I'm innocent.<eos> No, I won't, dude.
You made a vow to callie and a vow to god.<eos> you just don't walk away from that.<eos> This is your soul we're talking about.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No,you will not.
It's publicity.<eos> It's publicity.<eos> It's something to tell the papers.<eos> It's a story. "I am a samurai, should this gaijin defeat me I will surrender my fucking belt."<eos> And will he?
I ask you only one thing:<eos> that you allow me to serve and worship you.<eos> As Lancelot served and worshipped Guinevere.<eos> Sweet gentle Lady, will you let me so?<eos> I will.
This is not America.<eos> You're scaring the other passengers.<eos> If you don't stop, I'll confine you to a locked compartment.<eos> You said you'd help.<eos> And I will.
If I go everyone's, problems will be solved.<eos> You can't!<eos> No?<eos> I can't put Debbie through this.<eos> I won't.
So what if they do?<eos> He left drunk.<eos> He fell in a ditch.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> You won't.
- No No pictures<eos> She said, no pictures.<eos> Oh, and what are you gonna do, huh?<eos> Call Secret Service?<eos> - Ow! - No, but I will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> Well, don't sell it to any weirdoes, okay?<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
Dude, you're fucking squirting everywhere.<eos> - You're a squirter. - Shane.<eos> What about my brother?<eos> I don't wanna lose him.<eos> You won't.
- Now the doctors-- they want to--<eos> - I know there's something wrong with me.<eos> I don't need a doctor to tell me.<eos> Because it's never good news when they wanna run more tests.<eos> And they will... tomorrow.
But I want you to stay.<eos> So do I.<eos> But your mom's the boss and what she says goes.<eos> I wish you were my little boy.<eos> I always will.
So Are You, Um, Packing Up Your Music?<eos> Nah.<eos> I Just...<eos> Need To Find Something New To Write About.<eos> And I Will.
- Oh, wow, this came out pretty sharp.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The umlaut was my idea.<eos> - You made him sell you his soul?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
- All right. Okay.<eos> - One more bite.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Alexis is gonna freak out when she sees this.<eos> - No she won't.
If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
20 minutes.<eos> Shake some hands on the rope line, meet and greet with the mayor.<eos> Well,that sounds like the time for us to make our move.<eos> You got the password yet?<eos> I will.
And there was a woman with the same last name in a nearby refugee camp. But she wasn't related.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I really wanted you to have your family at the wedding.<eos> I will.
Please, Hoyt, if anyone needs sunblock, it's you.<eos> Your skin's whiter than Desitin.<eos> Mama, I'm gonna move out.<eos> I swear it, I will.<eos> You won't.
-Writing notes, for Jordan.<eos> She's dead.<eos> -Yeah, I remember watching her fall.<eos> -Me too. How will she get the notes?<eos> -She won't.
We also found a jeep registered under the name Roberto Rosa.<eos> We are trying to locate it now.<eos> We're not sure if he keeps it on the island or the mainland to get from one crime scene to the next.<eos> It's a lot of ground to cover but we'll fucking find him, Tom.<eos> - No, you won't.
Oh, that is nice.<eos> Okay. This is what we're gonna do.<eos> You will go where he says, you will give him your cash, and then you will hit the deck when the bullets start flying.<eos> Once Michael's dead, then you can run, and, Drew, if you ever come back, I will find you.<eos> - I won't.
He won't give it back;<eos> he'll just sell it.<eos> Don't you remember I lost my phone just, like, a month ago in a cab, and I never got it back.<eos> If you give it to the cab company then they'll-- they'll call the people that--<eos> No, they won't.
Well, that bruise should show up about the same time as the state attorney, I would say, don't you?<eos> Now, Horatio, tell me.<eos> Are they gonna believe me, or are they gonna blame a cop who got extradited to brazil for killing a man?<eos> Just remember what I said, Ron.<eos> I will.
I just got you back.<eos> Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now, then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.<eos> Your father's gonna forgive you.<eos> Why don't you let me drive?<eos> He won't.
- Yes!<eos> What nonsense, daddy?<eos> This is not nonsense, this is serious lt can't be announced right away that this was a joke.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will.
- Greg.<eos> - Just kind of--<eos> - Greg.<eos> No. - So let's say this actually happens.<eos> - Which it will.
Yes?<eos> No?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Jason and Cindy cannot beat you again in Miami.<eos> - They won't.
Harry.<eos> Harry!<eos> Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.<eos> Yeah. If I have to...<eos> I will.
So you tell me.<eos> Do I wait for you?<eos> I want you to.<eos> But I understand if you can't.<eos> Well, I will.
Drop it!<eos> I'll kill her, I swear to God!<eos> I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Father, you will see me again.<eos> I'm sure I will.<eos> Susannah will get me a pardon. And when it's safe for me to return to London, she'll put a notice in the London Gazette.<eos> You'll never see that.<eos> One way or another I will.
Like I care.<eos> What if something happens?<eos> What if it was the last time?<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - No... you won't.
I didn't think things through.<eos> It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
Those are hot-oil burns on your hands.<eos> Did the colonel spatter when you deep-fat-fried him you sick son of a bitch?<eos> Pixie dust and lemonade.<eos> You have no proof. That story will never hold up in court.<eos> This will.
Come on, you gotta pull yourself together.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me. We just have to make it until 9:00 am.<eos> When the bank opens, they'll open the vault.<eos> No, they won't.
Uh, like I told you,it's my daughter.<eos> Um, she... uh,she worries about people, and at times, it-it... seems like she's very... prescient. Do you know what I mean by that?<eos> I think I can guess.<eos> Will you please tell her I appreciate her effortson my behalf?<eos> I will.
We'll get you some more and you can make a birthday crumble.<eos> Have we met before, Alex?<eos> I was scared and I was so alone, and you took my hand.<eos> What would you do if your goddaughter found out?<eos> She won't.
Says who, huh?<eos> You?<eos> It's your word against mine, bud.<eos> I just want this to end.<eos> It will, all right?
And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.<eos> A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?<eos> Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.<eos> Ask different questions, Duck.<eos> I will, Jethro.
You just wait till she comes back, though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, grandma.<eos> Well...<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yep. We will.
He is always the king.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry because he's never coming back here again.<eos> So you can have your crown back.<eos> - Okay, let's say, he does come back.<eos> - He won't.
- It won't come to that.<eos> I can feel it coming. It's pushing me out.<eos> What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?<eos> We will figure something out, Beth.<eos> No, we won't.
He matters.<eos> And I've lied to him for long enough.<eos> What he did today was so brave, braver than any of us because we signed up for this.<eos> He did it because he loves me, and I won't take that away from him!<eos> I won't!
And now everything's going to be fine.<eos> You can keep my secret for me, can't you, baby?<eos> And you'll never tell daddy the truth?<eos> Even if he asks?<eos> No, I won't.
Hey, there's a spot.<eos> Where? Here.<eos> It's teeny.<eos> No one will notice that.<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Bring my brother to the center of Market Square in Santa Luna, Mexico.<eos> Sundown, this Friday.<eos> Once my brother is released, you'll get the girl.<eos> At one minute later, if I don't see my brother, I'll assume you want me to kill her.<eos> And I will.
But my favorite part is<eos> If you're lost you can look<eos> And you will find me<eos> I love this part<eos> You will, huh?
Right.<eos> Right.<eos> We should just... just leave them, then, eh?<eos> We should.<eos> But you won't.
I just got caught up in the passion of it.<eos> It was like it was waiting, calling to me.<eos> I suppose you can't leave the poor thing unfinished.<eos> - I can and I will.<eos> - Oh, no, you won't.
All right.<eos> Peace out.<eos> But check this, okay?<eos> If I take one step out this door, you'll never see me again.<eos> Yeah, I Will.
You coming here to find out That you and I are brothers.<eos> Brothers?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that you've come all this way, peter, But I can't help you.<eos> Can't?<eos> I won't.
Oh, you got to love the irony.<eos> I mean, it's like a greek tragedy or something, right?<eos> Okay, mom,<eos> Do it.<eos> I won't.
I'm going to have to get out.<eos> What about your men?<eos> No sign, but don't worry, we've got contingency plans.<eos> - If Nick finds out...<eos> - Well, he won't.
A couple of lines?<eos> It's still very rough. - I want to hear it.<eos> Now? - Yes.<eos> Men, Lanze's going to sing a song.<eos> - No, I won't.
- What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> - l won this for you.<eos> - Don't want it.<eos> - Will you please take it?<eos> - l won't.
Lucky you.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> Man, you said we were gonna get jiggy!<eos> I said you'd get laid, Jake.<eos> And you will.
Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> just you wait, Mum.<eos> What if it never gets better?<eos> Course it will.
Ok,you guys go help with the funeral band too?<eos> Yeah,buy another casket?<eos> 'cause that was donated by the community.<eos> - We'll pay for a new casket.<eos> - We will?
Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.
That's wonderful. Can you keep it up till I get there?<eos> All right, I want to make sure we're all on the same page here.<eos> This wedding will be ruined if Mom finds out... ... hersonandfuturestepdaughter have been carrying on behind her back.<eos> -Don't worry.<eos> -She won't.
You know, baby, We can go wherever We want to go.<eos> The money that I saved up,<eos> You know, you and I Just buy a house, Just escape.<eos> My daddy finds us, He'll kill you. I know he will.<eos> No, he won't.
You know, you and I Just buy a house, Just escape.<eos> My daddy finds us, He'll kill you. I know he will.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> He will not hurt you again.<eos> No one will.
I mean, how can one man stop all that?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He can do it.<eos> Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him he'll have to answer to me.<eos> I will.
My heart... It's getting slower.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> In your mind, you've got so many plans.<eos> There's so much that you want to do.<eos> And I will.
Now's your chance.<eos> You're never gonna answer for it.<eos> Not in this world.<eos> That's right.<eos> Didi will.
Sara. This is a good thing.<eos> You made me mortal.<eos> Only to lose you.<eos> We should have had more time.<eos> We will.
let him see the truth.<eos> - He won't like it.<eos> - None of us like it.<eos> Well what if it pushes him in the wrong direction?<eos> It won't.
Everybody's a liar.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> What if he finds out where you're keeping him?<eos> - He won't.
I have to go.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Leave me alone, do you hear me?<eos> I won't let you do this to me.<eos> I won't.
This is totally normal, but we can't make it better if you run away from me.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You can't tell anybody.<eos> I won't.
Cos you are just their bitch.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> - What if he finds out you're keeping him alive?<eos> - He won't.
I'm just saying...<eos> Look, you, you know what I'm saying.<eos> I know. We have to sell it.<eos> Um, yes. Hold on, hold on, sweetie, hold on.<eos> Yeah, well, we will.
It's ok.<eos> I got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that i didn't do anything with those other guys.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> I will.
Don't! Unh!<eos> You will not bind his hands!<eos> It's ok, I am not gonna hurt him.<eos> I'm just gonna make sure-- no!<eos> You will not.
Aren't you curious why I wasn't?<eos> Yes!<eos> Do you want me to find out why you weren't told?<eos> - If it's important to you.<eos> - Fine. I will.
You're under oath as a material witness, ms. Montenegro.<eos> I swore to tell the truth, and the truth is that I am not saying anything.<eos> judge haddoes, could you...<eos> - The witness will answer.<eos> - No, the witness will not.
I wish you hadn't have done that.<eos> Be smart, Sookie, and just let him.<eos> There's still somebody out there who wants to kill you.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
You are way above the Greek noise limit!<eos> Hysterical.<eos> - Now get out of here.<eos> - Before we do sir, if you wouldn't mind blowing into this before you drive your lovely date home.<eos> I will not.
And Nina's gonna have a vegetable garden because she loves to garden.<eos> And...<eos> Why is this happening, David?<eos> Why can't we fix it?<eos> We will, Bob.
And...<eos> Why is this happening, David?<eos> Why can't we fix it?<eos> We will, Bob.<eos> We will.
You find the lab, I'll make them own up, believe me.<eos> We may never know who's responsible for this.<eos> But if we're right, It's still out there. It's likely to kill again.<eos> You wanna call the Sheriff?<eos> Yeah, I will.
- You know Denny.<eos> He could break his arm and you wouldn't know it.<eos> He's really suffering.<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
Some of them are lucky to be alive.<eos> I chose the room, the chairs, the program.<eos> I just spent so much time trying to get it right.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Next time you will.
Did everybody get some pizza?<eos> Uh, did you guys get some pizza?<eos> Because I ordered plenty of pizza.<eos> So, please, make sure that you get some, sir.<eos> I will.
She did it as a bet.<eos> One more time, that's not true.<eos> Say what you like, I know it was a bet.<eos> - Ask her.<eos> - I will.
Are they?<eos> Mommy!<eos> They're called little creepers.<eos> Oh, is it so wrong that I just want to have one of these to grow up and resent me?<eos> Oh, you will.
I didn't get it before, Miguel, but you can't be reasoned with, guilted, controlled.<eos> This whole back-and-forth game for leverage is pointless.<eos> That's right! I'll do what I want, when I want, to whomever I want!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.

So...<eos> Can she look at mine?<eos> Honey, what are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't help it, I... I wanted to look.<eos> Will you?

You're jumping the pool?<eos> Wow!<eos> Yeah, it's the real deal.<eos> You should come.<eos> Maybe I will.
She really wouldn't mind when I tell her what you're doing.<eos> That's fine, but I don't think the laws of the council will allow it.<eos> I'm not a Traveller.<eos> You might have to be a Traveller to enter the Puck, boss but to live with us, all you need is not to have a house.<eos> In a week I won't.
We charge our friends to have sex with them. - All right.<eos> - You see?<eos> Now listen.<eos> We start a little country club, okay?<eos> A "Cougar Club," if you will, right?
Nothing to do with bomb-making.<eos> Just detection, using trace paper technology.<eos> You can check it out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.

Man, this is hard to spell.<eos> Swagger is going to go with what he knows.<eos> He'll try to track the shooter.<eos> He won't get far that way.<eos> Yes, he will.
I'll be on my arse again, won't I?<eos> Jobless, telling war stories to the rest of the drunkards.<eos> No, it's different now.<eos> You and me, we can do big things here.<eos> You will.
Shit.<eos> We find Guardo...<eos> He dies the same way.<eos> Only slower.<eos> Yeah. He will.
- No man.<eos> - That's why you... can't get reckless. You hear me?<eos> I'm gonna need your help to finish this thing.<eos> I can't lose you, too, Shane.<eos> You won't.
But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
So is someone gonna say, like, "action"?<eos> - Would you like that?<eos> - If you like it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I will.
- Yes, you are right.<eos> The horse, left we are leaving too.<eos> Bye. - Bye. - Thank you.<eos> Don`t take tension at all, once the grass grows back..<eos> The grass will..

- Yes, I can see it.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Will I get a shock?<eos> - You will find out.<eos> No, you won't.
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
You do that and Ben dies. - Go.<eos> - No, you think I'm lying?<eos> You think that this is a bluff?<eos> I will let him die.<eos> No. Jack. You won't.
I'M REALLY SORRY, REGINA.<eos> LOOK, I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.<eos> I JUST WANTED TO BE THE MAN YOU WANTED.<eos> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.<eos> BUT YOU WILL.
She said that?<eos> She did.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I gotta get back to work, but you should ask me in sometime.<eos> I will.
It runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<eos> It's never been shut down.<eos> So how do they do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who will?
He took a neighbor's horse so he could give his girlfriend a ride on the beach.<eos> Officer batista laughed when i asked him if julio might've been a hit man.<eos> Then he cried when i told him julio was dead.<eos> - You don't have to say it.<eos> - I won't.
No, you loathsome creature, I am Samswope!<eos> Come on, Bedzyk, it's not that bad.<eos> At the very least, we are still alive.<eos> We'll find a landfall.<eos> We will... - All in the fullness of time.
Just not to me.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> Give her time.<eos> What if she doesn't?<eos> She will.
But you've never been the affectionate type now, have you?<eos> Thank you, Pullo.<eos> - I'll be hearing about the grain, then, will I?<eos> - Perhaps Bibulus will succeed?<eos> - No, he won't.
But I haven't been able to come in there, because... you know...<eos> Come in and eat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> All right, I will.
You do?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> So... so tell me.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
- It'll be separate rooms by then, dear.<eos> - Oh, no, that told you.<eos> I wouldn't let you go into a home.<eos> - You might not have a choice.<eos> - I will.
Lex isn't satisfied playing in his own backyard anymore.<eos> LuthorCorp is starting up divisions of 33.1 all across the globe.<eos> Wherever there's evidence of people with abilities... there'll be laboratories to do experiments.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> We won't.
You, uh... you checked up on my story?<eos> Yeah, for good reason. Your story doesn't check out.<eos> The cab is on its way.<eos> Now before you go, tell Ryan the truth.<eos> Or I will.
Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
I don't suppose you asked what this alleged bad guy did.<eos> Actually, I did, dean.<eos> And the angel told me.<eos> He hasn't done anything... yet.<eos> But he will.
Father?<eos> You know why.<eos> you want me to step into this and fight that thing outside?<eos> Correct.<eos> I won't!
I need to say that I'm sorry. And I was stupid and lame.<eos> - And if I could take it all back, I swear.<eos> - Tell her it's ok.<eos> Tell her she's a really good person and it's ok to let others see it.<eos> I will.
Naomi never dated anybody with a job before.<eos> At least not one that's indoors and legal.<eos> I understand.<eos> Well, you let me know if you need anything.<eos> I will.

He says the test results are in, but he's not telling me anything.<eos> Is it... serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bloody hell, Chloe. Whatever it is, I'll help you get through it.<eos> - No, you won't.
Right now, the best way... the only way... to do that is to let you go.<eos> I hope one day you can understand that.<eos> I hope one day you can forgive me.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.

Thanks Tone.<eos> Relax.<eos> We'll sell it tomorrow.<eos> Where?<eos> We just will.
He's great and so's Ted.<eos> Oh, I think he popped it back into joint.<eos> You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.<eos> I can't miss this.<eos> I just... I won't.

My father brought me here so we can be happy.<eos> Well, you're going to have to take charge, okay?<eos> I want you to make sure your father does not get out of bed, that he gets lots and lots of rest.<eos> Will papa get better?<eos> Yeah, he will, yeah.
- It was a directive from the IOA.<eos> - Well, they don't need to know.<eos> - Ronon, she's... I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.<eos> It is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.<eos> And it will.
I was at the gym.<eos> Feel free to check.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I will.

You can fight the dark side, mate.<eos> You really can.<eos> You too, Connor. Move away!<eos> He will kill you.<eos> No he won't.
No knock.<eos> I'm a dog lover myself, but Julie deserves better.<eos> You know you'll just end up cheating on her.<eos> No, I won't hurt her again.<eos> Sure you will.
Come on.<eos> I'm not that hard up.<eos> Look, she didn't like me.<eos> So what?<eos> On to the next who will.
As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
You say that like they are!<eos> Oh, they are!<eos> I'm such a terrible liar!<eos> Look, you have to promise me, you can't tell anybody!<eos> Of course I won't.
Listen to me...<eos> Please don't, honey...<eos> You promised not to get involved again.<eos> I have a feeling that it'll kill you.<eos> It won't.
You stay there and do as your husband told you to do.<eos> Keep your door closed and locked!<eos> f I hear anything I'll come right back and let you know.<eos> - Tell him I love him!<eos> - I will!
The baby's his, and I still love him.<eos> So call the cops. Have him locked up.<eos> Will you ever forgive your mom for calling the cops?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.<eos> I won't.
If you say yes.. ..then both your relationships will have.. ..a sword dangling over them for life.<eos> No, daughter!<eos> Wait here. I'll do something..<eos> No, mother.<eos> You won't.
I had to let everyone think they had a fighting chance.<eos> But what I need... Is a leader.<eos> To lead who?<eos> Oh, I've already got my army -<eos> - Or I will soon, anyway.
Please, like I chose to have him breathing on me and shoving his flyers in my face.<eos> Someone's got to put that guy on a bus.<eos> Hey, I feel you on that.<eos> (woman) So why don't you, if you're so offended by him taking your students?<eos> Well, maybe I will.
Oh, my God, is that side-boob?<eos> Careful with the side-boob, big guy.<eos> My hormones are going crazy.<eos> I might just pounce your skinny ass. - Kim, I really don't think we should.<eos> - I won't, then.
Yes.<eos> If you don't tell her... then I'll tell her myself.<eos> - You wouldn't do that.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - You won't.
Ah, it was a conflict of interest.<eos> I was involved with this cop who was working on a case that I was... involved with.<eos> –Oh, dear God.<eos> Alan will take care of it.<eos> No, he will not.
Whatever.<eos> –This is not going well, Alan.<eos> –You think?<eos> She won't even hear our side.<eos> Hopefully she will before she—
Well, I mean, what we could...<eos> What we could do is we could transfer the money from multiple accounts.<eos> Like, you know, commercial and personal accounts.<eos> Then you route the money through different branches and create, like, a smokescreen, a labyrinth, if you will.<eos> If you will.
I'm gonna break this guy out of here, or I'm gonna die trying.<eos> And if it's the latter then that should count for something, right?<eos> That's gotta count for something.<eos> You tell them that.<eos> - I will.
I talked to my cousin Petey. He told me she's back in Chicago.<eos> Hey, you're still wanted in Chicago, remember?<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> If you change your mind, I'm staying at the Plaza del Sol.<eos> I won't.
And you must love him in return.<eos> Remember your promise.<eos> When he dies, I marry whom I choose.<eos> Charles, as you love me, take care of her.<eos> I will.
Who could've done such a stupid thing?<eos> - Bulgae.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Bring this matter to light, whatever it takes.<eos> I will, Your Highness.

Thank you, I think.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you ready for your big adventure.<eos> Now, Ted, the journal won't take you right to the idol.<eos> It won't?
How about breaking and entering?<eos> By the looks of this, a little assault as well.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> - This can't go any farther.<eos> - It won't, Sister.
I'd say this is pretty big.<eos> Thanks, Dad. Ah!<eos> Thanks, Pop.<eos> Okay, honey, I want you to have a good semester.<eos> Okay, I will.

Did you get the tape?<eos> When do I get paid?<eos> Soon enough, baby.<eos> That shit better not get out.<eos> Oh, it won't.
They're listening.<eos> They're watching.<eos> If you should succeed, remember me, my love.<eos> Remember my name.<eos> I will.
You know, I could hurt you, Jack.<eos> Like you're trying to hurt me.<eos> I could say something.<eos> I could tell you something that would hurt.<eos> But I won't.

Move!<eos> I have another patient to see.<eos> - She won't come.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because she won't.
Just a little... tied up...<eos> Oh God... da...<eos> And how did this break?<eos> I'll teach you how...<eos> I will...
That'll cover getting him back fast, no matter what the price.<eos> With the prenup we have, there's just no other way.<eos> I want them all dead and the trail leading to McCain.<eos> - If something goes wrong-<eos> - It won't.
- Are we going to mass?<eos> - I heard the bells.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Tell your mom to get ready.<eos> Okay, I will.

I found it taped inside of his computer case.<eos> Off-line, where they couldn't get to it.<eos> - Will it work?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But Zeigler will.
All right. Grab the first plane out and return to the library.<eos> I'm not coming home right away, Judson.<eos> I'm going to the Mines.<eos> It's dangerous, Flynn. I mean, if the Key of Solomon should fall into the wrong hands...<eos> It won't, okay?
- You stupid idiot!<eos> It's OK.<eos> The container is not compromised.<eos> Sorry. I won't do that again.<eos> No. You won't.

They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> - I can answer anything.<eos> - Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> - They can't keep changing.<eos> - They won't.
There's frickin' rats!<eos> One just tried to rip my throat out.<eos> Mom!<eos> What if the rat comes back?<eos> He won't.
Fuck that.<eos> It's their room.<eos> They should pay for it.<eos> - But someone would have to come in.<eos> - Goddamn right, they will.
Un shrew sans pareille.<eos> More arrack, Jacques.<eos> More arrack.<eos> We shall all have sore heads tomorrow.<eos> Well, you will, anyhow, Jacques.
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.<eos> Very nice.<eos> And the best part is...<eos> I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.<eos> Someday, perhaps you will.
Overlooking the world.<eos> Imagine when we come down from the mountain.<eos> With this gift of fire?<eos> They'll never understand.<eos> One day they will.
But what I now think is this.<eos> What happens when you become a man is that you stop blaming your dad for not being perfect.<eos> You realise he's just a man and you love the man he is.<eos> And on my bar mitzvah, my dad became my friend for one day and I loved him.<eos> And I always will.
I guess.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> I just feel like I might not get over it, you know?<eos> Like maybe I'm too sensitive or something.<eos> Well, maybe you won't.
I don't know.<eos> I think so.<eos> Don't do anything, just be cool, you know.<eos> Just wait; she'll call you.<eos> - She won't.

Someone covetous of our success?<eos> I am my own agent, Roman.<eos> Well, you're not displeasing me, you're throwing out a challenge to God.<eos> You shall relinquish that seat, or I will bring your temple crashing down upon you.<eos> No, you won't.
Yeah. Are you jealous when Margie goes off like a tractor-trailer?<eos> I fight my jealousies and I conquer them.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> You can tell Barb that.<eos> Good, I will.
As far as they know, you're human.<eos> They can't touch you.<eos> Maybe not, but they're sure as hell not gonna let us take out Grant so I can become chairman.<eos> We won't have to take him out, they'll do it for us.<eos> At least Billie's spellbound parents will.
Anyways.<eos> You gonna have dinner with us?<eos> May be my last fucking meal if apoplexy takes me... off my nervousness.<eos> What if you won?<eos> I won't.
Now,getting back to leslie.<eos> I don't think she's stable. Noted.<eos> Do you have her address?<eos> She probably wouldn't want me to give it to you.<eos> So I will.
Excellent book-- shame to put it down.<eos> I hope martinis will be fine.<eos> Ooh, better than fine.<eos> Will Rory be having a martini?<eos> Yes, she will.
Great. So you want to come over and make juice?<eos> When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> I'll come over.<eos> We'll... juice.

You're gonna be remanded for psychiatric care.<eos> No, that detective he's done everything you've asked him to do. So you just tell him that it was a mistake.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yeah, you can.<eos> I won't.
for the silent auction.<eos> my busy little beaver.<eos> not really.<eos> look, ton', i haven't wanted to bug you, but before you'd gotten hurt, you said you would get that building inspector to cut me some slack so i could get back to my business?<eos> oh yeah, right right. i will, later.
Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons. We found them most difficult to use in outer-atmosphere combat.<eos> When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes. We will.
Nim helped.<eos> Yeah, I guess people are starting to get to know about your pet, and, uh, i-it's got 'em worried.<eos> Well, people should worry about themselves.<eos> Well, things are gonna get back to normal soon.<eos> No, it won't.
Does your lizard know about your other girlfriend?<eos> You know, you'd think girlfriends would be a sore subject for you right now, Greg.<eos> Oh, I'm not worried.<eos> Your sister will snap out of it.<eos> Nah, she won't.
Who are you mad at?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> - I just... want to get out there.<eos> - It's never gonna happen for you.<eos> Sure, it will.
We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.<eos> We fly home on the wings of imagination?<eos> - Is that what we do, Ronon?<eos> - You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.<eos> - Oh, fine. I will.
- No, look, look, hey. - Please?<eos> I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right. We'll just hide, all right? We'll wait this out, okay?<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> I'm not leaving you, Peyton.<eos> I won't.

He said if I danced at his club, and was nice to some of his friends-<eos> - If you're spinning me another line-<eos> - Setting you up was my last job.<eos> He said if I did that, he'd let me go.<eos> But he never will, will he?
So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked.<eos> Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents.<eos> Hello.<eos> What if Dad says I could stay up to watch it?<eos> He won't.
This baby.<eos> You'll never be far.<eos> Tell my brother to love Lillia.<eos> Love her the way I never could.<eos> I will. I will.
A prom?<eos> Can... can we go to that?<eos> Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, they won't.

But lying here with you, I feel that same stillness.<eos> I can almost believe that the world's not as screwed up as I know it is.<eos> My mom's coming home. She called.<eos> Well, at least now you won't have to live alone in this big giant house.<eos> No, but she will.
And congratulations to you, too.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'm going home.<eos> No, come on. Stay. I won't be long.<eos> Yeah, you will.
I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Well, the ring will.
Big day.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're gonna have to tell me how it is living with a guy before I let Luke move in.<eos> If it's too creepy, he may have to stay with Babette.<eos> I will.
I learned real early how to play tough to cover up being scared.<eos> That's all it was, but I got over it.<eos> And me and Denny got tight.<eos> - You can ask anybody in the cast.<eos> - We will.
- No way.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> You've never gotten her to come before.<eos> What makes you think she'll come now?<eos> - She won't.
Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.<eos> She's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.<eos> We anticipate that she will reveal herself before long.<eos> We will find her.<eos> Yes, we will.
- I won't let go.<eos> - Again.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> Please... again.<eos> I won't...
I hate you.<eos> The situation with Martha is taken care of.<eos> There are too many loose ends.<eos> We cannot have her unravel everything.<eos> She won't.
You can't... you can't tell...<eos> Charlie about Tim.<eos> No, you won't do that.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
We all know you're a big superstar, Andi, but tennis should come first.<eos> You're right.<eos> This guy just kept talking.<eos> Tell him you have practice and that being late is frowned upon.<eos> I will.
The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Some kind of circle of life thing.<eos> This kid doesn't have kidney failure.<eos> He will.
If he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain.<eos> Chase, run a blood smear and immunochemistries.<eos> Foreman, get an MRI.<eos> - I'll page Cuddy.<eos> - No, you won't.
Stop!<eos> - He's lucky you got there in time.<eos> - He's lucky he's alive.<eos> I figured this for a heart attack or a stroke, but nothing showed up on the test?<eos> Nothing will.
You know what, that's a nice attitude, Ryan.<eos> I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.<eos> It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme. Yes. Thank you.<eos> You will get rich quick.<eos> We all will.
Okay, this is great.<eos> Thank you, my friends.<eos> She is perfect.<eos> Uh. Dwight, may I have your chair, please?<eos> And some singles, if you will.
And I'm going to wear earplugs tonight. The good ones that expand in your ear, so I won't be able to hear anything that might be going on out in the street at all hours of the night.<eos> Thank you, Mama. For everything. And look at it this way.<eos> You're not losing a daughter, you're gaining a son who likes to wear a dress.<eos> - He had better make you happy.<eos> - He will.
That's what I want.<eos> Henderson's men outnumber us.<eos> If we leave now, we lose.<eos> The cops get the recording if we go into custody.<eos> We won't.
You aresuch a liar.<eos> You know I didn'tdo anything to David, but you can't accept that.<eos> You can't accept thatit's fate that sent David away, and that it's proofthat celia and I are meant for each other.<eos> She'll never love you.<eos> Yes...she...will!
Mom, you forgot my birthday.<eos> You're really in no position to negotiate.<eos> Honey, where am I gonna put all of his things?<eos> And, you know, he might come back at some point.<eos> He won't.
I don't think so.<eos> I'm gonna wait a little bit on that.<eos> It'll go down easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.<eos> - What if they find out?<eos> - They won't.
Well, maybe you might want to think about it.<eos> There's nothing sexier than a man in tights.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that's true.<eos> Look, can you just tell Lorelai I came by?<eos> Oh, of course I will, honey.
I'm what they call "working deep cover."<eos> That's why, like I said, - You gotta keep the secret.<eos> - I won't tell.<eos> - You better not!<eos> - I won't!
-Under potential hazards.<eos> -Along with mines and drunken soldiers?<eos> -Right above it.<eos> You should read them.<eos> - I will now.
You'll do.<eos> It's your team now.<eos> Tim, you're a good agent.<eos> Don't let him tell you otherwise.<eos> I won't, boss.
And you used it this afternoon?<eos> !<eos> Hey.<eos> You... you have no proof of that.<eos> No, but I will.
- Well, I'll be there, too.<eos> We don't know that yet.<eos> We haven't heard from RISD.<eos> Whatever happens, you know, we'll make it work.<eos> - We will?
- What?<eos> I'm really going to miss you bossing me around.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> - Nope, nope.<eos> - Yes, you will.
He was only ever going to get it from me.<eos> You know, I know you believe that.<eos> That's why I've tried so hard to forgive you.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Maybe one day I will.
Will you quit looking at me like that?<eos> Like what?<eos> You know like what.<eos> Like we're never gonna see each other again.<eos> We will.
Sign it! Sign it!<eos> Sign your name!<eos> - Sign it!<eos> - I can't.<eos> I won't.
Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Something might happen again.<eos> It won't.
That... that's my drink.<eos> Get me the manager.<eos> Well, tell Ari when you find him<eos> - he needs to call me back.<eos> - I will indeed.
That's a very bold move, Arvin, trying to cut a side deal with one of their top assets.<eos> I'm well aware that you could walk out of here and tell them what I'm proposing.<eos> You might curry some favor, save your life,<eos> temporarily.<eos> But you won't.
Marshall's right about you.<eos> I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> Does that help you sleep at night?<eos> Eventually, Marshall or Rachel will do what I ask.<eos> No. They won't.
If we get out of the house, can you make it so their cars can't start?<eos> No, I'm not helping.<eos> Didn't you see what they did to that other girl? They took her away.<eos> I don't wanna go away.<eos> You will.
You are a good man, Robin.<eos> Nothing will change that.<eos> That won't help you make your decision.<eos> - It might.<eos> - It won't.
Where's Marian?<eos> Good question.<eos> If you've hurt her...<eos> If you've done anything to her...<eos> You'll what?
I'll send a team to meet you there.<eos> I'm sending Krista back.<eos> No! Use every asset.<eos> If he gets to Domic and he discovers what we've been doing here.<eos> He won't.
I haven't seen this many Irishmen in ties since the pope came to town.<eos> Well,you know,if we pull this off, it's gonna be a win for the whole neighborhood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somebody donates more than that, you let me know,and I'll match it.<eos> I will.
According to reliable sources... four of them... the Theta Betas get pledges all liquored up, take them to a secret room, and have them undress while the guys from their brother fraternity watch the show through a two-way mirror.<eos> If this Parker girl was there...<eos> You had me at "secret room".<eos> Looks like you'll have a room all to yourself.<eos> I will?
Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.<eos> Oh, no. Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail?<eos> But you will.
Vince, I've got his schedule.<eos> There's no way he can make lunch.<eos> He has a ginormously important lunch already planned.<eos> Okay, then tell him to call me back.<eos> Okay, I will.
Just got one more stop to make.<eos> What for?<eos> You trust me?<eos> Of course, I trust you, Brad. It's just that if anybody finds out about this, I...<eos> They won't.
- His medical records.<eos> He's claustrophobic, paranoid, depressive. Got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide.<eos> He's barely left his house in years.<eos> - Look, Owen, if Jack finds out...<eos> - Well, he won't, will he?
And tell him I forgive him for the rest.<eos> And he forgives you for the rest of it.<eos> He does?<eos> He does.<eos> Steve... she will,too.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hey! Congratulations.<eos> I want to do the right thing. I really do.<eos> But I don't think she's going to let me.<eos> She will.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I'm leaving it here.<eos> It's yours. I have returned it.<eos> And somehow or another, I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.

I could write the script word for word, and our little play does not have a happy ending.<eos> You are a bizarre human being.<eos> Oh,am I?<eos> Here we go.<eos> She'll say,"isn't the room a little small for a pool table?
I suffered every day at breakfast and dinner at Shlomo's place.<eos> You're your dad's spitting image!<eos> But at least now lunch was somewhere different every day.<eos> - Leave the boy alone.<eos> - I will not!
Oh, get on with it, Van Sciver.<eos> We're far too old to be moved by your honey-voiced ass-kissing.<eos> And remember, you might have built this room.<eos> But that doesn't mean a turned blood like you belongs here.<eos> Or ever will.
She said that was the best date.<eos> The picnic on the beach and it poured sheets and sheets of rain.<eos> We sat in my car and listened to the whole American Beauty album.<eos> She remembers it all.<eos> She always will.
Cynthia and andreware good people.<eos> And I believe they havegood intentionswith blackthorne.<eos> So is jeremygoing to join them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He'll makehis own decision.
You know how many jobs Pruitt brings to the city?<eos> If Pruitt folds, so do dozens of other ancillary businesses.<eos> - Who does that help? - Those are sweatshop jobs.<eos> If they go, you think people will stop coming here?<eos> They won't.
I'm afraid he's going to leave it on my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.<eos> You don't need Matt's kidney.<eos> Because I'm going to give you mine.<eos> That is very sweet, Sean, but I think that we're both gonna feel a little silly when my body rejects it.<eos> It won't.
The thing is, Sean, some men can't handle temptation.<eos> Marry me again, Julia.<eos> Sean, what are you doing?<eos> And some men can. Burt can't find out about this.<eos> He won't.
Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> Tell her it's all your fault.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - You will eventually.
Recently, Joy and Bargain Bag had a difference of opinion on their return policy.<eos> You can't return this.<eos> I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.
You can't return this.<eos> I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.

Why would I be a terrible mother?<eos> We all turn into our parents.<eos> I mean, as soon as Brooke, Jr. Hits puberty,<eos> Brooke, Sr. Hits South Beach.<eos> I will not.
They may be stronger than us, but they don't have our brains.<eos> The towers were vast.<eos> Seventy five feet high and weighing many tons, teams of men were needed to move them into position.<eos> - We'll never do it.<eos> - Yes, we will!
It's called sensory depravation.<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> You hear me, you son of a bitch?<eos> ! It's not going to work!<eos> Yes, it will.
You've done enough damage.<eos> Lane, get in here Lane!<eos> I left so this would stop.<eos> But it didn'T.<eos> It never will.
He says that if we use it as our standard...<eos> You've caught something from that sorcerer!<eos> What will the men think when they can't fight under their gods?<eos> They will lose their nerve, Maxentius will win!<eos> - No, he won't!
Eleven hours and 59 minutes.<eos> [Earl Narrating] Since I knew I couldn't get Ralph to change his mind...<eos> I went to talk to the one person I knew he would listen to.<eos> Anyway, uh, I was hopin' you'd talk to Ralph and get him to, you know, not kill me.<eos> Of course I will.
Where are you going,coward?<eos> !<eos> "Jesus,I don't think you're gonna be able to get the networks to forgive its debtors.<eos> " "We should.<eos> " "We won't.
That blows.<eos> We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you okay?<eos> What if the crazy lady comes back?<eos> She won't.
Amanda, if you knew who he was, why did you get so involved?<eos> Because... I thought he would get sick of serial dating.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> And what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Wanna bet?<eos> Mousey, give her 5 million bucks<eos> I think you'll regret it<eos> If you lose...<eos> I won't
Sorry, sorry, sorry...<eos> I just wanted to ask<eos> What?<eos> What if our school finds out?<eos> They won't
So... there are reasons to stay.<eos> Hey, um... I think I am gonna take that job.<eos> And... Scranton? It's not that bad.<eos> So if they offer you a job there... I think you should take it.<eos> Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
I've been asking everyone in the trailer park to help me figure out who wrote it.<eos> Well, that's easy. Earl says it's illegal to open other people's mail.<eos> That's the good thing about having three strikes you don't have to worry about the stupid laws anymore.<eos> Wish I had three strikes.<eos> You will someday. What the... ?
If they gotta pull you out of here, you could get arrested.<eos> You could get hurt. I don't care.<eos> If I take one step out of this car, it means I'm starting my life without Lina.<eos> And I won't do that.<eos> I won't.
[Laughter] right, kevin?<eos> And i pretend homeless people are you, And i burn 'em. [Laughter]<eos> Gosh, i don't know about this, foxxy.<eos> The cool kids are never going to let me play meth lab with them.<eos> Of course they will.
Oh, I didn't know you were invited over there.<eos> I'm not... well, yet.<eos> But I'm sure he's going to ask me.<eos> Well, I mean, I hope he does.<eos> Well, he will.
I'm sorry.<eos> You must still be in shock.<eos> February 29th is over.<eos> will the ghost return in 4 years?<eos> will she?
- Boyden, Klotz.<eos> Wider path, please.<eos> The King approaches.<eos> You're never gonna tell her you love her.<eos> - I will.
I was trying to help, Ben, but if you don't believe me...<eos> BEN: No, I don't.<eos> Eight, seven...<eos> Why not ask the gallery, then?<eos> OK, I will.
No.<eos> But you can.<eos> - There's gotta be something we can do.<eos> - You came all this way to save me.<eos> - And you will.
Even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power.<eos> When you stand before God, you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do thus", or that virtue "was not convenient at the time".<eos> This will not suffice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I will.
I'm just gonna go upstairs.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did, uh- Did you want a baby?<eos> Eventually.<eos> Well, eventually you will.
That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery is killed in a traitor's stead, the Stone Table will crack and even death itself will turn backwards.<eos> We sent the news that you were dead.<eos> Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will, dear one, but not alone.
Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.<eos> - And get that mud off your pants.<eos> - Now we must all try and keep very calm.<eos> First thing that we have to decide is this: Who is going with Charlie to the factory?<eos> I will.
I told them the Tams were no longer a threat, damage done.<eos> They might listen... but I think they know I'm no longer their man.<eos> They take you down, I don't expect to grieve over much.<eos> Like to kill you myself, I see you again.<eos> You won't.
- I don't see them.<eos> - The cameras?<eos> [Woman] I guess they don't bring them till the morning.<eos> You better get back to sleep before your mother comes down here looking for you.<eos> She won't.
She moves around a lot.<eos> Well, I want to meet her eventually, you know?<eos> She's your sister.<eos> - I want to know her.<eos> - You will.
It's okay, Gina.<eos> You'll get through this.<eos> - You'll get through this.<eos> - I wish that was true, Joe.<eos> You will.
I want to go back.<eos> We'll go back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bab'Aziz, won't you go to the gathering after all?<eos> I will, my little angel. I will.
See I tried to walk the line, but now I realize there is no line.<eos> We here, we are playing on a level that most will never see.<eos> I know my brother George, he didn't see it.<eos> Maybe he had a divine moment when his brains hit the floor.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you will too.
Are you out of your mind, with everything she's doing?<eos> All right, two.<eos> But then four in the fall.<eos> Only if she wins sectionals.<eos> Oh, she will.
- Yes you can.<eos> Sooner or later the cops will figure out that it was your dad who has done this thing.<eos> When they do, they are gonna lock him away.<eos> Then they will take you and put you with another family.<eos> - No, they won't.

Around here, people disappear all the time.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Look where we are.<eos> Who will know?<eos> We will.
The west?<eos> We're going to Sierra Leone. Oh, yes.<eos> And my son Baptiste Junior will go with you to make the proper introductions.<eos> We have no trucks.<eos> You will.
They're scum. They deserve what's coming.<eos> So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?<eos> They haven't killed anybody I know about.<eos> It got pretty bad at Shellie's place, but they didn't kill anybody.<eos> And they won't.
No!<eos> Yes or no? No!<eos> Yes or no? No!<eos> Still so stubborn!<eos> You won't?
Catch her feet.<eos> She will fall asleep in 10 minutes.<eos> - Then we will go inside.<eos> - And what if she wakes up?<eos> - She won't.
Please tell me what to do.<eos> Baby, take my pad.<eos> I want you to get that shit up on the radio.<eos> You put it in the DJ's hand yourself, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
What do we do, eat?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Quick shag while we wait?<eos> What if they turn up?<eos> They won't.
It has like all these minerals in it.<eos> - Let me see!<eos> - Let me just finish!<eos> - It doesn't match at all.<eos> - It will.
- No!<eos> - Listen, it's just for five minutes.<eos> - Please, don't leave me.<eos> Please! - Listen. - What if he catches me again?<eos> - He won't, he won't.
Only the coffee and chewing gum money that their wives give them.<eos> We can't waste time at the 2-dollar windows.<eos> We're not going to bet their money, we're going to keep their money.<eos> - Suppose they win?<eos> - They won't.
I've nowhere to go.<eos> I can't survive anywhere else, Zachary, only here.<eos> It's the only home that I've ever known.<eos> Don't let them take it from me.<eos> I won't.
Clear?<eos> Got it?<eos> Comprende?<eos> - Then I'll teach her to read.<eos> - The bloody hell you will.
Not enough to kill herself, but enough to keep pissing me off.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Here's your ticket, I'll take the jeep.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - I won't.
We get it, for chrissakes!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Too much happiness, too much!<eos> Beware of parties, they often end in tears.<eos> - This one won't.
A guy's capacity to be a world-class asshole.<eos> Fortunately, I'm familiar with the cause.<eos> Will you just please tell her I came by?<eos> No, forget it. I'll catch up with her on my own.<eos> No. You won't.
All right, keep on coming.<eos> Keep on coming.<eos> Give me three, three is well in.<eos> You give me that right now...<eos> You will?
Yeah, you were drugged, all right.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.<eos> Go ahead. Call these models. They'll tell you.<eos> Of course they will.
If there wasn't a war going on,<eos> - this would be the most happy day in my life.<eos> - I know.<eos> Take this to Milena, she's hungry.<eos> - I will.
Not any more.<eos> Come on.<eos> She'll come back again, you know.<eos> They'll not keep her caged.<eos> -Not this time, she won't.
No, no, no. no. That's it, dude. That's it.<eos> I get too many callbacks, Sylvia's going to get suspicious.<eos> Oh, Sylvia's going to be kissing your ass.<eos> Not if she recognizes your voice.<eos> Oh, she won't. Here, sir.
Tonight, any protestor, any instigator or agitator will be made example of!<eos> Chancellor, there is a contingency that has not been addressed.<eos> And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?<eos> - Should the terrorist succeed...<eos> - He won't.
I cannot give you the details straight away.<eos> Why not?<eos> Before I explain... I must clarify some things.<eos> Please translate what I say.<eos> Of course I will.
I'm sorry, Billy.<eos> I'd trade my life for yours if I could.<eos> Maybe he traded his life for us.<eos> [Zack] Yeah. Probably did.<eos> I would.
And now that we've been reinstated in the company, I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.<eos> - And when that happens...<eos> - you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.
Hmm.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> - Oh, no, I never would.
So, ben is there with you?<eos> Yep.<eos> He's looking very fit.<eos> You want to say hi?<eos> I would, actually.
'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.<eos> I wouldn't recommend anybody get into the business today.<eos> I just wouldn't.
There was plenty said about him.<eos> I understand it's hard to watch a war hero...<eos> You don't understand shit about Fred Johnson.<eos> -Enlighten me. -Oh, then you want<eos> -the real story? -Yes, I would.
And trust that Elena is right here dancing with you.<eos> For the sake of argument, if Elena Gilbert weren't tied to your mortality...<eos> Would I become a vampire for you?<eos> Well, you said even if you wanted to.<eos> Oh, would you?
No, you're jealous of Elena.<eos> Because you know that Stefan and I both would choose her over you every time.<eos> And she would choose Stefan.<eos> What makes you so sure of that?<eos> Because I would.
Because you know that Stefan and I both would choose her over you every time.<eos> And she would choose Stefan.<eos> What makes you so sure of that?<eos> Because I would.<eos> Any woman would.
I'm saying maybe if we find her, we can explain to her that you're different now, you know?<eos> Sam, that won't work.<eos> She won't quit.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Would you?
Yes, I just didn't want him there.<eos> Why not?<eos> I felt that he had been bad for my mother and that he was part of the reason she took her own life.<eos> Some people are saying he blamed you for her death.<eos> Yes, well, of course he would, Sheriff.
Overruled.<eos> But... But she did... she said "speculation."<eos> Your Honor, the People have more than enough evidence to warrant a trial.<eos> Would the defense like to make a motion?<eos> Yes. The defense would.
Please be alive, please be alive, please be alive.<eos> Not a single man left living.<eos> Nor woman.<eos> She is the daughter of King Alfred, they would not kill her. They...<eos> They would not.
It was a legitimate treatise.<eos> Has it ever been cited?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I would.
I chose tulips specifically to torture Larry Henderson.<eos> After all, he killed my baby sister.<eos> Plus, tulips are my wife's favorite flower.<eos> Before we unveil the headstone, would a loved one of Margaret's like to say a few words?<eos> - I would.
After all, he killed my baby sister.<eos> Plus, tulips are my wife's favorite flower.<eos> Before we unveil the headstone, would a loved one of Margaret's like to say a few words?<eos> - I would.<eos> - I would.
You can't just kill Charles Lindbergh. It's not right.<eos> Look, I will go in there, I will talk to him, and I will convince him to leave Rittenhouse and not become the monster he's supposed to become.<eos> And you think he's gonna just, what, give up all that fame, the power, the legacy?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would. Okay.
- The dumpy one out of...<eos> Yes, smart-arse, I know who she is.<eos> I couldn't tell you the last time we saw anyone. It's the back of beyond up here.<eos> You know Jonjo Patterson's missing?<eos> No, we'd no idea.
This deal guarantees that we win the month.<eos> I want that production on today.<eos> Mr. Blackridge will fire me!<eos> I can't roll the dice on twenty grand!<eos> Race Bannon would.
But the film burned up.<eos> Well, how did she see it two days after it supposedly burned up?<eos> And the wardrobe matches perfectly.<eos> So Amelia had a second print? She had a copy?<eos> Wouldn't you?
Almost.<eos> Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?<eos> I expect it was Mother.<eos> Your mother wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, she would.
I just can't do it.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I will speak to your godfather.<eos> But he just made a decision that means you might not have to marry a loyalist.<eos> Oh, would you?
Interesting. It took nearly five seconds to freeze this rose in liquid nitrogen.<eos> So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass and body fat, of course.<eos> So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.
We just want to talk to him.<eos> That's all.<eos> I... Is he in some sort of trouble?<eos> Now, why would you think that?<eos> I wouldn't.
You helped him wash it.<eos> That would be very hard to prove.<eos> What you couldn't have known was that some of that money that you and my husband laundered Tony stole from his cousin Joey Marks.<eos> Now, obviously the Armenians don't know you were involved in that, or we wouldn't be sitting here.<eos> Well, you certainly wouldn't.
- Do I look suspended?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - He doesn't look suspended.<eos> Would I be sittin' here staring' at you two chowderheads if I was suspended?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
This is a terrible idea.<eos> Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
I'm waiting on Dr. hale. Dr. hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
I wasn't talking about you.<eos> So, if I were the right guy, you would marry me.<eos> - Mnh. - You wouldn't?<eos> No. That's not what I'm saying.<eos> - So you would.
- He'd have had to...<eos> - He'd have what?<eos> Had to do something drastic to scare her of.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> And he wouldn't.
We have guns, but so do they, so when we get up there, we cannot hesitate to kill, do you understand?<eos> Taiana?<eos> Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.
Hello, Larry.<eos> He won't be out of the anaesthetic for a while.<eos> Whatever happens, thank you.<eos> Anybody would have done the same.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Spare the gaffer his blushes.<eos> Well, the only person known to have handled that file apart from DS Rogerson is you, not DS Arnott.<eos> Well, the pair of them must have hatched a plot to alter the file.<eos> DS Rogerson denies altering the file.<eos> Well, she would, wouldn't she?
Frisky?<eos> - I'm gonna go in now.<eos> What?<eos> Do it again, I'll do it back.<eos> You wouldn't.
What we had to!<eos> Nothing from Trubel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I can't believe she would just leave like that.<eos> She wouldn't.
This is the only way to do what's right by folk.<eos> - As far as you're concerned.<eos> - No, it's a fact.<eos> Because if you don't, there's nothing to stop me taking over.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> I would, though.
It's nothing.<eos> And the color.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Did you steal it?<eos> I would never.
All right... You know, it just so happens that bedtime stories are my specialty.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> Would you like to stay, David?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
That's it.<eos> They're coming for us from all sides, Bella.<eos> And I want you to know something.<eos> Everything I did was to protect my legacy, - (faint, distorted shouts) - and I will do it again.<eos> Yes, I would.
It's impossible.<eos> Nobody can figure out these equations.<eos> I bet the Chief Medical Examiner of the Commonwealth could.<eos> Okay, Maura does not want to tutor me.<eos> Sure, she would!
They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
- You tell her, New Fiona.<eos> That's New Fiona?<eos> - If the bra fits... - Okay.<eos> Out, or I swear to God, I'm gonna call the cops.<eos> You wouldn't.
You don't want to get so involved with patients.<eos> What if... that poor little baby doesn't make it?<eos> You're gonna feel terrible.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I would too.
- I got two bills.<eos> - Damn!<eos> Hump her on the table, why don't you?<eos> - That doesn't bother you?<eos> - Why would it?
Thought we're on the same side here, Joe.<eos> We are.<eos> But please put the bag down.<eos> You remember, Joe, when you told me that you'd do anything possible to find the animal who did this?<eos> Yeah. Well, so would I.
Processing the DNA at the junk lab in Red Hook?<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> Our bureau's got the best labs in the country.<eos> Yeah, didn't think I made the cut.<eos> Usually you wouldn't.
That was quick.<eos> Hey, man, look, you should come down here.<eos> We need to talk right quick.<eos> Like you would with a manager?<eos> No, nigga, like I would with a calm yo ass down!
You meant what you said last night?<eos> Yes.<eos> If James remembered now, if he were standing here now instead of me, what would you say?<eos> Go away.<eos> - You would?
Her pain.<eos> My mother's pain... there's a way to make it go away.<eos> Is that what's in the black bag?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why wouldn't you?
- Yes, I know!<eos> We've been having this same conversation for six months.<eos> I just feel like the amount of time I spend trying to massage this relationship, I could have learnt the clarinet.<eos> Mm, and clarinets don't ruin 'Shine Bright Like a Diamond'. Mmm...<eos> They probably would, actually.
He's been dead for a century.<eos> Look, I know you believe this stuff...<eos> If you saw what I did...<eos> What we saw...<eos> You would, too.
They much prefer revenge.<eos> Brutal revenge.<eos> Rey Torres was their favorite smuggler, and now he's dead, thanks to you.<eos> All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.
Why? I suffered an unfortunate series of embarrassing incidents.<eos> I just want a wine bath and to go to sleep.<eos> Listen up, Manny.<eos> Of course you want to run away from whatever happened back that party.<eos> Anybody would.
- There may be video tomorrow.<eos> I hope you're wrong, but if you're not, we'll edit it and put it on the air. No.<eos> I don't want to air it.<eos> I'll make sure it's vetted.<eos> Julia, I'd rather not.
He arrived in New Orleans months ago, been buying companies and properties all over the city-- he's probably gonna be our new focus in the investigation.<eos> Listen... you need to stay away, Percy.<eos> Dustin's in the hospital, his aunt is dead, and the man who may be responsible is off-limits?<eos> Come on, Gregorio, you know we're not staying away.<eos> And you wouldn't, either.
NO, BUT YOU WERE DOING THAT FOR US.<eos> YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD<eos> TO MAKE THIS TRIP MEMORABLE FOR ME AND THE KIDS, AND...<eos> AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT.<eos> BUT WHY WOULD YOU?
You don't get 'em back.<eos> So you're scewed.<eos> You bleeding hearts.<eos> That dyke wouldn't do it for me.<eos> Yeah, she would.
Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.
- Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.
- But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.
- But you might.<eos> But I would not.<eos> We could go round and round.<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> - But I would not.
- No, Farhad, not grabbed me.<eos> - You should do it.<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> - I would.
About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about the first time you got fucked?<eos> You have been fucked before, haven't you?<eos> If you'd rather not...
Would that be possible?<eos> ~ Does she want to marry him?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> And do you want to marry her?<eos> What man would not?
You in the service?<eos> Me too. 3rd of the 9th.<eos> Back in the day.<eos> Ah, they wouldn't want me now, even though I'd go back if I could.<eos> Yep. I sure would.
And she's so hot.<eos> You must have sex, like, all day.<eos> - Bel!<eos> - What?<eos> I would.
That's not so easy today. I need someone to co-sign.<eos> Iwenlto see Mum, but she doesn't want to. So I thought of you. - Granny?<eos> -Yes?<eos> I was wondering if maybe you'd be willing to put up the house as collateral.<eos> 'Course. Of course I would.
That's not what I meant.<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> Swarek's a good guy.<eos> He's gonna want to know you're pregnant.<eos> Any guy would.
No, help yourself.<eos> - Raul lied to you!<eos> - Can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - He lied!<eos> I-I would never!
And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> ~ Anyway, Mrs Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> ~ Of course she would.
As a remedy against sin.<eos> And to avoid fornication.<eos> ~ We can't thank 'ee enough.<eos> ~ Any man would do the same.<eos> "Any man" would not.
- Chuckie.<eos> - What?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Honey, if something happened to Topher over there, you would blame me for stopping you, all right?<eos> You would think that you could have done something to save him,<eos> - and I... - No, no, no, no.<eos> I would never blame you.<eos> - Yes, you would.
You sure you're ready?<eos> It's the romance of small moments. Of intimate moments.<eos> I think so.<eos> You think I should do this, right?<eos> I would.
He avoided... vulgarity, then?<eos> Vulgarity?<eos> Mr Carson wouldn't be vulgar if they put him on a seaside postcard.<eos> I'd like to feel a man could speak of me like that at my age.<eos> I would.
No, you don't.<eos> You think I'd use it to go back a few days ago... So I could save my mom.<eos> I'd go back long before that...<eos> To when the bad stuff really started.<eos> I would, too.
Okay, you know what?<eos> The Donahues aren't that great.<eos> We treat you pretty good around here.<eos> You don't think I'd like to lie on the couch all day and chew on an old belt?<eos> I would.
He runs for the border, yeah.<eos> All right, well, it seems like you have everything handled.<eos> I don't know if I should tell Jane and Lisbon.<eos> Good question.<eos> I wouldn't.
What am I supposed to do all morning?<eos> Well, I believe the technical term is "relaxing,"<eos> which I know you will refuse to do, so I've made an appointment for you to have a Swedish massage.<eos> Now, Hilda will be here in 15 minutes with her table. Then you have an appointment at Duvall's Boutique, where Clarissa will help you pick out a nice, beautiful dress for this evening. And afterwards, the beauty parlor downstairs will be expecting you.<eos> I... I would really rather not.
How are you? I'm Steve. How you doing?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - What's the matter with you? - If you don't mind, I just want to give you a tip.<eos> I just saw something from back there.<eos> Oh, I would... yes, please.
For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, Mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open to get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.
Shakespeare does not translate into Comanche.<eos> He said that the Cherokee call you the Raven, but the Comanche call you Wild Turkey because you drape yourself in foolish colors and you lose your head when the coyote come.<eos> What the hell they saying?<eos> You'd prefer not knowing.<eos> I would.
Look at it.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, this is the replacement, isn't it, for the 458?<eos> ~ Yes, it is.<eos> ~ I'm just thinking, if you had a 458, you'd be feeling suicidal now, ~ wouldn't you?<eos> ~ Yeah, you would.
She was an IG and a mother.<eos> I feel as if we did the crime and she paid for it.<eos> Ifs good of you to feel that way.<eos> But, if it were Anju instead of Sam and vice versa wouldn't IG Meera try to save her son?<eos> Of course, she would.
Once a year, she just lets that girly freak flag fly. Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
- Oh, I know.<eos> Sort of into it.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?<eos> Wouldn't say no to a creme de menthe.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
I mean, I just got finished tearing Jake a new one.<eos> I'm gonna do exactly the same thing?<eos> Okay, consider it a standing offer.<eos> The whole Jake Angela thing, I'd cut them some slack.<eos> You would?
I don't think that people are born bad.<eos> I think it's their choices that make them who they are.<eos> I think sometimes people convince themselves that doing something bad is okay.<eos> - What if I do that?<eos> - You would never.
You really want to make this up to me?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Hold off on that phone call.<eos> Come on, Elliot. Just give us the shirt.<eos> I would, except no.
May he be present at the table so that we may join in fellowship with thee, now and for evermore.<eos> Amen. And we also give thanks for the safe return of Aumea.<eos> May the journey she is about to embark upon be as blessed as the union from which she came.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill her?<eos> They wouldn't.
We're gonna have to open her up.<eos> Listen, you could find a doctor to perform 20 operations on that leg, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> I know you want to fight for this.<eos> And I would, too.
Thank Fitz, but there's no reason to dote over me.<eos> Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?<eos> I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you've been doing, and I just can't understand it.<eos> After everything you've been through...<eos> - Why would you...
- Are you ever not hungry?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> No, the mom said that they're gluten free.<eos> Why would they order a dough-laden pizza?<eos> They wouldn't.
[ Sighs ] I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
If someone tried to kill me, I would not rest until I took my revenge.<eos> But you're not going to kill my doctor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Oh, no.<eos> I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her.<eos> Not that I wouldn't. I totally would.
Wait.<eos> If I'm analyzing the black box and the CAN-Bus, what are you guys gonna do?<eos> We're going to Disneyland.<eos> You don't think they're really gonna go, do you?<eos> I would.
You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.
You just need to be like,<eos> "Hey! I'm a good-looking doctor."<eos> No, it would work for me, Mikey.<eos> - Would it?<eos> - Yeah, it would.
Maybe in another country, that deals with children's issues.<eos> - You wanna work with children?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> You wanna have a family of your own?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Are you ready to accept that?<eos> .<eos> Well, who would decide whether I won or lost the argument?<eos> .<eos> Well, I would.
I have to go away for a while.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Do you know where my father is?<eos> - Would you go away with me?<eos> Would you?
- Tell me! - I don't know what you're fucking on about!<eos> Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
You made fun of my shoes?<eos> These are my mom's.<eos> Do you wanna try them on?<eos> No.<eos> All right, yeah, I would.
And I've invited Ely and his mother to join us.<eos> I made sure the caterers have made all of your favorites... the chicken coconut soup, the mint and fennel salad...<eos> Paul, that's very thoughtful.<eos> I... I'd be happy to host a dinner for you.<eos> - You would?
You don't need me.<eos> It's the whole Manhattan thing, isn't it?<eos> Why would I care if you moved to Manhattan?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why would you?
Is that what you don't respect?<eos> I spoke to you, sir, in the wrong manner.<eos> I apologise.<eos> I'd be grateful if you could see your way to putting it behind us.<eos> You would, would you?
But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?<eos> Mr. Kenneth wouldn't say that.<eos> Would he?<eos> Of course he would.
And takes off his makeup.<eos> We made a good kid, didn't we?<eos> We sure did.<eos> You know, I never thought I'd say this, but do you want to go to bed, grandma?<eos> I sure would, grandpa.
Would you please raise your arms? - No, Meechum.<eos> I know you don't want to shake my hand, so we'll just skip that part.<eos> Meechum.<eos> The President didn't mention anything about it.<eos> Why would he?
You're just a cog in their machine. Ira...<eos> If you want to have control, I mean, make a real difference and some money, too, work freelance with me.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You know we would be a great team again.<eos> Yeah, we would.
How long had it been since she did?<eos> Years ... two to three, at least.<eos> But we found them with her in her briefcase.<eos> Why would you take retainers that don't fit?<eos> You wouldn't.
Yeah? I know we got slightly derailed today with the universal child care, but now we are really back on a roll.<eos> Will you come on our walk, ma'am?<eos> Someone from the vice president's office will absolutely...<eos> Catherine, wouldn't you like to go on this lady's walk?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Please, come on in. Take a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's been a very interesting development in the case.<eos> I'm gonna need you all to pay very careful attention.<eos> Agent Fischer, if you would.
Dude, I think you're picking Radio Korea.<eos> You'll be tip-top once the damage from solar flare is dealt with.<eos> I want to move out.<eos> He doesn't want to sleep with MXes.<eos> Well, who would, really?
- That's not fair... - We're not to be trusted.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.<eos> It's about my son, so it does.<eos> And you want to do anything for him.<eos> - Yes, I would!
What happened to the gold envelope?<eos> He's a teenager.<eos> That would mean using a pen.<eos> Oh, he wouldn't have seen one of those.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Why? !<eos> - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
- No, we gotta do something first.<eos> - I stood by you, Ray.<eos> Didn't give you up.<eos> You know I would never do that.<eos> Sure you would.
- What?<eos> - That I'm like Cammy.<eos> Don't worry, nothing bad is gonna happen to you.<eos> Unless you do get caught, 'cause then they'll want you to talk.<eos> I wouldn't.
What... what... what...<eos> - what if you lose it?<eos> - You can't see her face.<eos> - Nobody'd know it's her.<eos> - But you would.
I was.<eos> In my thigh.<eos> Thigh? That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
Then she can start a new life, just like she wants.<eos> Deunan?<eos> No way.<eos> She'd never go without you.<eos> Maybe she would.
Course you wouldn't.<eos> She died when you were born.<eos> How would she recognise me, then?<eos> In heaven.<eos> She just would.
am brought up the M-word last night.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He didn't officially propose.<eos> Just wondering would I consider it.<eos> And would you?
Ooh, another one.<eos> The stars are falling.<eos> It's the final sign before the Darkness said it would return.<eos> He said it would sweep the land.<eos> What would?
If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
Now, who are you?<eos> I'm Christy's ex-husband.<eos> And I'm her father. Oh, really? Did you know your daughter took her family and ran out in the middle of the night to beat me out of the rent?<eos> My daughter wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, she would.
How is that legal?<eos> The DA is allowed to offer whatever plea deal she wants to you or Griffin.<eos> The only way to stop that deal is to get her to rescind it.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - She wouldn't.
I'm not having that conversation over the phone.<eos> I just really think he wouldn't want you to go to his home.<eos> Why?<eos> Just trust me, okay?<eos> He wouldn't.
So, he was stabbed, and then he was strangled.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> That shank could have done major damage.<eos> So, why would you strangle someone if you had a perfectly good weapon?<eos> You wouldn't.
Lawyer from the state's attorney's office?<eos> I heard he went right back to work the day after his kid was killed.<eos> Is he a stand-up guy?<eos> I really wouldn't know.<eos> Olinsky would.
If Dulaque and the Serpent Brotherhood have Santa, at least we know what happens next.<eos> Dulaque kills him.<eos> He kills Santa Claus.<eos> Ho, ho, ho. Santa was not expecting this turn of events.<eos> Santa wouldn't, would he?
Perhaps he did once.<eos> Now I am not so sure.<eos> I do not think you would allow your son... to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.<eos> No, you are right.<eos> I would not.
You made me laugh.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't make you pee your pants.<eos> Well, give it time.<eos> Hey, I didn't know her, obviously, but she sounds like the kind of woman that wouldn't want you spending all your time being sad.<eos> - No, she wouldn't.
- Yeah, I bring them along with me.<eos> - Speaking of deals, how would you like to join Jerry Cleveland Enterprises?<eos> We do shows for county fairs in eight states throughout the Southeast.<eos> And it pays.<eos> Why, yes, sir, I would.
- Speaking of deals, how would you like to join Jerry Cleveland Enterprises?<eos> We do shows for county fairs in eight states throughout the Southeast.<eos> And it pays.<eos> Why, yes, sir, I would.<eos> I would, indeed.
We do shows for county fairs in eight states throughout the Southeast.<eos> And it pays.<eos> Why, yes, sir, I would.<eos> I would, indeed.<eos> Yes, I would! I would!
The November's lining up to take a shot.<eos> Appears our government doesn't approve of your plan.<eos> What you do not understand and what our politicians don't want to accept or face is that the Americans have acquired a first-strike nuclear capability.<eos> what makes you think they'd use it?<eos> We would.
I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark.<eos> He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
This guy's probably got a million-dollar wine collection.<eos> Wow.<eos> The place is temperature controlled, fireproof probably.<eos> It's a great place to hide $10 million.<eos> I would.
It's nice to see you again.<eos> # you're gettin' ready to work # it seems you got a bad connection #<eos> Hey!<eos> # no reception # what will it take to make you understand?<eos> # # bad reaction, what would... #
Maybe when I was a kid, like before I had a VCR in my room and I couldn't, but even then I had Playboys, so...<eos> - Have you ever thought about quitting?<eos> - Quit...?<eos> - You're talking about it like...<eos> No, why would I?
Might not have known where he was or how he got there.<eos> Waking up?<eos> From a dissociated personality state.<eos> He would appear perfectly normal and not remember a thing.<eos> But a fractured part of him would.
It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
My relationship to the real world would be tenuous, at best.<eos> I hear that.<eos> You're a groupie.<eos> I prefer muse.<eos> Sure, who wouldn't?
I've got a song I want to sing to somebody.<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> Kurt, he's still sleeping. ♪ Would you like some tea?<eos> Yes, I would, but shh.
How's your hand?<eos> I'll live.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anyone would have done the same thing, you know.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I know you fancy yourself some kind of rebel, Axl, but sometimes in life, you just have to follow the rules.<eos> I put on sunscreen an hour before going outside.<eos> I wait till the bus comes to a complete stop before standing.<eos> You don't think I would love to fill up on bread?<eos> I would.
What's that?<eos> I remember that case.<eos> That's the pregnancy pact.<eos> You looked good in that.<eos> I still would. Ooh.
Excuse me.<eos> The loops were marking the vessels.<eos> They weren't squeezing them shut.<eos> So even if I left one in, that wouldn't kill the patient.<eos> Ah. Yes, it would.
Lots of people thought so.<eos> Men, especially.<eos> Uh, was there any particular man you're referring to?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't want to speak out of school.<eos> Course you wouldn't.
More likely you'll peddle some fiction to my father about me not being ready to be alone yet. Hmm?<eos> Whatever your pride dictates, I shan't hold it against you.<eos> You know I'm not staying, right?<eos> What? And continue your journey to profound professional satisfaction?<eos> Why would you?
After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
Well, I wouldn't be able to track Ducky's model of phone, but as long as Jimmy's battery hasn't been removed, even if it's dead, I can still get a trickle charge that'll power up the...<eos> His battery's been removed.<eos> According to this error code.<eos> Why would Jimmy do that?<eos> He wouldn't.
Sarah had a controlling interest in the company,<eos> - but now all her shares are sold to Jen.<eos> - Sarah didn't want to sell.<eos> She didn't get a chance to sign the deal memo.<eos> Or maybe she wouldn't.
Probably thought I was so old it would've killed me.<eos> Remember that stripper at your leaving do?<eos> She was uncomfortable.<eos> You know, didn't fancy the idea of stripping in a bar full of coppers.<eos> Who would?
Feel free to snort a little of him.<eos> It was epic.<eos> The mic is now free if anyone would like to talk.<eos> Anyone?<eos> I would.
The yellow fractures show the injuries from the simulated falls, and the red show the actual fractures to your victim.<eos> We couldn't match the same fracture pattern that we found.<eos> What if the body dropped at a 90-degree angle?<eos> Well, how could that be possible if she was thrown over the side?<eos> It wouldn't.
The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.
There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.<eos> I would.
But in this case, we're not trying to catch our killer.<eos> Fosse's already dead.<eos> You know what bugs me?<eos> Why would a guy on a bombing spree be worried about selling his baseball card collection?<eos> He wouldn't.
Then we're all set up for tomorrow night, prime time?<eos> Thank you, Rachel.<eos> Tell Fitz he has 36 hours to convince me, in person, that he regrets the unfortunate choices he's made and truly wants to recommit himself to his wife and children.<eos> If he doesn't, he will have the pleasure of seeing the First Lady of the United States call her husband a whore-loving bastard on national television.<eos> You wouldn't.
Lord Aysgarth, I'm modern.<eos> I don't hanker for those days before the war.<eos> And I don't really want to spend the rest of my life among people who think me loud and opinionated and common.<eos> But I assure you, they wouldn't.<eos> Ah, yes, they would.
I know it's a shame, but it's just until she can get buried.<eos> Here.<eos> I want you to take this and go see her.<eos> You have a key to the diner?<eos> Well, I'd better.
Honestly, Mina, it's like talking to a man sometimes, nose buried in whatever silly thing has captured his attention.<eos> Lucy, what's wrong?<eos> I hate this.<eos> Lucy, I... I don't understand.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?<eos> Mr. Kenneth wouldn't say that.<eos> Would he?<eos> Of course he would.
Boo-hoo. Done?<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause this is what I know.<eos> I'm not giving you anything.<eos> Why would I?
Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.<eos> Would you, you sweet, sweet man?
Why are you hunting down your own kind?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Someday, this war between our species is going to end.<eos> And when it does, I'd like to be on the side that's still standing.<eos> Wouldn't you?
Yes.<eos> You're frightened.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I could come to visit you, if you like.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I need to tell him something before I lose my nerve.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Oh, there must be something you can do.<eos> I-I mean, I'm sure that a hard-working, but poorly paid man like you probably wouldn't take a bribe.<eos> I wouldn't.
Oh, there must be something you can do.<eos> I-I mean, I'm sure that a hard-working, but poorly paid man like you probably wouldn't take a bribe.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> And you wouldn't know anyone else who would take a bribe?<eos> - I would not.
No, no, no.<eos> He needs to know.<eos> What?<eos> D.A. wanted him to give you up.<eos> He wouldn't.
Beyond inspiring, wow.<eos> Sean, I hope you were listening to what Blake had to say.<eos> I gotta be honest, I tried, but I'm still pretty buzzed from breakfast because I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Okay, who'd like to share next?<eos> Sean would.
Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> Had.<eos> How do you two get along?<eos> He's never laid a hand on me.<eos> Ever. And he never would.
But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that, and it's a shame too, because I had a great eulogy.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Would you like me to share it with you?<eos> I most certainly would.
Did I say something funny?<eos> When I first told you about Robinson, Harold you were against it.<eos> Now, all of the sudden you're worried about him.<eos> Wonder how that happened.<eos> - Why, any decent-minded person would... - Sympathy, Harold.
On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
Do you think he'll tell his father?<eos> No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> What about Danny?<eos> Do you think he'll tell the authorities?<eos> - He'd never.
And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to "F-up his pussy ass."<eos> Which is what she said.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I would never. To a child?
Want a beer?<eos> As long as it's cold.<eos> You seeing someone?<eos> Would you like to see my new tattoo?<eos> Would you?
I'm free!<eos> My father ignores my mother. And me!<eos> Bruno doesn't ignore me.<eos> He loves me!<eos> Why wouldn't he? With all this understanding?
- Yeah. You really want me to sic my husband on you in the state he's in?<eos> You're right. That kind of thing could lead a man to drink.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And then his glorious mangina might make an appearance. Wouldn't want to see that happen, would we?<eos> Actually, I would.
No.<eos> You cannot touch the sacred tree.<eos> I guess my bite is worse than your bark.<eos> You... you wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
It's not right.<eos> Makes me look like a dirty old man.<eos> I have to ask.<eos> No.<eos> I never, I would never.
- So great.<eos> - But I won't.<eos> I have a fairly specific rental agreement.<eos> If they miss a payment, I'm within my rights to evict. - Oh, come on.<eos> Why would you--
Er...<eos> What if I'd opened that door ten minutes earlier?<eos> Or even five?<eos> Would it have made a difference?<eos> Well, would it?
"Preternatural ability."<eos> Robbie's been doing that.<eos> Been doing that a lot.<eos> "Affirmation.<eos> "The host would...
I just read the day shopping networks make their money on the day seniors pick up their social security checks.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> Alright, you shouldn't say things like that, cause a host of a jewelry channel may up and do it.<eos> You would feel bad.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Kill yourself.<eos> Alright, you shouldn't say things like that, cause a host of a jewelry channel may up and do it.<eos> You would feel bad.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Yes, you would.
The ones we thought would forever be at our side.<eos> But in their passing, the chains that bound us to desires not our own have been struck.<eos> And without such a blow, we would not find ourselves in each other's arms.<eos> No.<eos> We would not.
Ahem. Uh, now that, uh, we're all here,<eos> I'd like to make a toast to, um, to Jerry.<eos> He was a good man and a good cop.<eos> I never got to tell him that.<eos> So, um, I'd just...
No. Actually, I don't.<eos> There's nothing I really like about you.<eos> Where's your girlfriend?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I would.
You mustn't be.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> But when he comes home, he will make me his mistress.<eos> Or he won't.<eos> But you wouldn't!
Look, we're not gonna get anywhere if you insist on joking around.<eos> What do you charge?<eos> If your blow outs are as good as I think they are, you could be charging ten times that amount.<eos> Oh, people wouldn't pay that.<eos> Of course they would.
But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
Her dad knows the security guard.<eos> You told me all this last night, I'm not going to sleep with you again this morning.<eos> Maybe I should just go in there and confess.<eos> Tell my dad what happened. No. If Dylan's father knows anything, you think he's going to rat out his own offspring?<eos> My dad would.
Look, I liked Susan, but it's not inconceivable that she forged the signature<eos> - and fudged the insurance on her own.<eos> - Well, maybe she fudged something else, like this mysterious engagement to someone a couple days before she was murdered.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know who that was, do you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
Now I'm going over reports from last night, see if there's anything I should carry over.<eos> Wow, way to work it.<eos> Well, I just don't want people thinking I got this promotion because I'm sleeping with Jerry.<eos> No one's gonna think that.<eos> I would.
Being responsible.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I was crossing the street, it was about two in the morning and I was hit by a drunk driver.<eos> LAUGHTER I always wondered if he tells people that he got hit by a drunk pedestrian.<eos> LAUGHTER I would.
I have been eating a lot of soy lately.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I really picked up the slack in there.<eos> That does not make me feel better.<eos> Would it help if I told you we could barely hear you yelling at your penis in the bathroom?<eos> It would not.
Nothing.<eos> Eat it.<eos> Have it.<eos> It looks nice.<eos> Why wouldn't you...?
Klaus, where's Tyler?<eos> Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...<eos> He wouldn't.
Dr. Wilder.<eos> He brought me back.<eos> He did 20 minutes of CPR, shocked me three more times.<eos> He didn't give up on me.<eos> He just... wouldn't.
Dad?<eos> I don't want to talk about it, Sonny.<eos> Okay. And I'm pissed at all of you.<eos> That's why I left. I just want to calm down.<eos> I'd just like a few minutes to myself.
- Yeah.<eos> "And then when I got pregnant, I was just like, "Get me the fuck out."<eos> But your blog looks so happy.<eos> I don't think my Mom would read it if it were about depression.<eos> My Mom would.
Do I have a curfew?<eos> Can I stay up and watch Jon Stewart?<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> No, I think it's ridiculous; you wouldn't do this to any other cop caught in the same situation.<eos> I damn sure would.
Reycraft, listen.<eos> If I needed some time off, would you cover me?<eos> Mat leave?<eos> Who's your baby daddy?<eos> Seriously, would you?
Linus.<eos> What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie. - Oh, relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
Soon as I do, they'll burn this world and us with it.<eos> So, Oswin, my question is this.<eos> How fast can you drop the force-field?<eos> Pretty fast.<eos> But why would I?
You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually...<eos> I would.
Sit down! You should be nicer to your son.<eos> It's just a thought.<eos> Who wants to hear a song?<eos> We'd love to sing a song for you.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
And we have a responsibility to see what those needs are and to address them.<eos> What would you have us do?<eos> Sit down with every student in the state?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
I may have changed a few lives today.<eos> Oh, please let me tell him.<eos> I don't know, I kind of promised Howard. Tell me what?<eos> Actually, we should all share the moment.<eos> Raj, if you would.
There is no right time or wrong time to save someone in need, Barb.<eos> And it's important to me that our children know we feel that way.<eos> But she wants to go home.<eos> She doesn't know what she wants.<eos> Who would?
You know Jim Brass-- you two worked the Anne-Marie Tolsom case.<eos> You ever hear of professional courtesy?<eos> We're on the trail of Anne-Marie's body.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> Well, I damn straight would.
Well, let's give the guy a couple days.<eos> He's been through the wringer in two cities...<eos> You saying you want to delay?<eos> We all want to put this to bed, Detective, Langston included.<eos> Who wouldn't, in his situation?
I think she's going to see that boy Alex.<eos> Wait a minute, we don't know that she's lying.<eos> You know, she needs a consequence because she lied.<eos> Okay, if she's lying, she needs a consequence, or she's just gonna keep lying.<eos> I would.
I always will.<eos> If that's the case, why not fight for him?<eos> - Against Priss?<eos> I'd never win.<eos> - Sure you would.
What happened?<eos> You have every reason to hate me.<eos> I don't even know why I'm here.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I would.
These are homeless people, Connor.<eos> No relatives, no one to look out for them. The authorities don't care.<eos> Listen, if there was a creature out there, then we'd already know about it, believe me.<eos> How?<eos> We just would.
Clear.<eos> She looks different.<eos> She's happy.<eos> Do you think she's told him?<eos> Would you?
It could rip a hole in the universe.<eos> Except, he's done it before.<eos> And, in fairness, the universe did blow up.<eos> But he'd want to know!<eos> Would he?
Okay. All right, not the most original of openers.<eos> Let me try this again.<eos> Would you like to go grab a cup of coffee?<eos> So?<eos> Would you?
- Sorry, Judith.<eos> He was rutting away till dawn.<eos> Fortunately, after eight or nine hours, Peter was spent and the high priestess very kindly gave us a lift back to the airport.<eos> I must say, for as long as I live, I would never go back there.<eos> I would.
Okay, well, then, I guess you're just gonna have to call the police.<eos> Or I just go down now and get her.<eos> - That wouldn't go well.<eos> - No.<eos> It wouldn't.
I want you to come live with me.<eos> You'd hate it.<eos> So would I.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> And neither would barry or the boys.
Please.<eos> Please, just tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - You wouldn't underand.<eos> - Try.<eos> - You wouldn't.
No.<eos> Come on, Peter. No.<eos> No. No, the FBI is not gonna pay for your combat training.<eos> Think about what I could do for you guys if I knew how to fight.<eos> No, I'd rather not.
Yes, and he ate something shiny.<eos> Glitter.<eos> Somehow he ingested it.<eos> Why would a horse eat glitter?<eos> He wouldn't.
- I'm not the one in the wrong.<eos> - You will be if you tell Paul.<eos> Wouldn't you want to know?<eos> In his situation?<eos> Wouldn't you?
I see.<eos> And he says there was no reason why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life.<eos> Just not a very mobile one.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> I would.
Now, it's the kids that nag, not the wife.<eos> He's grown a lot.<eos> I wouldn't recognize him.<eos> If we met our lost sons on the streets, - We wouldn't recognize them.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
Dumped in a field in Schenectady.<eos> Ouch.<eos> You mind if I make a move ?<eos> I know she's out of my league, but she's at a spud gun contest with the soon-to-be five-time runner-up, so she's probably got some self-esteem issues.<eos> You wouldn't.
What?<eos> ! We'll be the laughing stock of Stoolbend!<eos> We're not doing it.<eos> Oh, you're doing it, or I'll sign you up for the summer reading program.<eos> You wouldn't.
I think something else caused this.<eos> Could this be the age of these bones as opposed to the others?<eos> Well, he's significantly older.<eos> Arthritis in the joints puts him in his late 50s, but that doesn't account for this degree of breakdown.<eos> In fact, nothing in the ocean would.
And are you and George friends now?<eos> [scoffs] Come on, Grace.<eos> George is George.<eos> You wouldn't... Cheat on Jeff?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
It did it in 1 minute 25 dead so, even though it was a damp track, it was faster than an M3.<eos> Very good, but hang on, because I think there was a bit of film there we didn't see. No, there wasn't.<eos> There was, from the final run.<eos> I think the audience would like to see it.<eos> No, they wouldn't.

So that she could gain access to your real daughter's trust fund<eos> Just so su could take the money for yourself?<eos> I think the authorities would have a problem with that,<eos> And your family would, too.<eos> You wouldn't.
Because a conviction would only prove you failed.<eos> An innocent man in prison for the rest of his life because of your incompetence.<eos> Imagine having to live with that.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> You would.
Do think that in some way had something to do with your father abandoning you and your family?<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> -l think that's a stretch. -Perhaps, but you said yourself if he showed up today you'd welcome him back into your life.<eos> -l didn't say that.<eos> -So you wouldn't?
I'm so sorry.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Let me, uh, let me make you some breakfast. Oh.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> No, I-I would...
Make it up to him.<eos> You can't feel that bad, then.<eos> Yeah, if you felt that bad, you'd at least think about it, wouldn't you?<eos> Would I?<eos> I would.
I was talking to,um,jim,and i don't think jim's fond of getting rid of ozzy.<eos> Who is closest to ode?<eos> Elyse?<eos> I think she's in ozzy's back pocket.<eos> would***
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.<eos> There's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.<eos> Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.<eos> Why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?<eos> He wouldn't.
Merlin took some from here earlier.<eos> He was really angry when he realised Arthur wasn't going to eat it.<eos> He has been behaving very strangely.<eos> Why would Merlin want to kill Arthur?<eos> He wouldn't.
- Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just tryin' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> - Yes, I would.
I have no ambition in this field.<eos> It is only to ... buy paint.<eos> Where do you play?<eos> I would like to go to listen.<eos> You'd rather not.
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids.<eos> - Yeah, Rubber Dinghy Rapids.<eos> Right? - OK, I would kill you, brother Omar.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
Flicka helped heal my broken spirit.<eos> And has become part of my soul.<eos> She embodies all that is pure and true.<eos> I would do anything to save her.<eos> So would I, Katy.
Money owed.<eos> I got a nice penthouse in Old Victoria, I'm happy with me digs.<eos> You should come and see me.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Would you?
is there a surgery or something that we could... I honestly wouldn't recommend it.<eos> It's very risky. Right. Okay.<eos> Excuse me. Thank you, Doctor. Babe.<eos> -Babe. lt's okay.<eos> Would you...
Give her my number.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It is a famous party.<eos> And I will be famous.<eos> Would you?
Mommy and daddy still sneak off for smoochy-smooch, Despite the fact that they've been together since prom.<eos> So tell me, Emma.<eos> Why would we trade any of that<eos> To go to a place full of earthcakes?<eos> We wouldn't.
So tell me, Emma.<eos> Why would we trade any of that<eos> To go to a place full of earthcakes?<eos> We wouldn't.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Was his cock of impressive size when engorged?<eos> How many times did he have you?<eos> Huh?<eos> Speak. He would not have me.<eos> He would not?
It's not about my pride, it's about the principle.<eos> They're trying to screw us over because we're small.<eos> That's what they're supposed to do. They should be pressuring other hospitals to be more like us, not trying to make us more like them. It's stupid.<eos> And putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?<eos> You would.
They're exactly what you wanted.<eos> Yes, because I'm a fucking moron.<eos> No, you're just a little insane, 'cause you hate everything you ever done.<eos> No real guy would wear these.<eos> - I would.
They pick lettuce all day, live like 30-deep in some rat-piss apartment or else, like, you know, homemade tents out by the highway.<eos> Point is, they ain't running shit. - No.<eos> - "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
Why can't the doctors tell us what is wrong with him?<eos> How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here?<eos> Don't you see, Renai?<eos> You want to believe.<eos> Anybody would.
Milk...<eos> One sugar, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, and why would you know how I take my coffee?<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
And, uh, well, you asked if there was something<eos> - that would make me feel better...<eos> - So go with feeling better.<eos> I... I couldn't.<eos> I wouldn't even... I...
She seems to think you are her master, Thomas.<eos> Who's a fine lady?<eos> Who's a splendid lady?<eos> Would you like a drinky of water?<eos> Would you?
I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
Well, I'll leave soon.<eos> So, what else?<eos> You know, the whole thing you said about, you know, feeling in the moment,<eos> I wasn't feeling in the moment at all.<eos> Why would she?
Feeling like a fat, stupid, ugly nothing?<eos> Dom, come on.<eos> No, hey, everything my uncle said is true.<eos> Who'd want me unless I paid, right?<eos> And who would? Huh?
It's not genetic, okay?<eos> 'Cause I would never ever... do that to you.<eos> I didn't even think of that.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, well, of course, I would never.
I-I think maybe it's a good idea.<eos> Better to have loved and lost, eh, Vincent?<eos> I-I wouldn't know.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
I may have to hurt you massively.<eos> She'll do it.<eos> I may have to hurt you.<eos> I would do it for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't!
She'll do it.<eos> I may have to hurt you.<eos> I would do it for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't!<eos> Yes, I would!
Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancee?<eos> He'd better!
Ames, we do this, it's over.<eos> We can live whatever life we want.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Of course she's gonna do it.<eos> I would.
That's right.<eos> And famine everywhere. I mean, it's a multibillion-dollar market ready for Wakefield to dominate.<eos> It's so arcane, brutal.<eos> She'd have to be a monster.<eos> Yes, she would.
That's it.<eos> Oh, and I would love to be able to walk into a nightclub without having every queen in the room leaping on me like I'm a Gay Pride float.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who wants to share next?<eos> I would.
- Yeah.<eos> I love Rita, you love Rita. What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work".<eos> She would.
You've got your pride when it suits you, but this whole time you're running around with that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're deserting me.<eos> I would never...
Let's get a dictionary and look that word up for you.<eos> I'm not having an affair, Paul.<eos> That's what everybody who has an affair says in the beginning.<eos> Trust me, I wouldn't even know how to get an affair started.<eos> Sure you would.
Oh, my God.<eos> And your mother, she doesn't even realize that she's the craziest one of them all.<eos> This is great.<eos> I may never leave.<eos> Why would you?
I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
The steering wheel's at a weird angle.<eos> The airbag didn't deploy.<eos> Someone was definitely trying to make sure the baby got hurt in the collision.<eos> Why would a carjacker go to this much trouble?<eos> He wouldn't.
No, nothing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He wouldn't do that to us.<eos> He wouldn't.
Dead right.<eos> They're all overpaid.<eos> He has, therefore, decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity.<eos> Give me the houses and cars they give him, I'll donate a third of my salary too.<eos> - You would not, not in a million years.
This blade is ... specifically created to cut skin and muscles.<eos> It's a knife for human flesh.<eos> "Unbelievable" "Imagine your"<eos> He really wants to do that.<eos> Why would it?
She did the right thing.<eos> - Fuck off! -<eos> Put your feelings aside, cop!<eos> We need everyone.<eos> He wouldn't.
I want you to take me back to New York with you.<eos> Take you back?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Son, I'd like to do that.<eos> I really would.
Hey, Nordic.<eos> I just read in Us Weekly that Lance is dating one of the Olsen twins.<eos> Which must be total vindication for Sheryl Crow.<eos> I mean, that guy is just gonna fuck everyone, isn't he?<eos> Hey, I would.
It's on television. You know.<eos> The male body's the "in" thing, right?<eos> I hear a guy can get a blow job real easy around here.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> You wouldn't ?
All right.<eos> All right,I'll tell you what you want to know.<eos> No,my husband didn't know I was having an affair with the Kings' manny.<eos> Would I have killed Cal to prevent him from finding out?<eos> No,I would not.
- I panicked.<eos> At that moment, if you'd gone to the police, it would've been the end. For me, Marian, for my children. And I'm not talking about prison, you understand?<eos> They would've killed us all.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would?
There is a knife in your brain.<eos> -Right, yeah.<eos> -By some miracle, you're still alive.<eos> If you're gonna get stabbed in the head, you picked exactly the right spot, but, then...<eos> -...you would.
What the fuck did you do?<eos> Nothing. I didn't do anything!<eos> You made her do this.<eos> You killed her.<eos> No. No, Tom, I would never.
OK, here we go.<eos> One more. Lovely.<eos> Have one of me and Freddie, eh?<eos> you'd better not hurt my daughter again, do you hear me?<eos> - I wouldn't.
"we're out of trans fat!<eos> You won't be fried today!"<eos> Because I will not do it.<eos> - How'd you like to get that bunny?<eos> - Would I?
Right indeed. Here indeed. Yes, I am, sir!<eos> I want you to turn this settlement upside down until you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson!<eos> That fat bastard thinks he can steal my bride and get away with it?<eos> I wouldn't bet a corn farthing on him escaping.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Wish I could tell you I found every hole and patched it but no such thing as perfect security. Perfect, no.<eos> But is it sufficient? The damn thing is tricky.<eos> Can't know for sure, not really.<eos> - Who would know?<eos> - He would.
Is he around?<eos> He died in the war.<eos> You need a new hose.<eos> Will that take long?<eos> A new one would.
I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
It's been authorized, and it's a fact if you will accept.<eos> It would mean leaving the unit.<eos> Unit's a colonel's billet, tom.<eos> Would you like to think about it?<eos> Yes, sir, i would.
So... 20 weeks.<eos> First ultrasound.<eos> Do we want to know the sex of the baby?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I would.
Either that or to let me pass the exam...<eos> With compliments.<eos> - You think he would agree to that?<eos> He is tricky.<eos> - He would.
Got yourself beaten up, cos you thought it would make a difference.<eos> My son...<eos> Your son walked away when he found out what Riley did.<eos> He could've stuck with it, be rolling in it.<eos> Most fellas would.
She would never kill herself.<eos> Agent, the surveillance you wanted is ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She wouldn't do it.<eos> She just wouldn't.
Girls, I'm telling you, are not into the flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Would James Bond use a cane?<eos> No, he would not.
- Dan.<eos> - Dan.<eos> Can I meet him?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
My husband did not do this thing.<eos> If he went into jail, what would happen to the kids?<eos> They'd go into care.<eos> And he wouldn't do that to me.<eos> He wouldn't.
Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work right now, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't slap me with a harassment suit for telling you this but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> - Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
If we don't cut this deal, then... her murderer could walk.<eos> It's your case, Booth.<eos> What I want doesn't matter.<eos> To me, it does.<eos> And it would to Sachi.
It has to be a real kiss.<eos> Tongue optional.<eos> What a wimp.<eos> - Like you'd do it?<eos> - Maybe I would.
Becoming pregnant with sixteen... and then you're coming back here!<eos> I don't want to have that child, too!<eos> There are still so many things I want to do.<eos> Then have an abortion.<eos> I would, but... 120.2.2.
- I don't know.<eos> I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.<eos> I guess.<eos> - It would take the pressure off.<eos> - It would, wouldn't it?
Not today, chief. Not on my watch.<eos> Okay, I totally thought that was gonna end different.<eos> Yeah, more like that.<eos> Dr. Bailey, care to fill us in?<eos> No, I would not.
Or a projection of the man's own fears.<eos> Ok, so is that what's galloping around town right now, his fears?<eos> Or his rage.<eos> You said he didn't take the diagnosis well.<eos> Um, would you?
A... a doctor has been hired.<eos> And he's great, and everything's going be great.<eos> If you could erase bad memories, do you think everything in your life would better?<eos> There's some things in my life I'd like to erase.<eos> Yeah, wouldn't we all?
Why, you wanna report this?<eos> You just stood and watched that's a punishable offense.<eos> You've changed so much while you were away.<eos> You think you wouldn't change?<eos> You would too, with enough money.
Call them off, Malcolm!<eos> Go ahead, shoot the kid.<eos> He's willing to die for his cause.<eos> Is that what you want, Jay?<eos> He'd rather not, Malcolm.
Walt said the fire trucks came here, On university av, but the fire station<eos> Is there and the lab is there.<eos> Yeah. But garden av is a direct route.<eos> Why would the firefighters go the long way around?<eos> They wouldn't.
Have you seen him?<eos> Not since he told me he was leaving.<eos> For all I know, he's already gone.<eos> He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.<eos> Yes, he would.
Conversation's over.<eos> Playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher,<eos> I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.<eos> And you would know, huh?<eos> - I would.
Sean Allison.<eos> You wouldn't do it.<eos> For that kind of money?<eos> You're gods damn right I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Don't even tell me.<eos> You can sleep with whoever you want.<eos> Betty, no. Of course not.<eos> I would never do anything like that--<eos> Darn right you wouldn't.
Henry, I have it on very good authority that she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.<eos> She fornicated with him on many occasions. Sometimes brazenly entering his chambers at night.<eos> I've heard those rumours.<eos> She denies it.<eos> Well, she would, wouldn't she?
- But why should anyone ever know?<eos> - Don't be stupid, Brereton.<eos> They would find you and torture you,<eos> - and you would tell them everything.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
Hey, Brooks. You got a camera on your cell phone?<eos> Take my picture.<eos> Fuck you. Hey.<eos> You wanna see how this is done? Get in close.<eos> I wouldn't.
They'll never get a conviction.<eos> What about me?<eos> They'll be seeking a lookie-likie.<eos> Why not try twinnie?<eos> I would!
- A good sarge knows her staff.<eos> I can tell you the names of everyone who works at our nick.<eos> Fine.<eos> But do you know them?<eos> - A good sarge would.
In a bit.<eos> Norma, would you pop upstairs and wake Mum?<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - No!<eos> Norma, would you?
I mean, he thought that his life is, like, really dramatic...<eos> I thought you were on crack when you showed us that.<eos> It's, like, why would you waste your time videotaping...<eos> Simon, you want to get that?<eos> Why would Simon...
The best that we could.<eos> Our old furniture barely fills half the new house.<eos> Maybe you could give my wife some decorating tips.<eos> Sure.Call a decorator.<eos> who'd up for a harvey wallbanger.
I don't think it's bad to be gay.<eos> I'm not saying it's bad. I just don't think I want Birdy to be like...that.<eos> Life would be easier for her if she wasn't.<eos> I sure as hell wouldn't want any a son of mine growing up queer.<eos> Jim! Well, I wouldn't.
- I know, I know!<eos> And you could be such, such a wonderful mother!<eos> So wonderful!<eos> But I don't remember a boy turning up!<eos> And surely I would!
Which is fine.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Well, you know, it's not what you think.<eos> Our social calendar is really limited, and we have to consider our entire year when we make plans.<eos> Any smart social chair would.
I can't find Luisa.<eos> Did you ask her maid?<eos> She hasn't seen her since last night.<eos> She wouldn't have gone out knowing the danger.<eos> Wouldn't she?
One: don't believe anything he says.<eos> Two: always keep him in front of you.<eos> And three:<eos> under no circumstances let him kiss you.<eos> As if I would!
-What?<eos> No more Laundromats.<eos> We come home and go onto a run without worrying about dirty shorts.<eos> I never go running with you.<eos> Maybe you would with a drawer full of clean jog bras.
I thought Steven's affair with Helen would've come into that category.<eos> So, he's sent you here to spy on us?<eos> I prefer to call it management appraisal.<eos> I should leave him up there to die because of what happened with him and Helen?<eos> Some people would.
What Nathan said about Linderman...<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Come on, Angela.<eos> Linderman wouldn't dare go after Nathan on his own.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Right back at you.<eos> So,crocotta,huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> That would explain the flies.<eos> Yeah,it would.
Robert and Abi, though, they seem contented little kids.<eos> I'm sure they'd rather be together, with your sister.<eos> Is he fast?<eos> Cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he takes a couple of steps.<eos> I would, too.
All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
Be careful, Lily.<eos> The world absolutely needs Woo Girls.<eos> If there were no Woo Girls, there'd be no Girls Gone Wild, no bachelorette parties, no Las Vegas poolside bars...<eos> - Those are none of the things... - The souvenir shot glass industry would collapse.<eos> So would the body glitter industry and the stretch Hummer rental industry.
Only it was going to be me that died and her sitting here with dumb cops asking dumb questions.<eos> ******<eos> Why was she?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Sure she would.
