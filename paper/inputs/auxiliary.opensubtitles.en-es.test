We don't want you here.<eos> Why not?<eos> Aren't all believers welcome?<eos> You don't believe.<eos> Yes, I do.
You're always so fucking amused.<eos> We all make choices.<eos> Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know<eos> I killed that hacker chick? Well, guess what.<eos> She does.
And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, Pinocchio?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
You sure he exists?<eos> He exists.<eos> He gave your son $5,000.<eos> Sekou don't have $5,000.<eos> He does, ma'am.
- No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
I knew where everything was heading.<eos> I... I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really... I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
- An official title--<eos> Senior Advisor to the President, and an office in the West Wing.<eos> It would be the greatest honor of my career.<eos> I know you had your concerns about even coming on temporarily.<eos> I did, yeah.
He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know... I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.
When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know... I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.<eos> - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
Why don't you just take an acting class?<eos> Shut up, Marnie!<eos> What do I look like, Ryan Dillon Davidson? Pff!<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's not my book.<eos> It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's true...<eos> I borrowed your pills.<eos> Looks real.<eos> Indeed, it does.
- He found me.<eos> - What?<eos> He's... He's there in Australia?<eos> Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?<eos> No, I didn't.
They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
She had no idea, did she?<eos> Can't feel my arms.<eos> You won't.<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.<eos> Just like I don't.
He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.<eos> Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?
This camp is going to fight it with or without you.<eos> They may call you a king, but only in the kingdom that is no more.<eos> We're all free men here.<eos> And I wish to stay that way.<eos> As do we all.
If you could help me gain your husband's ear again, this time in private, outside the presence of those other men...<eos> My husband's commercial interests have grown 12-fold in the past three years.<eos> By some estimates, the estate represents the ninth largest family fortune in the Americas.<eos> Does that sound like something built by a man who would discard an opportunity as promising as this because of what the neighbors might think?<eos> No, it doesn't.
And she is interested.<eos> She invited me to return this evening to provide details of our proposal.<eos> Prove that we can be trusted to manage Nassau in the event of Rogers' removal.<eos> And I think you should come with me.<eos> You do?
Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
- The Cannibal?<eos> Clustercide.<eos> Story is he ate his own.<eos> - Do you know his real name?<eos> - No one does.

Stop crying.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's not that bad.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't...
The fake ID is a breeze.<eos> There is only one little problem...<eos> Do you know anything about tending bar?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> She doesn't, does she?

I want to be with you.<eos> So do I.<eos> We can't do it at the expense of my child though.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I do.
- Come on.<eos> - That was no heart attack.<eos> - Who had a heart attack?<eos> - Clemenza.<eos> Only he didn't.
Exactly what did Karen say to you?<eos> We'll talk about it tomorrow.<eos> Hopefully, you'll come to your senses by then.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Oh, hello.<eos> We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
Excuse me, sir, this is...<eos> Won't be but a moment.<eos> He's still in Richard's body.<eos> Richard doesn't care, darling.<eos> I fucking do.
It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> I felt that way.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
-Wait up, man.<eos> I don't think that's too smart, man.<eos> There's two of them up in there now.<eos> That changes everything.<eos> -No, it doesn't.
It's simple now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Coming?<eos> - I thought he caught a life sentence from the Detroit job.<eos> -He did.
OK, wait til I come home and I'll make it.<eos> - No, no-one's going home.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - No you don't!
We've decided.<eos> Teena McGuire is a lying whore, no-one's gonna believer her.<eos> My boys are not pleading guilty to something they did not do.<eos> That's it!<eos> Innocent people don't do time.
You think no one understands you?<eos> Yeah, I do, because I made a very intense choice to take this on all by myself, okay?<eos> I decided to be brave and just go it alone...<eos> Mom, I buckle my bra every day, okay?<eos> But just do it for a second.
I'll... I'll get to it later.<eos> I have never felt such an intense need to just, like, Instagram a stranger.<eos> (Sighs) I get that a lot.<eos> You know, no one's expecting all of this in all of this.<eos> - No, they don't. - _
- Not steal fine china.<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> Or someone else's fucking boyfriend.<eos> Can't believe you just said that.<eos> I did.
Fuck. Ge...<eos> You don't even like Adam. How are you mad at me about Adam?<eos> You wouldn't even let him drink milk from your fridge.<eos> Well, that's because he has oral herpes.<eos> - Oh, no he doesn't.
Very tortured woman.<eos> But our daughter is a good girl, so, you know, I have to believe that this... life, this mother, is teaching her something, you know, building her up strong, because, uh,<eos> she's had some depression stuff this year and it got kind of serious, but, um... she's good.<eos> - Listen, I don't know you...<eos> - No, Hannah, you do not.
- I am so sick of Grey areas.<eos> When I was in fifth grade, I had this English teacher, Mr. Lasky.<eos> He liked me.<eos> He was impressed with me.<eos> I did, like, special creative writing.
I mean, they'll think they'll know everything, but they won't.<eos> - Like what happened to you.<eos> - Like what happened to me.<eos> You thought you knew everything, but you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I'm not gonna act like that's not what's going on, okay?<eos> It's fine if that's what you wanna do, but...<eos> Elijah, I understand that this might seem crazy, but you know what?<eos> I need you.<eos> I really do.
- Totally! Exactly!<eos> Their true, deepest, most intimate selves.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And of course we know the correct answer.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
I started in the theater department.<eos> I wanted to be a stage actor more than anything, but I never got cast, and my dad kept telling me that no one was going to cast me and I needed another job.<eos> He said that the last thing this world needs is another actor, and I was like, "Thanks, asshole."<eos> Parents don't always know.<eos> Mine didn't.
For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?<eos> No one did.
What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
Of course it was.<eos> I take it you...<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> And I assume you want us to...<eos> Yes, I do.
I just, uh, dropped off Jessica.<eos> And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell.<eos> Looks like it's rough going.<eos> I thought those things actually worked.<eos> They do.
Suse, the damage is done.<eos> You saw the jury's faces.<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.<eos> His office is a big Oval.<eos> You want the hospital secured, ma'am?<eos> Yes, Agent Spaulding, I do.
A lot.<eos> Still wanna split up?<eos> We can deal with it.<eos> We just need to find Brett's trail.<eos> No, we don't.
She needs to be kicked off the team.<eos> I agree, but she is dangerous. Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
- Hey, are you sure you're okay?<eos> You're not still upset with me about...<eos> No, promise.<eos> He doesn't have anything on you, right?<eos> He does.
The... the book I was writing about Alison where we met, andand I started...<eos> I started this relationship by lying to you.<eos> I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now.<eos> I would have deserved it.<eos> - And maybe I still do.
I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now.<eos> I would have deserved it.<eos> - And maybe I still do.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you do not.
Okay?<eos> I was scared.<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.<eos> You don't need to tell me that.<eos> Yes, I do!
I was scared.<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.<eos> You don't need to tell me that.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> I do.
The whole drive up, I thought about just staying on the road.<eos> Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?<eos> You know what it's like to be the outsider.<eos> I do.
Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no...<eos> I-I don't have names.<eos> Alright.<eos> I never did.
The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Wanheda saved us, all of us...<eos> Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you.<eos> Azgeda has no authority here.<eos> We do now.
Yeah, Rip yarded us in.<eos> You remember his speech?<eos> I know you don't.<eos> You were too busy running your mouth.<eos> Of course I do.
Well, I... I guess it's best if I just move on.<eos> Okay. I'm here.<eos> Your collateral, all of it.<eos> - Thought we had a deal.<eos> - We did.
- You don't know that.<eos> - It's not your fault, Joe.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Buck wore this trident on his uniform.<eos> All seals do.
Right, rip?<eos> Make me believe it.<eos> O0 c1 when you call up your witness, you want to swear them in first, like this.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Joseph.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> No, I do.
They charged Frank.<eos> And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.
Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Will you stop attacking him, please?<eos> All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.<eos> Well, now you need to do the same thing for Connor.<eos> - Yeah, he hated Wes.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I think Laurel just called for me.<eos> You're gonna have to respond to him at some point.<eos> The only appropriate response to "I love you"<eos> is "I love you."<eos> Okay, but do you?
Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.<eos> I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
All those years we built this place together.<eos> And all that time I've supported you... looked up to you, deferred to you.<eos> Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<eos> I have.<eos> You did.
- Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family.<eos> We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
There's no need to get narky with her, Natalie.<eos> Julie don't get narky with me.<eos> What's Julie got to do with it?<eos> I thought you didn't mind looking after them?<eos> I don't!
In what?<eos> People.<eos> These people.<eos> And that Shannon will be found.<eos> But you don't do God?
So you do know him.<eos> You must have been surprised when you heard where Shannon had been found?<eos> Yeah, I were, dead surprised.<eos> Did you ever think to yourself that your Uncle Mick might have her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> And you said, friends don't lie to each other.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Did I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Cool story, bro.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You achieved nine erections while you were sleeping.<eos> Would you like to see the chart?<eos> - What do you...
Was that the woman in the accident?<eos> Oh, I can't sleep because I keep being dragged back to that place.<eos> Do you have any idea what that's like?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
He knows what's been happening between me and Nora.<eos> What?<eos> She doesn't need to see that.<eos> She's my patient now, and, yes...<eos> Yes, she does.
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.<eos> You were great today.<eos> You too.<eos> Those folks love you.<eos> Who doesn't?
Well, I heard about what happened from some cops, who all said to pay that money, the 350 large.<eos> You're worth a lot of money, JP.<eos> You probably owe some of that to your brother for making sure you stayed on track.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Oh, okay, what...<eos> What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?<eos> Well, actually, I'm from the past, but that's beside the point.<eos> Look, George, I don't care about movies, but guys like them?<eos> They do.
Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do.
She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
We need to get them off of the island.<eos> Ok.<eos> Curtis can handle it.<eos> I can understand if you don't want to go with Malcolm.<eos> Damn right I don't.
- Please.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> It is just very interesting how we choose our words, and how we express those words in order to...<eos> I'm so looking forward to meeting your plus one, if she exists.<eos> Well, she does.
Do you remember when he used to lie on the floor and watch us have sex?<eos> - That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. It was another set of eyes watching me have sex.<eos> - He didn't know what he was seeing.<eos> - He absolutely did.
I would feel bad, for you, for doing this.<eos> Then I would feel sad, too.<eos> I know I'm not... ready to be a father.<eos> Do you think that's how Jesus would feel if he knew?<eos> I do.
I'm just grateful Rita gave me a job.<eos> - Well, look who's here.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How we doing?
- Why didn't you say anything?<eos> - Because...<eos> When Aaron kissed me, it didn't mean anything.<eos> I was hoping that you felt the same way.<eos> Unless... did it?
I was kind of hoping I could move into the... garage?<eos> Well, Callie and Mariana might have an opinion about that.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mariana will have an opinion, but... I'm fine with it, I don't want to sleep up there.<eos> I think that's a great idea.<eos> Oh, do you?
- So Jesus can keep my room.<eos> - How generous.<eos> Hey, I'm the one who offered Jesus my room in the first place.<eos> Okay, well, what if I wanted to live out there, huh?<eos> Do you?
What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.
Yes, I did.<eos> And he just told me that his operation was nearly compromised by my team.<eos> Well, I said, "that's impossible.<eos> The team no longer exists."<eos> The hell it doesn't!
I--ok.<eos> I'm ready. Unh!<eos> - That hurt?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, it did.
First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II<eos> - in the sixth dynasty.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Does it say anything about how to stop it?<eos> Yes, actually, it does.
I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
When did you know?<eos> Tonight?<eos> When I talked about trust.<eos> Did you know then?<eos> I did.
Moving to where?<eos> Unknown.<eos> But it's de-orbiting sunward.<eos> - Do we know why?<eos> - We do not.
For heaven's sake, put the poor man out of his misery.<eos> Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I know why.<eos> You do?
You look beautiful.<eos> Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.

- Emily.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Shocked you still come here.<eos> I-I don't really.
Because when you wanna die, you give away all your things because you're not gonna need them.<eos> After all, look at me. She's already given me away.<eos> Claire... Trust me, your daughter is not suicidal.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Did you see anyone at the border?<eos> Just the dead.<eos> I saw this place, I thought it was a refugee camp.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> We didn't.
I know you're dealing with it and you're processing it.<eos> I can't imagine how hard it is.<eos> But what I do know is that you did absolutely everything to make sure that you did the right thing.<eos> You had a job to do.<eos> You did it.
He's gonna break.<eos> Ford, you're being awful quiet over there.<eos> Do we have enough to hold him any longer?<eos> No, sir.<eos> We don't.
Okay? Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed. You really did.<eos> - No, I just... - Yeah, woman, you really did.
She used to say, "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Shadow.<eos> You must have questions, and if you don't, you should.<eos> What is that smell?<eos> What is it, cat piss and oven cleaner?<eos> Yeah, I do...
All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'.<eos> Nonsense. Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
Something happened, didn't it?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> - You did, didn't you?
And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Where are we?<eos> Where we are is not important, James.<eos> What matters is why you're here.<eos> You know why I killed my uncle.<eos> Yes, I do.
Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
That's Arwen.<eos> That's... Arwen.<eos> I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare?<eos> Do I want the customary...<eos> Yes, you do.
- Anyway...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't.
No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Why?<eos> Because of your dad?<eos> Because Barry is going to find him.<eos> Look, you don't know that, okay?<eos> You don't.
He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him! I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!<eos> You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!<eos> We don't!
Thank you.<eos> Risky move coming to an Earth where interdimensional travel is punishable by death.<eos> Especially when I'm the one who's supposed to uphold that law.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I don't do long-distance relationships.
Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.<eos> Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?<eos> Yes, I do.
I get it. I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.<eos> When you get bucked from the horse, best thing you can do... get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.<eos> Ride!<eos> Hello, Barry Allen.<eos> - How do you...
It's just beautiful.<eos> You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, he did.
On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.<eos> All you need is to just believe in yourself.<eos> And for what it's worth...<eos> I already do.
- What? Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times, huh?<eos> Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?<eos> No.<eos> No, she did not.
I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
- I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?
- What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.
Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
I know you can't see it right now but Alan would have been a horrible father.<eos> And you're just gonna have to believe me on that.<eos> It's a decision I did not make lightly.<eos> No.<eos> No, but you, you did it anyway.
He doesn't wear the cape or carry the pitchfork, so maybe that's just his way of being dramatic.<eos> Things have a way of getting bloody with Cade.<eos> We may not have another chance, so... do you want to tell me why you were planning on leaving town?<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't.
We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
Prince of hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
Serena and Alton seem smart.<eos> Pierce...<eos> You know he calls himself.<eos> "The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?<eos> I do.
The... the s-system is very much I-intact.<eos> But you can disarm it?<eos> I'm not really known for my Patience.<eos> I don't quite have the means...<eos> Who does?
You think this dump has a restroom?<eos> Come on, find a bush.<eos> For the gas.<eos> - Want one?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Sounds.<eos> Smells.<eos> Tastes.<eos> Sounds like you had a hell of a trip?<eos> Yeah, we did.
Smells.<eos> Tastes.<eos> Sounds like you had a hell of a trip?<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> Yes, we did.
Yeah.<eos> More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?<eos> No. No, I didn't.
I'm quite nervous. Are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> - Men don't normally say that.<eos> - Don't they?
Look...<eos> What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
What?<eos> Her husband is sending her abusive anonymous messages?<eos> Yeah. Fancy going to have a chat with him?<eos> Now-ish?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Yes, I did.
It's pathetic, innit?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> So you not only stole back your phone, you kept what I deleted and you added even more.<eos> - Do you know how much that cost?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Get up!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.<eos> - Oh, aye, you do.
Here.<eos> You will not feed the slaves!<eos> And you will not bark like a great, fat hound!<eos> You said you will pay?<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, it's you.<eos> Hey, do you know which one of these has a knob without any slack?<eos> No. Does it matter?<eos> [sighs] I thought so.<eos> I really did, but maybe it doesn't.
[Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
Is this funny to you?<eos> No, it's not funny to me.<eos> I honestly, I don't understand how we got here.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You don't.
"Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> - Do you take this woman...<eos> - Man.<eos> Man.<eos> I do.
Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Eastern.<eos> Dake? Dake gets our trial?<eos> You had to have known we couldn't prosecute it. The conflict is too deep.<eos> You said you had a workaround.<eos> Yes, I do.
You kill him?<eos> No.<eos> But somebody else did.<eos> You have my card if you need anything.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Find out where his head's at.<eos> - You got it, Cap.<eos> No more fuck ups, Woodrow.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Doing great.
Get it out of the way. Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
Back off!<eos> And you need one.<eos> What does Will have to say about that?<eos> I don't have a father.<eos> Oh yes, you do.
Hey, I need to talk to you.<eos> What's going on with you and that girl?<eos> Her name's Savanah.<eos> Look, I know you like her, but do you know who she is, where she's been, what's in her past?<eos> Yes, I do, dad.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> - This is...<eos> This is not my fault.<eos> - You took my tiger.<eos> - Yes, I did do that, but...
Now it-- It's happening all over again.<eos> He's gonna talk about all that now, Manny is, and when he does... that prosecutor's gonna give me the death penalty.<eos> Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't.
Do you remember how we met?<eos> How quickly you stole my sword from me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you scared me, Coltantha.<eos> You still do.
Hey.<eos> Yeah, Coyote's told me so much about you.<eos> And your kids.<eos> He loves those kids.<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Go ahead.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Show me your badge.<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
If Homeland catches up to me, I can't run.<eos> And I won't be able to hold out.<eos> I--<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Can't just walk down the street anymore.<eos> Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.<eos> I never asked for this. To have my face plastered all over the bloc like some kind of revolutionary.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Katie, we've got company.<eos> - Who?<eos> Redhats.<eos> - How long do I have?<eos> - You don't.
And they're putting it into t-the face creams<eos> - you all use... the girls.<eos> - Hold up.<eos> They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.
Well, let me ask you something, Connie.<eos> It's Kenny, sir.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Do you think that I like microwave ovens?<eos> No, I don't.
None of your business.<eos> Fodagut, bera, stay back.<eos> I trusted you, you little shit.<eos> I na need your trust, Earther<eos> No Belter do.
Beauty or chips. I like chips.<eos> So did she.<eos> So that's OK.<eos> And how does that in any way explain why you keep coming to my lectures?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't really, does it?
Right.<eos> Thank you, Miss Berger, that's been most useful.<eos> - They seemed nice, didn't they?<eos> - Yes. I left some tongue in the fridge, did you see?<eos> Yes, I did.
Um... you want to see some of the herbs and spices?<eos> - Uh-huh. - Hey, you like cinnamon?<eos> We got some cinnamon sticks right over here.<eos> You know where cinnamon comes from?<eos> - Do you?
Somebody's here. Who's here?<eos> Crap!<eos> It's Sean.<eos> - How do I get out of here?<eos> - You don't.
I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
I really appreciate everything that you've done for Diana and me.<eos> It's too bad you didn't think of that before, you know, that betrayal thing.<eos> Now is this gonna be a regular treat with you?<eos> You're gonna keep showing up here and making me feel sorry?<eos> Because I don't do sorry very well.
Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
- No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
Sometimes I miss my other mommy too.<eos> Her name is Kelly, just like my brother's.<eos> You know her, don't you?<eos> I don't know where she is anymore.<eos> Do you?
And I think... no wait, I'm sure... you're gonna love this.<eos> And by love, you mean...<eos> Oh, to have an appreciation of or for the two sets of prints found at the crime scene, both, and I repeat for emphasis, both in the system.<eos> So we have two positive identities with criminal records at the crime scene?<eos> Oh, yes, we do: a Robert Johansson and a Martin Dominguez.
I did, and then I bit its arm.<eos> I don't really remember any more.<eos> Nick, I don't want to stay here.<eos> I have this feeling that... something is starting.<eos> I do, too.
I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.<eos> And second of all, who or what the hell was that?<eos> Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, I did.
I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?<eos> It already is in the wrong hands.<eos> Don't you wanna see Time Base One?<eos> It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?<eos> No! I don't.
People die every day, people died while I was saying that sentence.<eos> Gene Cosgrove, lung cancer.<eos> - Does that bother you?<eos> - That doesn't bother me, Jane.<eos> - Then what does?
I already have a job when I graduate.<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> When you graduate, you're gonna have to stand before the bar and pass the character and fitness test.<eos> And you think working at your firm looks better than looking at mine.<eos> Yes, I do.
You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you,<eos> I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll just leave it here.<eos> I was gonna tell him, you know.<eos> I was gonna tell him that he's the one that should be managing partner.<eos> Louis, you may have your flaws, but he had no right to talk to you like that.<eos> Yes, he did.
- The funny thing is, all I ended up with was the shortest, most humiliating run as managing partner in the history of the world.<eos> If you ask me, you may have had a short run, but you made your mark.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, unless I'm mistaken, we have ten associates starting tomorrow who chose to come here over one of the best law firms in the city.<eos> They did that because of you.
You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
- Please tell me you didn't change your mind about seeing her.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then what's the problem?<eos> I haven't seen the woman in seven years.<eos> The last time I did...
Thanks, Louis.<eos> You're welcome, but we're partners, and they're all our clients.<eos> They are.<eos> Louis, I didn't mean it when I said you weren't ready to be managing partner.<eos> Yes, you did.
I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer, I have to get better in trial, and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.<eos> And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along,<eos> I promise I will let you do that, but this is not the case.<eos> This one's Marissa's, and I need to know you have her back.<eos> I do.
Oliver... we can get through this together.<eos> Except now you told me I can't handle it, and that's gonna be boring a hole in my brain, making this thing a thousand times harder.<eos> Well, I can't take back what I said, but what I can do is stay here all night to make sure you prove me wrong.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> No, I don't.
'Cause I love cocaine.<eos> Do you have any?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I shouldn't...<eos> Do you?
Do you promise that the testimony you shall give in the case before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
We'll do yours and Mary's.<eos> Oh, where I come from, you don't tell anybody your year. Mummy?<eos> You want to have a peek?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Hello, Robin.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> He's really insistent on this point.<eos> So, before I answer back in proceedings, I just need to know...<eos> No, I didn't.
I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want--<eos> Uh, I-I do.
Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> I thought I'd die.<eos> But you didn't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> No, I gotta call him.<eos> - So you didn't call him?<eos> - No, I called him.<eos> No, you didn't.
Do not put your foot in the pool, or the career is done.<eos> And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.<eos> - Oh, God. - I don't care what you're saying.<eos> Okay, you did it! You did it!<eos> You did the foot.
Or a big glass of whiskey.<eos> Either way is...<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Did you ever see that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks?<eos> No, I didn't.
Next year, it will be.<eos> CBS sees your jokes work now.<eos> Next year, you'll be telling those jokes, 'cause you wrote 'em.<eos> You want me to do the jokes he's telling right now on next year's Grammys?<eos> But you do 'em in your voice.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint.<eos> Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
- And it's filled with porn.<eos> I've seen worse.<eos> So, does that help? - ...<eos> I feel so nasty. - No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Then stop worrying about what we're doing because tomorrow isn't about losing.<eos> It's about winning.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> We've been up all night and we've got nothing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Till the end of the world.<eos> Asshole. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Talking to you.<eos> I don't have all day.<eos> No, you don't.
Every little bit helps.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey... I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
It protects women from unwanted sexual advances.<eos> Right.<eos> - Everyone is so angry.<eos> - I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.<eos> Regarding?<eos> I'm her father.<eos> Does she know this?<eos> She does.
No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
The answer is yes.<eos> I didn't ask a question.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> No, you didn't.
All it needs to do is keep my fucking beer cold.<eos> Hmm. You're running low on beer.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Did you forget to scan that bar code?<eos> Yes, I did... on purpose.
Shall I add them to your shopping list?<eos> Eh, sure.<eos> Well, let's hope that Melcher doesn't hear about all this.<eos> You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
Roll credits.<eos> Sorry, Aida.<eos> Take him out!<eos> - Did you know he could...<eos> - I did not.
Why are you asking?<eos> Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.<eos> And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do, don't you?
Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do.
No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Yeah, well, there was a time, I thought I'd live forever.<eos> Lately, I been wondering what's gonna happen after I'm gone.<eos> This isn't about your family.<eos> You want to be remembered.<eos> Of course I do.
- Sidney has help.<eos> Somebody's working with him.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> Nobody does.
Hey, Amber, what do you mean by that?<eos> Aunt Megan, she had a monster inside of her.<eos> We took care of that, didn't we?<eos> You saw it leave.<eos> We both did.
- A prick.<eos> Correct, and not only that, he's a prick we suspect has made payments to a number of officers in various units.<eos> What about Frank Linnell?<eos> He's not someone we have an active interest in.<eos> Plenty of our colleagues do, of course.
And you didn't ask why?<eos> Of course I asked.<eos> He said he needed... he needed to cause a distraction, that night, in that area.<eos> I didn't know anyone was going to be killed.<eos> I didn't.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
Good for... Look.<eos> It's not good for me.<eos> Red wine is good for me.<eos> Odette told me if you get any fatter, she's gonna kick you out.<eos> - She did not.
Seven.<eos> - Do you want to play?<eos> - Love to. But I have work to do.<eos> - And, in any case, you know the law.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
Louis, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Donna. What can I do for you?<eos> I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.<eos> But I'm not sure that you know that we brought on Stu as an investor.<eos> - I didn't, Donna;
The context is you portrayed yourself as one thing when, really, you were another, which is what you did the entire time you pretended to be an attorney and what I believe you are doing to this body right now.<eos> Mr. Chairmen, if she's going to impugn his character while he's speaking, then he's entitled to let someone else speak for him.<eos> This isn't a trial.<eos> We don't allow character witnesses here.<eos> Actually, you do.
It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
You've done everything you can.<eos> And I'm tired of putting my wants on hold.<eos> What is it?<eos> You know about my product with Benjamin.<eos> I do.
I mean that story wasn't any old story, and that woman wasn't really a woman.<eos> It was a man named Joseph O'Neal.<eos> And it was Walter Samson's godson.<eos> - So she did call in a favor.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.<eos> I'm sorry too, Harvey.<eos> Jessica, you don't need to apologize.<eos> Yes, I do.
You!<eos> You can reveal it to us.<eos> You were meant to show us the way.<eos> - I don't know how.<eos> - Yes, you do.
A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- I have clearance to get us inside.<eos> - And I have a team.<eos> Look, Eliza,<eos> - if you care about Dolls...<eos> - I do.
There.<eos> - Those were hers.<eos> - Man, what the fuck?<eos> - How you know that?<eos> - Just do.
Yeah, I guess that's a stretch.<eos> I can be supportive when I have to be.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, we were thinking that you could be the stage manager.<eos> Of course.<eos> The dyke does tech.
Yeah, I miss you too.<eos> You know, I got to go in a minute.<eos> I just, um, I, I wanted to let you know that we're having a baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and I don't know
It was a very long time ago, Johnny.<eos> Can that happen here? No.<eos> But if it did, what would you do?<eos> It's not gonna happen here.<eos> But if it did.
Do you see?<eos> You understand this world.<eos> You understand me.<eos> That's why I picked you.<eos> But I didn't...
Chrisjen, this may be our only chance to stay in the game.<eos> They're already making weapons.<eos> - They're testing them...<eos> - You honestly believe that Mars would use this protomolecule to destroy Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
I guess you got your wish.<eos> Mars is in the protomolecule business now, just like everyone else.<eos> You know we don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros<eos> I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
It's way past your bedtime and your dad's gonna be home any minute.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Why do you keep saying that?<eos> So, you don't have kids?<eos> No, I don't.
And... you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> Fundadores.<eos> Yes, I do.
Sorry, sir, only commissioned officers or sponsored guests.<eos> The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving. Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
What was Brewster doing in Connecticut?<eos> Likely selling goods on the London trade.<eos> It's good cover for his trips across the sand on Culper business.<eos> How did Arnold know?<eos> Well, he doesn't, sir.
It's good cover for his trips across the sand on Culper business.<eos> How did Arnold know?<eos> Well, he doesn't, sir.<eos> He knows that Caleb is my friend, that he's seconded to my command, and he knows that I run spies, but he knows nothing about Culper senior or junior.<eos> Brewster does.
- Listen, Vernon is...<eos> - Wha...<eos> Headaches still?<eos> Migraines. You get 'em?<eos> Unh-unh. Father did.
Maybe you can understand the anger I have towards the Ottos.<eos> Magnify that hate a thousand times, and maybe you can understand.<eos> I do hate you.<eos> I hate you for killing Travis, for thinking you know how I feel.<eos> You don't.
- I know that.<eos> Hey, Greg!<eos> Can we get you some coffee or some tea or...?<eos> - Do you have some bai hao white tip?<eos> - I do!
And we are expecting our first child.<eos> - Congratulations. - Thank you.<eos> She would be dialing a divorce lawyer if she ever thought that you and I had swapped more than, you know, appreciative memos.<eos> - You understand that?<eos> - I do.
- No, no, look! They know!<eos> They finally know it's me!<eos> - Oh, my gosh!<eos> Well, the history books are being rewritten, and this time, it's not Texas saying Satan made fossils.<eos> Yes, he did. - What?
- You mean you'd like to convert?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but we should go.<eos> I have essays to write.<eos> - Converting would suggest that I already follow a religion.<eos> - You do.
I wanted to be like you.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> I don't drink, I don't curse, I don't play your stupid games.<eos> - You don't have to fit in.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- You know?<eos> How it looks.<eos> What it means.<eos> - It shouldn't matter, but...<eos> - But it... does.
I assume you had a gentleman caller?<eos> He wasn't a gentleman, but he did wear a monocle while we did it.<eos> Well, you had a much more exciting night than I did.<eos> Both of my legs fell asleep on the toilet.<eos> Then so did I.
Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
You just need to open your eyes.<eos> Tell me how to open them.<eos> Feel your purpose.<eos> - I don't know what my purpose is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
She loved me!<eos> No one could love you, not the real you!<eos> Alex loves me.<eos> Until she finds someone that could fuck her!<eos> I did!
No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - I don't.
Melanie, do the moves.<eos> Those are my moves, kid.<eos> I mean, they're the moves that got me cast in the porn dance party in Body Double.<eos> Please, as if you worked with De Palma.<eos> I did.
- A zombie. It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping Tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
Yes, hello. [clears throat] Forty-seven?<eos> Is this Marga?<eos> No, I'm not Marga.<eos> But you just said you were Operator 47.<eos> I did?
You are sworn to Alfred.<eos> To become King of Mercia you would need to break that oath.<eos> If that is my fate.<eos> Then you believe he speaks the truth?<eos> No, I do not.
The future King of Mercia!<eos> Welcome to Lunden, your new home, should you want it.<eos> Sigefrid.<eos> I thought you might want to kill me still.<eos> Oh, for a long time, I did.
No, it was a surprise, lord, nothing more than that.<eos> Lord, love should be gentle and kind.<eos> "Gentle and kind," she says.<eos> How is it that you have a knowledge of how love should be?<eos> I do not.
Hey.<eos> Want an autographed copy of my new book?<eos> Not one bit. - Ooh.<eos> Jealousy doesn't look good on you, my friend.<eos> Then again, nothing does.
It was you.<eos> You never stopped loving me.<eos> You never gave up on me.<eos> And I think, because of that,<eos> God didn't, either.
I'm sorry.<eos> I knew you'd do this.<eos> I just knew you'd pull the rug out right from under me when I finally gave in and slept with you.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Oh, but it did.
Yesterday you were brought to the president's attention by Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> She said you claimed to have had information about Vice President MacLeish before he was confirmed.<eos> The president would like to know what that information was.<eos> Agent Wells, you need to answer my question.<eos> No, I don't.
Too late now.<eos> Not really.<eos> I still have the evidence against you, Liam.<eos> And now...<eos> Senator Bowman does, too.
Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
He'll never trust me again.<eos> I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.
A sting operation masquerading as a weapons sale.<eos> None of that is happening today.<eos> Today is about establishing a contact and trust.<eos> Okay, um, so I don't need a gun or anything?<eos> No, you do not.
Is this about Borden?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I just...<eos> I do understand what you're going through.<eos> You do?
You do?<eos> You know what it's like to find out that the person you've been sleeping with is a terrorist?<eos> To have someone plan these dates and give you these amazing, useless gifts, and then kill a bunch of your co-workers and your friends?<eos> To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.
It's beastly.<eos> Everything's excruciating!<eos> Well, at least you're at home now so I can look after you.<eos> If my testicles start swelling, you know what that means, don't you?<eos> ! - Yes, I do.
- It's not mean, there's nowhere for her to stay now that Donald's here.<eos> I did notice that.<eos> Five minutes after I move out and you've get a new son and I'm relegated to the guest couch.<eos> - I have the mumps now.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'm gonna leave.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> Because I do.
No, no, no, you're lying to me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We have three babies.<eos> We have a boy and a girl.<eos> We do.
I kind of wish she didn't make the final round so we could get out of here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> It looks like we have a checkmate, everybody.<eos> Congratulations, Tess.<eos> Yes, we do.
Everything okay?<eos> It looks like we have a checkmate, everybody.<eos> Congratulations, Tess.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't know.<eos> Hey, you've said three whole words since we left the show.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what the problem is?<eos> - I don't have a problem, Rebecca.<eos> - Yes, you do, Jack.
This is your cousin?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son, Randall.<eos> Yeah, he look like you.<eos> I do?
- No. ...about working with your ex-boyfriend.<eos> No, that's total BS, Jack.<eos> You hated the fact that I was singing again.<eos> I was fine with it. You didn't want me to have a career.<eos> - You never did.
It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly,<eos> I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
Use the gas!<eos> David, my boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> She does.
It's just like chicken but juicier.<eos> Thanks for convincing me not to fast today.<eos> All right, so be honest. How religious are you?<eos> You really go to prayer and stuff?<eos> I do the Friday prayer here and there.
Yeah. Are you religious at all?<eos> We've been friends since we was kids.<eos> You know I go to church sometimes.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You do do that.
Well, that fits with the phone being stolen by the killer.<eos> Tim had a hi-tech security system installed in his flat, and the cameras fed direct to his computer.<eos> There's no images stored anywhere else.<eos> It's another reason we need to find his phone and computer.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Are you seriously suggesting that Nick is a suspect?<eos> No.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> I'd just like to know if Mr Huntley saw anything on the night in question that might help us with our inquiries?<eos> No, I didn't.
The high street youth club, with a tenner between them.<eos> Nando's.<eos> On a school night?<eos> You don't want to talk to me, Roz?<eos> Of course I do.
- Y'all need to come with me.<eos> - You again.<eos> I don't want you coming around here.<eos> Dad, you need to listen to him.<eos> No, I don't.
So, making secret plans with the enemy is more important. Than your own people knowing what's going on?<eos> I suppose so when you're sending agents to their death.<eos> It had to be done, neil, And I know that is hard for you to understand.<eos> They didn't have a chance.<eos> No, they didn't.
Everything could have fallen apart because the two of you.<eos> Weren't careful!<eos> But it didn't.<eos> I know what I'm doing, alfred.<eos> Do you?
I don't trust you.<eos> I am giving you a chance to protect him.<eos> Surrender and he will not be harmed.<eos> I have your word?<eos> You do.
You know?<eos> We're all new.<eos> Let's get to know each other.<eos> Who wants to go to Malibu?<eos> - I do!
So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
So, deal with it, Rosen.<eos> Fuckin' anti-Semite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When did we learn that move?<eos> We didn't.
Keith thinks I quit.<eos> Well, it's my first pack since Randy was born, so...<eos> did Steel Horse live up to the name?<eos> - They told you.<eos> - Melrose did.
Ah! - Yeah.<eos> - I'll tell you what I did love:<eos> The two black girls.<eos> We want more of them.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
Come back, play more Brubeck, then get the fuck out of here.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Got any blow?<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
You had your pregnancy snack an hour ago.<eos> No seconds.<eos> You know that.<eos> I'll need written proof of that.<eos> Of course you do.
It's... just a movie.<eos> Yeah, obviously, I know that.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> Nobody thinks you're stupid.<eos> Oh, s does!
I hate people.<eos> Okay, so, do we tell Kristen?<eos> 'Cause it'll kill her.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - No. We do not.
Well, then he is not a York.<eos> No York man would ever run from battle.<eos> No one will believe his claim again.<eos> I never thought that we would have this.<eos> But we do.
Stopped the bleeding.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> 'Cause... well, yesterday we did some digging into your past... what's real, and I think we may know...<eos> I know what I am.<eos> You do?
Okay.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> I wanna know your secret.<eos> - What do you...
- That's all.<eos> - Let me look at you.<eos> I'm okay, Byron.<eos> I told you everything was gonna be fine!<eos> - Yes, you did.
Evening, garçon.<eos> What's on the menu tonight?<eos> This... this is truly undignified.<eos> Do you want to eat or not?<eos> Well, I do, yeah.
Yes, sir.<eos> Your shoes are still on.<eos> Klaus?<eos> I promised our parents I'd always look out for Klaus.<eos> But I didn't.
Twice.<eos> I bury my boy every day.<eos> And I'm tired.<eos> I'm not afraid of dying, because I know I got it coming to me.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.<eos> Dr. Railly to the ER.<eos> I thought you didn't want to see me.<eos> I don't.
- They won't.<eos> Whatever it says about us, we'll destroy that part.<eos> Jones will never know.<eos> We just need to get to the painting first.<eos> And if we don't?
Dr. Railly, enough.<eos> I think it's time we had a talk.<eos> Mother to mother.<eos> - Jones, you don't understand. - Correction, Dr. Railly, I didn't understand.<eos> But I do now.
$5,000.<eos> Pedro García has always paid his taxes on time.<eos> We know that.<eos> He'll have records and receipts, but I guess you know that, too.<eos> We do, sir.
- Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?<eos> I... I did. Um...
She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
She didn't want to stay in touch.<eos> The ex-husband was out for five days before he got busted for assaulting his po.<eos> He's been locked up ever since, so he didn't kill them.<eos> I know.<eos> We done here?
Schmidt's gonna be there?<eos> That's right.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Does helene bauer know how to dance?<eos> Of course she does.
We don't disagree. "We"?<eos> The brigadefuhrer and i.<eos> Who has your loyalty?<eos> Faber or your superiors?<eos> He does.
But everything you do. Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see, The people you don't.<eos> The people you save...<eos> Ania?<eos> The people you don't.
Definitely.<eos> Ah, you always know just what to say.<eos> Aram, you're a trusting person who assumes the best in people.<eos> Be yourself and they will see that.<eos> Everyone does.
And then, you know, one thing led to another and...<eos> And the next thing you knew, she was using your personal laptop to access classified data.<eos> Well, when you put it like that--<eos> You expect us to believe you knew nothing about this?<eos> Yes, because I didn't.
While you're on this task force, the country you're protecting is the United States.<eos> - And today, I protected both.<eos> - Almost died in the process.<eos> You need to think about where your allegiance lies.<eos> - No, I don't.
Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but... I don't.
Is a spy.<eos> Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> I thought Panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did, why?
Spit it out! Spit it out!<eos> I told you to stop!<eos> Get on the elliptical!<eos> You liked that Brussels sprout?<eos> ! Did you like that?
You get to have that experience of seeing the thing free for the first time.<eos> As it comes over the horizon, it finally sees the jungle.<eos> It's getting all excited.<eos> It jumps off the boat, it's rolling in the sand.<eos> "Buddy, we did it!
The Black Widow?<eos> Who could forget?<eos> Even the broadsheets went gaga for her trial.<eos> Father Brown cracked the case, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
Do all priests read minds, Father?<eos> No.<eos> I was so pretty, so young.<eos> Do you know, the camera adored me?<eos> Everyone did.
- Ready.<eos> The in-game tutorial is who I am.<eos> If you have any questions, then I am your man.<eos> Thanks, cloud man, we got this.<eos> Well, Barbie does.
Yeah, before we get to that, uh, Mr. Young is going to need you to explain to him why there's nothing more you can do for his son.<eos> What?<eos> No one's told him that yet?<eos> I thought he knew we were coming.<eos> Well, he does. It...
You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even...<eos> He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.
Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even...<eos> He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.<eos> I really do.
Yeah.<eos> No, it's great.<eos> You know, I get to...<eos> Iwatch something go up.<eos> Yeah, Johnny did construction, didn't he?
That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
Barton.<eos> Barton's no good for this.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - I need to be here.<eos> No, you don't.
- Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
You could still tell her that you made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't make a mistake.<eos> I have a duty to this hospital.<eos> My chief asked me to step up, so I...<eos> Did she?
I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
The thing with the husband.<eos> Are you... I'm fine.<eos> Let's use the pelvic brim - as a landmark. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Dividing the ureter...<eos> How we doing?
- April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.<eos> Grey is very good, but when she wasn't here, the person they turned to was you.<eos> Oh, I know...<eos> Do you?
Bad as you thought it would be?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We have to, but...<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
What was I calling about?<eos> Yes.<eos> This morning.<eos> - I forget.<eos> - No. No, you didn't.
Actually, that's two staples, not one.<eos> It's like a high-end magazine.<eos> Do you know that Ms. Quinn is not a co-conspirator to this malware?<eos> Yes, I do not.<eos> You do not?
- Please.<eos> Diane.<eos> You didn't like any of the applicants?<eos> For the assistant's job?<eos> No, I did.
Me?<eos> I need both hands to pinch the artery tight.<eos> You apply the glue.<eos> You know how I am about blood.<eos> I do.
Oh, um, excuse me, Your Honor.<eos> Norwood is going to England next week, too.<eos> Just like the Haights.<eos> Counselor, do you have something more for this witness?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who are you?<eos> Elsbeth Tascioni.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't like eating alone, do you?<eos> - I do, actually.
What was your quote?<eos> Um...<eos> "When you go after me professionally," "I go after you personally."<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Dad.<eos> Hello, Henry.<eos> Diane.<eos> Maia, do you have a second? No.<eos> No, I don't.
Listen, Maia, I can think of a dozen reasons why you didn't let Amy's parents invest.<eos> First and foremost, you didn't want to mix up finances with love.<eos> That makes complete sense to me.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
If He has a problem, He sends an emissary, like me, or maybe a burning bush.<eos> So how does this God Johnson know Samael?<eos> My name.<eos> Wait, I know.<eos> - You do?
Or not.<eos> Maybe there's another piece missing.<eos> Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, maybe Mum does.
No.<eos> Clean as a whistle.<eos> Clean as a whistle.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yes, I do.
- -Ay hijo.<eos> I want to play on your phone.<eos> You know what, here you go.<eos> It's wet. It doesn't work.<eos> Nothing does, okay? Okay? Okay?
We know that; he doesn't.<eos> You can tell him you have another copy, and he'll have to believe you.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Even if he believes she made another copy, he still has to believe she has a good reason to blackmail him.<eos> Well, luckily, she does.
Well, a wise man once told me that "I'm sorry" only starts the conversation.<eos> So... who's ready for another game of truth or dare?<eos> I love truth or dare.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
Does make you want to puke.<eos> Oh, my... Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
All right, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - We have been looking for you!<eos> - You scared the crap out of me!<eos> - Oh, I need some O2.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
You want to ask the black guy next?<eos> S-Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Of course I do.
Well, often the first step is baptism, to open your heart... to let the sin out.<eos> Being gay is not a sin.<eos> Isn't lying a sin, Father?<eos> You lied about my son, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.
And my mom was there.<eos> Or you know.<eos> And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.<eos> Except...<eos> Except maybe... maybe I do.
I'm not.<eos> If you know something, tell me.<eos> When you release me, I'll tell you.<eos> - You don't know anything.<eos> - I do. I do.
Since before any of this happened.<eos> I've been here with all these... civilians trying to make my way, and you just walk across my path.<eos> Do you...<eos> Do you really have no idea who I am?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Well, she'd be a damn fool if she did.<eos> - I think it's safe from lightning bolts.<eos> - Mmh, you'd be surprised.<eos> You think that god is a woman?<eos> Yeah, of course I do. Don't you?
Oh, my God.<eos> - Jules, you don't understand...<eos> Oh, my God, you can't...<eos> I don't have a choice right now, I swear to God, if I did...<eos> You don't?
No.<eos> Allie, please.<eos> No, I... Because I don't know if you killed that cop.<eos> Because I don't know what you did that night at the fire.<eos> Yes, you do.
I just--I don't know if you accepted my apology.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> No, I don't.
You can't... You can't cheat every day.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> No, I don't want to.<eos> So, what, you're...<eos> done with me?
Look!<eos> There's your mama.<eos> Stasha, he started crying again.<eos> Mind if I ask how old he is.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Loved her coffee.<eos> From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
You will always be our daughter, and we love you, Miriam.<eos> But I'm heartbroken.<eos> I just don't think you've really thought through what this is going to mean for the rest of your life.<eos> I know what I'm doing, daddy.<eos> Do you?
What do you expect me to do?<eos> You want me to disappear into some gutter?<eos> Hey, Lyle...<eos> Lyle, she did not mean that.<eos> Actually, I did!
So... we're gonna wind it down.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to go get some breakfast and talk?<eos> I know losing Louie wasn't what...<eos> I don't.
Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes... Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.
Well, we'll be horribly murdered!<eos> Let's say I'm right.<eos> Doctor, if those suits have killed 36 people that means there's 36 corpses walking about this station.<eos> You know, that REALLY doesn't matter right now.<eos> Correction: yeah, it does.
But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow. All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
What the hell are you saying?<eos> Okay- - What?<eos> Slow do-- hey.<eos> Hey, you said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.
Is that true, Robbie?<eos> Your mom wasn't the only one, did you know that?<eos> What happened to your mom, Robbie?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
You're never gonna have to worry about him hurting you again.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> And thank you for letting me stay here today.<eos> You have a really nice family.<eos> I do.
They won't have it.<eos> They wouldn't take those Angelina Ballerina videos. Nothing wrong with them!<eos> Because they're videos!<eos> People don't have video players any more!<eos> The library does!
Do you really think killing Regina is gonna solve your problems?<eos> All it will do is make a martyr of her, and then nobody will be able to look at you without thinking of her.<eos> Believe me, that part is no fun at all.<eos> Well, I suppose you have a better idea.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
If you're gonna kidnap me again, may I humbly request I'm allowed to finish my ale first?<eos> I'm not here to kidnap you.<eos> And I'm... I'm sorry about that.<eos> So, if you're standing here, can I assume that the villain plan didn't work out so well?<eos> It didn't.
Of what?<eos> I like you.<eos> A lot. But... I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Why? It would put him in terrible danger.<eos> It is not safe for him.<eos> But I come for him.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
We'll be more careful.<eos> More careful?<eos> This has been hard for me for a long time.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do.
His crucifixion was the ultimate example of that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, you're important, too.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I do.
He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
- Jiya, try it.<eos> - I just want to talk.<eos> - Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.<eos> And I do.
I'm back, I came back!<eos> But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
I can be a shelter from the storm.<eos> Uh, I like my job, but sometimes I lie about what I do, uh... because, uh, sometimes I say I'm a bookkeeper, you know?<eos> If I'm in a closed space.<eos> I wish I am.<eos> I do all my own Quicken and QuickBooks.
- I'm here for Lily.<eos> I always knew this day would come.<eos> Probably not what she's here for.<eos> How do you know our daughter?<eos> I don't.
You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It-It, um... It actually does work now.<eos> It does.
All you have to do is admit that you want the job.<eos> And, like, get down on your knees and beg.<eos> Says the guy who's romancing a woman through a phone that isn't even on.<eos> A woman that he described to me in private as a skinny little fuck factory.<eos> Oh, no, I didn't.
I don't think so.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide. I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
It wasn't.<eos> You compared yourself to Abraham Lincoln, Richard.<eos> Can you do me a favor?<eos> Can you say it so I know I'm not hallucinating?<eos> - I just did.
- Yeah, but when she has her shade back, she'll get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Um... Speaking of shades, since this is probably the last time I'm going to have one...<eos> - Look, you do not have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You called him my friend.<eos> Who?<eos> Elliot.<eos> You said you were not my friend who died.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I don't want to give up on this either.<eos> 'Cause I don't know what I would do without you.<eos> You do have me, Dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And I'm doing it so I can give money to another son of a bitch.<eos> The truth is those sons of bitches live on a different planet.<eos> It should be one world for all.<eos> It's not your decision to make.<eos> Who does?
But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
Yep.<eos> You lookin' for a guitar today?<eos> Actually, I'm lookin' for a keyboard.<eos> You got any good used keys around?<eos> We do, we do.
All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Tell them that you acted out of spite, that you'll support their leadership.<eos> It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I... I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
Julia's not here either.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand. You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.
Leif?<eos> - Leif!<eos> - It's fine. Thanks for having me.<eos> Leif told me you can help me get a new face.<eos> - Did he, now? - Yes.
That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
I don't know about the gun.<eos> There are vestiges of the contagion in your irises.<eos> You... don't have the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> What sort of stupid thing is that to say?<eos> Of course I don't.
I want everything to go good.<eos> Well, do you have any questions prepared?<eos> I have a ton, they're in my backpack.<eos> Do you have my backpack by the way?<eos> Yeah, I do.
But we're missing one bag.<eos> I gave it away so we could escape.<eos> It wasn't yours to give.<eos> - We didn't have a cho...<eos> - But you did.
And in that moment, I knew...<eos> "So, this is how I die.<eos> After the Comanches, the Tonks, the Rangers, the Union Army, the thugs, the bandits, a goddamn lion will be my end!"<eos> How'd you get away?<eos> I didn't.
Those Lamanites did a number on you, didn't they?<eos> Heck, I thought you said it was one of them that pushed you off the cliff.<eos> _ but he's the only one.<eos> I've got a father and brothers and... And that girl you said I'm gonna marry.<eos> So I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Aw, Bob.<eos> You identify with Meat Man.<eos> (sniffs) I just think it's a good movie, Lin.<eos> Everybody does.
And this isn't just some rooftop.<eos> This is where you married your true love yesterday.<eos> My true love?<eos> Sorry, kid. That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.
Emma.<eos> Her lack of belief. It's sapping the magic from everything here.<eos> Well, can't you fix it? Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't. I'm... I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
Yeah. Who are you?<eos> My name's Lucy.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Get out of the way!<eos> What?<eos> What the hell!<eos> You see what I mean?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And I was like, "Well, that's discouraging." Like, "What the fuck?"<eos> When I met him, he was the first-- He's the only guy I met on there.<eos> I liked him right away. I really liked him.<eos> I was like, "I'm gonna make this guy wait."<eos> And I did.
- Yes, we are. To free my other.<eos> Dolls... get back.<eos> Don't let it touch you.<eos> Oh, Dolls!<eos> You did it!
It gives them confidence, self-esteem.<eos> Half the kids in jail never had names.<eos> That's why they give them numbers.<eos> Ooh, how about Jansport?<eos> We already did that one.
We're gonna finish this conversation later.<eos> We're busy fighting. What's up?<eos> We got a case.<eos> Really cool stuff.<eos> You and Happy almost done?
I just want to know from Paige, why did you tell me you loved me?<eos> Mom.<eos> Did you really say that to Walter?<eos> Um... honey, I don't recall.<eos> Yes, you do.
What do you mean, "my order"?<eos> I told Harris to start CPR.<eos> We had multiple victims suffering from cyanide poisoning when the cook went into cardiac arrest.<eos> - So, you saw this?<eos> - I did.
Bert and I may have run our course, but keeping this from him<eos> - is a mistake.<eos> - I'm selfish, I know.<eos> I'm scared to spend the last few years of my life alone, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
According to my notes here, there's some discussion about whether or not to abort the mission once you realized communications were down.<eos> Now, do you agree with Assistant Director Weller's decision to move in anyway?<eos> He didn't give that order.<eos> - Really?<eos> Who did?
Quill!<eos> Eyes on the enemy!<eos> Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!<eos> None of us do!
Good luck with that!<eos> Even the most powerful Believer can't just wish for that kind of mental ability.<eos> I don't need to wish.<eos> I believe.<eos> More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.
So, you understand what I'm saying?<eos> The point is this:<eos> He rapes, but he saves.<eos> And he saves more than he rapes.<eos> But he probably does rape.
I'm not...<eos> It's just a few lines, Kathleen.<eos> Just a few lines, yeah.<eos> I don't mind doing this.<eos> Really, I-I don't.
Why?<eos> You have to ask?<eos> Look, I'm not one to cut and run, and neither are you.<eos> But whatever this is between us, it deserves a chance, don't you think?<eos> Yes, I do.
Shot point-blank, barely a scratch.<eos> Looks like more than a scratch to me.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
I was just kidding, Sebastian.<eos> We have to do it the old-fashioned way.<eos> We need to check every locker.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
He's gonna kill Richard and make sure he takes the fall.<eos> Unless we stop him.<eos> You got yourself into a real mess here, Richard.<eos> You know I didn't do what they're accusing me of, right?<eos> Yeah, of course we do, Marino.
I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
What about me?<eos> For a roommate.<eos> 'Cause I've been going nuts trying to find a new place within my price range before my landlord doubles my rent, so it would really help me out.<eos> And you know I'm not a serial killer, so...<eos> - Do we?
Anyway...<eos> I bet once you go talk to her, you'll find out it's not the things for her, either.<eos> When you find out what it is, you can help her.<eos> Who says I'm gonna go talk to her?<eos> I did.
Okay.<eos> Thank you... for these last few months.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Don't do that.
We don't text.<eos> We talk things out.<eos> Talking involves listening, Gabby, and you're not doing that.<eos> Listen, I understand you wanting to help out your dad.<eos> You do?
Are you talking open heart surgery?<eos> It would involve opening your chest, yes.<eos> Now, if you wanted to go non-surgical, a cardiologist could place a clip on the mitral valve to try and control the regurge and do angioplasty... to open up the blocked artery.<eos> Do you have a good cardiologist?<eos> We do, but I...

Papa.<eos> No gloves, Uberta?<eos> Let's get you inside before you get even more liver spots.<eos> I don't have liver spots, Rogers.<eos> She does. Ah!
I, uh... I'm so sorry, dearest.<eos> What's wrong? Ugh!<eos> It's your breath!<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
And hit men are drive by profit and self-preservation.<eos> They don't take a job unless they know all the angles.<eos> So, to predict their behavior, we need to ask ourselves a simple question.<eos> We know why Cat wanted revenge on Reid.<eos> Why does Lindsey?
If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.
It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.<eos> She does.
I, um...<eos> I didn't.<eos> You didn't hear about it?<eos> That seems rather odd.<eos> - Does it? - Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.<eos> You guys don't even like it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Oh. Uh, okay.<eos> "Carol Andrew Pilbasian Miller, loving wife, devoted friend, died in childbirth after a torturous, protracted, bloody labor."<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're not writing a damn obituary.<eos> Oh, no, newspapers do it in advance all the time.
"Afraid"?<eos> I love doing that.<eos> It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.<eos> I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.<eos> You always do, Lois.
Thank you, Ralph.<eos> Do you, Tobias Merriweather Curtis, take Happy Quinn to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> You bet I do.<eos> And do you, Happy Quinn...<eos> I do.
"It's not that special."<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Sorry.<eos> [Pablo] Erika, she takes all the creative work.<eos> And I do more of the operational and the human resources and marketing work.
They can dump her stuff in the bay, for all I care.<eos> - Oh, Bonnie...<eos> - That's two!<eos> You don't want to find out what happens at three!<eos> You don't.
Oh, and she should be.<eos> Funerals are basically orgies with a cold, stiff guy in the corner.<eos> Amen, sister.<eos> Yeah, you like me better than his mean old ex-wife.<eos> Yes, you do.
Wow, Mom, that means a lot.<eos> Hey, I probably don't say this enough, but you are an amazing person, and I love you.<eos> You have another legal problem, don't you?<eos> I might have slapped a meter maid, but that doesn't take away from anything I said.<eos> It does a little, but thanks.
We are all equal in the eyes of this group.<eos> You're being a snob.<eos> Someone has to be.<eos> Did you get my text earlier, about why Fred Kirby might have been harassing Virginia Spivey and the others?<eos> I did.
It doesn't much matter.<eos> Roarke has his 38 states.<eos> Still, I wrote a hell of a barnburner for the New York delegation to give during floor debate.<eos> Why does this feel like a double date all of a sudden?<eos> My God. It does!
If you... ever need anything...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need you to destroy Roarke.<eos> I believed every lie he told me.<eos> And America does, too.
The Russians could do anything with that intelligence.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't.
And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> You don't.
I've got some vodka downstairs somewhere.<eos> Be right back.<eos> We are screwed.<eos> He doesn't have a computer in here.<eos> Yes, he does.
You were like a human car.<eos> Yeah, vroom.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You didn't see it.<eos> No. No, we didn't.
I took her to the vet. I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
No. I told you, you can't.<eos> Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!
The heiress to the Vast Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?<eos> And, by inference, an ideal target for kidnapping.<eos> I'm not kidnapping a Vandertunt.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already did.
So, uh, what are we doing?<eos> Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I- - I do, but-- What?
Devon, we have a problem in Chicago.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I forgot your present.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
With all the amount of money and power your husband has, he can have any woman he wants.<eos> What are you doing up there so late?<eos> My business runs on a 24-hour clock.<eos> It doesn't stop at 6:00.<eos> And neither does his billing.
I might have gone overboard in hiding it.<eos> Put 'em together to find where I hid my treasure, because I do not remember. At all.<eos> - [Eep laughing]<eos> - Good luck. - Booby traps, here I come.<eos> - Not alone, you don't.
I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> - Well, now...<eos> - I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
That's right.<eos> We went to the library to look for you, but you weren't there.<eos> Wait, you guys are checking up on me?<eos> I'm 14, I don't need you guys looking over my shoulder all the time.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
That's what this is about to you, huh, Will?<eos> How I make my living?<eos> I'm just saying, this trial could go sideways.<eos> I don't want to see anything bad happen to you.<eos> No one does.
This whole gender oppression thing is lived in different ways by a transgender person, who is questioning precisely these formulas, these cages.<eos> Angeli, could you please ask a question?<eos> I would like to know...<eos> We worked together, we still do.<eos> -We still do.
I already had enough capital in professional respect.<eos> I could have lost something.<eos> "Oh, let's not hire that transvestite."<eos> It could have happened.<eos> But it didn't.
- Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no". I mean, I know...<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
Thought we've done this dance before.<eos> You know I'm not a bad guy.<eos> And you got into my truck... after you decked me.<eos> You said you have answers. About the venomous vixens.<eos> - I do.
Shinwell.<eos> Shinwell Johnson.<eos> Sleepy-eyed gang informant, chess aficionado, murderer-- ring any bells?<eos> You saw the text I got last night.<eos> I did not.
Doesn't look good, does it?<eos> Chief Vlasik coming out of your place with an envelope like that?<eos> Could be a stack of napkins in there.<eos> You don't know.<eos> We don't.
All of these groups make use of Heptex clouds.<eos> Every website they visit, every cell call they make, every text and e-mail they send is believed to have been recorded or catalogued on a Heptex server.<eos> How convenient.<eos> The FBI wants access to these servers.<eos> Of course they do.
Why, what do you want her for?<eos> Amber Bowen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're arresting you on suspicion of inciting girls to prostitution.<eos> Doing what?
Fuck off!<eos> I've been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you're demanding off me now I couldn't pay you lot to look at for years.<eos> And what, you swan in here off the street with your Prada handbag telling me to hand it over like you were asking to check me gas meter?<eos> I understand...<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
I've been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you're demanding off me now I couldn't pay you lot to look at for years.<eos> And what, you swan in here off the street with your Prada handbag telling me to hand it over like you were asking to check me gas meter?<eos> I understand...<eos> Oh, no, you don't.<eos> You really, really don't.
Holly... when you went to the police about Tariq and Daddy and those other men, the CPS made a decision not to prosecute.<eos> But now there's a new team of police working on the kind of crime you were a victim of.<eos> We want to reopen your case and bring these men to trial.<eos> So, you want me to help you?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yesterday, this box ends up outside the house of an attorney I know.<eos> He does real estate.<eos> Finds places for us to put our money.<eos> I didn't think anybody knew about him.<eos> But, obviously, SBK did.
No armored cars, no rotating hotel rooms, no security detail.<eos> He's just another convict.<eos> I'm guessing you know plenty of people behind bars who you could send to introduce themselves.<eos> And you don't have a problem with that.<eos> Not tonight, I don't.
Or maybe you'd like to prove to us that you don't have any bite marks anywhere.<eos> You are getting way ahead of yourselves.<eos> If you tested his DNA without a warrant, that is an unlawful search.<eos> You didn't have permission...<eos> We did, actually.
I am so sorry, Waverly, for everything.<eos> I made a h... I made a huge mistake. No!<eos> Forget about the DNA results, OK?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Chin up.<eos> Officer Haught's the strongest deputy I've ever had.<eos> Look, I know that you two are, um... you're, uh... but, you know, procedure says I had to call Nicole's next of kin.<eos> But she doesn't speak to her parents.<eos> Neither did I.
Who's that now?<eos> She's at it again.<eos> No, I told her no more.<eos> You know how stubborn she is.<eos> Well, that I certainly do.
Do you know how to wire RDX?<eos> Can a Dothraki outride any knight in Westeros?<eos> What?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
Would you have yourself heard those statements?<eos> I don't remember the number.<eos> I know there were quite a few, but it's been a little while, and of course, at this point, I don't have files or anything.<eos> Um, the fact that we had a number of victims come forward was enough to make us look at the situation, but prosecutors have a very specific obligation in terms of their conduct.<eos> All lawyers do.
"Shar, just leave it alone.<eos> It's just one of those things, you should just leave it alone."<eos> He never said, "Oh, my God.<eos> You're so ridiculous. How... "<eos> He didn't do that.
She said I did.<eos> Your first wife, is she an honest person?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Do you remember having blood on your shirt that night?<eos> You do?
The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
And I was always talking to him.<eos> Whenever I was home, I was talking to him.<eos> And then he died, and I stopped talking to him.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Or does it?
"What do you think would happen if I went to the hospital and got a rape exam right now?<eos> Yeah, what do you think?<eos> You think they'd find your semen all over and inside me?<eos> 'Cause I do.<eos> Oh, I really do.
And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know<eos> - what I do is worth it.<eos> - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
- or my authorization.<eos> - Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.<eos> You taught me that, sir.<eos> It's only better if you get results.<eos> And we did.
But now I'm really just looking for the truth.<eos> So... what was that bruise that Jillian saw on you?<eos> Well, you know, I... I already told you.<eos> I'm Darius's new head of security, so sometimes, - sometimes I get into scrapes. - Mm.<eos> I do. Sometimes I do.
That's all.<eos> I happen to be quite romantic when the right woman comes along.<eos> Or even the wrong one, for that matter.<eos> I have your number.<eos> I do.
He wrote a play for me to star in.<eos> Which brings us to tonight.<eos> You see, over the years, I've written several plays for Gil and I to perform...<eos> - George, you remember the first?<eos> - The first play we ever did?
- You want to run that by me again?<eos> - I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> - I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means...<eos> - Actually, Harvey, I do.
Oh, Becky.<eos> Girls, this is William, he's an alienist.<eos> You won't know what that means.<eos> Neither does he.<eos> No-one does.
Would you like to come in?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I mean yes... but no if you're busy.<eos> But as for wanting to... yes.<eos> But of course no if you don't also, but... but if you do then yes I...
- And who are you?<eos> - My name is Alex Williams.<eos> Your Honor, this man has no standing in this case.<eos> I beg to differ, because I have a binding agreement signed by his legal clinic stating they would have no outside help from Pearson Specter Litt<eos> - on this case, yet they did.
- Okay.<eos> - Don't let him get too much sun, okay?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - You have sunscreen, yes?<eos> - No, we don't.
And this is not your fault.<eos> You were such a good husband to me.<eos> I never thought that I would have a normal life, and I did.<eos> - Cora...<eos> - I really did.
Like how some iguanas flare their colorful dewlaps to attract a mate.<eos> Exactly... like that.<eos> I think.<eos> How do you currently pick out your clothes?<eos> I don't.
My name is Elsa Gardner.<eos> I think I spoke to you on the phone earlier.<eos> I remember.<eos> You told me I have a beautiful speaking voice.<eos> You do.
The Belmonts killed vampires.<eos> Until the good people decided they didn't want us around.<eos> And now Dracula is carrying out an execution order on the human race.<eos> Do you care, Belmont?<eos> Honestly, I didn't, no.
Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
You're the editor for Shin Michima, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, you're here, Mr. Moriguchi.<eos> What underhanded method did you use?<eos> I didn't do anything.
Throw these things away.<eos> It was sent by the guy who killed Nanaka.<eos> I asked the police about that.<eos> They said he didn't send any fax.<eos> Then who did?
I don't know.<eos> Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing. Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
Minami,<eos> I will never<eos> forget this feeling.<eos> -It looks like he's smiling.<eos> -It sure does.
Do I need a reason to fall in love?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hug me tight.<eos> Why are you doing this, Hitomi?<eos> Just do it.
No, that is super nerdy.<eos> Yeah, well, nerdy's good.<eos> Nerds get full scholarships.<eos> You want to go there, right?<eos> - Um... - [Doug] Yeah, you do.
Now I know you're crazy.<eos> I know we didn't get off to the best of starts... but you shouldn't be fixing rust-buckets.<eos> Classic 1972 Trans-Am.<eos> If I had your pedigree and experience...<eos> Yeah, well you don't.
No, you didn't.<eos> His mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Terrorist!<eos> God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell? .<eos> We do, Claire.
God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell? .<eos> We do, Claire.<eos> Of course we do.
Not a big deal, no pressure.<eos> We could just go.<eos> It wouldn't have to be a date or anything.<eos> The thing is, I already sort of have a boyfriend, so...<eos> No, you don't.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Listen, I'm so sorry for the drunk dial the other night.<eos> I mean, you know how it is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You cannot beat a river into submission.<eos> You have to surrender to its current... and use its power as your own.<eos> I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.
- Hello, Mr Jackson.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who wants to ride in the back of the truck?<eos> - Me!<eos> I do!
Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
Keep going.<eos> Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.
Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
Glass.<eos> Okay, MacGyver, no woman's gotten this far, but, um...<eos> You had a plumber cut your water?<eos> No.<eos> I did it myself.
No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen... listen to me now...<eos> it's downright naughty. Whoo!<eos> We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
It.<eos> When he... hurts me.<eos> Oh. I like it. No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
Doesn't that scare you?<eos> I've been alone most of my life.<eos> Does being alone scare you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
And the rug there, that's Moby.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And, um...<eos> I think this is the point in the conversation where you tell me your name.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
From me to you, Gabby.<eos> The stars and the moon.<eos> Let's just stay here forever.<eos> I'm glad you like it. Yeah.<eos> I do.
Tore them babies down, um, going on about two years now.<eos> To the airport, then?<eos> Well, they used to have an overflight curfew.<eos> It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.<eos> - They did.
And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> -It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
I wanted to come closer and look, but it speeded right from that spot and disappeared.<eos> Do you remember the license plate number?<eos> No. But it had C class tires.<eos> So you didn't see either the license plate number or the brand but made out the tires?<eos> I didn't.
- Suit yourself.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - We got a lot going on, so if we could just speed this along.<eos> - So, then you don't want your money then.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... my friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
Listen, can you just get me out of here?<eos> This isn't even my car man.<eos> So you got like no idea why these guys are chasing you?<eos> No.<eos> No I don't.
I know you work for Syndicate Red.<eos> What did you just fuck'n say?<eos> I know you work for Syndicate Red.<eos> Look I don't have to wait 10 minutes to kill you, how did you know that?<eos> I just do.
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti, but he was a brute too.<eos> Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.<eos> You have no idea how that bastard treated her.<eos> But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.<eos> Yes, Watson, we did.
Do you know what I told him?<eos> That you took my money and left, so he should pay back his kid's debt instead.<eos> Then he asked me for just a week.<eos> He said he needed a week.<eos> So what do I do?
'Cause I don't think we're that good, truthfully.<eos> Part of this whole process is all about some kind of a moment of untouchable, unexplainable, spiritual something.<eos> For us, it's just such a process of, like, scratching and digging and, like... it's like, uh, like just puzzle pieces, you know?<eos> But we don't know what the picture looks like.<eos> And only God does.
It's really... it's really awesome.<eos> There's always that.<eos> The chords, whoa...<eos> Yeah, it's a weird... it's one of those weird accidents.<eos> - You did a great accident.
I was looking at you with anger!<eos> I made a mistake, your eyes are very mischievous.<eos> They want one thing, but they say something else.<eos> Do you now understand how it feels when someone takes advantage of you?<eos> No, I did not.
Go back to your pub and let me make something of my life.<eos> But that's just it.<eos> Do you really want this kind of life?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
They'll turn up.<eos> It's brahms.<eos> He can be playful.<eos> I assume you brought other shoes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Just like the heelshires.<eos> And that ties me to them.<eos> And to brahms. And to this place.<eos> Does that make any sense to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
- No, sir.<eos> It will be our secret.<eos> You think you're pretty astonishing, right?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - You do.
- What did they get my dad on?<eos> Drug smuggling.<eos> - It's pretty serious.<eos> - So did we lose any endorsements?<eos> No, you did not.
She led her whole team to this competition in, uh, Tokyo, Japan. Did you know that?<eos> - Your mom competed in Japan.<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Aw, I want to see the silly dance.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're gonna have a better life now.<eos> We already do.
We're going, get dressed.<eos> Get out of my room.<eos> You're never around when I need you.<eos> Your sister just passed out in the backyard and you couldn't care less.<eos> - She did?
I know, but it's hard because...<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Thanks, Lieutenant, you always know what to...<eos> I do.
Andreas?<eos> Just tell me where she is.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - You think I'm playing?<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah?<eos> I was 3. You'd think by now, I'd be able to ride more than a bike.<eos> You actually think you're going to find something?<eos> Look at you.<eos> You do, don't you?
She's nice.<eos> She?<eos> The nice ones always end up being the biggest assholes.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Uh, yes I do.
Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
Why don't you mind your own damn business?<eos> They are my business.<eos> These rednecks were trying to take the girls out back.<eos> - Your friend's got a big mouth.<eos> - Yeah, he does.
- I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I guess they found nature.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yes, they did.
Shredder and the mutants were definitely here.<eos> And I'm detecting traces of neutronium, the critical ingredient required for creating a controlled black hole.<eos> Which is the only thing capable of rupturing the space-time continuum.<eos> And you know what that means!<eos> No. I don't, Donnie.
My parents published the books.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> You are Mccreighton-hill. The girl who got into Greene because of her parents.<eos> But you know what? I, uh, I don't buy that.<eos> Everyone else does.
- Yeah...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> About that.<eos> You know how everyone told me it was a stupid idea to build a gymnastics team to win back a boy?<eos> - Well, I didn't.
You're damn bright, old.<eos> - The bloody sweat.<eos> - You said it.<eos> Hey, tell me ...<eos> What does a blonde after a blowjob?
- Yeah. See you up there.<eos> I'm wondering, for each of you, what's that thing that really makes you... want to get up in the morning?<eos> Well, for me, I guess, the simplest answer is...<eos> I like money.<eos> I do.
- Have a drink.<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> But there are a million things going on tomorrow.<eos> - And...<eos> - This place does an amazing martini.
You mean everything I've presented.<eos> You're killing me, and that's fine, but don't kill him.<eos> Go home and write and your closing argument.<eos> You think you can handle it?<eos> - Do you?
There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait.<eos> You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
Thanks for meeting me.<eos> I felt bad for never giving you anything at west Chester.<eos> Do you think this is political?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Apparently you do.
You motherfucker!<eos> Hubert got away!<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
- I don't want to!<eos> - I don't care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Look, I know this is a big night for you. - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do!
Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
- That's Miller's pal.<eos> Yeah, I didn't get any orders anything like this.<eos> You stand down.<eos> I've got rank here.<eos> Not today, you don't.
Uh, why?<eos> I thought that since you had a certain... friendship with her, that you might have some insight that would help us.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Did you know that Peter Drax isn't Louis' biological father?<eos> I did.
No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
Oh, no.<eos> My god.<eos> Look, they're so cute.<eos> Oh! I want to hold them close to my face.<eos> No, you do not.
Everyone will understand, Mads.<eos> - Hi, Mom!<eos> - Hi, sweetie. All right?<eos> - Yes. Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
- Now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Honey, I... I'm not taking leave.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Did you?
We gotta go, we gotta go.<eos> Manuel...<eos> Manuel...<eos> Rocky!<eos> How you doing, brother?
You know, I'm just...<eos> I'm just out here, you know,<eos> I'm always hustling...<eos> - Well...<eos> - I don't...
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sound better.<eos> So, did you guys actually use the fishing tackle?<eos> Yeah, we really did.
Thanks.<eos> Uh, not that it would come up or anything, but her parents think she stays downstairs when she stays over.<eos> If it comes up for some reason, can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?<eos> I don't even know them.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.<eos> Oh, goddammit, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
What? Did Lee get food?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't want any.<eos> We're good. Forget it.<eos> He doesn't...
Minimum wage plus the room.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go get some furniture.<eos> I got furniture.<eos> No, you don't.
Dad made me promise not to drive till I was 17.<eos> Okay, we'll stick with that then.<eos> Do you want to stay for dinner?<eos> I think Sandy's mother likes you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
That's too fast.<eos> How 'bout if I put my penis in you?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> What about if I just did the tip, like, just the very beginning—
The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, con "A,"<eos> was to find the secret beach.<eos> And now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu.<eos> You don't like it when someone change your plans, do you?<eos> No, I don't. No, I don't.
- The fuck do you know, man?<eos> You didn't even know we invaded Egypt.<eos> - Iraq.<eos> - Same fuckin' thing.<eos> Goddamn right I didn't.
It would have to be one hell of a jammer.<eos> The static I heard sounded a lot more like Agent Porter simply turned off his wire.<eos> Porter turning off his wire?<eos> That doesn't make any sense, Captain.<eos> - No, no, it doesn't.
I should have tried.<eos> You did... nothing wrong.<eos> No.<eos> He deserves to know the truth.<eos> You both do.
I know how to conduct a marriage.<eos> I just need to prepare the papers.<eos> Good. In an hour's time, then.<eos> You really want to do this?<eos> Do you?
You know, I don't believe you.<eos> I don't believe you ever really cared about their pain.<eos> Do you care?<eos> Do you really care about my pain?<eos> Of course, I do!
You're totally right, I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this, please do it.<eos> Please do it.<eos> Just do it!
Go watch some TV, huh?<eos> It's gonna be a long night.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm coming outside, boys.<eos> How ya doing out there, Bobby?
Our boy is gonna get himself killed.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> You know this lunatic, Dante?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING SILLY.<eos> MERRY CHRISTMAS.<eos> MERRY CHRISTMAS.<eos> WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR HEARTBREAK AND I PRETENDED LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE ONE?<eos> WELL, I DID.
How'd it go?<eos> Good.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> You have anymore commitments this afternoon?<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
- Come on, oh my god.<eos> - What, you, just...<eos> - it's game time.<eos> - I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> - Nope, no you don't.
- It's not where you sit but who you sit next to.<eos> I remember that first summer.<eos> I wanted to see the big lebowski but you insisted on seeing buffalo 66.<eos> - You told me you loved that movie.<eos> - I did.
- I like what you did with the place.<eos> - I just expected the end of the night to go a lot different than this.<eos> - The rose petals are a little dramatic.<eos> - You like 'em.<eos> - I do.
He was not on her list anymore.<eos> She had taken him off it.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't she want him dead any longer?<eos> She did and she did not.
So, you want them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Cost me 500 bucks.<eos> I prefer a money order.<eos> Nice doing business with you.
Nick, I promise you.<eos> I promise that if you open up, you won't get hurt, okay?<eos> I just...<eos> I... I don't know what you want.<eos> No, you don't.
I mean, it needs a lot of work, but...<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> He's standing downstairs.<eos> Do you have any wine?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.
Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
I'm just one man, Mrs Beckett.<eos> They need an army.<eos> A good man's an army by himself.<eos> He has your husband's smile.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
No! Not like that, of course not.<eos> A proper doctor.<eos> I've heard that in Harley Street there are...<eos> You know...<eos> And do you?
It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
Or as we say in Spanish class, "Le dejo a usted conversar, senoritas." I think we need to "conversar" about Cousin Mabel.<eos> There's no such person, Trixie.<eos> I made her up so that I didn't have to tell you the truth.<eos> But there's really no truth to tell now, so it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
- What are you guys gonna ride?<eos> - Jumbo. Dumbo, not Jumbo.<eos> Dumbo. Em, did you thank Mommy?<eos> Say thank you?<eos> - Yes, we did.
I will cut you up.<eos> And nobody will ever find you.<eos> Why you tailing me?<eos> Why are you tailing me?<eos> Okay, I did!
You cursed.<eos> Swear jar?<eos> Come on, man. I...<eos> All right, look, I don't have anything on me now.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Hell... even the Koreans.<eos> All loyal.<eos> We're all good.<eos> So... when do I get my Judas?<eos> You don't.
What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
-I didn't screw anybody.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.<eos> That's not true and you know it.<eos> I do.
I don't wanna bleed to death on the floor, like Scarfe.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.<eos> - I don't drink.<eos> - Yes, you do.
No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
I liked the club better.<eos> I'm a man who needs his space.<eos> Space is a good thing.<eos> Especially when you come to kill a man.<eos> Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.
You know, in that... that thing that your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?<eos> There were a lot of dirty hands.<eos> Not Cornell's.<eos> - He didn't have the guns.<eos> - Oh, yes, he did.
Are you still not feeling better?<eos> No, I can't concentrate.<eos> I don't think I'll be well by New Year's Night.<eos> Don't you want us to go out?<eos> - I do.
Sorry, can you avoid the tunnels?<eos> Tickets.<eos> That's not the tickets, that's your letter.<eos> - I threw the letter away.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
Yes. That's right.<eos> _ Did you find it?<eos> _ Find what?<eos> _ The town you were looking for?<eos> _ Oh yeah, we did.
I don't know.<eos> But when the time comes, you'll know what to do.<eos> Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> And so did your father.
Never mind.<eos> Valčík, you take this street behind me.<eos> We have some sun, so take this.<eos> If he approaches without an armed escort, then use it to signal.<eos> And if he does?
- What's with you, bro?<eos> - Talking about my shit ain't brand-new.<eos> - Man, you need counseling, bro.<eos> - You do, too.<eos> No, I don't. You do, man.
It's a matter of time... before your wife starts to braid hair... like Allen Iverson!<eos> Why does he still have the braids?<eos> We like Allen Iverson's braids.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We do.
Too late for that. The bigwigs decided.<eos> I'm here to take the Black family off the books.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> - Yes, you do, little girl.
- You're kidding.<eos> This has to be a mistake.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you don't like being lied to?<eos> I don't.
These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
If Otto doesn't have some to borrow... I've got to find the son of a bitch who stole mine or I'm screwed.<eos> So we are going to Otto's.<eos> - Anthony.<eos> - Hey, Otto.<eos> - How you doing?
I didn't touch her, Mr Redmond.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Did you enjoy taking her virginity?<eos> Did you enjoy making her a woman?<eos> - Did you?
- You've broken confidences.<eos> - Only when I thought it necessary.<eos> - I can't break the rules like you do.<eos> - I don't break the rules!<eos> - Yes, you do.
We don't need any more stuff, but...<eos> I think what I really meant is you don't need to give me anything because you're here. And that's a very good gift, I appreciate it.<eos> I mean, if you have, you know, an albino alligator, I'll take it.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - We do.
She was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
Least you've still got hope.<eos> - ♪ Over and over... ♪ - WENDY: Gillian, you have to go home<eos> - now.<eos> Anna has homework.<eos> - No, I don't.
- my daughter's dead.<eos> - Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there, what we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
I want it! Aah! It's the end of the line, Naté.<eos> I've seen a lot of drug-smuggling operations, but this one takes the cake.<eos> Think you can cuff her, partner?<eos> I do, partner.<eos> I do.
I've seen a lot of drug-smuggling operations, but this one takes the cake.<eos> Think you can cuff her, partner?<eos> I do, partner.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, too.
And for your information, yes, I have.<eos> I gotta say you were fairly impressive, but I mean, what else would we expect from the great Orson Creed?<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well I had some help, but you know all about that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Come on.<eos> - Do you know what. - Happened to her?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Nobody does.
I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> Come here, you little fuck.<eos> Do you know where you go when you die?<eos> I do.
Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
Nothing famous about that.<eos> Now, this is the famous Beacon Hill.<eos> This is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the entire city, and it's home to my sweet, sweet boyfriend, Tom Brady.<eos> - Does he really live there?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
They probably had crushes on you.<eos> I mean, everything's backwards when you're little.<eos> When a boy likes you, he pulls your hair.<eos> When you like a boy, you kick him in the shins.<eos> You do any shin-kicking back in the day?
Dying to see this movie.<eos> Sounds interesting enough.<eos> Blick, Thompson, and Cohen were talking about it in the office.<eos> And Thompson said the film might be racist towards white people.<eos> No, he didn't.
B!<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> Yo, Rafiqa!<eos> This Barack's woman, Michelle.<eos> - He done well for himself. - Mm-hmm.
'So..will you marry me when we grow up? '<eos> 'Then you must cut your hair.<eos> - Promise.'<eos> 'Do you promise?<eos> - I do.'
He's black, incidentally, which doesn't really--<eos> I'm sorry. Do I care about anything you're saying right now?<eos> Nikki: No, you don't.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to go?<eos> Yes. He does.
Yeah, we searched the entire Asylum.<eos> There aren't any tunnels here.<eos> That's because according to the blueprints,<eos> Arkush doesn't have tunnels.<eos> Sure, it does.
Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> And now I love him more than my own life.<eos> Oh, don't say that.<eos> No, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> But you're right.<eos> No, Mitchell, no I'm not.<eos> She deserves better.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Ethan?<eos> This just came for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And this just came for you.<eos> Yes it did, yes it did.
The kid moved, okay?<eos> You told him not to but he did, he moved right when you were cutting.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> An accident caused by a squirming child, that's all.<eos> But he didn't.
But with my guidance she rebounded from fashion disaster.<eos> Sweetie, dial it back.<eos> When she met Will, I knew it was special.<eos> She never talked about boys, so when she brought him up, I just knew that...<eos> Okay, Em, kind of doing something up here.
She doesn't speak Latin.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I never believed in the Devil or demons, or any of this shit, but there is something else controlling her.<eos> Tell me you don't see that.<eos> I do.
One thing in particular, that dang walk-in.<eos> That bill is a real whopper.<eos> - I know, it's a problem, all that ice cream.<eos> - I don't want to overstep my bounds here. But, we may have found a solution.<eos> Or Joan did, actually.
- So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> - I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
It's disingenuous.<eos> - Fuhrman doesn't have to be a witness.<eos> - What?<eos> He's not even the cop who entered the gloves into evidence; he doesn't have to take the stand.<eos> Yes, he does.
So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.
Once in the hotel, you will not be permitted to leave your floor.<eos> You're not allowed in another juror's room for any reason.<eos> Deputies will be on duty in the halls and elsewhere to supervise you at all times.<eos> Do you and each of you understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Dearly beloved.<eos> We are gathered here today to join together in holy matrimony Thomas Michael Shelby and Grace Helen Burgess.<eos> Those flowers need to go there.<eos> Do you, Thomas Michael Shelby, take Grace Helen Burgess to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> I do.
Your hair, everything.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Churchill is the go-between but it's against government policy so everything must be kept a secret.<eos> You know it's begun.<eos> They started the business tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
You have got to learn proper hood protocol if you're gonna go snooping around.<eos> And the first rule is you don't go out alone.<eos> Not after seven and certainly not in the Valley.<eos> - How'd you know where I was?<eos> - Actually I didn't.
His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
Show me your stance.<eos> Now listen to me, Pod.<eos> See how your feet are about a yard apart?<eos> Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.<eos> 'Cause they do, Pod.
Will you allow Amberle to return to the Sanctuary and fulfill her sacred duty?<eos> Amberle Elessedil, you turned your back on the Chosen and your duties to the Ellcrys.<eos> I did.<eos> And now you wish to carry its seed to the Bloodfire.<eos> I do.
If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
You know, and what's the point?<eos> Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind?<eos> Maybe you were right about the Elves.<eos> Maybe we don't deserve saving.<eos> Yeah, maybe none of us do.
- Always around? He like hung out like all the time.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And I was like, "Oh, there's something between you."<eos> Oh, so there was something between you.<eos> - Yeah, you knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't! - Mm-hmm.
- I don't know, I think they're doing girl stuff.<eos> We got caterers coming.<eos> - I know.<eos> You know how much I love to make sweet potato casserole.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
I knew that chicken.<eos> - What?<eos> I have seen that his neck was reversed, most recently at the farm of Chardoul.<eos> Chardoul?<eos> Do you Thomas?
I agree.<eos> And you should only choose the right warrior.<eos> Jinna, I'm the right warrior.<eos> You know this.<eos> We both do.
Kunta!<eos> Live!<eos> See what comes!<eos> Do you know what will come? !<eos> Does Allah? !
Then, this one Saturday... my grandmother came crying Mother's name.<eos> And I knew, in that moment, that... Mama had died.<eos> I lost her for a second time.<eos> I, too, thought things could never change.<eos> But they did.
With the added power, A.L.I.E. Was able to complete the work she began with her creator a hundred years ago.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Look. I'm still leaving this place in a rowboat.<eos> I need you.<eos> Of course you do, more food for the sea monster, right?
We have to move it.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
We're staying in the city, at the theatre.<eos> I have other news that might be heavy for you.<eos> Your brother, King Christian, surrendered Denmark at 05:00 this morning.<eos> If it helps, he did not have much choice.<eos> No, he probably didn't.
- Excellent!<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - This Quisling will never be accepted as a leader of the Government.<eos> - We like Mr. Quisling.<eos> - We all do.
Yeah, sure I was.<eos> I mean, we could go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.
All that for a kimono?<eos> You don't understand love.<eos> Gosh, this nail Polish remover sure smells.<eos> It stings, too.<eos> It does?
I told my parents I was going to Frenchie's to study because they won't let me go to dances.<eos> That's why I didn't want to be on camera.<eos> I didn't want them to find out that I lied to them just to be with you.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
I know.<eos> Mine don't care about anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sandy, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't... oh.
You left your ID.<eos> You came all this way for that?<eos> Thought you'd need it.<eos> No, I...<eos> I do, thanks.
- Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds<eos> - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
Shalom.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on, listen...<eos> I owe you a little something, don't I?<eos> I do.
May I just start, right, by saying that I may choose to stay here and just starve to death and choke on sapphires rather than ever go back to the fucking world again?<eos> Yeah, well, there is a good reason for that, you know, little man.<eos> Because my shop, right, is just above a rum house, so all the...<eos> - You speak Russian?<eos> - I do, yeah. I do.
Ah, well, here we are.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Do you have any information regarding the case that you have not shared with us?<eos> This is for my mother.<eos> No, I do not.
He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Smart girl.<eos> Oh. Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> I do, I do.
I'll go get 'em.<eos> It was nothing that you did or didn't do, Alfred.<eos> Why I went away.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> I do.
But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.<eos> Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop. Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Gina, hey, how's the stalling?<eos> Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.<eos> You did.
Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.<eos> You did.<eos> You did.
I'm sure Diaz gets it.<eos> She's so in touch with her feelings.<eos> And me, hmm.<eos> After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.<eos> Of course you do.
- Adrian.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I thought you left.<eos> I did.
It's a great name for an album cover.<eos> I love this.<eos> I think you need it more than I do, though.<eos> I have a great sense of direction.<eos> Yeah, sure you do.
Whatever it takes.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you don't have what it takes.<eos> Nobody does.
- Maybe it's out of date.<eos> - May 2017.<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't you want to do this?<eos> No, I do.
I'm not a cop!<eos> I really didn't know.<eos> I didn't.<eos> How would I know?<eos> I didn't.
When you're done with these clowns, you come and meet me up there, we'll do a little "Three Sisters."<eos> You see?<eos> He's intelligent. He knows.<eos> He knows. You see?<eos> - He does.
- What?<eos> - Is there something wrong with my face? Just tell me.<eos> Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.
- Wow. - And, uh, it's why I'm working three jobs, that I... - Yeah.<eos> Hate.<eos> Well, I'll drink to that. Well, I don't do that anymore, so...<eos> - No. Shit!<eos> - I don't do that.
What the holy hell do you want?<eos> What do a bunch of Columbian drug lords care about Al-Qaeda anyway?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> This ain't my first rodeo, hombre.<eos> And what if I don't?
Till recently, I thought that was me as well, but now...<eos> I don't know that it is anymore.<eos> It is natural for men new to power to assume that it has no limits.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It does.
Do you want to fool around... With me?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Do you really want to know what it's like?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't have them.<eos> What?<eos> None of my friends do.
You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone That there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> Well, she was mistaken.<eos> What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
- Oh, I probably shouldn't.<eos> What is it? What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't!
"She really thinks she's something."<eos> Now, who would write such a thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure. Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Swift.<eos> My name is Dayshawn.<eos> I like your glasses.<eos> Do you have boyfriend?<eos> Do you?
Come on, Seychelles.<eos> - You're being a little freak.<eos> - You are.<eos> You are... being a freak.<eos> - Out of the corner of my eye. You do. - A little bit?
Yup. Bam.<eos> There we go. Um, well, you need to loosen up.<eos> You look, uh, you look awkward.<eos> I feel like I look pretty cool.<eos> No, you do not.
Are you coming to the bedroom?<eos> Yeah, you promised.<eos> You guys want to shut it down?<eos> Ooh!<eos> Yeah, we do.
So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> What?<eos> You could work for me, if you wanted to.<eos> I do, I do want to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> But the point is, I met someone online, and I decided to come to the city and meet him in person.<eos> Okay. Um, what happened?<eos> He didn't look anything like his Internet photo.<eos> - Yeah, well, they never do.
What's up?<eos> Headed your way, actually.<eos> I told you we're fine.<eos> It's that case I told you about.<eos> Our victim did business there.
The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe she does.
And yet, here we are.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I didn't kill Tony Allen.<eos> Why'd Joey Marks order the hit on him?<eos> He didn't.
Makes me feel like the danger's over, and we should just go home.<eos> I'm not really sure about that, so just humor me, okay?<eos> Stick around a couple more days.<eos> I think you just like having us here.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
I say this, not just as Mongols, but as people under the Mongol Empire!<eos> Open the gates to outsiders, secrets will spill!<eos> Brother.<eos> I should've left you there to bleed out in that cave.<eos> Probably... but you didn't.
To make Americans hate real Muslims.<eos> A lot of people who say they were at 9/11, they're all actors.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Well, now you know.<eos> Of course you didn't.
This isn't for a trick, is it?<eos> For what it's worth, I didn't want to bail on the scholarship.<eos> But I had to.<eos> I just want you to know that.<eos> I do.
So, is Elliot loving school?<eos> Oh, well, so far so good.<eos> We'll see how it goes.<eos> I bet you cried your eyes out with your only one going off to college.<eos> -Well... -She did.
And she told me the drug test was gonna be for heroin or crack<eos> -and of course I'm-- -hold on, Ms. Diaz, this is a conversation you should be having with your attorney in private.<eos> Your honor, if I can just have<eos> -a second with my client. -I trust you understand how many cases we have backed up today.<eos> I do, I do.
Yeah, maybe a little.<eos> What should I call him?<eos> David, why are you asking me these questions now?<eos> -Call him whatever you want. -You never even told me his name.<eos> -I did.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Men are weaker than women.<eos> A lot of temptation out there and men are the first to fall.<eos> -You really believe that?<eos> -Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> - And you didn't respond.<eos> No.<eos> And I texted your mom actually.<eos> - You did?
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
Well, maybe it's his ghost.<eos> Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
They sing.<eos> Where's Clarence?<eos> They're ready for him.<eos> Judge, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Welcome, Professor.<eos> We thank you on behalf of the Committee for making time for this. I know it wasn't easy, and we appreciate that.<eos> Uh, please stand to be sworn in.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
You're in the special forces here.<eos> You are a Navy seal.<eos> And there's a reason for that.<eos> Did the s.E.A.L.S make a mistake signing you up?<eos> No. They did not.
Yeah.<eos> Denny dantone's coming in with an offer on the Norton house -- $62 million.<eos> Prepared to close in less than a week, I hear.<eos> How the fuck did he see it?<eos> He didn't.
Nice deflection tactic.<eos> As your intern?<eos> That's not what you were asking.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.
I just wanted to let you know before they did.<eos> I asked to stay on XHP with you.<eos> Thanks for the consolation prize.<eos> You deserved it.<eos> No, I didn't.
My wife and I used to do this on sailing trips.<eos> I should have said "ex-wife".<eos> No, I just never heard you talk about her before.<eos> I didn't feel like I knew you before.<eos> Well, you do now.
So, you did write it.<eos> -I didn't say that.<eos> -I don't know why it is, Ezekiel, that you seem to want to be nothing, when with just a little courage... you could really be something.<eos> I got courage.<eos> No, you don't.
How Mylene look topless?<eos> - Shut up, Boo.<eos> - Yo. Yo.<eos> He don't know.<eos> You don't.
Meanwhile, you have been living the dream.<eos> How does this happen?<eos> Oh, you know how these things happen.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I honestly don't.
I already filed a complaint with OSHA, but I hop you'll file as well.<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Kelsey, I got Thad's laptop, which I'd like to access.<eos> - Do you have the password?<eos> - I don't, no.
- Oh, my gosh. You don't know.<eos> - I know.<eos> If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
Tyra Banks.<eos> - See? - Marty, she's an African-American model of prominence.<eos> Dad, I thought you'd be happy.<eos> I thought you didn't want me to be a model.<eos> I don't.
- we're amazing.<eos> And we think<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - That you're amazing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Emily: Why?<eos> Nick, why? Nick:<eos> Because that's what people do. Emily:<eos> What do we care what people do?<eos> - We don't.
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?<eos> She's a goddamn doll!<eos> Hey, can you not say that around her?<eos> I swear, I feel like she understands.<eos> Of course you do.
You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
- Now, no... - You... Hold it.<eos> They don't know what it means.<eos> That means equal pay.<eos> It's, everybody's gonna make the same. Yeah.<eos> - DO... Yes. - Across the board, yes.
The other one's your husband.<eos> I know that it's a late hour and all, but I just drove straight through from Houston when I got the news.<eos> It's... it's 10 hours, and if I could just use your bathroom and your phone, call my wife, let her know I'm safe, I... I'd really appreciate it.<eos> Why didn't you call ahead?<eos> Well, I... I did earlier.
Have you... have you... have you heard any more, uh,<eos> - from the cops?<eos> - No. Why, you talk to 'em?<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
You'll light a couple of candles.<eos> And when the time is right...<eos> She got interested in me when she realized who I am.<eos> I don't want to take her for a ride.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Is that your mother?<eos> - No.<eos> Unfortunately we're also out of Ruinart.<eos> I'm sorry, but we have several bottles of Ruinart.<eos> - No, we don't.
Jacob, settle.<eos> - Someone needs a nap.<eos> - Faster!<eos> I don't normally like to gossip, but did you hear that Jacob needs a nap?<eos> I did.
The first tour.<eos> You didn't have a choice the first tour.<eos> The second time you did have a choice and you chose to go back and risk your life<eos> - for a...<eos> - No, I didn't.
-We're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come out.<eos> We know you're in there.<eos> No, you don't.
I like to treat myself, don't you?<eos> Why should all the bad people have all the good things in life?<eos> Like this?<eos> You had a good morning. Yes, I did.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Everyone says she looks just like Antoine.<eos> His spitting image.<eos> But we say that of all children, right?<eos> True or not.<eos> - We do.
What I think is interesting is that, first and foremost, he has, if we go back, your father's name, and so, needless to say...<eos> Here we go, French kings...<eos> Look, Antoine, I'll just shut up, alright?<eos> And you tell the story.<eos> Or no one does, and...
Like on your postcards.<eos> Or that little smile.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Did they talk to you?<eos> Suzanne just did, right?
We think silent people are good listeners.<eos> But I shut up so people leave me alone.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
- Mr. Chang what's this?<eos> - It has been in my family since..<eos> Forever.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah I do.
Kill him.<eos> Brutus, not him, kill zhao.<eos> Ups.<eos> - So, I assumed you have a plan.<eos> - I do.
We have to get through.<eos> And I need to finish cooking my soup.<eos> How long is that going to take?<eos> - All night.<eos> - We don't.
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?<eos> It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.<eos> The way the Princess looks at you..<eos> She believes in you.<eos> - She does?
- Yeah.<eos> You came to save me.<eos> I guess.<eos> I knew you will.<eos> You did?
Just live in the moment.<eos> No offense, but I think we don't have a moment.<eos> Do you arun take su lin in sickness and in health..<eos> - For better and the worse?<eos> - I do, she does.
Well, what do you believe that is?<eos> Prevent the spread of Communism.<eos> Right, well, we secure this gook stockpile in Quan Thang, we secure the lives and safety of hundreds of Marines, maybe thousands.<eos> Now, you believe that's worth something fighting for?<eos> Yes, sir, Captain, I do.
Gary, Scott Levitt. He's the counsel for American Century Records.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Did you bring the contract?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who's the beanpole?<eos> Mr. Squivers, a medical cadet.<eos> Hmm. I had some reservations about Dr. Hale's assessment.<eos> Did you?<eos> - I did. - Mm.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome our special guests, the Van Atta Middle School dance team!<eos> Sponsored by Gibbler Style Party Planning! $5 off your next quinceañera.<eos> You guys wanna see more?<eos> But we don't have any more.<eos> Oh, yes, we do. Right, Mom?
- You two are gonna love working together.<eos> - Oh, we are?<eos> Yeah, Matt's gonna help out while I'm on vacation.<eos> I told you.<eos> Uh... no, you didn't.
It's always me.<eos> Oh, yes, it is.<eos> OK, Aunt Becky, time for a baby break.<eos> - No, he doesn't want to...<eos> - Yeah, he does.
Fernando, for the past 15 years you've made every day an adventure.<eos> I don't always understand what you're saying... but I always know that you love me.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> Fernando, Jesse, do you take Kimmy and Becky to be your lawfully wedded wife and your already-wedded wife?<eos> - I do.
I don't always understand what you're saying... but I always know that you love me.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> Fernando, Jesse, do you take Kimmy and Becky to be your lawfully wedded wife and your already-wedded wife?<eos> - I do.<eos> - I do.
Fernando, Jesse, do you take Kimmy and Becky to be your lawfully wedded wife and your already-wedded wife?<eos> - I do.<eos> - I do.<eos> Kimmy and Becky, do you take Fernando and Jesse, uh, to be, uh... what I just said?<eos> I do.
I'm very sorry, and we will pick this up at a later date.<eos> OK, thanks, Christine.<eos> My source at the police station called it the Tug Show, actually.<eos> - He said that?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Hi, George.<eos> Why, hello, Christine!<eos> Shall we?<eos> I thought you didn't drink.<eos> For the most part, I don't.
- It wasn't like this before.<eos> There's someone back here, Jonah.<eos> Pick away.<eos> I don't know.<eos> She does.
We don't know if that one guy is actually dead.<eos> "One guy"? His name is Rand, man.<eos> Rand.<eos> He's been my best friend for, like, 15 years and you don't even know his name.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Shut your face, Gitty!<eos> - Martin, watch your mouth.<eos> Martin, this chicken's delicious.<eos> - Where'd you buy it?<eos> - I didn't.
Then I suppose she'll never get tired of my boy either.<eos> I'll say!<eos> She'll adore him forever.<eos> You want to continue teaching after marriage?<eos> Yes, I do.
A little bit at a time.<eos> For Ramba Ral.<eos> Do you like chocolates?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police...<eos> Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
No, because two hours later they caught Glen Baker.<eos> And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought. What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
It's a good school.<eos> It's gonna help you get into college.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Evy?<eos> I don't want to go back to that place.<eos> I don't.
I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I... I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No.<eos> You do!
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
It's like a farmer's almanac for non-farm stuff.<eos> Then, yeah, I could put out a couple of volumes of Schott's miscellany about the place.<eos> You just need to ask yourself one question first...<eos> Are you rich enough to never get another job?<eos> I did work for that man.
Starting right after we address the situation in Yemen.<eos> Honey, it's Yemen.<eos> Life gives you Yemen, you got to make Yemenade.<eos> Okay, well, I'll come back later.<eos> You always do.
So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
- A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
Yeah, I just wanted to have something that had a little bit more of a classic feeling bar.<eos> You know?<eos> Something that doesn't necessarily rely on a theme or anything like that.<eos> Well it has a theme.<eos> No it doesn't.
Oh yeah well...<eos> I know they were better than mine, so...<eos> I'm going to get more booze.<eos> I didn't know that you wanted to be a writer.<eos> No, I didn't...
Hey, you gotta calm down.<eos> I gotta turn myself in and I gotta...<eos> No, hold on. I gotta tell how it could happen.<eos> Yeah, but you don't know what happened. - Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
-About what?<eos> I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
We do not need the money anymore.<eos> Have you noticed that our life has changed?<eos> I make movies now.<eos> Soon, we can handle ourselves. It will be like old times.<eos> We do not even André.
Tell me what's up.<eos> I think this place is making me worse.<eos> We'll go home after lunch.<eos> Who wants to skip some stones?<eos> I do!
Where'd you hear it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song? I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
Who did?<eos> No one.<eos> Who would say something mean like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
It all... It all happened because I chose her.<eos> You wanted to adopt that little boy, but... I wanted her.<eos> I thought because she was blind, she would need me forever.<eos> I needed her... to love me.<eos> I just did.
You're taking this way out of proportion.<eos> I think this shows that I care about you the most.<eos> I was the most worried to tell you.<eos> Does that not mean anything to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
- I can save her.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Hey, not while you have diarrhea.<eos> I don't have diarrhea.<eos> I don't.
- Can you tell me anything else about the game?<eos> - Mm, very little I'm afraid.<eos> Only a scant number have played it but, uh, every few years or so, it always ends up back here.<eos> - Uh, why do they return it?<eos> - They don't.
Previously on Rogue...<eos> Shit.<eos> - Did you actually see her shoot him?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Maybe it's run its course.<eos> Doesn't look like it's getting any traction.<eos> Maybe, maybe, we just maybe, have beaten this thing.<eos> Ah. Don't you think it's a little early for that?<eos> No, I do not.
Yes, I'm sure.<eos> But what the hell does it matter?<eos> I mean, really, Ethan, what is your angle here?<eos> That Gary finished up his spreadsheets and then they sent him over here to blow me away?<eos> You done?
Come here.<eos> All right. Do I know you?<eos> Oh, yeah. Um...<eos> I really liked your poem.<eos> No, he didn't.
Mystery Man's got to see how committed we are.<eos> Right?<eos> Especially after what we did.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
You're just gonna let him walk out of here, Commander?<eos> - In a word, yes.<eos> - Harley Cohen is at the very least a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Don't you think it would be prudent to hold him for further questioning?<eos> I do not. Ah.
Coralie, call Lefort and confirm the hearing.<eos> Magnesium.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Try magnesium for palpebral tremors.<eos> Okay. Did you do anything?
Crazy, huh?<eos> What you did was amazing.<eos> I did not do much.<eos> - Anyway.<eos> He did it himself, with his own arguments.
Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street. Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
If I wind up in prison, I am never gonna take a shower.<eos> I can promise you one thing, that she will not be here long.<eos> Yeah, meanwhile, her accomplice was captured.<eos> You know, thank God the guy doesn't know where she is.<eos> Um, he... he does.
- Well, it's not your money.<eos> - It takes a certain passion to see things through and you've never had that. Maybe it's because Mum was always easy on you or your face is so symmetrical, but it's left you soft.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa. I know you.<eos> No, you don't.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa. I know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Okay, Romeo.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, thank you for coming to us.<eos> It's my duty, Milord.<eos> Clearly the boy has value to you?<eos> Did you see where he went?<eos> No, I didn't, no.
Man of my imperious...<eos> You ready to sweet talk me?<eos> Statue of Liberty bombing attempt.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Mr. Johnson's not so good about getting it fixed.<eos> I think you need to see a doctor.<eos> I'll be right back. Okay?<eos> You watch over your mother.<eos> I do.
He needs a prime number.<eos> - Something like 607. - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
They're ready to set off any time.<eos> We'll shutting down Rue-Ian's secret laboratory.<eos> No one can get in anymore.<eos> Now, do you believe me?<eos> Now I do.
- I'll be there in a sec.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Have to talk about the Cross-Co. short.<eos> I didn't understand the play when you had me make it.<eos> Now I do.
What is it?<eos> First things first.<eos> Peggy Carter paid me a visit today.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> Well, she did most of the talking.
Well, no, but you see someone else here who can?<eos> What does the machine do?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> A cannon.<eos> Something to do with gamma radiation.
These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside.<eos> They will destroy your life without conscience.<eos> You're wondering if you have a choice.<eos> You don't.
Bitch was crazy.<eos> I remember the pictures you sent me.<eos> You got a big-ass dick.<eos> I'm kinda jealous.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Do we have to do this again? - Yes, we do.<eos> I've lived a life like a man who has pursued peace.<eos> - Have you got that?<eos> - Yes, you're a man who's pursued peace.<eos> Like a ferret does a rabbit.
You want it?<eos> You know, it's a bit ugly, but maybe you'll like it.<eos> It looks good with your beard.<eos> Oh, I like that a lot.<eos> - Huh? - I do, yeah.
Ohh. Actually, can I...<eos> I really need to go to the bathroom, okay?<eos> He doesn't need to go to the bathroom.<eos> - I do need to go to the...<eos> - He doesn't.
It's an intuition thing.<eos> You see this door... It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
Okay, that's true.<eos> But you were like... When I met you, you were like... - You were like...<eos> What's your major?"<eos> I didn't say that all the time.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- That sounds really positive to me.<eos> - I think that'd make you happy, too. - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - No.<eos> - Whoa. You know you just recoiled<eos> - from my touch? - I didn't.
Let me remind you we are an impartial committee, and it's important the views you express here today are yours and yours alone.<eos> I'll ask again...<eos> Do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
I'm not paying that kind of money.<eos> It's like getting stabbed in the tea bag with a butter knife, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, but who knows?<eos> You know, he might still come up with something.<eos> Yeah, what if he doesn't?
Julian: I didn't pull you back in!<eos> Julian, you pulled me back in.<eos> Mr. Lahey!<eos> I've been living a lie, saying that I don't need you.<eos> But I do.
- Oh, shit!<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - I broke the ring pull.<eos> - Don't know your own strength.<eos> No, I don't.
Put in a call to Delsanto.<eos> Lucky, man!<eos> - Just like something...<eos> - Give it again...<eos> Do it again, huh!
You back at the estate?<eos> Yeah, Maimouna...<eos> It's me.<eos> I wanted to tell you I did it.<eos> I did it!
Come back!<eos> It's not safe out there.<eos> Can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.<eos> If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.<eos> He did.
What part of "I won't see you" was unclear?<eos> I respected your wishes for a week, Clarke.<eos> We've got bigger concerns.<eos> "We" don't have any concerns at all.<eos> Yes, we do.
We're on the brink of a war we can't win, and all I can do to stop it is send kids into harm's way.<eos> Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they're not kids anymore.<eos> With Clarke gone, Bellamy's the key.<eos> I've been trying to reach him, but Pike's influence is strong, and he really believes he's doing the right thing.<eos> Everybody always does.
Azgeda cut off Costia's head and delivered it to my bed, and still I let them into my alliance.<eos> I'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty.<eos> I'm sorry, Lexa.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> Yes, you did...
He used to beat us.<eos> Koll saved us.<eos> He took my daughter as his own.<eos> We came back to my home, here, to Herot, but I never knew what he was.<eos> I never did!
Smashing can be a full-time job.<eos> Point is, since there's nothing threatening the world right now,<eos> I'm gonna adjourn the...<eos> - Friday, do we have a gavel?<eos> - You do now.
- Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Everyone does.
You know where we could use her?<eos> We could use her in the graveyard scene with Arya.<eos> - Oh, yeah. That makes sense.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It does.
- He's this guy I think I might be into...<eos> - Do you have butterflies?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I have butterflies, and I have a heart murmur, and I got the Hershey squirts.<eos> - But I thought you liked him.<eos> - I do. I do.
She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> - Cool! - Uh-huh.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
- How's Kia?<eos> - She's good. Very good<eos> When 2 people have a scene in college... and they lose touch... and meet after many years... that moment guys...<eos> is pure sex!<eos> Here! Sex done?
- You talked to CPD? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I had a conversation with his lieutenant, went through all his case files.<eos> There's nothing in there that should've put him anywhere near those Russians.<eos> It doesn't make any sense...<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.
What'd he hire you for?<eos> Well, that's confidential.<eos> I can't find my partner, Patrick Finnegan.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah, whatever you want.<eos> Okay. Then I'll get Crystal to watch him<eos> - and maybe we can go dancing?<eos> - Dancing?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - What we gonna do, Nae Nae?
"I didn't want the big, bad Russians to hurt me."<eos> Well, fuck you!<eos> All these years, I've taken care of you.<eos> I don't know what you want.<eos> What do you...
But life changes things, you change, or... or something.<eos> And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You... You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
Right now I'm doing nothing wrong.<eos> Just waiting for my pizzas to cook.<eos> Nothing illegal about that.<eos> And it's not a lie if you believe it's not happening.<eos> And I do.
I don't know.<eos> This weekend?<eos> Might as well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't...
We're just gonna give up, hope for the best?<eos> Hey, you got any better ideas, Einstein?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want to talk to Jason again.<eos> You already did.
- I asked around.<eos> Look...<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> - No, you don't know anything.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh? Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Uh, I do.
- Good.<eos> - But where are they going?<eos> - Uh, I don't know, Your Majesty.<eos> You said to announce it at once if the outlander arrived.<eos> And, well, he did...
-Howdy, stranger!<eos> -Hey, hey!<eos> Trudy!<eos> -How'd you know I was in the neighborhood?<eos> I didn't.
-Hey, hey!<eos> Trudy!<eos> -How'd you know I was in the neighborhood?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I didn't.
I imagine it pays 'em quite adequately.<eos> Yeah, I suppose it does.<eos> Look, why don't you call whoever you have to call and just tell 'em you're clocking out.<eos> You don't want to bring your NetCar driver to have drinks with your clients.<eos> But I do. I do.
-They're on their way.<eos> -Was in my car.<eos> Was in my car!<eos> Gave me coffee. Had to know it was me.<eos> Maybe didn't.
You've already gotten me in enough trouble.<eos> - My heart bleeds.<eos> - Shut up, all of you.<eos> - Who's got the money?<eos> - I do, some of it.
No. We got tracks right here.<eos> They gotta be in there.<eos> We moving in or what?<eos> How do we know this ain't firecrackers in a trash can?<eos> You don't.
We can help each other.<eos> We're doing fine.<eos> Are you?<eos> We want to generate trade.<eos> Gregory does.
- I'm going with you. - I said stay here.<eos> No.<eos> Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'll come get you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Mitch, just slow down, buddy.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Do what you do.
It hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Did you tell him?<eos> - We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
She was all over the place.<eos> She wouldn't tell me why.<eos> I was just making a point and...<eos> How did you know it was my print?<eos> Oh, I didn't, pet.
Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
Your choice.<eos> Why are you scratching your hand?<eos> Why were you doing that?<eos> I had an itch.<eos> No, you didn't.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> What the hell are you doin', man?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Do you know who that guy is?<eos> Do you?
Leave it with me, I'll see what I can do.<eos> Oh... by the way, when's the big match?<eos> Last night.<eos> Oh... I take it your new opponent won.<eos> No, I did.
Any matter related to Axe Capital is to be handled by the Eastern District from here forward.<eos> You know, the only thing I can't figure is if the AG's fear of negative publicity is because she's planning a Senate run or a return to the private sector.<eos> Put on a blindfold, spin yourself around, and pin the tail on the donkey.<eos> - You know?<eos> - I do.
Fuck you, David.<eos> If you didn't wanna do this, why'd you come?<eos> To get a BJ.<eos> Hey, I've got that department covered.<eos> Oh, do you?
Jasmine, I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> Everything.<eos> You know about me and your mother and who I am.<eos> Yes, yes, sadly I do.
I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
The Grounders were starving us out.<eos> Because you massacred an army that was sent to protect us.<eos> That army could've attacked us at any time, and you know it.<eos> But they didn't attack.<eos> You did that.
How would you feel about assisting me with today's lesson, Mr. Murphy?<eos> Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh? - Yeah.
You're not fuckin' about.<eos> No.<eos> I've done this three times.<eos> Once it worked, twice it didn't.<eos> It didn't?
You will cook and clean.<eos> You do know what we're takin' on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you know the dangers?<eos> I do.
It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Where are Alec and Isabelle?<eos> Being distracting.<eos> You're really not gonna talk to me, are you?<eos> That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
They'd bury it.<eos> Deeper than me.<eos> Or maybe I hold on to that officer, and maybe the government gets the message that they should cut a deal with you or else the arresting officer, your father, will hold a big nasty press conference.<eos> Dad... These people... you don't want to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
You know?<eos> Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.
Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, for sure.
Good.<eos> So, let's talk about what happened to your old bunkmate Jamie Thorne.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Jodie told you where I was.<eos> Oh, my mistake, pet, so she did.
And second, as a gesture of good faith, we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.<eos> You should've done so already.<eos> I need your assurances he'll get a trial.<eos> - What do you care about Igor Milkin?<eos> - I don't.
Thanks for the rush job on this.<eos> Well, you're a friend.<eos> And this is far more interesting than... testing names of anti-depressants for five-year-olds, or... what color cross trainers soccer moms will drool over.<eos> -I thought you hated politics.<eos> -I do.
The IMF wants to help us with the debt relief solution.<eos> Sir?<eos> We need to respond to strength with strength.<eos> Well, I don't know how we could be any stronger, other than to invade Russia.<eos> And what if we do?
Was hoping you would.<eos> Oh, you're doing this wrong.<eos> I mean, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> So, uh... this Blake guy... he has safehouses, what, all over?<eos> All agents do.
Up we go.<eos> In we go.<eos> Dad, can you please tell Sophie to stay out of my room and stop eating myjelly beans?<eos> Soph, stay out of his room.<eos> But I didn't.
Sorry, I don't usually eavesdrop on other people's carts.<eos> It's just...<eos> I'm Sandy, I have two sons.<eos> I already said that.<eos> Yes, you did.
I know that you're in control. Please, give me the courage.<eos> In Jesus' name, amen.<eos> Call to order.<eos> I assume Ms. Wesley understands that this board has the power to recommend any number of disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.<eos> She does.
There are more than 5 minutes awaiting you and your brother.<eos> John chapter 11, verse 25 to 26 says, "I am the resurrection and the life.<eos> "He who believes in me will live even if he dies. "And whoever lives and believes in me will never die."<eos> Do you believe this?<eos> I do.
Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So, you did have a plan.<eos> No, you did.
All these private jets and five-star hotels and endangered-species dinners and... wait, endangered species?<eos> Are you raising money to help them or...<eos> I ate the last dodo.<eos> I want to eat the last something.<eos> Of course you do.
Are you raising money to help them or...<eos> I ate the last dodo.<eos> I want to eat the last something.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Everybody does.
I knew this was too much house.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm two years away from college, so this is more of a "you" problem than a "we" problem.<eos> Well, I've got a "disaster preparedness" folder.<eos> Of course you do.
Day-trading?<eos> That ain't nothing but gambling.<eos> Proud of you, boy.<eos> Just make sure you know what you're doing.<eos> He doesn't.
Good shot, Arban.<eos> We'll be home behind a wall soon.<eos> Then he will be in someone else's safekeeping.<eos> You said you didn't choose this place.<eos> - I didn't.
Kendra isn't a lab experiment.<eos> She's a person.<eos> I know.<eos> You need to have confidence this will work.<eos> Well, I don't.
I'd expect nothing less from the Malick boys.<eos> Gideon, they're saying it's time.<eos> I already told them no, Nate.<eos> We have to go see him.<eos> - Like hell we do.
And then, um, when I get the register open, you guys pull out the gun, and then I give you the money.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> We're lying. We're not. No one has a gun.<eos> We might have a gun.<eos> Nobody does.
Daisy... what did you do?<eos> I've got Malick.<eos> I have to get back to the base.<eos> They have something we need.<eos> Do it.
-What?<eos> -Your mommy!<eos> That old bag hated me for not being one of her polo club friends' daughter!<eos> -My mom didn't think that.<eos> -Yes, she did!
Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
Who told you that Freddie Lau had killed Kayleigh?<eos> Or why else would you have murdered him?<eos> You thought Freddie had taken the life of the woman you loved.<eos> I know Freddie didn't do it.<eos> I did.
Cause... this person killed my mother.<eos> And I want to see him stopped.<eos> It's why I gave you the bracelet.<eos> But you don't know me!<eos> I do!
It's not enough for you to say it, Mr Clayton.<eos> You've given us nothing to make us believe you!<eos> You have to believe me!<eos> [SIGH]<eos> No, I don't, Mr Clayton.
Mr Linton, this is Detective Superintendent Winter.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Did you show Dr Marghai the photos I sent over<eos> - for identification?<eos> - Yes, I did.
They did not.<eos> And this low opinion you suffer of Mr. Hafeez?<eos> He is a bad boy, no respect.<eos> Common, you understand.<eos> Oh, I do.
And why should she not be?<eos> It is a fascinating place.<eos> And do you not think, Mathilda, on what might happen to her, to you?<eos> You of all... you know what happens in Whitechapel!<eos> I do.
You miss this all so much?<eos> - The care was asked of me.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Oh, it doesn't, does it?
This might be our only shot at them!<eos> Why the hell would you hurry while I've been tracking all this down by myself?<eos> I'm withholding evidence that would sink you and you're still sneaking off doing God knows what!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> Damn right, I don't!
Does she handle Analytic Geometry?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And she speaks.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
Mama.<eos> Hi.<eos> HEY-<eos> Oh, please don't tell me I missed someone's birthday.<eos> No, you didn't.
Hey, Sigmund and Sigmunda Freuds!<eos> Anyway, did everyone enjoy the reading assignment?<eos> - Noah's got a little crush. - Really?<eos> You liked it?<eos> I didn't.
I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill? I heard he had kidney stones.<eos> But no health insurance. So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
Gee, I don't know.<eos> Maybe I arranged it all myself, because I hate vacation. Right, Thijs?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm sorry. I believe you.<eos> You do?
No.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
Just get better, eh?<eos> If I'm not truly ill, then how can I get better?<eos> If you're not ill, then what are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Dr. Banning doesn't.
If I'm not truly ill, then how can I get better?<eos> If you're not ill, then what are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Dr. Banning doesn't.<eos> My parents don't.
I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes. But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
Yes. But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!
You know, uh...<eos> They always told me the world down there was no good.<eos> They'd gone and they'd lost everything that made life worth living.<eos> But me and you, we know that ain't all true.<eos> Oh, we do?
Of course, I did, right?<eos> A good job, a real good job, but my heart wasn't in it.<eos> So, I quit to be a comedian, to make people laugh because when they laugh, they feel good.<eos> The thing is...<eos> They didn't.
Walk the other way?<eos> Never meet me, or her?<eos> You've seen what I come from, that dragon that raised me, that land that reared me.<eos> I've known very little grace in my life.<eos> But I did with her.
Tariq!<eos> I didn't take the deal.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop. This care bear is your fucking manager?<eos> - Rainbow brite, here?<eos> - You didn't?
No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?<eos> Well, all my friends and family are dead, except for Oliver Queen, who happens to be dead inside and missing his left arm.<eos> Sara, I have told you...<eos> That this is just a potential future and that it's all gonna go back when we return to 2016... if we return.<eos> But what if we don't?
You learned to fight, didn't you?<eos> Only a little.<eos> You learned more than you think you did, and faster than an ordinary person could.<eos> But that doesn't matter now.<eos> It does.
You can't heal him, can you?<eos> No, but I can take his pain.<eos> It could help.<eos> It might even get him to start healing.<eos> - Then do it.
- Let me see it.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I can scent the suppuration from here, Hasil.<eos> You need medicine.<eos> We all do.
You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.<eos> I do...
Look, I was planning on telling you and Melissa after the election.<eos> But Gil, he, he begged me not to share this.<eos> It would, it would scare off the voters, hijack the platform.<eos> It would be all that anyone would ever ask me about.<eos> So what if they did?
Dad, you may kiss mom.<eos> But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.<eos> It can't be Mona.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.<eos> Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay? If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
Okay, well, maybe now you can invite Mona instead.<eos> Honey, it's the first time in years that you and your friends have all been in the same place.<eos> Yeah, because of a murder investigation<eos> You need this.<eos> All of you do.
So how about you stop wasting both our time?<eos> The Green Arrow told me to have a conversation with you about Darhk. Wow.<eos> I'm surprised, John.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I didn't.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
What is that smell?<eos> Tropical musk candles.<eos> Gosh, the sacrifices you made pretending to be a therapist.<eos> Yeah, I like that scent.<eos> - Of course you do.
We'd very much like to know what you just realized.<eos> Too bad.<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> But you want to, though, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
We've got some seizures just sitting there in evidence.<eos> Could actually get you a supply today if you've got cash.<eos> I always have cash, Malcolm.<eos> You know that.<eos> That I do, Tommy.
Could actually get you a supply today if you've got cash.<eos> I always have cash, Malcolm.<eos> You know that.<eos> That I do, Tommy.<eos> That I do.
Flu's bad for pigs.<eos> But he's better now.<eos> -You have a pig in your truck?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> We all do.
My boss isn't always willing to take the necessary steps to get things done.<eos> You're going rogue?<eos> How fun.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
Everything that you... That you are?<eos> No, you don't really need me.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - No.<eos> I do.
You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
J'onn.<eos> I should have known...<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
Mississippi.<eos> You forgot Mississippi.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> God damn.<eos> I always do that.
They were real women.<eos> Even worse.<eos> Whoa, whoa, slow down.<eos> I lost 90,000? Huh?<eos> I did that?
- Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
The sound when he hit the ground was...<eos> And why didn't you contact the police sooner?<eos> - I was scared.<eos> - We'd think that you pushed him?<eos> - I didn't!
And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
All I gotta do is convince the one guy who always watches me to go inside and party with the others.<eos> Then there's ten minutes before I drive the day shift up.<eos> Ten minutes for Alonso to grab that shit from the wheel well.<eos> Shit.<eos> -What? Do it!
And why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does...
- Reason?<eos> - I don't have to give you...<eos> Jan is looking for the real name of an informant, alias Bella Tuerlings.<eos> And why didn't Jan submit an official request?<eos> I did.
I really want to learn Kung Fu of the Iron Kick.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't deserve it?<eos> And Wu does?
The first year, I made $53.<eos> I had to send half of that to my ex-wife.<eos> You were married?<eos> I told you that.<eos> No, you didn't.
I think you like me as much as I like you.<eos> I do like you.<eos> But?<eos> I didn't say "but."<eos> Yeah, you did.
What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
Nothing is.<eos> Jude.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
Business good?<eos> Yeah that's Good. No no no Hold on to that.<eos> ...I did a register on the weekend...<eos> - How your mama feeling now?<eos> - She doing good, she doing excellent.
Nah..<eos> You could be gay, but you got everybody call you a faggot.<eos> What I mean is...<eos> - How do I know?<eos> - You just do.
Long time no see Right?<eos> and I asked Teresa for your number and...<eos> Hold on man!<eos> You... you do remember me, Right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Um, I'll be back Friday.<eos> - This can't be my life.<eos> Jules, it can't be.<eos> - I wanted to see the fireworks.<eos> I really did.
Girl, what is wrong with you?<eos> I think you're in a position to become the spokesperson the foster community has been waiting for.<eos> So, you're flunking out, huh?<eos> Yeah, I can't go back unless I want to keep taking steroids,<eos> - and I don't.
I need to meet someone new.<eos> I need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
-What are you doing here?<eos> -I'm sorry. I was just... resting here.<eos> All night.<eos> You told him.<eos> I did. I did.
He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
-So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.<eos> Why- - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
This isn't that.<eos> I'm right and he's wrong.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You won the argument.<eos> You always do.
Robert kicked him out and Paddy showed up at my place.<eos> So you're trying to get away from Paddy?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I don't want to feel sorry for him.<eos> But you do.
That, you've never seen me beyond this, big brother thing.<eos> - Cause Gordon, you're my best friend.<eos> You think best friends make the best lovers?<eos> - Where the fuck's Claire?<eos> - You fuck, you didn't just do that to me.
Creative differences.<eos> Really?<eos> And how's, uh, Ricky's check cashing con paying off for you?<eos> Because no one asked you to skip town to Pittsburgh for some Greaseball shithead.<eos> Yeah, well, he did.
It's just that... no.<eos> No, I just want to get out of here for a minute. Get some sunshine.<eos> -Dude. -Come on.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
We arrive to inspect the body.<eos> There is no evidence of the killer making their escape, but, then again, they could've left by another route.<eos> Good morning, everybody!<eos> Ah, JP!<eos> - How you doing, Chief?
Oh, yes.<eos> And it's so nice to hear the old stories about you, Inspector.<eos> What stories would these be?<eos> Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.<eos> I... I don't.
What stories would these be?<eos> Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.<eos> I... I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, Humphrey, you remember.<eos> I don't!
I always knew it wouldn't last.<eos> Did Robert have the other half of that?<eos> - What?<eos> - The pendant?<eos> No, no... my mum does.
He knows who you are.<eos> Show him who you can be.<eos> I've seen that person.<eos> I think Duval should see him, too.<eos> You done?
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.<eos> And when he asked for your help, what did you do?<eos> Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here.<eos> Does my dad know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
No irregularities whatsoever.<eos> Absolutely nothing to worry about.<eos> - See.<eos> - You want to know the sex?<eos> - Yes, I do.
'Cause we'd be more than happy to... contribute.<eos> - Kermit! - Huh?<eos> - Oh! - Denise!<eos> Uh... oh, no. I missed your 5k run!<eos> - No, no, yes, you did!
Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
Cheers, mon capitán!<eos> I think we'd all like to see more of you on the show.<eos> - Aw. - And the rest of you, too.<eos> If I knew your names, I'd praise you all individually.<eos> But since I don't, cheers!
Stop!<eos> Number '9', congratulations!<eos> You have an announcement to make?<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.
You have an announcement to make?<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.
Feel better.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hey, hey, hold up a minute.<eos> I got somewhere to be.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It's religious music from the Solomon Islands.<eos> Oh, so you're selling out.<eos> Why Melanesian choirs?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I got you some Kombucha.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Man, I thought you liked this shit.<eos> - No, I do.
- He's not my uncle.<eos> - It's a figure of speech.<eos> We've got an excellent product.<eos> We don't have to do that.<eos> Uh, yes, we do.
You know?<eos> And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Ooh. Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
'Keisha, it's our shop.<eos> And it ain't exactly on the Upper East Side.<eos> I was protecting us.<eos> You know how to use that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No one else here, but a neighbour just showed up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Hey, did you see that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Please, have a seat.<eos> We want to be inclusive.<eos> We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.<eos> We have major support on both sides of the aisle.<eos> Well, you do for now, but not for long.
Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why was he working for you?<eos> And ask him the names of all of his conspirators, everyone who intrigued with him?<eos> Do this, and I will spare his life.<eos> Of course... we already know you were involved.<eos> Do you?
Yeah, you must be Tom.<eos> He said you had arms as big as cannonballs.<eos> Say you were smarter than Jeff Davis' own engineers.<eos> He said you were the hunger in his heart.<eos> He did.
Jonah, what is happening?<eos> Do you own one of each of us?<eos> No!<eos> I went to a bunch of different stores over lunch, and then I just happened to pass this in the window of a sex shop, and look, it looks just like Amy. All: Whoa!<eos> - Yeah, it does. - Ew!
-Yeah.<eos> -Unless, in the name of mercy, you could untie the bindings.<eos> I'd still be in your medieval straightjacket, but at least I'd have some degree of control over the movement of my arms.<eos> Hey, maybe you don't get it.<eos> Or maybe your bosses don't.
That's all right, then?<eos> You're smoking?<eos> Since When?<eos> We never saw you smoke.<eos> I didn't, in front of you.
You're a crap father.<eos> You pretend to care about us but all you do is yell at us.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> I didn't yell at you.<eos> I never do.
I think I can help you with that.<eos> But first, you up for hitting Omar's tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just need to go home and take a quick shower.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You know... when I went back to Robert after you... I just shut down.<eos> After he left, I tried dating someone, but... he wasn't you.<eos> God, I wish things were different.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
OK?<eos> Can we save the detective act for the morning?<eos> Please?<eos> I'm sorry. Did you have a bad day?<eos> In an endless stream of them, yeah, I did.
Yeah.<eos> She's... she's fine.<eos> She's good.<eos> I gave her your keychain of hopes and dreams.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Food drop failed, so they're bringing in the big guns before they try another one.<eos> But it failed because of her.<eos> I mean, she rushed the timeline.<eos> You really think that matters?<eos> You really do.
No badge, no warrant, nothing.<eos> He's my guy.<eos> Do you really want to know what that entails?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
We won't know for a little while.<eos> Do you think it will?<eos> I want it to.<eos> Do you have a mom?<eos> I did.
We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.
The fact that you're here, that you stayed behind... speaks volumes about your character.<eos> Kate always gave me a hard time when I thought about giving up.<eos> She always saw me as... more of hero than I saw myself.<eos> She had a way of seeing the good in people.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's not about what I think.<eos> People can --<eos> They can try and set you in the right direction, but they can't show you the way.<eos> You know, you got to find that for yourself, and... I thought I had it.<eos> I did.
I ain't ever gonna kneel.<eos> Yeah, I said that, too.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> See that's the thing, man.<eos> You don't.
We put aside half the supplies.<eos> No, Rick.<eos> No.<eos> You don't decide what we take.<eos> I do.
I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.
It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.<eos> She didn't answer the question.<eos> I didn't?
You had to.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Whatever helps you sleep at night.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't you even want to know if you got in? Uh... Nope, didn't get in.<eos> Come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.<eos> Honestly, I didn't.
Don't you even want to know if you got in? Uh... Nope, didn't get in.<eos> Come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.<eos> Honestly, I didn't.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> You really didn't.
We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
A "G" and a nerd sharing a room.<eos> It's like "The Odd Couple" up in here.<eos> Rule 3... you may only use references I understand.<eos> - It doesn't say that.<eos> - It does.
What's going on?<eos> Emery!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's not what it looks like. This is your romantic date?<eos> Doing your taxes?
The crowd is cheering,<eos> Lenny's taking bows...<eos> Two minutes later, Frank comes stumbling out, covered in soot, helping this old man in his underwear.<eos> Now, nobody wants to see a picture of an old man in his underwear with a cop holding him.<eos> Well, maybe now they do, but...
Eddie!<eos> Jamie, we got him!<eos> We got Jeffers!<eos> I don't care.<eos> Don't ever do that again.
Well, for the trip back...<eos> - Or if there is a problem.<eos> Not for today or tomorrow, but...<eos> Then we have one extra oxygen.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I'm not phobic, but get your hands off my butt.<eos> I might as well carry these all the way up.<eos> Patte, did you notice?<eos> The cave collapsed.<eos> Yes, I did.
- $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Hi dad!<eos> Hey, happy birthday, kiddo!<eos> Thanks!<eos> Did you get the birthday present I shipped?<eos> No, I didn't.
Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
Okay, I reconsider cutting this short, since we know you're a paid informant for the FBI.<eos> You told Agent Lange you have no connection to Heavy.<eos> But... she doesn't know that your boy, THX, helped him kill Retro Girl.<eos> - She doesn't know?<eos> - No, she does not.
I'm ready.<eos> What I'm about to say, I'm not sure you're ready.<eos> Ready to go in five... four...<eos> Come on, Trip, I don't need this shit.<eos> Yes, you do.
It could only be someone 100% loyal to her.<eos> Someone like you, Ellery.<eos> It was you who sent the letter, wasn't it?<eos> - You knew somebody was trying to kill Caroline?<eos> - He did.
How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.
Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.<eos> You have all the time in the universe... - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.
Barry, look at yourself right now; you're not okay.<eos> Cisco, my dad was just killed in front of me!<eos> Do you have any idea how that feels?<eos> Watching someone you love die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Because it didn't match Hame's account of the ambush?<eos> And this bullet is a different caliber than the shooter's.<eos> .32 steel jacket. It's enough to ricochet off concrete.<eos> So you think whoever shot our Vic in the throat also hit him in the leg?<eos> Yes, I do.
What if someone already rented the episodes they want?<eos> They can just get something else, like The Illusionist or The Prestige.<eos> - Whichever one you were in.<eos> - Do you know which one?<eos> - Do you?
I've wasted too much time waiting for things to happen.<eos> And I'm not gonna wait anymore.<eos> And for what it's worth, I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah. Everybody did.
But with each Polymorph we eliminate, sir, part of the Cat's personality will return.<eos> Hey, buds, I need a hand here.<eos> I'm busted up really bad.<eos> - How did you know that wasn't the Cat?<eos> - I didn't.
Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
To my son's mother.<eos> So I know what it costs.<eos> It cost a part of me.<eos> How do I get that part back?<eos> You don't.
Maybe you could see him.<eos> He's just so frail.<eos> Can't even stay angry at him anymore.<eos> If you were here, Iknowyou'dknow exactlywhatto do .<eos> ButI don't. Idon'tknowwhattodo .
When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards, I was sure it was you. I was wrong.<eos> I really tried to become a better person. To show that I was trying to listen. So, when you held the assembly that women were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?<eos> Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina,<eos> Do you miss your friends? I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.<eos> You do now. Cool.
I can bring Travis back.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
- He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that-<eos> - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
Are you serious?<eos> I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this?<eos> - In the front, Richard.<eos> - Laurie, did you know about this?<eos> - I did not.
But the platform will take way longer to launch than that.<eos> Yes.<eos> So we are effectively a $250 million company who just took $5 million in funding and now we're dead-ass broke.<eos> Our burn rate is astronomical, and every day we sit in limbo like this...<eos> What if we don't?
- When's the last time that happened? - It hasn't.<eos> - Can I help you with anything else?<eos> - Get me a date for tonight. Make that three dates.<eos> Who knows when I'll get another night off?<eos> I do.
What do you want?<eos> We want your help.<eos> We need it.<eos> - We have nothing to offer.<eos> - You do.
And in this moment as I was beaten by the living, I was bitten by the dead.<eos> A hand found me and I saw Luciana.<eos> She brought me back here.<eos> We waited for death to come.<eos> - But it didn't?
Took me a year to work up the courage to talk to her.<eos> Just to speak.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> No, you don't.
-No, BoJack.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> You control every part of my life, I don't know anything about you.<eos> [scoffs] -You don't want to know me, BoJack.<eos> -No, I do.
We still have one day to go all out.<eos> Rutabaga, do you think we have the spunk and moxie--<eos> That's a good name for a lady detective series.<eos> --required to pull this off and save the agency?<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
Oh, you get it?<eos> What is it that you get?<eos> What you're trying to teach me.<eos> I mean, you don't even like James.<eos> No, I don't, son.
There's something I didn't say last night.<eos> Something I need you to understand.<eos> You don't need to say anything.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You're petrified.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Tell her.<eos> You want to do this?<eos> No, I don't.
Bradley Cooper?<eos> We love him for some reason.<eos> -Where?<eos> -Let's go, Todd.<eos> -Oh, God, what do we do?
I wasn't actually shot.<eos> My injuries were powder burns.<eos> No nightmares?<eos> No flashbacks?<eos> Yeah, I do.
[chuckles] I'm tempted to send that girl's family my legal bill.<eos> So I assume this will be the last we hear of the matter, counselor?<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Rita, we have a problem.<eos> No, we don't.
How far did you go?<eos> I put my fingers inside her.<eos> I couldn't have done anything else even if we both wanted to, because I finished early.<eos> Did you have sex with Abby Stewart?<eos> No, I did not.
I was passing by and thought I'd come over to ask you to solve this apartment situation.<eos> It's hurting so many people.<eos> Dad made the deal 6 years ago, he died and so far, nothing.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Today's your birthday!<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You know you can always count on me?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Ms. Clara!<eos> I don't know if you remember us, ma'am.<eos> I do.
I have only one question.<eos> Paul Lefebvre isn't his real name.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> Did he ever tell you his real name?<eos> No, he never did.
He went to Mystic Falls.<eos> Damon's gotten himself into some trouble with Julian.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, I-I told him he didn't have to worry, that I would stay here and look after you.<eos> Yeah, of course you did.
Well, Rayna's dead.<eos> Julian's safe.<eos> You'll surely sleep easy tonight. ♪ Should I go somewhere else ♪ ♪ And hide my face?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> And what if I did?
There are no princesses and no monsters, only humans... their flesh and bones and all too broken hearts.<eos> I am fond of you because you are real.<eos> And I can not find anything hidden or broken about you.<eos> You must be fond of me because I, too, am real. Do you see?<eos> I do.
Ay... _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Trust me, I know how difficult this is.<eos> You don't.
I kind of take care of myself.<eos> I did, until Billy came along.<eos> Maybe we should just run.<eos> You don't think he can track you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I really don't like this woman-on... look at me.<eos> I really don't like this woman-on-woman aggression.<eos> Like, instead of cutting each other down, we should be building each other up.<eos> Like Kayla... you, for instance, have a real air of gravitas.<eos> I do not.
No, I'm good.<eos> Chili, I'm trying to talk to you.<eos> About what?<eos> That woman almost died today.<eos> Yeah, but she didn't.
Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
I should have known that.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> What you doing? Putting stuff away.<eos> Emily asked me to help out, so, uh...<eos> Emily did? Mm-hmm.
Before church...<eos> Nope. No, I-I didn't see him.<eos> It's the darndest thing.<eos> Actually, you did see him.<eos> I did?
Jesse?<eos> You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You did.
! I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
Come on, we don't fight.<eos> We're above that.<eos> Yeah. Try being here.<eos> - Okay. I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
You know what might make us good is you jumping in this lake.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to jump in the lake?<eos> - Yeah, I kind of do. - Okay.
It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
I'm deadly serious.<eos> You ever miss life on the road?<eos> Nah. Nah, I had my fun.<eos> You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.
Research.<eos> Roy asked me to do an article on... castles.<eos> In a wig? Castles?<eos> I thought you said you had a family crisis.<eos> I do. I-I did.
Morning, Agatha.<eos> Morning.<eos> What time is James' flight?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Either way, you're unfaithful.<eos> No doubt you have some twisted Brahman justification to explain it away.<eos> He does.
Wait a minute.<eos> They lost us when we went in that cave, right?<eos> And they found you two when you went outside with the rubies.<eos> We never even had a chance, then.<eos> We don't.
The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> - Jodi: Yeah, they do.
No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
Not at all.<eos> Generally, we're better at queens than kings.<eos> In this country I have a feeling you'll be no exception.<eos> - I certainly intend to do it well.<eos> - I did, too.
The home of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom is Buckingham Palace.<eos> Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.
Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
It won't last.<eos> I know.<eos> But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
We went into the basement.<eos> There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.<eos> (squealing softly): Oh, my God.<eos> And you like him.<eos> No. No, I don't.
You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
I remembered this morning but now my god, it's the day after tomorrow.<eos> I have so many cupcakes to make.<eos> Oh my.<eos> You don't like your pie?<eos> No, I do.
It's time.<eos> Thanksgiving has always meant sharing the bounty of our rich land, especially turkey. But the one thing we will not be sharing this holiday is Drumstick or Cranberry.<eos> Catherine actually personally chose those names, didn't you, honey?<eos> - Um, yes, I did.
- Dad!<eos> - Sam! What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse.<eos> Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
We use force to take what we want!<eos> So we'll be taking our friend back now!<eos> TESORO!<eos> Luffy!<eos> You did it, Luffy!
Sue, don't worry about it.<eos> It'll be an even bigger surprise when she sees you're there.<eos> Just leave it that you're not coming home.<eos> So I should tell her I'm not coming home?<eos> You already did that.
I'm am esthetician by trade.<eos> - No shit. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And you got a nice face.<eos> - Please.<eos> - You do.
Great.<eos> Now fill up the water and gelatin mix in the drum with the proportions that I gave you.<eos> The kaolin clay from the glass polishing kits acts quickly as a bonding agent.<eos> Now, Happy, where do you keep that D-12 refrigerant hidden?<eos> Um, I don't.
It's called a silent heart attack, and it comes with very little warning.<eos> I know what a silent heart attack is!<eos> I know!<eos> But that doesn't mean anything to her family<eos> And that doesn't do anything for me!
- No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
Well, can I just say one more time, for the record... I think we should start fast, and run at a good clip.<eos> - Noted.<eos> - I am right sometimes, you know.<eos> Even you said yourself that I have good instincts.<eos> You do.
A bit of a Heathcliff.<eos> He wants total control.<eos> Well, any artist worth anything would insist on that.<eos> - You don't really want a flatterer.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yes.<eos> Part of the furniture.<eos> Well, as long as you don't sit on him anytime soon.<eos> - Well, that all seemed to go well.<eos> - Yes, it did, didn't it?
Um, I'm sorry. What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Um, you asked me if I was seeing anybody.<eos> Y-Yes, but you don't have to answer me.<eos> Y-You really don't.
For fancy company.<eos> Well, with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress,<eos> I bet you'd look real pretty in it.<eos> You got a wife Mr. Clay?<eos> Yes, I do.
Dad will be heart-broken, Kaveri.<eos> And what about my heart.<eos> - Does anyone care if that shatters?<eos> - Of course we do.<eos> I do.
I can spot a fake body part a mile away.<eos> - Like his mustache?<eos> - And your nose.<eos> - I had a deviated septum.<eos> - We all did, sweetheart.
Well, I'd like to do a full workup before discharging her.<eos> See if we can find what caused those spasms.<eos> Could take a couple of hours.<eos> You guys okay with that?<eos> Do what you do.
Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay, if you could rewire it, you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this... into a low power mono FM transmitter that produces a signal that you can trace.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
I talked to my abuela, a ghost expert.<eos> She ain't afraid of no ghost.<eos> And she said that our ghost is clearly a local haunting.<eos> A local haunting... that makes sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
She ain't afraid of no ghost.<eos> And she said that our ghost is clearly a local haunting.<eos> A local haunting... that makes sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.<eos> - Yes, it does.
So given that Steve and Danny traveled all this way, I've agreed to sign off on their therapy hours once they've completed the course.<eos> I should also tell you that I've spoken with Steve and Danny about their partnership, and it is fraught with some very serious problems.<eos> So I think it would be both cruel and irresponsible for us to abandon them in this time of crisis.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't.
She's... resting.<eos> Sure.<eos> Looks like something tropical's blowing in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I was... just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You...<eos> You don't?
- I know that too.<eos> - So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> - They do?
She changed his fuckin' diapers.<eos> You know that we had to pay for a live-in nurse at the end?<eos> We're in something of a hole. Here at the moment.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't?
But... You're a famous author.<eos> And you've been to prison.<eos> Sir thomas malory wrote le morte d'arthur. When he was prison.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Looks like home.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> So do you have any experience in the dental field?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't.
You must.<eos> He's all I have.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You've got me.<eos> I do?
His vitals are good.<eos> Give him glucose and painkillers through an IV drip.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you know how?<eos> I do.
I'm sure.<eos> Where you go...<eos> People walking away from me!<eos> You know the FBI?<eos> Jody does.
Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> 50/50.<eos> Malcolm, listen to me.<eos> - I don't need this.<eos> - Yes, you do.
What'd I do?<eos> 'Cause I don't remember doing anything bad.<eos> You shoot these photos?<eos> Ah, Summer Blake.<eos> Yeah, I did.
What's goin' on?<eos> I went to a party, um, in Vegas.<eos> Private jet.<eos> I just got back.<eos> I did too much... too much shit.
Okay.<eos> So, Brittany, get an IT guy to blow these images up, and then all three of you go through this list, and find somebody that knows what this shit is.<eos> You don't think the video would be enough?<eos> With this judge?<eos> No, I don't.
There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
He's not in.<eos> Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed.<eos> Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.
He was just looking for Denise or something.<eos> Thank God she was on a school trip.<eos> The look on his face was priceless.<eos> You really enjoyed that, didn't you?<eos> Yeah. I did.
Yeah.<eos> You're the reason.<eos> Yeah, well, when the vein comes out, the hand comes out, remember?<eos> Remember the last time your hand came out?<eos> I did this.
We couldn't very well just stick her in a cell.<eos> Mom.<eos> Who owns the drugs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm fine.<eos> You know, your mom's just upset, because she's scared about what's gonna happen.<eos> She's not the only one.<eos> She doesn't think that you own the drugs, Nicky, but she thinks you know which one of the kids does.<eos> Do you?
- What's going on with them?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> What's that?<eos> You want to hear how we spent our evening?<eos> - No, he really doesn't.
- Don't ask.<eos> What's that?<eos> You want to hear how we spent our evening?<eos> - No, he really doesn't.<eos> - No, I don't.
No, I am actually ready to stand next to you and fight.<eos> Sounds like you found your manhood, Richard.<eos> Bobby found it...<eos> A bunch of times, if you know what I'm saying, huh?<eos> Unfortunately, I do. Ow.
It must be if you're having slumber parties.<eos> His buddy dropped him off here.<eos> Evan tied one on, and he's crashing here, so that he doesn't have to face Mom until he's sobered up.<eos> And you know he's allergic to pet dander, so...<eos> - Oh, I didn't, actually.
Put down that cat.<eos> Wha...<eos> Richard, you're... You're alive?<eos> You didn't go to war?<eos> No, I did.
Show-off.<eos> Yeah, this could get ugly. We should go.<eos> ♪ Do you, your highness, take this male model ♪<eos> - ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - I do.
- ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - I do.<eos> ♪ Do you, good sir, take your social superior ♪<eos> - ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - Yes. I do.
No one ever died because Donald fucked them.<eos> And don't kid yourself.<eos> Lucy knows exactly what she's doing.<eos> You know who I really hate, though, right?<eos> - You do.
We had a lot of stuff in there...<eos> Um, newspapers... pictures of the family, coins, stamps, some predictions.<eos> Father Anan came over last night.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
Do you know... that if you cut a worm in half, both sides stay alive?<eos> Jack.<eos> Let me talk to your Uncle Garrett for a minute, okay?<eos> You said you'd never come back.<eos> I did.
That would be my understanding.<eos> On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?<eos> Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.<eos> I hope that you can accept my apology.<eos> Of course I do.
No.<eos> And you hate him too, so why do you even care?<eos> Riq, come here.<eos> I do not hate your father.<eos> Yes, you do.
Those who see blue rats are always right.<eos> I've given 30 years to the company.<eos> And I've been unfailingly loyal.<eos> I really believed in it.<eos> And I still do.
- There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made,<eos> - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
Love?<eos> Right.<eos> He's my current husband.<eos> I love him now.<eos> I do.
- What?<eos> - You hated me.<eos> - Horace, you thought I hated you before we broke up?<eos> I didn't hate you.<eos> I didn't.
Listen to her.<eos> She doesn't think you deserve to be happy.<eos> Look at this office.<eos> Look at this town. This all belonged to her when you had nothing, remember?<eos> Of course I do!
Emma did exactly what she needed to.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I do.
So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.<eos> Because something did.
Like, they get drunk and they do something stupid.<eos> We've done that story a bunch of times.<eos> Different takes on it.<eos> I thought you knew our site.<eos> Oh, I do.
I made a mistake there with you, and I'm sorry for that.<eos> All rise.<eos> The Honorable Judge Richard Cuesta presiding.<eos> So I understand we have a plea deal.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
- Okay.<eos> - Dudes, you want to step in here?<eos> - No.<eos> - Not really.<eos> I don't.
Agent Brody Nelson.<eos> Sound good, don't it?<eos> It does, it does.<eos> I know.<eos> Yes, it does.
We wouldn't stay another night in this dump if you begged us.<eos> Come on, Quill.<eos> Ah, here's the thing.<eos> Um, I didn't get banished.<eos> You guys did.
But, of course, I went anyway.<eos> And I found it too.<eos> You found the Cosmic Seed?<eos> But you told them you didn't have it.<eos> And I don't. Not anymore.
They shoved a mic in my face.<eos> You know, if you were a work of art... and I'm not saying you aren't... you would be a study in...<eos> Oh, please, don't try to define me, okay?<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> - No, but I do.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.<eos> Rafiq, go check.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Do you know everything?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I'm an adult. I don't need to be on my step-daddy's insurance.<eos> You know, actually, I think that's great.<eos> I think it's great that y-you want to be independent, Norman.<eos> I think that shows character.<eos> Oh, really? Do you, Alex?
"Hey, guess who isn't married to Dan Logan."<eos> She thinks I don't know where they're coming from.<eos> Like a person could actually just, in the course of their normal life, bump into that many people who make balloon animals.<eos> You know what the ironic thing is?<eos> Do you?
It's... It's not like Bill not to fight.<eos> A witness was gonna come forward.<eos> Things were gonna be said that would've been bad for Bill, bad for Virginia, and... and it would have been entirely embarrassing to you.<eos> Well, I do want to put all of that behind me.<eos> So does your husband.
We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
Good job.<eos> That's raw, Dad.<eos> This bad boy's done.<eos> Damn! That looks damn good!<eos> We done?
"This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - Yes, she did.
This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
Because he thought the real target would be there.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> You two watch the lobby. And you make sure that Mr. Rauf makes it back to the Palace Hotel without incident, okay?<eos> - I know that name.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
- We should probably get the element of surprise.<eos> - Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, right?<eos> I'm just saying it's not exactly Ocean's Eleven in there.<eos> Hey, could you get this guy out of here?<eos> Sorry, I didn't...
Seo-yeon?<eos> She's a fantastic sous chef.<eos> Where're you from?<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
"Sort of"?<eos> I'm not entirely sorry because it's not entirely my fault.<eos> You're entirely a jackass.<eos> I thought you wanted your restaurant to succeed!<eos> Of course, I do!
I know I've put a heavy burden on you, but I have faith that the D.A.'s office will do the right thing.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Please, this has to end.<eos> I want to spare these girls any more exploitation.<eos> We all do.
- Yeah. - He had a fake ID, but his real name is Anthony Talamonti.<eos> Oh, my God, it's Tony.<eos> - Seattle Tony?<eos> - You know this guy?<eos> Yeah, she does.
- I mean Jason.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh... unclear.<eos> I told them I had new information about the Abbies.<eos> Do you?
Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
It could be hours.<eos> But whatever it is, I'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge.<eos> So what I need to know is where you stand.<eos> I don't matter.<eos> No you don't.
There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon; you know this.<eos> I've had lives in my hands.<eos> Held a human heart, beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
I need more practice.<eos> That's dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Because I don't wanna be friends.<eos> When I think about what I wanna do most in this world... it's you.<eos> Oh God, that sounded so much more romantic in my head.<eos> Just jump in any time, Nicole, because I really, really don't know how to do this.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
I'll remember him to my dying day.<eos> Then you must also know that your sister's eldest child was his child, too.<eos> - But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.
Anna came to me in prison before she went to Australia and told me that child was dead.<eos> Your sister wished to sever any connection between her daughter and you, or anyone else so that the girl could grow up in peace and no-one know her true identity.<eos> But now I would not have you make her your heir unintentionally, so... I thought it right to tell you.<eos> Do you see her?<eos> I do.
What are you do... stop.<eos> Oh, here's the lock.<eos> You just need to wiggle your tiny little spaghetti fingers in there, and wiggle it free.<eos> Okay, I don't have tiny spaghetti fingers, all right?<eos> - Yes, you do.
Oh, here's the lock.<eos> You just need to wiggle your tiny little spaghetti fingers in there, and wiggle it free.<eos> Okay, I don't have tiny spaghetti fingers, all right?<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't.
Okay, I don't have tiny spaghetti fingers, all right?<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> I don't got a tiny spaghetti dick either.<eos> You do.
- I've seen it dozens of times.<eos> - Not hard.<eos> I'll just take one of your bobby pins.<eos> - I don't have bobby pins.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Anyway, besides, it's your turn.<eos> Can't you just call your little pretty friend?<eos> Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.<eos> She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.<eos> Yeah, dude, she does.
Is he badly hurt?<eos> We don't know right now.<eos> we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here.<eos> Claire needs some medical things -- she thought you might have some for the animals.<eos> Of course I do.
And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
You will wear this costume, and you will keep this mask on at all times.<eos> - Is this a Jason costume?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> With you in this costume, it'll be easy to keep a eye on you, 'cause nobody wants to be Jason on Halloween.<eos> Yes, they do.
For assaulting me with silver!<eos> And... probably being in cahoots with Denise Hemphill in murdering Chad and a whole bunch of other people with his serial killer hand!<eos> MUNSCH: Chanel, look, I know you are feeling a tad blue right now, but Dr. Brock Holt did not murder Chad.<eos> He has an airtight alibi.<eos> He does?
It's late.<eos> We are raw from travel.<eos> Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?<eos> I do have a proposition for you.<eos> You yankees always do.
Something of that kind.<eos> The estate is a fine one.<eos> There is no risk.<eos> - What if I need the money?<eos> - But you don't.
Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
Only this.<eos> Please tell Miss Thorne that I hope I did not offend her.<eos> She thought me a buffoon.<eos> I'm sure she did not.<eos> No, she did.
Please tell Miss Thorne that I hope I did not offend her.<eos> She thought me a buffoon.<eos> I'm sure she did not.<eos> No, she did.<eos> She did.
I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
She's had her run here.<eos> She was your dad's pleasure chest, and then my dad honored him by keeping her here.<eos> But, yeah, I mean, we don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, we don't owe you anything, Marsha.<eos> Nobody does.
- How are you, um...?<eos> I mean, are you still working?<eos> Did you go back to work?<eos> - No, Horace, I got laid off in April.<eos> - You did?
Three girls? !<eos> What? !<eos> Jodi Albertson, Kim Murphy.<eos> - They died from the same batch of...<eos> - No, they did not!
Your wine is that important to me, T.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> - All right, fine.<eos> - Look, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do...
Is it not to you?<eos> Now, then...<eos> I have thought long and hard about this issue, and based on what I have heard, I find there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the espionage charge; therefore, Mr. Dellinger's extradition is hereby approved.<eos> Ma'am, we have one more motion to be considered.<eos> We do?
The 6 adults and 2 children under 10 shot to death by the defendant were human in every sense of the word<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Claiming your victims were unworthy of life because they were minorities is not a defense, Mr. Darnell.<eos> Make your point, if you have one.<eos> I do.
Yes, I recorded all our sessions.<eos> And do you remember where those recordings are?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, do you want me to tell you where to find them?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay.<eos> I'll read Jordan Graff.<eos> Who is he? He is someone who is helping us regain our fatherland.<eos> Do you know this Jordan Graff, personally?<eos> Yes, I do, very well.
Yeah, and pretty soon, he's probably going to succeed, and then where will we be, Number Five?<eos> It's time to start taking desperate measures.<eos> We need to start interviewing patients.<eos> Why do you think you'd make a good Chanel?<eos> Um, I don't, actually.
- Yeah?<eos> Ignore all of them.<eos> I think you are being very brave.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
This bitch was caught escaping and I know there is an accomplice in here.<eos> Right?<eos> So tonight. Until I find the accomplice. I'm gonna have some fun with all of you.<eos> You. Did you know that bitch was escaping?<eos> No I didn't.
You. Did you know that bitch was escaping?<eos> No I didn't.<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> You?<eos> I didn't, please I really didn't.
Yeah, this is us.<eos> -We've got to make up some ground.<eos> It's a little faster than a walk.<eos> (BOTH COUNT) You want to say 12 or 13?<eos> Just do 212.
But they don't do it all at once.<eos> They do it one nut at a time.<eos> Everyone has their part to play, so everyone just needs to handle their own nut.<eos> We do that, we get all the nuts. - Makes sense.<eos> - Does it, though?
- That wasn't flirting.<eos> I mean, I know what flirting looks like.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> All right.<eos> How we doing with the harvest?
We don't have time!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Okay. So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
That they were backed into a corner and they didn't have a choice.<eos> The only difference with Warren is whether or not you think he's lying, whether you believe he didn't see that door open.<eos> And do you think he was lying?<eos> - No.<eos> - We don't.
What am I supposed to learn from this?<eos> Do you feel even the slightest remorse?<eos> Yes. Yes!<eos> H-How can you ask me that?<eos> Of course I do!
You made an astonishing error in judgment that I'm trying to accept and forgive.<eos> And it's gonna take me a lot longer than six months.<eos> All bleeding must stop.<eos> Well, I am sorry I disappoint you.<eos> Sometimes it does so at a cost.
Um, I'm still confused.<eos> Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious. Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.
Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious. Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.<eos> We do.
Edwards, what if we did a balloon catheter?<eos> Robbins was in there.<eos> I saw her.<eos> You saw her?<eos> I did.
Tell me what happened to Mary.<eos> You were there.<eos> He wrenched from her all the powers he had granted her, as if he was turning her inside out.<eos> I do not know how she survived it.<eos> But she did?
Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did. - Oh.
So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?<eos> He's got us by the balls, Harvey.<eos> If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through the other night even for?<eos> Which means right now, we just have to figure out how much we're willing to pay.<eos> No, we don't.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Right initials, wrong fella.<eos> Robert,<eos> - you don't want to do this.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
He's a young kid, he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> Now be honest, you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did. That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
Right?<eos> Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
- Who?<eos> Ghost Rider.<eos> You must not be from around here.<eos> Do you know where I can find him?<eos> Nobody does.
Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.<eos> Do you mind if we go inside to talk?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> I do, actually.
Rumplestiltskin, what's going on?<eos> This, uh... this isn't like you.<eos> I have a ball to attend to later, and I'm a bit rusty. Will you help me practice?<eos> I... wasn't aware that I had any choices here.<eos> You do.
I love all of those ideas, but I just became captain, and you have your P.I. business.<eos> And then there's LokSat.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We have responsibilities, right?<eos> But what if we didn't?
When is a man not a man?<eos> When his life-force cannot be extinguished, when he cannot die.<eos> Then he is a god.<eos> I think he senses your powers.<eos> Yeah? You do?
I'm more judgmental about my daughter's Christianity than yours. Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And this case wouldn't even be considered<eos> - unless there was an ulterior motive.<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - That has nothing to do with this case.<eos> - But it does, Your Honor.
Is this about Jason?<eos> Wait, who's Jason?<eos> Her investigator.<eos> - You have an investigator?<eos> - Well, her firm does.
- No.<eos> But don't you have reason to be angry with the Florricks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
They'll hire the great John Alden to ransom us."<eos> She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> And I was waiting for you.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.
Sit down, Howard.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Don't tell me to sit down, Allison.<eos> Do you know who the hell you're talking to?<eos> I do.
Lillian can't publish until she corroborates Andrew's story.<eos> The less that's out there, the better off we'll be.<eos> Thank you for coming when I called.<eos> You didn't call.<eos> Abby did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Mellie...<eos> I really did care about you.<eos> I cared about you, too.<eos> I still do.
No.<eos> That leaves you.<eos> I didn't grow up on an estate in Santa Barbara.<eos> I don't have $5 million sitting around.<eos> Yes, you do.
Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
Can you tell me what the bumper sticker says?<eos> Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.
- Oh, bathy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> Look, I-I love making love to you, but sometimes I think it would be great if we just lit some candles and... and popped some champagne and took a bathy.<eos> - Oh, do you?
Look, in my experience, costumed serial killers are never adequately punished by the law.<eos> Sometimes vigilante justice is the only way. I'm with Chanel.<eos> She killed my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, so I suppose no one cares that your boyfriend murdered my boyfriend?<eos> No one does.
She still live here?<eos> Moved as soon as she could.<eos> Still thinks I should've done something.<eos> Saved him.<eos> Everybody did.
It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
I've had a good life... thanks to you.<eos> Very few of the world's secrets I haven't cracked.<eos> It seemed worth a soul... at the time.<eos> Oh.<eos> It always does.
It took a spell from the Book of the Damned to spring Lucifer, and Rowena hid the book.<eos> And we would need both the book and her to even have a shot.<eos> Did I say this would be easy?<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Diane Gould.<eos> I'll be your backup this afternoon.<eos> Oh, pleasure to meet you.<eos> Didn't know I needed backup.<eos> Well, you don't, of course.
Yeah, hey, we appreciate the extra attention, but don't you fellas have a receptionist?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> She's at lunch.<eos> Late lunch.<eos> We do a lot of business with the East Coast.
"Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Ok, Felicity.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> -You don't know that.<eos> -Yes, i do.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe.<eos> No, that's just it, Barry.<eos> I do believe you.<eos> You... do?
Don't be, don't be.<eos> I wanted a resolution and I got one.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to call my childhood phone number and scream at whoever picks up. I'll see you Monday.<eos> Wait, I got the job?<eos> Of course you did.
You can't fight it.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then, no, you don't.
- I- - I believe in equal rights for everybody.<eos> That's what I believe in.<eos> I mean, for everybody.<eos> - I know you think you do.<eos> - No, I do.
That's what I believe in.<eos> I mean, for everybody.<eos> - I know you think you do.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> I really do.
He would have lost his mind.<eos> Anyway, congratulations.<eos> That is so cool that he's giving you this opportunity.<eos> I... I mean, I thought you didn't want to be a pot guy.<eos> I don't.
You're her sister.<eos> I won't pretend to know what you're going through... But stay away from my friends.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Do you know where I found this?<eos> Yeah... you do.
Well he brought this on himself.<eos> Did he?<eos> Let me give you a bit of advice.<eos> Stay out of it.<eos> He did this in a precinct.
They are your greatest creation because they're better than you are.<eos> Yeah, sure, they're weak and they cheat and steal and...destroy and disappoint.<eos> But they also give and create and they sing and dance and love.<eos> And above all, they never give up.<eos> But you do.
I don't know... if Chuck is leaning our way.<eos> You don't know?<eos> If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball.<eos> I thought they hated each other.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Come on.<eos> No chick-flick moments.<eos> Yeah, you love chick flicks.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I do.
Why did you bring me here?<eos> Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.
Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
I've been doing a lot of thinking, Velma.<eos> It's like I've been walking in a thick fog.<eos> But suddenly, seeing that mummy, everything fell into place.<eos> I have got the answer.<eos> - You do?
From my security feed, there's at least a mummy runnin' around.<eos> I'm sure these are the only two.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I know who they are.<eos> You do?
- He's cute.<eos> - Hey, how we doing, boss?<eos> Nikki has a thing for cops.<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
You're going to bring up Brenda here?<eos> I told you, I didn't sleep with her.<eos> Well, I had to walk around with the whole town thinking you did.<eos> - No one thought that.<eos> - Oh, we all did.
Told you I was gonna go.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> I see why you like it.<eos> You do?
Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
I sat with that hammer for hours, and when he came home, I stood up, and I hit him over and over again until I saw brains.<eos> And still I didn't feel... that that made up for all the times that he hit me.<eos> So I hit him some more.<eos> You want me to say I'm sorry, that I regret my actions.<eos> But I don't.
Do you trust her?<eos> Completely.<eos> She's my best friend.<eos> I didn't think I needed one.<eos> I did.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.<eos> I just wanted to go on record as soon as possible.<eos> We understand.<eos> As long as you know any statement you make here can be used as evidence at the formal disciplinary hearing.<eos> I do.
Sorry.<eos> - Have you seen Frank?<eos> - No.<eos> You'll call me when you do?<eos> If I do.
You couldn't... because Sam got into your head... just like he did to me.<eos> This is a woman who wants me dead.<eos> Because she blames you for the baby, and that's fair.<eos> You know that.<eos> Of course I do.
Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
- His father?<eos> - Biological father.<eos> My God.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
My God. Stop!<eos> - You know I always have been.<eos> - No. You know, I don't know anything<eos> - about you!<eos> - You do.
I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
I want to see you.<eos> Mom?<eos> Has Dad left already?<eos> We argued.<eos> You did?
I've been here a year.<eos> - Were you living in Marseille?<eos> - Yes, Félix Pyat.<eos> - You wouldn't know it.<eos> - I do.
Thank you. Don't forget.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Our neighborhood needs to change.<eos> Of course it does.
I just want an answer, a clear cut answer!<eos> Yes, I was there for some time.<eos> So, when you went into the room to use the washroom who shut the door?<eos> I don't remember<eos> You did!
- Yes.<eos> Out in the restaurant you struck an obscene conversation with Rajvir to which the manager is a witness.<eos> What was that about?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> You don't?
Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.
After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.<eos> You did.
And since you were a woman of questionable character in the eyes of the accused Rajvir Singh and his friends on that day, at that moment, what did you do to make it clear that right now I am not interested in sex?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I refused<eos> - What did you say?<eos> What exactly did you do?
Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!
Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!<eos> You did take money!<eos> Of course you did.
Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister?<eos> Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
No, you were dreaming.<eos> You saw the state I was in yesterday.<eos> How could I have gone out in that condition?<eos> I saw you with my own two eyes.<eos> No, you didn't.
Did he now?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Right, I best be off.<eos> Don't want to miss my train.<eos> No, no, you don't.
[laughter] [therapist] Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Um, Pilar, yeah, since we're on the subject, do you miss being intimate with Oscar?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's time.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> And I did.
When you were in prison, there was not one single bombing in New York.<eos> You got out July 2015.<eos> 13 months later, the Bensonhurst Bomber starts blowing things up again.<eos> You have to admit, that's a little strange.<eos> No, I don't.
Two people killed in the blast, half dozen more injured.<eos> It's another bleach-based compound and it's another public detonation.<eos> Obviously, it's our guy.<eos> I thought we had Nathan Resor under surveillance.<eos> We did.
What is your relationship to the victim?<eos> Is that something that has to happen right now?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Didn't know it bothered you.<eos> I-It doesn't.
Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
Ah. Thought you'd never ask.<eos> Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
It's him.<eos> He's even uglier than the last time we saw him.<eos> 65 of your years ago, you saved me from capture.<eos> Listen, you don't need to thank us.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Hey.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> These are the gauntlets for my suit.<eos> And you probably know nothing about that.<eos> - Do you?
Yeah.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - That.<eos> Yeah, why'd you open a breach?<eos> - I didn't.
Okay, Snow...<eos> Caitlin...<eos> You and her, you've always had such a special relationship.<eos> You talk to her.<eos> - No, we don't.
You would barely even look at me.<eos> I... couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
If Wally's having dreams of being Kid Flash, then he's in trouble, yeah, but don't worry, okay, we'll figure it out.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - All right.<eos> ♪♪♪ "The Flash 3x06" ♪♪♪ ♪♪" Shade"♪ ♪ ♪" OriginalAirDateonNovember15,2016"♪<eos> Yeah, we do.
So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
How do we even know he's telling the truth?<eos> Wally, come on, this isn't because of the particle accelerator, it's because of Dr. Alchemy.<eos> It's the same thing that happened to Frankie Kane.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
See? Ah.<eos> What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.
Of course he does.<eos> Where's Grodd when you need him?<eos> Gro... Gorilla Grodd?<eos> You have sentient gorillas on your Earth too?<eos> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, we do, many.
- Savitar.<eos> Savitar?<eos> Get searching.<eos> So, they don't know why she took Julian?<eos> No, they don't.
You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
Something's wrong with me, baby.<eos> Then let me help you.<eos> We will figure this out together.<eos> When I thought lawton killed Andy, all I wanted to do was bring his murderer to justice.<eos> I still do.
That's my life, man, and now you asking me to relive my latest and greatest.<eos> That's right, Rene.<eos> If you want to help us, if you want to give us anything that could bring down Church, I'm afraid you're gonna have to.<eos> Ok.<eos> What do I do?
Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
And who do you think will be president?<eos> Or you can stay a Republican, and Red will run someone against you from the right.<eos> That's what happens to moderates now.<eos> You know that.<eos> We did it!
Yeah.<eos> That's the worst.<eos> Yeah, well, the problem is they match you up based on, like, shared background and common interests, you know, so you're like, oh, it's great, we have so many common interests, and it turns out, people don't really connect based on common interest.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - And what does?
Hey, what the...<eos> Hey, hey, what is going on in here?<eos> - It's lively in here.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Did...
Remember...<eos> Remember when you...<eos> when you went out for hockey?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I remember that.<eos> No, you don't.
And yeah, we were all a bunch of losers, but the tryouts were so much fun and when I got cut, I didn't care.<eos> And I told you that, and you said, "Yeah, okay.<eos> Fuck 'em, do what you want."<eos> That happened!<eos> - Did it?
Really? No one?<eos> -Girl,yougot tolisten.<eos> Open the ears, close the mouth. He's telling us to lay back, stop be so,<eos> "Hey, girl, yeah, whoo, yeah!" - I just don't know what you're saying, Lucian, baby.<eos> I just don't.
I don't know yet.<eos> Somewhere new.<eos> - D.C., maybe. - Why?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does.
Did you ever go to Peru with him?<eos> A few times.<eos> And you saw him doing these things like feeding the poor?<eos> Yeah, taking care of sick people.<eos> I did.
Where do you want to go?<eos> Uh, NYU.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in. Scholarship.<eos> You just need a room of your own, right?<eos> Everyone does.
Can I help you?<eos> Sir?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> So then Sarah asked me if I'd seen you that night.<eos> She did.
Forgive her wanderings.<eos> And allow The Light back into her soul.<eos> Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol of the bond that you have to each other.<eos> Do you accept The Light into your heart?<eos> I do.
Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol of the bond that you have to each other.<eos> Do you accept The Light into your heart?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you vow never to turn your back on the message no matter what darkness may creep into your heart?<eos> I do.
I couldn't look people in the face.<eos> I've known for months.<eos> Papa doesn't know.<eos> He just knows he's been dismissed. He doesn't know why.<eos> Emily does.
I fuckin' made the time, I can also change it.<eos> Mr.Seven, drink!<eos> Take out the cash and I call them off.<eos> I don't have the money for you.<eos> Yeah, he doesn't.
So, uh, what are you guys talking about?<eos> Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I specifically asked you not to do that.<eos> - We didn't.
Pretty much just hung out at his place or at snooty restaurants with his bitchy friends.<eos> I feel like a middle-aged shut-in.<eos> - That's no fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My crew does a Boystown crawl every other week.
- An old friend.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> - Tell him what?<eos> - About me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Shall we tell each other stuff?<eos> Yeah. What kind of thing?<eos> I don't know, where you're from, what you like to eat, your favorite movie...<eos> Because apart from smoking joints and fucking, I know nothing about you.<eos> Sure you do.
How did the snake removal go?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
- Good night, my babies.<eos> Idiot.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> You really want that?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
You're like my reason for living.<eos> I do love you and want you to get better, but... not for me... but for yourself.<eos> As long as I have you, I can do that.<eos> I do have you, right?<eos> Yes, you do.
He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered.<eos> And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, why aren't you dancing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just too dumb, I guess.<eos> So, how could Molloy forget giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
That's where I was the afternoon Mrs. Johnson was killed.<eos> I do want you to get better, but not for me but for yourself.<eos> Well, as long as I have you I can do that.<eos> - I do have you, right?<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Why would you say that?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> Actually, I'm pretty sure I don't!<eos> You think I'm dumb, Emma.<eos> Why do you...
There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work.<eos> - Wait. Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
Okay.<eos> What do you think?<eos> He's a nut-job, it doesn't make him a murderer.<eos> So, did you figure out your room situation?<eos> Uh... Yeah, I did.
They came in the middle of the night and took everything we had.<eos> Ration cards, food, clothes... our house.<eos> Told us we had four hours to move.<eos> Said we worked for them now.<eos> - Who did?
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
He said you wanted something big.<eos> Hey, let's go... let's go say hi to some people.<eos> Why did you invite Stavo?<eos> I thought he creeped you out.<eos> He does and I didn't.
Holy what?<eos> Why are you talking like that?<eos> Wait, you don't usually wear a cape, do you, Cyborg?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...
Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...<eos> I've been a cop<eos> - for five years and...<eos> - You do.
We were just playing.<eos> It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
Every single day.<eos> When are people gonna learn?<eos> It just makes things worse.<eos> And people always say they need one for protection.<eos> - They don't.
I feel like I know you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You said you couldn't wait to see me.<eos> I said a lot of things.<eos> - She did.
"Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
Son?<eos> Son? I...<eos> I don't... I don't have any children.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, a-actually, you do.
We know this.<eos> I tried my best.<eos> Please know that if I could've done more...<eos> I know.<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> She's stable.<eos> Yeah, uh, Robbins is closing.<eos> Your baby girl has a very strong mother.<eos> Yeah, she does.
And... I've got lots of money... mmm, that I love spending on drugs.<eos> Not even picky.<eos> I'll do any of them.<eos> Mix them together sometimes.<eos> You ever done a he-she?
Look, I don't know what your deal is, but you make me a better detective.<eos> And you've always got my back.<eos> What more could I ask for?<eos> And you need the eggs.<eos> Damn right I do.
Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, I've assumed a lot about my mother, including the fact that she wants revenge for what I did to her.<eos> - And now she doesn't?
You were making mistakes.<eos> You were off the rails.<eos> When that happens, I have the right to make...<eos> No, no.<eos> You do not.
It's probably healthier not to ignore it.<eos> So, um...<eos> Do you think it's starting up again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, so are we good?<eos> So, we're good, then?<eos> You don't need a subpoena for that.<eos> To pull all those clients' accounts?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We in Miami.<eos> Them dudes sittin' up in them Ivory Towers on Brickell?<eos> Ain't much difference between them and the dudes I know.<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
Hey, it's not all about you.<eos> It's about me and what I need for this relationship to work.<eos> I need to know that you are willing to do anything for me.<eos> I need to have that level of confidence in you.<eos> You don't already?
I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.<eos> And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.<eos> I don't even know who you are anymore.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't.
Is he here?<eos> We gotta disable that before we take him down.<eos> Why?<eos> How well do you know that Cuz guy?<eos> I don't.
-He said he was in packaging.<eos> - The only thing that man packages is cocaine and body parts.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> You have Amanda Tims today?<eos> - I did.
Oh, come on. Why would they do that?<eos> Because they know I know what they know.<eos> Now go away, or I'll set my dog on you.<eos> - We don't have a dog.<eos> - Yes, we do.
-Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> - So, do you still have that Adderall?<eos> - Oh, the Adderall.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do. At home, yeah.
You told Senator Healy we were crazy, but yesterday you thought an infestation made sense.<eos> Yes, but that was yesterday.<eos> It's not today.<eos> What changed?<eos> She did.
I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hold on...<eos> This is a humanitarian assistance effort only...<eos> We're full... Quiet!<eos> I said I'm going to deliver "this" assistance.<eos> So, do it!
Came to get you.<eos> How long he been there?<eos> A few hours.<eos> Ain't been talking much though.<eos> What they do, big man?
Now I'd like to go back and finish the rest of it before it all get cold, too.<eos> So I'll make this quick now.<eos> Who shot Joelle?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
This is not Valencia talking.<eos> This is just me.<eos> I would like to buy you lunch.<eos> - Big man.<eos> What it do.
This is just me.<eos> I would like to buy you lunch.<eos> - Big man.<eos> What it do.<eos> - What it do.
Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
Hey everyb...<eos> Damn it.<eos> Do you need a hand there, Sophie?<eos> No, I got it!<eos> You really don't.
I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Do I strike you as the kind of woman who needs protecting?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you have a past.<eos> So does everybody.
- Nicely played.<eos> - It wasn't just a bluff.<eos> The more I studied my company's doings, the more there were things that could only be explained by your existence.<eos> Still, I had to know for sure.<eos> Now I do.
I think there's plenty to say.<eos> After all you went through with him, I just need to know that nothing's left unsaid.<eos> Well, you should speak to him yourself, then.<eos> - I did.<eos> - You did?
So why'd they make a Bruce Wayne look-alike anyhow?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know I looked like him until a few days ago.<eos> I went to his house thinking he might have some answers about who I am.<eos> He didn't.
Cobblepot!<eos> Cobblepot!<eos> They love me.<eos> If you would've bought the election, you would've never known.<eos> But now you do.
What's in the box?<eos> Open it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - I already got one.<eos> - Oh, of course you do.
A man who values protecting others above protecting himself.<eos> A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail. A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.<eos> Now... I-I wasn't always that man, but damn, that didn't stop me from trying.<eos> - I don't know how to be that man.<eos> - Well, sure you do.
But I'm not gonna let him go.<eos> He loves me.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Of course you do.
- Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
Maybe you are one, 'cause your intuition's uncanny.<eos> Linda, listen. I did what I had to do, all right?<eos> Now, you wouldn't understand this, but I was dealing with matters of great importance.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you did.
He deserved what happened to him.<eos> Yeah, but you're not answering the question.<eos> Did you kill Nick?<eos> I understand punishment all too well, Tommy, and Nick deserved to be punished.<eos> He did, didn't he?
What are you doing here?<eos> Trying to catch our killer.<eos> Duh.<eos> - I thought you didn't care whether this sicko was brought to justice.<eos> Oh, I don't.
Sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I like to rock it old school when I'm working.<eos> - Know-what-I'm-sayin'?<eos> - I do.
Not the appendage I'd hoped to be pulsing by now.<eos> I know that hood.<eos> There's a great tiki bar across the street from that building.<eos> I know the bartender.<eos> Course you do.
The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Wow.<eos> Look who bought a ticket to the gun show!<eos> Divorce becomes you, Detective.<eos> I do not sound like that.<eos> Of course we do.
- L-Linda told me that you were in the business.<eos> -I'm intuitive.<eos> People tell me that my intuitions sometimes help.<eos> And sometimes my intuitions are not all that helpful.<eos> I don't do hocus-pocus, no past lives, no messages from Grandma.
What did you expect, Sarah?<eos> That I'd fly away with you?<eos> That we'd leave together?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, you don't.
Had you been drinking?<eos> You think I'm a bad mother, don't you?<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> Do you know what it's like?<eos> No, I don't.
Jensen's gonna give you 'till August and... well, if you're not caught up by then he's gonna put a lien on the ranch.<eos> I tried to get him to give you more time, but...<eos> It's alright.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> I do, I do.
Yeah, she was beautiful.<eos> She had this hair all the way down her back.<eos> It was like a crimson sunset on Christmas Eve.<eos> But after I got this right here, she said I changed.<eos> She did.
I thought that was the saddest-looking girl I've ever seen.<eos> And the most beautiful.<eos> And later, when she just left you?<eos> It felt... like a stone in my stomach.<eos> It still does.
Yeah. just like that.<eos> Except vampires don't get warrants.<eos> I do.<eos> - So, do you have one?<eos> - No, I don't.
Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
You don't... you... do you really... okay.<eos> I'm sorry. Do you really think I would do something like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> No, I didn't before.
Someone to see you.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> Did you get the stuff I sent you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yes, I did.
Now that's what she said.<eos> That's... What accent is that?<eos> - It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really? - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't
- No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can't afford it.<eos> Come on, you really think I'm here for money?<eos> We do, yes.
So you might stick around?<eos> Whoops! I spilled gravy on me. [Laughs] Mmm!<eos> Something spoil your appetite? Hardly.<eos> Mama always said it's rude to chew with your mouth open. Well, I'd love to chew the fat with her some time. I already said "chew."<eos> Chew did?
- No, look, I just want...<eos> Let her be.<eos> - Emma, I didn't know it was Piper!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Yes, you did!
- What?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> - You don't seem fine.<eos> You said you needed my help on this case.<eos> And I do.
Everything worked out perfect.<eos> They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled. How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
- You wanted nothing to do with them!<eos> - ‭Whatever!<eos> No, not whatever!<eos> Why did you hate me?<eos> What did I do to you?
What kind of weight exactly?<eos> Like someone poured cement in a bunch of bowling balls and then strapped those bowling balls onto a big fat circus man and then he climbed this ladder...<eos> - And then stood on your shoulders?<eos> - You get it.<eos> I do!
And this kind of elegance allows for versatility, it allows for universality...<eos> Yes, a universal language, like I said.<eos> And the best part is, the online catalogue viewer, the transfer protocol, the Web server software, all of it is free.<eos> I have a problem with open source.<eos> - You do?
Yes, a universal language, like I said.<eos> And the best part is, the online catalogue viewer, the transfer protocol, the Web server software, all of it is free.<eos> I have a problem with open source.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
I'm not angry at you.<eos> No, no, it's not that.<eos> It's, um, I have a scoop.<eos> - For Roll Call.<eos> - You do?
Makes sense.<eos> Oh, um... what did you need when you came by the office?<eos> I need your list of gerrymander districts.<eos> We have a bug.<eos> You do?
Yes.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> And we don't have the equipment.<eos> The CDC does.
They put out a comic book about how to repel a zombie attack.<eos> This was merely a way to get people who usually don't care about disease to read about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I thought I had five minutes.<eos> You do.
Stick it. With my knife.<eos> And how did that... feel?<eos> - What, like...?<eos> - Emotionally.<eos> I didn't.
He'll be making a lot of money.<eos> Just raking it in, drinking cognac and playing golf, and being on various boats.<eos> What?<eos> I just want to hear you say that you're happy for your brother.<eos> - I did.
Hi.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Van, I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to hang out with my girl tonight, and I messed up.<eos> I did, okay?
Hold on.<eos> Look what I got you.<eos> I got this just for you.<eos> I know you want it.<eos> Yes, you do.
Now you ask?<eos> Yeah, Mom.<eos> Jesus, Mom.<eos> I told you about this, like, weeks ago.<eos> No, you didn't.
But we are all vulnerable in a crisis.<eos> Right now we are very disturbed and sensitive.<eos> So avoid raising this issue.<eos> Else you know how low we could stoop...<eos> You do, don't you?
Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
They call his wife?<eos> Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do. Right?
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
Yeah.<eos> Wow. Your car is messy.<eos> You got kids.<eos> I can tell that.<eos> Yeah, I sure do.
Get on the bus.<eos> Take it home.<eos> Mom, don't be a drama queen.<eos> That bus doesn't even go to our house.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hi.<eos> I'm Sam.<eos> This is Sunny, my friend.<eos> Uh, did you get a chance to look at the photos?<eos> Ahem. Yeah, we did.
Yeah, you're supposed to love church.<eos> Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.<eos> Mom, Morgan says that her church is really great.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into music?<eos> No, honey, I didn't.
- Mom, don't!<eos> - What?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Be nice.<eos> Kind of they do.
No.<eos> We totally used condoms.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, you didn't, Sam.<eos> Yes, we did.
What the hell?<eos> I thought you two might show up.<eos> You spoil all the fun.<eos> You know, if you were expecting us to show up, you really should've brought something a little more powerful.<eos> I did.
- Karina.<eos> - Where's Daewon?<eos> Daewon?<eos> I don't know who this is.<eos> Vadik, you do.
We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
You're such a bitch.<eos> It was very generous of you.<eos> Jacob has a new wardrobe and $19,000 in a college fund.<eos> He has a college fund?<eos> Yeah, he does now.
There.<eos> Now you have that picture and my number.<eos> So, if you ever need anything...<eos> Do you have my dad's number?<eos> No, I don't.
Someone had to know.<eos> Someone who'd been following the money.<eos> You said it was safe.<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> - Yes, you did.
That Blush dude money.<eos> All of that money?<eos> That money you was gonna give me yesterday when you and homegirl fired me...<eos> - Well, we didn't fire you, but yeah.<eos> - Yes, you did, Nick.
- Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
- I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
Okay, we just have her fake up some documents.<eos> Oh, my god! Stop!<eos> That's making it worse.<eos> - You got a better idea, Nick?<eos> - No, I don't.
Unlike the vessel recovered in '03, this ship doesn't appear to be designed for man flight.<eos> Looks like it's trying to establish a link.<eos> Let's see what it's trying to say.<eos> I don't even know if any of these alien bastards is out here.<eos> We don't.
Marcus Miles is pretty cool, man.<eos> You know he got that invisible car?<eos> What?<eos> Nigga, no he don't.<eos> He do.
I like fruit and especially what your boy's got.<eos> Nothin' better!<eos> I'll tell you straight, I don't like this situation.<eos> My boy, as you call him, has to stay out of this.<eos> He does this, nothin' else.
-What, this?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because, uh... because you don't want to have the same arguments about theology that we had once a month when we were married?<eos> -I don't...
Please!<eos> Piece-of-crap, old lock.<eos> Can you open it?<eos> Oh, yeah. Easy with a hairpin, which I'm guessing you don't have.<eos> No, I don't.
But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, Big Three, do you three know how much I love your mother?<eos> - any idea? - Yeah, we do.
God forbid we have real emotion in this show.<eos> What do we got here?<eos> We got a real suitcase.<eos> Finally, we got something real.<eos> Oh, no, we don't!
Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Come on, smalls, why you goin' so slow?<eos> Don't you want this?<eos> You want it? Yeah?<eos> Come on, smalls.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
Just take it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing... Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did.
So how's Derek?<eos> He's doing well.<eos> All right, Mama.<eos> He said he wants to meet Franny.<eos> He does?
Come on, Franny, let's go give Daddy a bath before Mommy has to go to work.<eos> Bye, Franny.<eos> Bye, Deb.<eos> Our thrills don't have to end.<eos> You goddamn right they don't.
Well, we both screwed her, but I wanted to stop way before my wife did.<eos> Pressured for sex.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Yeah, so we got any shot about getting our bar back?<eos> We do.
Listen everywhere you go.<eos> You'll hear it.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> - They like the bass line.<eos> - The bugs do?
I want to stop the terrorists.<eos> Why else?<eos> Hello?<eos> You know who this is, Agent.<eos> I do.
I'm texting Kendra.<eos> She shouldn't be waiting tables, putting all of her dreams on hold for mine.<eos> A-And now it's causing problems with you.<eos> I love her so much, but... I have to break up with her.<eos> Oh. Well, you do your thing.
She's very good.<eos> She plays with the blood.<eos> - She knows what I want.<eos> Ciao.<eos> - I do?
Treason.<eos> Death.<eos> No one has to die here today, Rainey.<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> Do you?
Men with tattoos, heavy tattoos all over.<eos> You didn't--<eos> You didn't transfer the bodies from the Patrick Spring case? - No.<eos> What would we want with them? - We do not want bodies.<eos> No, we don't.
Give us the her or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!<eos> - What? - I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't! - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
What "of course"?<eos> Dog.<eos> Girl.<eos> - Ah. This makes sense.<eos> - It does?
Dog.<eos> Girl.<eos> - Ah. This makes sense.<eos> - It does?<eos> Well, it did until right now.
What?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - All right.<eos> - Ah. - What up, Jey?<eos> - Big Ronnie, what it do?
No.<eos> I was looking through his medicine cabinet.<eos> Levodopa?<eos> Yes.<eos> He does.
Good.<eos> I think you're ready.<eos> Senator.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> I do.
Us.<eos> You're a bug, and you're more bug than human.<eos> You got me drinking.<eos> I don't know what I'm saying.<eos> Yes, you do.
You know, "Thank you so much.<eos> This is yours as much as mine and it's the whole team."<eos> So I cried that day, for sure.<eos> Let's go here.<eos> All right, how we doing on the dessert?
Emma!<eos> You know... he probably really liked you.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> And the best part is... you just told me you love me.<eos> I did.
Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.<eos> She's also doing half the band.<eos> Do you even know what that means?<eos> Uh, let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.<eos> Okay, you don't.
Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs, you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod...<eos> Oh, my God, babe.<eos> Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like "damn you all" or "what the dude" or whatever.<eos> Uh, it-it's "deuce." But, uh, but yeah, you're-you're right, it...<eos> I-I do.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, Joanie.<eos> Mama, does she have to come?<eos> Yes, baby, she does.
We were talking about her kids.<eos> We don't talk about you.<eos> That would be unethical. I just, you know, thought maybe she said something about...<eos> Right.<eos> She didn't.
- It's fine.<eos> I can.<eos> Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
And she needs me.<eos> And you can everything, okay?<eos> You can have the restaurant, Cole, the house, but please, please, don't take her away from me.<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> Nobody does.
Do you really think that I would stab Noah Solloway? No!<eos> What?<eos> I... no, of course not.<eos> Then why did you send the police to me?<eos> - I didn't.
No, Granny.<eos> It's a place.<eos> - And its Count has quite the reputation. - Oh.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
Welcome to the neighborhood.<eos> I got you a cheeseburger.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Get yourself one, too?<eos> Yes, I did.
Wait...<eos> What did he say?<eos> I used to come here with my father.<eos> You'd have loved your grandpa.<eos> Everyone did.
I am from Senegal.<eos> Do I have any siblings?<eos> Where did I go to college?<eos> Trick question.<eos> You didn't.
No.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.
- Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
This embedded part?<eos> Here.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Do you love me, Leo?<eos> Yes, I do.
Open.<eos> They're so beautiful, Dad.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should be thanking you, you know what this wedding means to me.<eos> I do.
Trust me...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The Cabinet is empty.<eos> I knew it would be.<eos> Every Rhodian does.
I'll find a place tonight.<eos> I mean, it doesn't... ahem... have to be tonight.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> Do you?
It is okay.<eos> Just, um... you should go to work.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I've interviewed Carly Shannon...<eos> "Interviewed"?<eos> On official business, yes, during which time the bruises on her arms and her forehead were pretty goddamned unmistakable.<eos> Okay, accidents happen, man.<eos> Not anymore they don't.
You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
You don't need a trophy for everything you do.<eos> [mimicking a child] "Oh, my feelings are hurt if I don't get a trophy."<eos> That's tough!<eos> Do you know how many people I had to pillage and raid and kill to get to be captain?<eos> Do you?
Thanks for being there for me, you guys.<eos> Making that booty clap just wouldn't mean as much without you there to share it.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get the kind of family you deserve.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
It doesn't matter, Clover.<eos> My parents have gifted me a brother.<eos> And if there's one thing I know above all others, it's this.<eos> I love gifts!<eos> I do!
Have you found an undesirable yet?<eos> [sighs] I thought having a brother would finally make us a real family.<eos> Instead, I've lost everything.<eos> Enjoy the throne.<eos> -I sure did.
Can we just use our brains here for a minute?<eos> Stop treading' on us, Maurice!<eos> [talking incoherently] He's still kinda swollen on account of getting stung in the face 160 times, but he agrees!<eos> Don't you all love your families and want to keep 'em safe from robbers and killers?<eos> Even if he doesn't.
Besides, you were probably paid to be my friend just like the rest of them.<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> Nobody had to pay me to be your friend.<eos> I always thought you were the coolest, sweetest, most handsome lemur in our school.<eos> I still do.
Wait up. You two have the same grandmother?<eos> Clover, did you know about this?<eos> Yes, King Julien.<eos> She's my sister. You did good, Clo-Clo.<eos> You did good.
For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
Doesn't feel good to have somebody encroach on your job, does it?<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> I have complete control of editorial content.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Excellent.<eos> We may need Gunther to bring in more seating.<eos> I fired Gunther.<eos> What?<eos> You did?
He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
You're gonna be all right.<eos> We're survivors.<eos> You still have a son.<eos> And he needs you.<eos> Like sons always do.
We shouldn't have done that, Frank.<eos> We should not have helped them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell me it didn't feel good.<eos> It didn't.
Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I, um... I think Jennifer Windham was murdered because of me.<eos> No, Alison, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> It does.
Deceased is Gunther Holzmann, 53.<eos> Hung himself with an electrical cord.<eos> Left a note, "I'm sorry"<eos> And you think he's the Silver Bells Killer?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
I had Gunther get rid of them.<eos> - Well, you didn't know.<eos> - I didn't know what?<eos> That there was a Silver Bells Killer on the loose?<eos> Of course I did, the whole world did.
Maybe.<eos> I missed her.<eos> And that's why you came back?<eos> I came back because my father was dying.<eos> And then he did.
Scattered showers of lunar debris throughout today, followed by a heavy downpour of death, with flaming chunks the size of Nantucket by tomorrow.<eos> The long-range forecast? There isn't one.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - You don't want to hear it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- There's a car in the driveway.<eos> - You don't have the keys.<eos> - Then I'll hotwire it.<eos> You know how to do that?<eos> Fortunately, yes, I do.
Yes, you are. Dana.<eos> We named you Dana.<eos> Where's your sister?<eos> I don't have a sister.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's billions of people gone, murdered, and you... you, all this time to take your revenge and you said nothing?<eos> ! The choice isn't yours.<eos> God!<eos> If I didn't have this thing in my head...<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
Who can keep track?<eos> All right, both of you, calm down.<eos> I will not say "BibbidiâBobbidiâBoo."<eos> - I don't think that adds anything to the conversation!<eos> - Yes, it does.
Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me.<eos> Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying "hello" over and over again, but she did point at you.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, you don't.
Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.<eos> Thanks, babe.<eos> Next question.<eos> Eleanor. Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place?<eos> No, I don't.
Listen, dude, in the end, she went for the money.<eos> I get it, it's cool. Whatever.<eos> That's a nasty thing to say.<eos> You really think she would've moved in with you if you didn't own that farmland in Jersey?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Close the door on your way out.<eos> Yep.<eos> You have a key?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Like it always did with your dad.
Gimme a hug.<eos> Well, um, I know you'll are busy and I'll get out of your way.<eos> You mean, you're not staying for Christmas?<eos> Your grandfather never really liked the holidays.<eos> - I did.
Lots of rules, Father.<eos> Lots of them.<eos> Not now!<eos> Rand, I didn't know you were coming.<eos> Yes, you did.
I think it's too cold for Nose to stay out there for very long.<eos> - Let's all go find him.<eos> - I'm sure he'll show up.<eos> Now how do you know that?<eos> What if he doesn't?
- We...<eos> - You're the one who made me that appointment with that first guy who turned out not to even be a doctor.<eos> - How do I even know I have cancer at all?<eos> - Just trust us.<eos> You do.
It's just now coming to me.<eos> I've never had my blood even tested.<eos> I just went to a person who said, "You undeniably have cancer."<eos> I don't even know if I actually have cancer!<eos> - You do.
I may not get back on a board ever again, but I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I just got to do this part on my own.<eos> That's just it.<eos> You don't have to do this on your own.<eos> Yes, I do.
Nobody move!<eos> Against the wall! All right, turn around, hands on the wall!<eos> Your gambling hall on 4th ave, the cops are raiding it!<eos> I thought we paid them off?<eos> We did.
Once my ex and I split, I figured that was it.<eos> I was never gonna be a dad.<eos> Then I meet this cute Asian chick at the Kubrick exhibit at LACMA and suddenly she's knocked up and I get this second chance at 42.<eos> So you believe in second chances?<eos> I didn't.
I just don't know, Paul.<eos> I just don't know.<eos> So... This cucking is something many women fantasize about?<eos> All of them.<eos> They all do.
Unfortunately,<eos> - it's not true.<eos> - Wha...<eos> How do we know that?<eos> Because we do.
And he wants the truth, n-not just a-a leak.<eos> And what's the truth?<eos> - Mr. Boch.<eos> - My guess is you have some information for me.<eos> - I do.
You want to know who?<eos> Sure, if you want to tell me.<eos> Michael Moore.<eos> You know, Michael Moore, the liberal.<eos> I do.
That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm telling you I've never spoken to Sean Cahill in my life.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But I gave you seven days to find that witness, and then you went behind my back, so you better have a good reason why you're in here asking to reopen this case.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
No, I'm not leaving.<eos> Oh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this.<eos> You know you don't belong here.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't...
I felt like I was done wrong.<eos> I felt like something needed to be done.<eos> I felt like something needs to be said.<eos> If I just cop out and say that I did it, nothing's gonna be done about it.<eos> I didn't do it.
I'll make it happen.<eos> Louis?<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.<eos> This was about buying us time.<eos> Take my eye off the ball?<eos> Do you even give a shit about me?<eos> Of course we do.
I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.<eos> But if you get out of here and I don't, you should know, I can get to you just as easily out there as I can in here.<eos> And when I say "get to you," you got to remember what I did to make Harvey put me away in the first place.<eos> Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?<eos> No, Rachel, I don't.
What do you say after dinner, you take me home?<eos> I say... I think that we should take it slow this time.<eos> Listen, I know you hate me right now, but right this second, we are on the same side.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
We think she knows her assailant.<eos> A guy came in the district last week, made threats.<eos> I want to know why, and I want to know who, and fast.<eos> Sergeant, you know we got those new cameras installed downstairs?<eos> We do?
He hasn't been arraigned.<eos> There is gonna be a trial.<eos> You're gonna testify.<eos> I... we can move on from the worst part.<eos> I do.
See you on the ballot, ghouls.<eos> Moanica can't win the election.<eos> Right?<eos> She won't.<eos> But what if she does?
That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he...<eos> - Fucking right I do.
What are you talking about?<eos> Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical designed to treat cancer patients... potent enough that a molecule on the head of a pin is deadly, but if even a molecule's altered, then technically, it's not a controlled substance.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Do you know how many OD's we have off this stuff down at Med?<eos> I do.
Dispatch put it over the zone.<eos> We were first on the scene.<eos> Is ASA Stone around?<eos> The Ariel Kincaid murder. You remember it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sure it was.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together Mr. Peterson's movements over the past few days.<eos> His assistant said you came to see him yesterday.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Gavros left.<eos> Green Zone league not gonna happen.<eos> So all that time, money, and effort, just pissed right down the drain.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know what happened out there.<eos> Oh, I do.
Fuck.<eos> I've never really said how sorry I was.<eos> You should get the trainers.<eos> She'll say I don't know her.<eos> You don't.
Just can't stop picturing it.<eos> I don't think you have to be alone to be lonely.<eos> Dad always taught me that.<eos> Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?<eos> He did.
Can I... do you mind if I go out side?<eos> I have to make a phone call.<eos> Yeah, yeah of course.<eos> You know the way.<eos> Yes I do.
We have lot of special needs.<eos> They take a lot of work, we are a small organization and then it's manageable.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> You love gray hounds, I mean.<eos> Yes I do.
- Suh's the least of my worries.<eos> Anderson clipped me last night.<eos> You got fired?<eos> I didn't tell you?<eos> No, you definitely didn't.
If she shows up again, we will get the police involved.<eos> I promise you.<eos> I don't want to stay here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I really don't.
We could go up and get it.<eos> Thank you, Dad.<eos> But I really...<eos> - I gotta get cracking on this.<eos> - Of course you do.
I knew it wouldn't help and so did you.<eos> I figured we had safety in numbers.<eos> I know.<eos> But if we'd had an alternative plan to save his life, yeah, I would've held firm with you.<eos> But we didn't.
- Hang on.<eos> We got something.<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> Anyone seeing this?<eos> We do.
What are you saying?<eos> I said that's a shame.<eos> No, you said something after that.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, you did...
I said that's a shame.<eos> No, you said something after that.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.
No, you said something after that.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did...
- No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did...<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
The... the drum solos, the bass player sings a song.<eos> They didn't even clean up after themselves.<eos> It's like living with three tiny truckers.<eos> Look, honey, I understand you had a tough day, I do.<eos> I do.
Look, all I know is I can take care of our kids.<eos> Didn't see that coming either, did you?<eos> Well, great.<eos> Do you have a plan to get the kids in line?<eos> Yes, I do.
You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
Guess the thing I really need to say out loud to everyone is, well...<eos> I'm down three pounds in one week.<eos> Oh, guys, come on.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> You don't...
I'm so worried about Bug.<eos> Well, that's all I wrote.<eos> Well, go finish it.<eos> You know how it ends, right?<eos> I do now.
I'm just forgetful, that's all.<eos> I keep picking up pills I think are mine, putting them in that cupboard there.<eos> I quite forgot about them until that lady knocked them out by mistake.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> Aye, we do.
- Sure, sure... But it's out there.<eos> - It is.<eos> - And it doesn't exist in the real world!<eos> - You're wrong. It exists.<eos> The fuck it does!
I'm sure he wouldn't be the first to try.<eos> - See, you know me, too.<eos> - I don't.<eos> And you don't know me, either.<eos> Oh, but I do.
We don't know what kind of firewall it has.<eos> It could kill her as soon as we try to break in.<eos> Share your wisdom with us, then.<eos> How do you propose we disarm it?<eos> We don't.
Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> you do. You do.
Well, thank you, Gruppenführer.<eos> I will certainly take your suggestions into account.<eos> I will make the necessary preparations.<eos> Our empire does not possess such a device.<eos> No. We do not.
Watch this, watch this.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> That's not even remotely how this program is supposed to work.<eos> Oh, I like it when a woman takes charge.<eos> Yes, I do.
I think maybe Raymond has an interest in it.<eos> I... Do you think that, or do you know that?<eos> Well, I hear things.<eos> I don't know anything for sure when it comes to him.<eos> No one does.
Uh, the president is busy meeting with his advisers, and, um... working up a strategy.<eos> Can you be any more specific?<eos> Uh... not really.<eos> - But the president does have a strategy?<eos> - Of course he does.
They're the ones handing out these weapons,<eos> They want us to be afraid of each other.<eos> To not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I... I just do.
Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> -Of course he did.<eos> -He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
Not to start a brushfire here, but if Little Jay had taken you out, what difference would any story make to you?<eos> Two years.<eos> I put myself on the line for you for two years, and you can't tell me why... why I got shot?<eos> What makes you so sure I got answers?<eos> Somebody does.
- Yeah, and?<eos> - We got to go.<eos> There's a pattern of calls from the Goff house to a pay phone in Washington Square.<eos> - Oh, we got him.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me.<eos> I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
Oh, you know that the district manager's still here, right?<eos> Jeff?<eos> What is Jeff still doing he...<eos> You don't think he's trying to find a reasonon to fire me?<eos> - Do you? - No.
Can you believe the lengths those two go to keep their little secret?<eos> - Secret, ma'am?<eos> - Why, Alfred!<eos> You really don't see it?<eos> No, I do not.
I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
I'm pretty much a genius.<eos> And I'm pretty much gonna pass.<eos> You want to try a Cacao Storm?<eos> Huh, buddy?<eos> Yeah, you do.
I got a call that it didn't go well.<eos> I think I'm out of contention.<eos> It was about the affairs, right?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> You don't?
But, epiphany, it's a real window.<eos> Do internment camps have many windows?<eos> No, the whole point is not to have windows.<eos> That list of sites for the camps, which one was closest, do you remember?<eos> Of course I do.
And this funding is in the farming bill.<eos> We're voting on this bill today.<eos> We have it under control.<eos> - So you knew about it?<eos> - We did.
Better not affect your performance in the field today.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I don't want to hear a thing about, you know, your tight calves or your chafed nipples.<eos> Well, then you definitely don't want to hear about my rectus femoris.<eos> No, I do not.
I think it's just hormones.<eos> I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine.<eos> So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?<eos> Does it really need one?<eos> Of course it does.
Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.
Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.<eos> No, you don't!
R-R-Rojohn.<eos> Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
Put that gun down, Marcus!<eos> Look, I didn't want any of this, all right?<eos> They made me do it!<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.
Thanks.<eos> Worked in "Back to the Future II."<eos> Wyatt.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
You're embarrassing me!<eos> [whimpering] No, no, I need help.<eos> Repressing The Crush made it stronger.<eos> [snarling] Which feels good!<eos> [whimpering] No, it does not.
Exactly.<eos> Come on, guys. As hideous as you can.<eos> Mom, I'm sorry... for everything.<eos> I don't know what happened to me.<eos> Actually, I do.
- Oh, wait, that's Gorp.<eos> [chuckles] Gorp, stop yelling at the sky and come party, you goof.<eos> That guy. Where was I?<eos> You know where you were.<eos> Fine. I do.
You know Bulk and Sulk always win, 'cause their dad does their projects for them.<eos> Such a rip-off.<eos> Now, since Bulk and Sulk have won every fair we've had so far, I've decided to make a change by giving them their awards in advance.<eos> [chuckling] Come on up, boys.<eos> They did it!
Hey, I'm curious.<eos> How do you know when it's time to buy a new pair of shoes?<eos> To be honest, shoes for me are whimsical.<eos> So, I heard what happened.<eos> Of course you did.
Thank you for coming.<eos> The rumors are true, then?<eos> I need to know if what my father is telling me is right.<eos> Did he ask you to leave?<eos> Yes, he did.
For what?<eos> Just being cautious.<eos> Hey, Mac.<eos> I thought you said this train was nonstop.<eos> I did. Why?
Now we, uh... We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
I don't think I hoped they would do anything with it, quite frankly.<eos> "This is a book for anarchists... "those who feel able to discipline themselves "on all the subjects, from drugs to weapons, to explosives."<eos> I don't think the book actually says,<eos> "This is what you should do with this information."<eos> In fact, it doesn't.
There was part of me that didn't want to know anything about it.<eos> Um, and there was part of me that was torn apart about it that did want to learn more.<eos> At this point, we're in the Internet age, you know, everyone Googles themself, and you have a book that you can search.<eos> At any point did you start to look at whether the book was connected to any other events?<eos> I did do a Google search of "The Anarchist Cookbook."
What's this?<eos> Ask her. She wrote it.<eos> Wanted to rub my nose in it.<eos> I didn't write this. No.<eos> Someone with your handwriting did.
You... You saved me.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever. May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
- I want this one.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I want it, and I need it.<eos> - No, you don't need this one.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, no, babies are hilarious.<eos> I should probably get back out there.<eos> "I admit I stole the fruit like some Saudi Arabian street rat."<eos> - You want me to sign this?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Nicole... or wait, you call her "Nicky," right?<eos> Yeah, Nicky won't like that.<eos> I think he went for it.<eos> He's gonna call back.<eos> 'Course he did.
Got it. It's just it's her first day out.<eos> I... I don't want to upset her.<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> Hey, you made it.<eos> I did.
Yeah, we're looking forward, Grant, not back.<eos> My recommendation is that you voluntarily commit yourself to the Springfield facility and begin the process of getting well.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm...<eos> Look, I... I know... I know I need help getting clean.<eos> I do.
It's showtime.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Who wants to see what he's gonna do?<eos> - I do!
- An unconfirmed...<eos> A black site is not an option.<eos> Deputy Director Atwood, you believe you can make progress?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
I know you feel betrayed.<eos> Samar and Aram feel betrayed.<eos> Everyone feels betrayed.<eos> But... my daughter is missing, and if you have any idea how to find her, you've got to tell me.<eos> No, I don't.
Uh, yes.<eos> For now.<eos> She needs time.<eos> We all do.<eos> We all do?
You have the data file?<eos> I wish I could meet all the people who dreamed up what's on here.<eos> Every one of them killed for no other reason than the power of their imagination.<eos> You know who she is and you're gonna give her that?<eos> Yes, Agent Ressler, he does.
Oh, Tandy, I'm so scared.<eos> What if Pat comes here and finds us?<eos> - He's not going to.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> Yes, I do, okay?
Yeah, no, she's beautiful, but she was also just...<eos> Some of the others, they don't like to go with me so much 'cause of my scars.<eos> But she didn't care about that at all.<eos> Last time I saw her, she called me to see if we could meet.<eos> And did you?
Six months of solitary can do that to you.<eos> Solitary?<eos> How would you know that?<eos> León likes to talk.<eos> No, he doesn't.
We find the painting, we find the killer.<eos> Checked everybody's houses.<eos> Nobody has it.<eos> Everyone insists Bruno has it.<eos> He didn't.
She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police.<eos> So I got the hell out of there.<eos> She saw that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> You erm... You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Good to see you, all right.<eos> - Got my keys?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
But the pieces are moving faster now, and I can't catch them all.<eos> I can feel them slipping through my fingertips.<eos> And soon where there used to be my granddaughter breathing and my son laughing, there will be... nothing.<eos> I know it feels like you have all the time in the world.<eos> But you don't.
There's also cherries jubilee in the fridge.<eos> Look at us eating like rich people... in the '50s.<eos> Hey, Mom!<eos> Have a good day at work.<eos> Uh, I already did that.
I'll drive you.<eos> All right.<eos> Levi.<eos> Over here, Levi.<eos> How you doing, SweetVicki?
It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Destroy the doc.<eos> How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
You should be.<eos> They control all of us.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> No one does.
Gilford.<eos> As in the D.A.?<eos> - It's just lunch, Jake. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You want him on the show, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Look, I really need you to trust me.<eos> Seeing him outside a clinical setting is a terrible idea, especially given the people he's involved with.<eos> But...<eos> But if you insist on...<eos> I do.
Granny's gonna get a liver today.<eos> That was...<eos> Really unexpected.<eos> Didn't see that coming.<eos> You didn't.
Smart.<eos> Hey, you're good at this.<eos> Well, I just have a knack, I guess.<eos> Babies like me.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you do.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
Have a good night.<eos> Enid, you're stable right now.<eos> We've got you on a nitro drip, beta-blockers, anticoagulants.<eos> Yeah, we're concerned you might've had a small heart attack.<eos> What... What do we do now?
I am moving forward... by myself, apparently, because you can't be bothered to sleep at home.<eos> I've had patients.<eos> Every night for the past two weeks?<eos> - You didn't have to stay here.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It's gonna be a long night.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I haven't slept in 48 hours.<eos> Thought I saw you go home earlier.<eos> You did.
Scalpel.<eos> How do you know when you're too tired to operate?<eos> Right about when you make your first mistake.<eos> I hate that answer.<eos> You don't.
I would think that would make him as much my patient as yours or Dr. Hunt's.<eos> But it's still my call.<eos> Look, we've got three attendings here, and a senior resident.<eos> We need to discuss the options.<eos> - No, we don't.
Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when... when you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
Or a manny.<eos> God, no.<eos> You know, if you still want<eos> - that vacation house you can...<eos> - I don't.
Is that unusual?<eos> Well, they've been sharing the same hot tub the last nine months; you can't bust them up right away.<eos> No, I'm not concerned.<eos> Did she tell you what we named them?<eos> No, actually, she didn't.
- how to fix her.<eos> - Sit down, Jack.<eos> She lost a baby, Jack.<eos> You can't just dismiss that.<eos> - So did I. - Yeah.
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?<eos> Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
Well, as I've said, guys, today we'll finish point 2 from the book now that we have the time.<eos> I don't want us to be in hurry at the end of the year facing the selectivity.<eos> Yes?<eos> But you don't follow the book.<eos> Okay, I do it my way.
Because obviously, he's a man but now a woman. Then does she like men or women..?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Anyway, you two are gay. I'm sure it's your thing.<eos> What does it have to do with me being gay?<eos> Of course it does, Bruno.
I don't know. If it happened, go ahead.<eos> But ... I don't know, maybe we can think about it in the future.<eos> Yes?<eos> No, Gina.<eos> I do.
I won't wait until you leave.<eos> Why don't you go live with Coralina those last days?<eos> Since she understand you well.<eos> Have you ever thought that you and Coralina are the same? Don't you say what you think?<eos> So does she.
When I was 11, she gave an unwrapped gift.<eos> Oh yeah? So?<eos> Does mom want to give me gifts?<eos> Look, Pau, I'll get mad.<eos> Of course she does.
Yeah.<eos> I had a good talk with her at the hospital.<eos> Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.
The best.<eos> Well, depends on what your needs are.<eos> But for performance, this is it.<eos> Do you ride?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
Yes.<eos> And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Oh, yeah.<eos> No one can see us from the road, and nobody in the whole world knows about this place, except for me and my best friend.<eos> We built it together.<eos> After my mom died.<eos> Mine did, too.
What the hell was that all about?<eos> Who's Sonia Bloom?<eos> Apparently, Adrian Shaw.<eos> You didn't care about The Coroner.<eos> No, I didn't.
There's a fast track process if you want to adopt.<eos> The one disclaimer I'll throw at you is the court will view you, Gabby, as a single parent.<eos> Even... even though we're living together?<eos> Yes. But here's the paperwork if you want to get started.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
I, for example, just got out of a serious relationship.<eos> With a woman.<eos> So...<eos> Nancy, I had no idea... that you knew anything about this stuff.<eos> I didn't, until your interview today.
You had a pretty big day.<eos> Why don't we start there?<eos> - Gerry, come on.<eos> - You got my note!<eos> - Yeah, I did, Gerry.
- Fine...<eos> - what's the Akkadian?<eos> - It's a myth.<eos> It's an assassin so lethal it's able to reach targets in such untouchable locations that the intel community doesn't believe it even exists.<eos> Yeah, and neither does Snopes, apparently.
They're hitting him in the byre.<eos> Ned and Mickey Joe and all those bullies. They're hurting him!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Barney, did you know about this?<eos> I did not, Mr. Coyne.
Mrs. Coyne.<eos> You knew.<eos> What?<eos> What was being planned.<eos> I didn't.
I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.<eos> I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.<eos> Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.<eos> What you don't know is that he is also a father.<eos> Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I read about him in the police report.<eos> Word was, he beat her, but they could never make a case.<eos> - He had an alibi.<eos> - Yeah, well, so did O.J.
You're spoiling me rotten, Sullivan.<eos> Well, when you're done with that, I'm putting you to work.<eos> We're combing through and searching for any mention of a girl named Meghan.<eos> Meghan have a last name?<eos> She does not.
I made choices.<eos> But you're making choices now too.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Even if I got out today, it doesn't matter.<eos> It never did.
What you doing, man...<eos> Amani Hill, huh?<eos> What, are you running a halfway house for ex-cops now?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> 'Cause before, you didn't.
- It doesn't make sense.<eos> You work your entire career, build a perfect record, ascend to the position of deputy director, and then throw it all away?<eos> Nassar boasted about killing nearly a thousand people.<eos> Atwood knew most of them.<eos> We all did.
Seth, come on.<eos> Like it or not, it is news.<eos> Maybe not to you, but to millions of Americans about to cast their votes tomorrow, the president's relationship with the truth means something.<eos> I like you.<eos> Seth, I really do.
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
Do you know who this belongs to?<eos> Do you?
Why couldn't I have picked them myself?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your office...<eos> you have no pictures in here.<eos> No, I don't.
Because he's one of them...<eos> not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel.<eos> -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
Here I come.<eos> You shouldn't have seen this.<eos> I found you!<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Do you? !
Let's begin.<eos> First candidate.<eos> Joana is done.<eos> Next.<eos> Done, why?
What if he wasn't the target?<eos> The hall doesn't have as many cameras as I'd like.<eos> -What?<eos> That's absurd.<eos> -It doesn't!
Relax your arm.<eos> Welcome to the three percent!<eos> Welcome to the three percent, Michele.<eos> Anyone else in my place would have killed you.<eos> Why didn't you?
So the case had been broken for some time.<eos> Russell was the friend you took to Maui.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> And considering your husband has a memento from the trip, I'm guessing he doesn't know.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
So was Cole right?<eos> Are we measuring them wrong?<eos> No idea.<eos> Do we have any idea why a Wall Street guy was studying this stuff in the first place?<eos> We don't.
That can't be comfortable.<eos> Well, it's better than a standard issue cot.<eos> Military?<eos> Or prison?<eos> I did a couple tours in Iraq.
What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
Any attempt to bribe your fellow juror will result in all of you being held in contempt!<eos> Bailiff, please collect the bribes.<eos> Harvey ate my orange.<eos> No.<eos> So, did you like the movie?
If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk,<eos> Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
- am i, uh... interrupting anything?<eos> - don't you got someplace to be?<eos> - anyplace else to be?<eos> - not really. - I'll be out in a minute.<eos> Do us a favor...
Is there anybody there?<eos> Hello!<eos> Say a word and I'll murder ya.<eos> I'm gonna cut your head off and bury ya.<eos> Don't... peep.
Killed that bodega owner, fled with cash from the register.<eos> Yeah, $207, if memory serves.<eos> Samuel Cruz.<eos> You said he saw the shooter flee the store?<eos> Yeah, he did.
That.<eos> That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, they did not.<eos> They did.<eos> - No. They did not.<eos> - They did. - Uh-huh.<eos> They did.
Who the heck is Torres?<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I ran from you guys.<eos> But do I look like the kind of person that would shoot someone?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't enjoy driving around in Helsinki.<eos> Every house, every road, every place reminds me of some crime.<eos> I don't have that burden here.<eos> When you asked me if I moved here just for mom or if I had a personal reason...<eos> Well, did you?
The name of the Audi owner or I'll pierce your head.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Where is my daughter?<eos> I don't know!<eos> -Who does?
I just need a few days, a place to stay.<eos> Degerman's cottage, perhaps.<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Do you want to know?<eos> -No, I don't.
I can go to St. Petersburg, shake things up.<eos> St. Petersburg yes, shaking no.<eos> -We'll send them an assistance request.<eos> -Do you know how long...?<eos> I do.
And who knows they're empty?<eos> For starters.<eos> I've been on your side in these situations so many times, it's quite interesting to see it from this perspective.<eos> Niko, if we had any information that could help, I'd tell you.<eos> But we don't.
Just take this and get the hell out of here.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> - Hey. What's going on?<eos> - You don't like her?<eos> - Oh, yes, I do
Okay.<eos> - Trust me, you don't want to do that.<eos> - Oh, I think I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Oh, I think I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I'm transferring Emme out of this class.<eos> Fine.<eos> Here's the transfer form.<eos> - Now, we have a reason to party. - Hmm.<eos> No, we don't.
Adam, listen to me, I am the captain now.<eos> Okay, I don't know if this is what you were going for, but I am really turned on right now.<eos> Look, you know what Adam's like.<eos> He-he just says stuff, he doesn't think.<eos> I really don't.
Hey.<eos> Mind if I stay a while?<eos> You know, it's kind of ironic I'm hiding from the media by staying with the media.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> - How you doing?
Did it again, didn't I?<eos> Yep.<eos> But how about we try to salvage the last five minutes of our session and talk about... I don't know, your sleeping problem?<eos> I don't have a sleeping problem.<eos> No, not in here you don't.
But hey, nice middle-class girl, nonviolent, you're looking at, I don't know, if you're lucky, eight years in a white-collar joint.<eos> You'll be out in plenty of time to get your life started again.<eos> But if these FBI agents turn up dead or they don't turn up at all, then you're looking at a life sentence, Lynn.<eos> Supermax.<eos> And nice middle-class girls, ooh, they don't do so well in there.
- Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, I'm gonna look for a ladies' room.<eos> Do they have those in factories?<eos> Uh, we do, yes.
Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
- You don't know that about me.<eos> You're such an amazing imaginary mom.<eos> You don't know anything about me, actually, Kelly.<eos> I do know a lot more about you than I'd like.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
Rob, Rob, Rob.<eos> ...but keeping up with them is a different matter.<eos> - He almost stomped on that.<eos> - Ooh! They didn't put that on the hazard assessment.<eos> - They did, as a matter of fact.
No.<eos> Just, um... trying to get my card to work.<eos> You got to have the right kind of clearance to get in.<eos> Yes, I'm supposed to have all access, so...<eos> Just like you do.
What did it get you?<eos> You're gonna die in here.<eos> Unless you wake up right now.<eos> But I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
We're going to the mall tomorrow.<eos> Can I call you daddy?<eos> Yes.<eos> My dad doesn't love me.<eos> Yes, he does.
You're glad I'm not another psycho hacker hell-bent on ending the world?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That. - Mm.<eos> But, Riley, I will admit, I had my doubts.<eos> He never did, though.
Instead of light, we use electricity.<eos> We use neurostimulation to jump-start his hippocampus.<eos> We send electromagnetic pulses that can penetrate brain tissue.<eos> Even if that works, how do we know for certain that Ryan's memories are still in there?<eos> We don't.
They thought maybe if they brought us out here, it might spark some memories, but...<eos> We should go.<eos> Did we stay for the sunset?<eos> We stayed beyond the sunset.<eos> We did?
They helped us out with the bank job yesterday.<eos> Did they now?<eos> Guess we were just in the right place at the right time.<eos> And where did you say you were from?<eos> - She didn't.
I mean, last time, Louise hijacked the interview, and... and Julia let her do it.<eos> How do we know that won't happen again?<eos> Let me handle that.<eos> You want me to put Dana Hartman back on the air?<eos> Yes, I do, for a good reason.
That the first female to solo anchor the news slept her way to the top.<eos> Well...<eos> Ronald had been harassing me for years.<eos> - You know his reputation.<eos> - I do.
Well, that's a very grown-up concept, Ethan.<eos> No biggie.<eos> My dad was one.<eos> You have a wife?<eos> Uh, I did.
Well, this is just the first step.<eos> We need to show the Senate that if they cross Commodus again--<eos> We already showed them that.<eos> And you think that's enough?<eos> I do.
It's gigantic.<eos> Charles, this is amazing.<eos> I know, when's the last time you cried like that? - Huh?<eos> You cried?<eos> - Damn right, I did.
- Damn.<eos> - Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but... I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> He's not solo.<eos> - You guys came.<eos> - Damn right we did.
That's not a saying.<eos> Why are the two of you suddenly so interested in my love life, anyway?<eos> Because we care.<eos> You don't even know my first name.<eos> Yes, we do.
You want to come?<eos> No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming,<eos> "Watch out, he's right behind you."<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Okay. Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.<eos> Well, I'd like that, too.<eos> In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.<eos> You promise?<eos> I do.
So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
I cannot have him wag for a miracle, James.<eos> - Noted.<eos> Let's go talk to him.<eos> - James?<eos> Fine, you do the talking.
Adorable. Have you been to our dining hall yet?<eos> It's got a robot that serves frozen yogurt.<eos> It's a can't-miss.<eos> Did you get your action figure yet?<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
Yeah. See?<eos> This is the problem.<eos> He thinks that he can just buy his way around the rules.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He does.
No.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> But how do you know that?<eos> I just... I just do.
Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
What does that mean?<eos> You want to stay with me, you got to contribute.<eos> My shampoo girl got pregnant and quit... again.<eos> You know how to shampoo hair?<eos> She do.
And why would that have you so perturbed?<eos> They really weirded me out.<eos> Tick-tock. Tick-tock.<eos> Now, I think I know what has you so distraught, Jim.<eos> You do?
Detective Snuggles.<eos> Nana warned me not to leave my chocolate lying around.<eos> But it was just after Easter, and I had pulled in a big haul.<eos> I never thought that cat would find my stash.<eos> But he did.
Did you not sleep well in Nana's dollhouse?<eos> - Why am I still small, Toby? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe stuff works differently on trolls than it does on humans.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> The gnome! You did it?
But how long will that finger be on your hand?<eos> We have information to suggest the Trollhunter possesses the Birthstone.<eos> They weren't supposed to know about that.<eos> I thought you burned the books.<eos> I did.
-We made it? -We made it.<eos> Holding hands, feeding him bento...<eos> It's as if Arisa likes Arman.<eos> -What?<eos> She does.
Holding hands, feeding him bento...<eos> It's as if Arisa likes Arman.<eos> -What?<eos> She does.<eos> -She does.
That's right.<eos> We haven't talked like this in a while.<eos> We haven't talked like this in a while.<eos> -We don't usually talk so much.<eos> -Yeah, we don't.
Really?<eos> You seem so suave.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I don't talk at all. Should I take this off?<eos> He really doesn't.
Now it's hard for me to talk.<eos> Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> I don't.<eos> -Do you have a girlfriend?<eos> -He doesn't.
Natsumi made... some effort and tried to be friendly.<eos> She did.<eos> She found the meat and said, "What's this?"<eos> -I felt her effort.<eos> -We all did.
-They do.<eos> -They're often called slackers.<eos> -Really?<eos> But really... no one works as hard as you.<eos> -You do good work for us.
I want this party to be epic.<eos> I want hot men and live peacocks and young people that no one would ever think to invite to something like this, because they're under the radar and much too interesting to bother.<eos> They're on the cusp.<eos> Do you know what I'm saying, Liza?<eos> Um, yes, yes, I do.
Guess who's just been promoted to point person on the She-donism party?<eos> What?<eos> Diana is giving up control?<eos> Annabelle wants a younger vibe.<eos> Of course she does.
What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
Those little groupies?<eos> They're disgusting.<eos> And you know the women I'm talking about, yes?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days.<eos> Good luck. Ugh!<eos> Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
We are not gonna let her kill this buzz.<eos> We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.<eos> Thad and I will take Josh and you out to dinner.<eos> Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yeah, uh, maybe the "geh-nocchi"?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "gnocchi."<eos> What?<eos> Why hasn't anybody ever told me this?<eos> 'Cause you do it so cute.
I'm someone who actually enjoys listening to the J Train as it's rattling outside my window because I know that it's filled with all kinds of wonderful people that are just living their lives.<eos> I like smoggy sunsets,<eos> I like smoking pot, and I would much rather experience the world than read about it in some book.<eos> Of course. I know that.<eos> Do you?
I know.<eos> It's hard to believe.<eos> An editor friend of mine discovered her.<eos> This friend needs to get this published.<eos> Yes, she does.
-Who fired the gun?<eos> I was driving, sir.<eos> - Huh!<eos> You were driving? So who fired the gun?<eos> -He did.
Did you tell anyone about Harman?<eos> I never told anyone.<eos> Be honest, and I won't harm you.<eos> I said I didn't tell anyone...<eos> Yes, I did.
Took the blame for your crimes.<eos> To give you a second chance.<eos> Everyone doesn't get a second chance.<eos> Liak didn't get it, I didn't.<eos> But you did.
Okay, that's it in a nutshell.<eos> The decision is entirely yours.<eos> You need time to kick it around.<eos> No.<eos> - No, I don't.
I'll arrange for you to make a statement, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I'm the president, see?<eos> Everything's my fault now.<eos> Hey, do I have time to talk to Jim and Dan and Mike?<eos> - Uh, no, you don't.
We felt they weren't right.<eos> So this is coming from the president?<eos> It's coming from us.<eos> And the painting, she wants that swapped out, too?<eos> Yes, we do.
- Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> You just did.
For the election. This election.<eos> There's an election going on.<eos> Oh, Well... (SCOFFS)<eos> Well, you're asking me a hypothetical question, and I need to answer it as best I can.<eos> Okay, well, you just did.
I think Pennsylvania is the real significant call tonight.<eos> Pennsylvania, you had that as a Meyer win, is that right, Matty?<eos> (STUTTERING) Yeah...<eos> Yes. That's...<eos> Yes, we did.
She said you fucked up, Ben.<eos> And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.<eos> You need to get him out.<eos> - She didn't say that, Gary.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.
I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - I do.
Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - I do.<eos> - I do.
It looks like harlequin Kama-sutra done poorly.<eos> So, I agree, bad culture fit.<eos> I think we all just move on.<eos> Look, I didn't say anything about a culture fit.<eos> No, I did.
What?<eos> Not even to your mom?<eos> We don't say that in my family.<eos> But...<eos> I do.
And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
Okay.<eos> You know, this first week, I'm not even supposed to answer the phone if it rings?<eos> Guess they're waiting to see if I fuck up.<eos> Oh, they are.<eos> So, maybe don't.
Don't say that you have me, all right?<eos> You have me.<eos> And you have... you...<eos> Up till about 10 seconds ago, I was gonna say you have Lynn, but...<eos> Well, I didn't.
Well, it is Halloween.<eos> What are you playing?<eos> Oh, just something I've already beaten about 15 times, I just haven't gotten the perfect score yet.<eos> Here I am thinking you're shaming me by working on the weekend.<eos> Well, I sort of did some work.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Leave me alone for a sec. What's up?<eos> Well, okay, uh, I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, it does.
All right?<eos> Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
It's all good.<eos> Be back soon.<eos> [whimpers] i got to go.<eos> - You know, i'm a writer too.<eos> - Oh, no. No, i did not.
I remember how you used to play.<eos> In high school.<eos> I would listen to you outside of the music room.<eos> I just had the strangest dream.<eos> Well, one time, I did that.
We needed someone to find the arsonist.<eos> Shane.<eos> Tim knew you would do it.<eos> How did he know that?<eos> He just does.
You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you sent us away knowing that he would come after us.<eos> You sacrificed us for Krampus to save your selfish old ass!<eos> Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.<eos> You don't know the forces that you are playing with.<eos> Yes I do.
- He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> - Franklin!<eos> You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid.<eos> You think this guy's going to let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
You think this guy's going to let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> - What makes you so sure?<eos> - Because I know him.<eos> No, you don't.
Tonight, you're a guest.<eos> Daniel?<eos> My, but you've grown into a fine young man.<eos> You know why you're here?<eos> ~ I do.
Perhaps it's easier if... if I show you.<eos> Please, come... come with me.<eos> Please. Come through.<eos> You know, it occurred to me that we only ever had Andre's word that his wife left him all those years ago.<eos> But she did.
Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
You went fishing last summer and to a karaoke festival<eos> The festival was last year.<eos> Inari hasn't been anywhere since Lumi was born a year ago.<eos> You haven't wanted to.<eos> - Now she does.
- No, it doesn't.<eos> - You're right.<eos> No safety locks.<eos> But you have a car seat, right?<eos> - Of course I do.
Nope.<eos> Well, trust me. Hyaaa!<eos> You get the idea.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yes, I do.
He'll be okay with Grandma and Pop-pop.<eos> He'll be great.<eos> They'll spoil him.<eos> Did you guys miss me at all or did you guys just had a blast?<eos> No, we did.
You're lying.<eos> He asked me for a cigarette.<eos> I started smoking when we got here, and you were here, so I said I was out.<eos> I know you started smoking.<eos> Did you?
Are you OK?<eos> You're not... You're staying stoned and you've got enough water and you've got a place to sleep and everything?<eos> Because, you know, because we oughta, all of us, I don't mean to be preachy but we oughta remember, and that means promoters too, that music's for grooving, man.<eos> Music's not for putting yourself through bad changes. You don't have to go take anybody's shit, man, just to like music. You know what I mean?<eos> You don't.
Morning, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Do you still have that newspaper?<eos> Yes, Henry.<eos> I do.
It's rained all winter.<eos> It's only just stopped raining.<eos> You and this other gentleman have been a great nuisance to the army, sir.<eos> These visions you've shown the ministers have convinced them they know how matters stand in Portugal.<eos> They do not.
You did not think to come to war for jokes and picnics, Mr Strange?<eos> I did not consider it.<eos> I'm sorry, Major Grant, I can think of nothing else.<eos> Perhaps you have some Neapolitans among the prisoners?<eos> No, sir, we do not.
Weren't you?<eos> I could see it in your eyes the very first day we met.<eos> Which was Wednesday.<eos> I tried to make you feel safe.<eos> I really did.
Wow, that is one of those words that sounds strange if you say it a lot.<eos> Or even once.<eos> So, you need help salvaging the meal?<eos> - Oh. - I kid.<eos> Of course you do.
All right.<eos> I'm having so much fun right now.<eos> I never want to go home!<eos> I don't have a home!<eos> Shh! Yes, you do!
I don't know if this is a good idea.<eos> Trust me, Bruce.<eos> It has to be special.<eos> Do you think you're the first guy ever to ask her to marry him?<eos> Yes, actually, I do.
Oh, yes!<eos> He has a long memory and well remembers when you were a burgess in the Parliament before this - and how you spoke against his war.<eos> I hope he doesn't think still of invading France.<eos> God damn you!<eos> What Englishman doesn't?
Like when you said it's better to give than receive, I could've said "in the butt."<eos> But I didn't, so...<eos> Class personified.<eos> Look, Ben, do you think I wanted to sell this barbershop to you?<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, guess what, Rita?<eos> You talk like a cartoon dinosaur!<eos> No, I do not!
Thanks, anyway.<eos> Oh, you got plans?<eos> I do not.<eos> Well, don't you want to go to the game?<eos> I really, really do.
Keeps my edges sharp.<eos> That's why I'm so successful.<eos> Forgiveness is for suckers.<eos> Uh-huh. Remind me again where it says that in the bible.<eos> It doesn't.
That's exactly how it would go.<eos> So, what, so then drinks after?<eos> - Yeah, sounds great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey. How you doing, buddy?
Thank you!<eos> Just tryin' to figure out what's wrong with him.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He's got a serious gambling problem.<eos> - He does?
That's funny.<eos> I thought sharks had no natural predators.<eos> I'll take three.<eos> Oh, Buzzy's got a lousy hand.<eos> Yes, he does.
I thought sharks had no natural predators.<eos> I'll take three.<eos> Oh, Buzzy's got a lousy hand.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Oh, yes, he does.
Like he's made out of smoke.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You would have thought I was crazy.<eos> I mean, things like that don't just happen...<eos> Do they?
I think...<eos> Maybe it reacted with something.<eos> Did you know she'd already dosed herself up on paracetamol?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Xbox or iPad.<eos> One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott,<eos> - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.
One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott,<eos> - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.<eos> We don't.
Honestly?<eos> It were all too much for him.<eos> He tried to kill himself.<eos> He thinks I don't know that.<eos> But I do.
He wasn't really able to function.<eos> You know, after his wife died.<eos> He had to take a delivery job.<eos> Do you expect anything in return?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
Now, how much had you drunk?<eos> - A lot.<eos> - A lot of champagne?<eos> - No. - I think you had champagne.<eos> No, we didn't.
I've already gone up and gone.<eos> This is posthumous.<eos> You're not dead yet, Abel.<eos> You still have to eat.<eos> No, I don't.
I was reckless.<eos> This wasn't reckless violence.<eos> It was a controlled use of force.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> Do you?
This is your priest report on your uninvited spiritual guest.<eos> People you hurt or injured while you were possessed.<eos> You're gonna need to make amends with them.<eos> Does it say why it chose me?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Thanks for the Jade elephant.<eos> That's...<eos> J.J...<eos> What do you, want do you want from me?<eos> What do you, what do you...
It was so intense.<eos> Oh, my god, get off me!<eos> Hey.<eos> I have feelings for you.<eos> Ha. I do.
We're just about to start the operation.<eos> I can't take the risk.<eos> Not with kids.<eos> Look, I understand where you're coming from, I...<eos> No offence, but you don't.
But if I don't do it, she dies.<eos> Look, I know this puts you in a difficult situation.<eos> It puts us all in a difficult position.<eos> Yes.<eos> It does.
We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
They don't mean anything.<eos> Then why'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them?<eos> You say you want to stop an outbreak.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> You don't.
Only trouble is, when he catches 'em... He eats the eyes all to himself.<eos> We will definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue is my favorite color, tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Course we do.
"In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He...<eos> He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did.
It was the closest we'd ever come to him, and we never felt further away.<eos> [Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.<eos> Let me hand over my gun.<eos> - You won.<eos> - We both did.
There's no difference between boarders and skiers.<eos> We're all just people with wood strapped to our feet, sliding down a mountain.<eos> I have a dream that one day we will not be judged by the size of our board, but by what we do in the pow-pow.<eos> Because the snow doesn't care who we are.<eos> It does not.
Please tell me you are not gonna buy me another fake purse.<eos> I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now. - Mm-hmm.
Please, kid.<eos> You want this watch?<eos> Yes?<eos> Doesn't this blink?<eos> Even my damned shoes do.
How long would we be here for?<eos> Just for tonight, I promise.<eos> A week or two, tops.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I don't.
Really?<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> I just want to sit here till it's over.<eos> I've listened to this about 500 times, and every time, it's like it's so slow, I feel like it could stop.<eos> But it doesn't.
Free, for your birthday.<eos> There's the birthday boy.<eos> Hey, Carlos.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - How you doing?
There's always something off, isn't there?<eos> What, you think he's shagging the head writer to get more scenes?<eos> That's how it started.<eos> No, I think it's just that I really like him.<eos> Oh, you do.
- Yeah, that's not your place.<eos> I don't think Harry is trying...<eos> Let him speak for himself.<eos> I had no right to hit you, Hugo.<eos> - No, you didn't.
What are you?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> - You want to leave me.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Alice...?<eos> She left me.<eos> She never understood.<eos> - Help me understand.<eos> - You already do.
- We're leaving.<eos> - Sam, we have to go.<eos> Uh, yeah!<eos> - How do we know Alice isn't here?<eos> - We don't.
I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
- No no.<eos> We know how this ends. We are one.<eos> We all want the same thing.<eos> - It is important that you do not feel sad.<eos> - Where does this conversation?
- Look at that.<eos> My plan is working.<eos> Get you over here, hide the A/C, get those clothes off.<eos> You don't actually have an air conditioner, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
I-I just feel like everyone is abandoning me.<eos> Ellie, Andy, Tom, and now dad?<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> Jules, you know how I love having all your friends and family at our house all the time.<eos> - No, you don't.
There's nothing wrong with Stan's school.<eos> She'd never let me move.<eos> Who's gonna invest in a broken-down ambulance that serves wine? Hey. Oh, come on, babe, you know it's true.<eos> Junebug, we don't have a cousin named Pootie.<eos> No one does.
No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom.<eos> She might adopt him. She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
She stayed with him right to the end, though.<eos> We should be thankful to her.<eos> You're right.<eos> She probably didn't visit the hospital very much.<eos> Barely 10 minutes if she did.
Stop saying that.<eos> There are a lot of better places than here.<eos> I'll give you the recommendation he would have.<eos> I know you'll land on your feet.<eos> I always do.
It's a hobby.<eos> I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you to let yourself have a future with me.<eos> Do you want to get married?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
Oh, I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You need a nice massage.<eos> Oh, God, I really don't, Donna...<eos> Yes, you do!
This is where people say they saw the Saskatchawaunch.<eos> Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did. It's probably a stupid bear or a dumb gorillna.<eos> Saskatchawaunches don't exist.<eos> Yeah, but what if they do?
These fucking breasts are too big!<eos> We can take them down a cup.<eos> I want my old ones back.<eos> No, you don't want that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Greasing is good for motion..<eos> Dad stop being so..difficult from last two days not a single piece has come out..!<eos> I don't want to die of constipation!<eos> no one dies of constipation.<eos> Elvis Presley did..
You're doing a chicken and airline miles scam today?<eos> Look, it is a great plan, okay?<eos> We do not have a ton of time to explain it to you, we're busy...<eos> Okay, fine, whatever, I get it, I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Now, let's have a little conversation we should've had a long time ago<eos> What do you want , Piolho?<eos> Why are you always getting in our way?<eos> We love each other, and you have nothing to do with it<eos> Yes I do!
Hmm-mm. So your an artist?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Like my daughter.<eos> Mama likes art.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Dad!<eos> - John.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Danny told me he asked to come home.<eos> He did?
I'm sorry.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
Well, it's good that he hasn't been poisoned.<eos> So the chemicals, the toxins that they found inside the bear...<eos> - Jules.<eos> - they didn't find those inside my son?<eos> - No, they didn't...
Be firm with her.<eos> She is wilful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Do what you fucking want.<eos> I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry. I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
How to kill babies.<eos> How to kill men?<eos> You do belong here.<eos> I know what I've done.<eos> Do you?
You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy. You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?<eos> I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.<eos> I do.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Shh! This is a library.<eos> Do you see what's happening here?<eos> Ron, I need that crotch-blinder.<eos> No, you don't.
Same.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Dude, thank you so much for this.<eos> I really owe you one.<eos> No, you don't.
[door closes] My love, we have to go.<eos> Just put all the candy in a bowl or something.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Did you eat all the candy?<eos> - No. - Did you?
Oh, God! Look!<eos> Look at them.<eos> ~ Ignore them, Colin.<eos> ~ I've got no authority left.<eos> You do, natural authority.
You can do one exam.<eos> Ah...<eos> Maths.<eos> Tell them you want to sit maths.<eos> But I don't.
Did you let me have it?<eos> That was one of your top-10 tirades, I'd say.<eos> You were pounding your fist and shaking.<eos> You called me a heartless thug.<eos> I most certainly did not.
Pep Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez--I made them.<eos> You discovered Selena Gomez?<eos> Different Selena Gomez.<eos> Look, I don't have the money for a raise.<eos> Uh, yeah you do.
How psyched are you about this trip?<eos> April, are you super psyched?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Also you have lipstick on your teeth.<eos> I do?
- Give me a second.<eos> Great job, champ.<eos> Okay, guys, stop picking on him.<eos> Jules, he doesn't know anything about you, either.<eos> Yes, he does.
I have a few tricks up my sleeve.<eos> Like if someone's droning on about their stupid life,<eos> I just pretend something really horrible will happen to my child if I don't listen.<eos> That's not gonna work for you 'cause you don't have a child.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Betty.<eos> Di-Betty, I mean, diabetes...<eos> Which I hope you don't have.<eos> I-I made pie.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
Poolside in her purse.<eos> If I close my eyes, I can still hear them arguing.<eos> My God, she was not a great mom.<eos> It sounded like she had great boobs, though.<eos> - She did. - Mm.
And there it is.<eos> Look, Jules, not everybody needs to have people around<eos> - all the time.<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Everyone does, except for maybe serial killers.
I can't...<eos> It's Sean.<eos> He wants you to meet him.<eos> He says you know where?<eos> I do.
What if it comes back?<eos> What if I die?<eos> - That will not happen.<eos> - You do not know that.<eos> I do.
If we get in, we can use what's inside to bargain our way out.<eos> But Mona said we won't make it to the vault before the power comes on.<eos> Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.<eos> I counted the steps to the vault from the prom room.<eos> - Of course you did.
She wouldn't burn.<eos> It took nine hours before she finally died.<eos> They took her down and cut up her body And placed it in nine unmarked graves.<eos> My granddad says witches don't exist.<eos> Of course they do.
Rolla got killed doing some "i don't need niggas with me all the time" shit.<eos> I'm not the one.<eos> Streets don't got no idea who pulled the trigger on him.<eos> Cops don't know shit.<eos> But they never do.
You obviously know a lot more about the old chap than I do.<eos> The date is on his grave.<eos> Mr Bainbridge says that you're very interested in paganism.<eos> He thinks you have big plans of your own to mark the day.<eos> I did.
That is R2F!<eos> Come on, Gary.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Mr. Briganza, do you think we have world class fighters?<eos> Of course, we do.
I heard it myself.<eos> Get up, son..<eos> Careful..<eos> I heard it myself. His shoulder's broken.<eos> So you did.
I'm not eating 'em.<eos> Hey, now! Hey! Whoa.<eos> Margarita brought you French fries.<eos> You better get fuckin' hungry real quick.<eos> Emiliano, do me a favor.
- I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> Ay, Dios. What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
Healy...<eos> I can't be your marriage counselor.<eos> Translator... for an hour or so, tonight, after dinner.<eos> - Oh, no, I think I have plans.<eos> - No, you don't.
In this grocery store? Mmm. I'm sorry I sold you the fruit.<eos> And, yes, fine.<eos> I will admit it.<eos> I knew it was bad.<eos> I did.
She's trouble, man.<eos> Just like kanan was trouble back in the day?<eos> Like i was trouble when i wouldn't help you kill lobos?<eos> You think i'm fuckin' stupid, don't you?<eos> Just like kanan did.
Yeah.<eos> Like, okay, like, I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now and throw my glass of water in your face.<eos> Right.<eos> But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first, you know what I mean?<eos> Of course I do.
But then out at the mill pond, when I saw the scars on yer back, scars made by a lash laid down wi' such fury... you dinna fash yerself about it anymore.<eos> It was me.<eos> It's my fault that Randall beat ye so.<eos> You dinna ken what you're saying.<eos> But I do.
What are you talking about?<eos> You put I.A. on it.<eos> And now my best friend is the guy on their suspect list.<eos> Nobody is gonna believe that Oliver's corrupt.<eos> - We don't... - Okay?
Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.
He confessed. He took a plea deal.<eos> He's gonna testify against commissioner santana And aidan kelly for a slap on the wrist.<eos> S-so, that's -- that's good.<eos> You think that's good, gail?<eos> Do you?
Your phone's off.<eos> I know. I was in court.<eos> What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
Hi, I'm supposed to give this to you.<eos> Hi, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're already writing another one, they must have really liked your first story.<eos> Oh, they didn't.
Call me Big Jake.<eos> All right, well, tax codes can be a bit tricky around here, Big Jake.<eos> See, once a business hits a 250K threshold, municipality and state taxes can run up to 15%.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Yeah, not a lot of people do.
No, I'm just enjoying my pancake and hoping there isn't a fire.<eos> Oh, very funny.<eos> Hey, look, Zoe, I'm here for you.<eos> I mean, I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Last month you had dreadlocks, now you're a punk!<eos> Stupid pest!<eos> Why do you always befriend weirdos?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Well, okay.<eos> So...<eos> A-after your mother died,<eos> I got to feelin' pretty low.<eos> We all did.
Aye, you don't sound like an islander.<eos> Well, Jamie spent time in France Fighting with the French army with Ian.<eos> Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.<eos> Did you, now?<eos> I did some soldiering myself with the French in Austria.
I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
What's going on?<eos> His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him.<eos> I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!
His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him.<eos> I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
If they had, you would have done the same thing.<eos> Tell me that isn't true.<eos> Somebody has to take the blame for this.<eos> But, Philip, it doesn't have to be Robin.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
All the details you need.<eos> Ivan has been very co-operative.<eos> Please... I am begging you... man-to-man, don't leave me with her. You have no idea what she is going<eos> - to do to me.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Michael...<eos> It's called the chain of command.<eos> You obey the person above you without question.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Yeah?<eos> It's the cameras.<eos> There's cameras all over the place.<eos> What, you think they're locking us in?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Maybe it's because I'm an honest person and I expect others to be honest.<eos> Ha!<eos> Beware of the man who declares himself honest.<eos> I thought you cared about me.<eos> I do.
Ha!<eos> Beware of the man who declares himself honest.<eos> I thought you cared about me.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Did you know that he rewrote the ending 'cause he was afraid that it would cause other depressed people to kill themselves?<eos> Don't you wonder what that original ending was?<eos> But you missed the one th--<eos> When the kid said at thing, you missed it.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm, uh...<eos> I'm wearing jeans and a T-shirt.<eos> Well, take your pants off, then.<eos> You want me to?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
You want one?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - But we need three guys.<eos> - No. No, we don't.
I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.<eos> Two nights ago, it was left on.<eos> Battery drained.<eos> I was so damn sure that I turned it off, you know.<eos> Because I always do.
I suppose I'll have no choice but to sell to them.<eos> That's sure to lose me some friends on the Upper East Side.<eos> But what's to become of this place?<eos> I don't want to tell you your business, Henry, but I feel I owe it to your father to provide my wise counsel at this time.<eos> No, you don't.
- Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Um...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How do you know?<eos> How do I know?<eos> I just do.
What?<eos> Dead?<eos> The police just showed me her body.<eos> I said I didn't know who she was.<eos> In many ways I didn't, really.
To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune.<eos> To lose both looks like carelessness!<eos> Yes?<eos> ~ Ah, Mr McLeod. So, you've seen him, then?<eos> ~ I did.
Giving an innocent man an alibi is disappointing?<eos> Because he is innocent, Ralph.<eos> Ramu didn't kill that woman.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> Really, I do.
Anyway, who ever heard of an American in India?<eos> Look - I'll build you a Taj Mahal.<eos> A palace.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> No, you don't.
Maybe.<eos> - Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No. - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
I just called off our wedding.<eos> - Yeah, I heard.<eos> - You did?<eos> How did you hear?<eos> I just did it.
That's an improvement.<eos> Yeah, well, I guess she saw the video of Deacon and Luke fighting.<eos> Gives her something else to be mad at me about.<eos> Speaking of Deacon, I probably should tell you that he came by today.<eos> He did?
Layla took full responsibility for her actions.<eos> No charges are being filed.<eos> She didn't say where she got the pills?<eos> Says she brought them from home.<eos> She did?
I didn't lie to you.<eos> I just couldn't tell you everything.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I do wanna fix us as a family.<eos> I really do.
I know I can fight this cancer.<eos> But I don't know if I can beat it.<eos> See, the thing is, if I lose...<eos> Well, there was a time that wouldn't have mattered that much.<eos> But it does now.
I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
- in that jam tent at the festival.<eos> - Why?<eos> Is this because of me and my music, or is it because you feel guilty about what happened at the... party?<eos> I mean, does it matter?<eos> It does to me.
I want that contract nullified.<eos> Yeah, but Maddie is my daughter.<eos> You think I want to explode our family?<eos> You think I want to break her heart into a million pieces?<eos> I do not.
I have a song to go finish.<eos> Of all the boys in Nashville...<eos> I think he's a good kid, though,<eos> - and we know ours is.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Much as we both hate this moment, I gotta admit, I love being here to have it with you.<eos> That was pretty perfect, Dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So does this mean you're not gonna tell mom?<eos> No. No, it does not.
It doesn't work.<eos> It never worked.<eos> With modified ammunition it works perfectly well.<eos> Easy, if you know what you're doing.<eos> And you do, Carl, don't you?
You can send out an identifying data and ask metro trains not to stop.<eos> He said it Also, there were flowers in hell.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - I do.
No, thank you.<eos> It's news about your sister who you love.<eos> Think you can spare an hour?<eos> Gallaghers don't do announcements at dinner.<eos> We do blackouts, suicide attempts, but never announcements.
This wouldn't have happened if you'd come to rehearsal.<eos> What the hell's going on out here? !<eos> He's putting on some kind of terrible play.<eos> Do you want to help plan this wedding or not?<eos> Of course I do.
About musicals.<eos> Honey...<eos> I love you, but I'm not that girl.<eos> Do you even know "I'm not that girl" is a song from "Wicked"?<eos> No, I do not.
No, because he refuses to spend money on himself.<eos> Wait till you see what I bought him.<eos> He has such a rugged sensuality.<eos> I mean, I don't have to tell you.<eos> No, you don't.
You've seen it before, but you can't remember where, right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You've got the ring of the Magi!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do!
So you want fame?<eos> Yes.<eos> What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Because I'm married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't.
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
How do you know?<eos> They haven't released anything.<eos> Oh, because I'm a man.<eos> You really want to leave right now, don't you?<eos> I don't. But, yes.
Let me play some.<eos> Let me throw you the ball.<eos> No, I'm cool.<eos> You don't want me to throw you one?<eos> Yeah, hell, yeah, you don't.
How do you think that's gonna look to people?<eos> How do you think it's gonna look?<eos> People are already trying to blame the victim, blame our son. Do you care about that?<eos> Do you... do you care about that?<eos> No, of course you don't, b-because you never did.
I promise I'll pay you back every penny with interest.<eos> I'm not suggesting a loan.<eos> I want to be a partner.<eos> I want a say in how this place is run.<eos> You do?
[Chuckles] Bye, Danny.<eos> All right, man, look, I'm gonna tell you something that you've only heard once before, and it was that time you fell into the dolphin tank at the aquarium...<eos> Brace yourself.<eos> She wants to have sex with you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> That's the fart desk.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
No one.<eos> Bo, if this is about last night I am not in the mood.<eos> I'm here to question Jack.<eos> Oh, when you need his help it's okay.<eos> But when I do...
Fine. I'll be asleep.<eos> Well then... I'll be going.<eos> - No buzzer?<eos> - I used it.<eos> - You did?
I follow my route.<eos> I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose.<eos> Bu! if it did...
I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose.<eos> Bu! if it did...<eos> If I! did... No patients?
Think I'm pleased?<eos> Half of what we do is done out of duty, not our of pleasure.<eos> We're talking about Simon! We can'! be so categorical.<eos> So he has mitigating circumstances?<eos> Of course he does!
If someone learns of this, we'll rot in a dungeon, forever.<eos> With rats, scorpios,<eos> - And rotten meat to eat!<eos> You got it, now?<eos> - Yes, I do.
We'll find out.<eos> Henri.<eos> - I came to say I'm sorry about the window.<eos> - Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> It does.
- Please, can't we just forget this conversation ever happened?<eos> - Nancy, please!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Do you have happy memories of your childhood?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, Mom, uh, let me call you right back.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you went home to crash.<eos> I did.
Why do you want to delete it?<eos> Jackie, it's...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I don't want to have to get into the details.<eos> Oh, you sure did in your letter.
Yes?<eos> You flinched.<eos> - What?<eos> - I felt it.<eos> No, I didn't.
- You said your career's over anyway, so it saves you from having to remember a bunch of bullshit lies all the time.<eos> These people don't want me here.<eos> - Adam just came looking for you.<eos> - Yeah, I saw him last night.<eos> You did?
- Oh, thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - Don't mention it. Okay.<eos> Okay, you just... - You're over thinking it.<eos> Just do it.
Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> ~ Because I had no choice!<eos> ~ More games...<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
What do you want me to say?<eos> Prove to me that you were actually his hostage and not his accomplice.<eos> Do you think I had anything to do with... you saw what happened out there, right?<eos> Right now, we don't know what to think.<eos> Well, neither did he!
Would you follow me?<eos> What is it?<eos> We've confirmed that he was most definitely poisoned.<eos> And we now know who did it.<eos> You do?
It doesn't work that way.<eos> No?<eos> How would you know?<eos> I work in a hospital.<eos> Did work.
So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- Would you rather do it at the police station?<eos> Then you might want to try being a little more cooperative.<eos> I can't remember when I saw her.<eos> Can you think of anyone who would do her harm?<eos> If you do.
I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
Oh, look, L-Lemon?<eos> Now, look, our current situation isn't good for anyone.<eos> Something has to change.<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.
Lavon.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lemon has feelings for Lavon again, doesn't she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I honestly don't.
What crawled up your cunt, bitch?<eos> Hey... I'm leading a tour of the woods in the morning.<eos> And if you wake up and decide to abort your shitty attitude, you're welcome to come.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry. I didn't...
And "X" is very, very sorry.<eos> Just don't do it again.<eos> I won't.<eos> I don't deserve you.<eos> No, you don't.
I can't believe Nina's just a body now.<eos> It kind of always was just a body, but top-shelf all the way.<eos> - Hey, man, have some respect.<eos> - I have extreme respect.<eos> And so did most of the basketball team.
I thought you'd be used to answering to women by now.<eos> By all accounts, your wife that held the purse strings.<eos> ~ She didn't. ~ Working day and night, coming home, leaving your balls by the front door, she'll chop them off, am I right?<eos> ~ Oh, you think, you think I'd kill my wife for money?<eos> ~ Your dad does.
I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind, jessica? You don't seem--<eos> I know you told scottie about mike ross.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I didn't till just now.
I like it here.<eos> ~ And anyway, I wanted him to lock me in. ~ Why?<eos> Because then I'm safe.<eos> ~ You really think you're safe? In here?<eos> ~ Yeah, I do.
The people move so fast, it's scary, I can't go back out there.<eos> Just take a moment, OK?<eos> Do you want to stop?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
~ Your health and prosperity, Ross!<eos> ~ And yours, George, particularly in the light of your recent acquisition.<eos> Ah, my shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> You must take that as a compliment.<eos> Oh, I do.
My finances are, at present... somewhat complicated.<eos> So, I cannot, at this time, join you.<eos> But I wish you well...<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I do, indeed.
For heaven's sake, Francis, who can afford new clothes these days?<eos> Truly, you imagine Demelza won't be trotting out her one good dress and not care a feather what people say?<eos> Well, she should, and if she does not, then she shows her ignorance.<eos> You like Demelza. Mm. Mm.<eos> I do.
George may feel obliged to respond.<eos> Why should he?<eos> Matthew's a cousin.<eos> Did you not know?<eos> No, I did not.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not like you have a right to tell me who I can be with.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
And then she's done.<eos> It's a huge sacrifice, I know, but she saved my life.<eos> What if she would have gotten some hard-ass judge who wanted to teach her a lesson?<eos> She could've gotten a lot worse!<eos> But she didn't.
You can show your gratitude by giving me my share of that thing when you sell it.<eos> And what if I don't want to sell it?<eos> I'm you. Eventually, I get tired of everything and everybody and sell it out for a profit.<eos> You have the same disease.<eos> Everybody does.
Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
- Do I have to go back to St. Bart's.<eos> - No.<eos> I think you're done with St. Bart's.<eos> I told your form teacher she needed to get laid.<eos> She really does.
He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- He's had a few problems.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Shaw was shot in the line of duty seven months ago, along with his rookie partner, Ray Jones, who lost his life.<eos> A lot of cops around here blamed him for his death.<eos> They still do.
- You gotta believe me.<eos> I've heard that you shot and killed five cops in cold blood.<eos> You know me.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> No, I don't.
She told me everything.<eos> My mother died without you there.<eos> For you fucked with your head instead.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She really did it.
Emma, you don't belong here.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> I do belong here.<eos> - Emma, they don't love you.<eos> - They do.
Now, most times, this kind of behavior is indicative of lack of stability, something she's having a hard time understanding, maybe problems at home, or...<eos> My husband and I, we're... working out some things.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I mean, lots of families have problems, right?<eos> Of course they do.
You brought that woman into my house.<eos> Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He did.
- You'd better not be from the bank.<eos> - I told y'all that...<eos> - No, we're from a charity devoted to helping wounded veterans.<eos> I... You know, I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am, I think my friend has the wrong house.<eos> - No, we don't.
- Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm. This is not about nudity, OK? This is...<eos> This is about decency. It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
Goodbye.<eos> Don't have too much fun without me.<eos> - What am I going to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
My bodyguard. Yeah.<eos> - Hello, Kala.<eos> - Papa-ji.<eos> - I had no idea you came to the temple.<eos> - I don't.
I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it...<eos> it worked for a while.<eos> And then one day it didn't.
We appreciate all the information that you've given us.<eos> But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter.<eos> Which is why you're no longer on the case.<eos> You don't have the authority to do that.<eos> Actually, I do.
Buried under a stack of ious made out to Dominic Chan.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be out of that uniform tomorrow.<eos> Still have to write the exam.<eos> [Chuckles] I never would have taken you as someone that believed in psychics.<eos> I don't.
Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> The commander does.
What I did to Finn was nothing like what you did to him.<eos> Don't do this now, Clarke.<eos> I was protecting everyone.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> - You did.
That's a long fucking...<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Mind you, hey, if you have to pick someone to fuck for the rest of your life...<eos> Diana, fucking beautiful.<eos> You did well.
Diana, fucking beautiful.<eos> You did well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She is. And I did.<eos> - You did well.
- I knew how upset you would be.<eos> I didn't want to let you down.<eos> - Let us down?<eos> - My marriage failed, okay?<eos> It did.
You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> No, I didn't. - Yeah.
- So you want me to pay the ransom.<eos> - Not unless you have to.<eos> But there can be no bloodshed and no press.<eos> - I have to say that.<eos> - No, you don't.
You're not really worried about the kids, Gin. It's that study that you're worried about.<eos> I let my kids go for nothing.<eos> I never meant to hurt Virginia.<eos> No.<eos> You never do.
It'll take care of itself.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's a really amazing system you've discovered.<eos> - Do you have a problem?<eos> - Yeah, Cameron, I do.
You know, when we get to DC... we get a fresh shot at putting that bio-weapon together again.<eos> Maybe, uh...<eos> Let's focus on getting there, OK?<eos> I know I don't have a right to ask you that...<eos> No, you don't.
That is the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.<eos> Tim's too busy jerking off, to Asian fairy porn, to notice me anymore.<eos> Do you like Asian fairy porn?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> All men do.
Bad things happen.<eos> But you're forgiven.<eos> That's all the plant is trying to tell you.<eos> It wants to help you, James.<eos> It does.
But you're forgiven.<eos> That's all the plant is trying to tell you.<eos> It wants to help you, James.<eos> It does.<eos> It really does.
You shouldn't have to, because I-I do already know.<eos> Ever since I was a little girl, it's like I-I've been holding my breath... waiting for something, something I can't even put a name to to fall into place so that I could finally breathe.<eos> I know you understand this.<eos> But I-I want to... breathe.<eos> I-I do.
Where does this go?<eos> That's extra.<eos> Extra?<eos> Yeah, you know they always give you extra pieces.<eos> No, they don't always.
Look for yourself.<eos> The buildings, the trash, the drugs... and them mutts want to move these people to our neighborhoods in East Yonkers.<eos> I mean, you want this living next to you?<eos> Huh?<eos> No, goddamn right you don't.
No justice, no peace.<eos> The best thing is, he has to rely on the districts that never vote.<eos> He had everything to the east where no one ever misses an election there.<eos> - 'Cause they give a shit, right?<eos> - This year they do, for sure, Hank.
And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> You really think it could make a difference?<eos> Yes, I do.
Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
Um, you guys are ruining my rehearsal.<eos> Come on, y'all.<eos> I got to get up out of here, man.<eos> All right, we out.<eos> We didn't...
Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
No, man, she definitely has wood for you, but...<eos> I got your back, okay?<eos> Remember that.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And then would take us on a shopping spree. She would sleep depressed for months. And then would throw us a big party for one of our birthdays.<eos> And then leave us on the street corner to buy drugs. Should I go on?<eos> - Have you done any of those things?<eos> Police report says you stole your lover's baby and took him...<eos> I didn't.
Okay, well, it's about to get worse.<eos> Look, i-i-i need to go kiss gainey's bottom, Try to convince him to co-host this game with us.<eos> And i just can't do it alone.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, of course you do!
Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
Well, she is carrying his child.<eos> You're doubting for two.<eos> Where's Bo?<eos> She went Pyrippus.<eos> No, she didn't.
That hasn't changed.<eos> I know.<eos> And I hope that it never does.<eos> Do you think that we can do this?<eos> I do.
Who can go out the farthest on the gantry.<eos> I was out there pretty far one night, and the wind gusted and I slipped.<eos> I fell.<eos> I was falling, and all I wanted was to miss the ground, but I was gonna hit it no matter what.<eos> And then, I didn't.
I let you know me.<eos> See me.<eos> I gave you a rare gift.<eos> But you didn't want it.<eos> Didn't I?
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious, too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Your army is already there locked in cages.<eos> We just need someone on the inside to let them out.<eos> Bellamy.<eos> You have faith in him?<eos> I do.
Have him do it.<eos> Leaving them without power that long would kill them all, and as I said, that's not the mission.<eos> Besides, we lost contact with Bellamy.<eos> What?<eos> We did?
The entire time we were singing I just wanted to turn off that damn boom box and confess my undying love for you and give you the world's most passionate kiss.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, why didn't you?<eos> I wasn't sure if you felt the same way.<eos> And you didn't.
Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
- Tell me how I can help.<eos> - Leave it to the experts, Gordon.<eos> - But -<eos> - In this crisis, you don't want to summon the board.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Do you?
are nothing to me.<eos> Claire, that's not true.<eos> I'm in large part responsible for the way your life has unfolded.<eos> I-I have a responsibility to help you.<eos> No. You don't.
You again!<eos> I thought I made myself clear!<eos> Mr Goodman, please, I know Dennis was using some kind of steroid or testosterone and I think you know that too.<eos> Now, we need to find that missing sports bag.<eos> Do we?
Had he ever mentioned anything about dizzy spells?<eos> No.<eos> Is it my fault?<eos> Please, tell me that I didn't kill him!<eos> You did not.
Hoist yourself up there again.<eos> Come on, lad.<eos> And hike up your shorts, please, before some poor soul falls into your butt crack.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> We do?
Are you serious?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That was ridiculously good.<eos> Look, I already know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself.<eos> He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm gonna radio ahead and make sure you make it out of State.<eos> If not, I'm gonna put out an APB and have you boys rounded up.<eos> And then we'll talk again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
- Geez! - Hmm?<eos> Karl Weathers, that is a good way to get yourself shot!<eos> Your lesser half gave us a key, asked us to look out for you and the little one while he's gone.<eos> Do I strike you as someone who needs lookin' after?<eos> You do not.
[Chuckles] Sleeping in one of these interview rooms - isn't all that relaxing.<eos> - [Chuckles]<eos> Uh, you know, I don't believe in past lives or ghosts or astrology, but this room... it, um, has a weird energy in it.<eos> Sitting in that chair, a person's whole future can change.<eos> Mine did, a long time ago.
Try the pay phone first.<eos> If he's not there, try the car, where he lives.<eos> Pardon my French, but, Au bon pain!<eos> How do I know you?<eos> You don't.
And also, do you mind telling me. What the hell you're doing in houston?<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> No, I think it does matter.<eos> I just drove 14 hours to get here.<eos> No, it doesn't, okay?
I want to know their names, how you met, your mission.<eos> Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with el jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, i... I do.
The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
I'm not gonna argue with you, Rebekah.<eos> I'm just saying maybe it's a public service, but I get why it's complicated.<eos> I mean, it makes sense why you won't kiss me.<eos> It's why I wouldn't kiss you if I wanted to, which I don't. Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't, Marcel.
We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
Danny, that cop?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> What we're planning here requires two things.<eos> No mistakes, and the cops not knowing anything.<eos> They still don't.
A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
What I did saved her life.<eos> She thinks Moira's still alive.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
How did you get him back?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, you didn't kill him.<eos> No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.<eos> And I still do.
She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling and I sabotaged the plane.<eos> The plan... was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> How did you expect to survive the plane crash?<eos> You didn't.
- Let me go.<eos> - Sorry, calm down.<eos> - I want to go.<eos> - I made a mistake coming here.<eos> - No, you didn't.
King, King, King, Reinaldo is our King!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I think you're missing a zero.<eos> - If I liked it.<eos> You didn't?
When you came to see me!<eos> Where?<eos> ! At the institution.<eos> I didn't even know you were in there.<eos> Yes, yes you did. Yes you did!
And her response is positive.<eos> Calm.<eos> There's another visitor.<eos> I thought you said that you didn't know she was there.<eos> I didn't.
Dorothy's probably wondering where you are.<eos> Aschell told me that kid was ready to roll on his brother, and you put the goddamn brakes on.<eos> Well, Aschell was out of line.<eos> I thought you wanted my job.<eos> I do.
I definitely know her. I thought about nothing else for almost four years.<eos> When's the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh -- um... High school. But most of those conversations happened in my head.<eos> Do you really think she, uh, had something to do with this pipeline bomb?<eos> Yeah, we do.
But... how on earth did you two end up an item out of nowhere like this?<eos> I...<eos> Wait, seriously, you really don't know?<eos> No, on second thought, uh, I don't want to know.<eos> No, no, I don't.
I told you-- you don't have to do that.<eos> If you want the job, I do.<eos> It's not gonna be enough.<eos> You know they like Lieutenant Aschell better.<eos> Who does?
Don't go up there.<eos> Junior.<eos> Mac.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I didn't do that, Junior.
Something that gives a sense of the man...<eos> Selfie from the daughter.<eos> Taken and posted on social media about 20 minutes before death.<eos> Well, he looks happy enough, doesn't he?<eos> They both do.
That'll be tough for her.<eos> I know how that one feels.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> Well, it's our understanding that you blamed Owen for the death of your son.<eos> I do, yeah.
Some people say follow the money. I say follow the roses.<eos> When asked about his knowledge of the crime<eos> Dmitri green replied that it wasn't what it looked like.<eos> McGrail then replied, "it looks like something?"<eos> Well, it did.
Am I a lesbian?<eos> Did you want a lawyer?<eos> - Want us to call one of your bosses?<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no. I don't...
There's no record of anything going wrong.<eos> Coaster ran every required pre-ride check.<eos> Proper functionality across the board.<eos> Yeah, it's like it never happened.<eos> But it did.
I'll check it out but you know, Kristin may not be wrong.<eos> You live where you live, you got to worry about everyone else.<eos> You live somewhere else, you only have to worry about yourself.<eos> Understand?<eos> - You do, all right.
- What?<eos> - Don't try to understand 'em.<eos> I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for.<eos> You served.<eos> You do too.
I'm not saying you didn't see it, but no psychic bats 1.000.<eos> You're going after the wrong guy.<eos> And from what I could gather, he's done it before, like, a lot.<eos> How is this guy even connected to Walker?<eos> Something to do with debts.
You'll see how much it'll be worth then!<eos> Why do you like it so much?<eos> Because it's all mine.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> You don't?
Sorry, but you've got to make room for me.<eos> I'm sitting at this table too.<eos> Why do you touch your dick when you talk?<eos> Got the clap?<eos> - Maybe you do.
No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here, with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.<eos> I think he got Number 8 to get rid of a witness.<eos> He didn't call Number 8.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
You've shown up on our radar a few times.<eos> Have you got a file on me?<eos> Why don't we pool our resources?<eos> We both want the same thing, after all.<eos> - Do we?
May I ask your name?<eos> Heidi, sir.<eos> Do you know who I am, Heidi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.
Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.<eos> Have you been watching the news, Heidi?<eos> Do you know what's going on in Pakistan?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
Ready?<eos> One, two, three, owl.<eos> - Ah! - You did.<eos> - You looked just like an owl.<eos> - Who-oo did?
Where?<eos> ( singsongy ) It's a surprise.<eos> ( singsongy ) I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> No, everyone does not.
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> He said he had a conversation with you that was a real eye-opener.<eos> Did you tell him your little tale about the Icelandic condominiums?<eos> Norwegian?<eos> No, I did not.
- Come.<eos> - Do I have to get up?<eos> Yes.<eos> I got a job.<eos> - You did?
That he had the answer to curing all disease... with sound.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.<eos> - Everyone got better.<eos> - But then someone didn't.
- doesn't have to show up for a while.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?
Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.<eos> Yeah, I did.
All right, well, let's go home.<eos> I'll make you pancakes, okay?<eos> How many kids were killed on the bus?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Is that what you want? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
I haven't heard from him since.<eos> Are you absolutely certain about this?<eos> Alexi, go public.<eos> We'll protect you.<eos> Like you did Xander Feng?
- We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.<eos> And so do the Israelis.
Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
Everything was fine until Dances With Wolves showed up.<eos> Everyone looks like someone they're not, you're all afraid of something you don't even know.<eos> And the only person who can help me is some mysterious Maestro that no-one knows how to get to.<eos> or I know someone who does.<eos> You do?
I only got one.<eos> Why are the lights off?<eos> - I don't know. You want a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
Okay, you two, it's time for bed.<eos> But Raul was telling me about his scars. Oh.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.
But Raul was telling me about his scars. Oh.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do... right there.
I probably just bumped into something without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until we figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab if you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
You...<eos> - You don't seem to be...<eos> - Because I knew.<eos> Sean... he told me that he felt something.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
- I'm a party in a purse.<eos> - Uh, we don't have speakers.<eos> Patch it in the PA.<eos> Whoa, genius.<eos> I do my best thinking on the toilet, too.
Bye.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hello, Henry. My God.<eos> So, you remember me?<eos> Of course I do.
I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
But I had my mind set on doing it.<eos> You know, getting it over with.<eos> I mean, that's how I looked at it at the time.<eos> Anyway things progressed.<eos> We did a little car wrestling.
He's funny.<eos> He's so unfunny, Michel what's-his-name.<eos> Wildly pretentious.<eos> He finds wit in his blandness. Why not dump him?<eos> I just didn't.
Should I talk to Esther?<eos> Ask her to write me.<eos> I'd like to see Pr. Behanzin.<eos> Got an appointment?<eos> No, I don't.
Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
- You don't understand.<eos> He is the only person I have left.<eos> - I didn't have anyone when I first came here.<eos> My husband died, I lost my daughter... And I was sure I'd never find her again, but...<eos> I did.
For the babies.<eos> And Fee.<eos> I love you, Sybil.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> But I do.
And Fee.<eos> I love you, Sybil.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> But I do.<eos> I do.
Erm, anyway, it started working right after... ..right after Janet's accident it started working again until<eos> 4.20 was the time of Janet's death.<eos> Oh, tell him about the day of the funeral.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to know about this.<eos> I do.
You.<eos> I produced this voice.<eos> But it's a huge step forward.<eos> We have a name now.<eos> We do?
A song that's a hit.<eos> She my manager now, too?<eos> Porsha, please sit down.<eos> Give us some space.<eos> Every artist from Michael Jackson to Usher did songs by other people.
There is no way Chuckie was smuggling heroin by himself.<eos> - Heroin?<eos> - What's the fuck's the matter with you?<eos> Carl, you have to do the right thing and tell the cops it was you.<eos> - No, I don't.
That's it, that's just it. I can't be helped.<eos> But I want to help you. Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't. But eventually it will be.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
So don't start it.<eos> The way those two investigators sounded, it's a matter of time, Ray.<eos> You put that envelope away.<eos> I'm gonna pretend like you never really thought I'd take it.<eos> I didn't.
What's in it?<eos> What he means is what you got worth taking anymore, Frank?<eos> My associate. His name's Ben Caspere. He was into that sweet Eastern Bloc pussy you all run between clubs.<eos> So, some of you might have girls that know him.<eos> Daniel here did.
Just one question.<eos> Am I supposed to solve this or not?<eos> Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.<eos> Ray accepts dualities must be effected to, uh, serve public interests.<eos> I really do.
I'll wear a red rose in my jacket.<eos> I'll see you coming out of the crowd, a head higher than everybody else.<eos> At first I'm worried.<eos> I can't see you.<eos> But then you do.
- No, I just mean ...<eos> - I can not hear you anymore.<eos> - His parents are here now.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I did not so, buddy.
Again, rude.<eos> It's family money passed down from my father.<eos> But money isn't everything, Bart, especially when you don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> You don't have any family?<eos> I did once, but not anymore.
I just hope I have mine when I'm your age.<eos> So, how long were you planning on staying with us'?<eos> As long as it takes to put Jory into tiptop shape.<eos> He has a bright future ahead of him.<eos> He does.
It'll be your word against mine.<eos> As you like.<eos> I'm sure they'll find my story fascinating.<eos> Wait!<eos> Don't do that.
Jayda, do you know who sent these?<eos> Madison's mom.<eos> Stephanie?<eos> Well, it's just that, well, Erica didn't really like her.<eos> Yes, she did.
I don't...<eos> I don't know his first name.<eos> Richard.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Oh, yeah, most around here do.
- They're looking for Blackway.<eos> - He won a toaster. - He won a what?<eos> - He won that toaster oven.<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> I just didn't...
What are you waiting for?<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have to go with us.<eos> You know that?<eos> Sure, I do.
Eat it, you little bastard.<eos> My mom wanted me to be a butcher, you know that?<eos> Oh, not the butcher story.<eos> I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer." I don't remember what I said next.<eos> No, you never do.
Did you pick it?<eos> I've never had it.<eos> My assistant.<eos> I said I'd be honest.<eos> You did.
When you hide things from us, it makes it a little difficult to trust you.<eos> - You hate Cooper.<eos> You'd say no.<eos> - I don't hate Cooper.<eos> - You don't?
- What the hell was that?<eos> John, it's time to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Huh? This is insane. Did he tell you that I saved his life?<eos> - Hmm? - Yeah, he did.
Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
The lock on your front door...<eos> Actually, I'm not interested in that.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - You need help.<eos> - No, I don't.
We were told that Cheryl squeezed you out.<eos> One week we lost by a point and Cheryl told Craig she had a friend who could do a better job.<eos> But Craig set up the team.<eos> Didn't he have a say?<eos> Yes, he did.
Elaine?<eos> What?<eos> You just said Elaine.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Can't talk about it. Um... I'm here for you if you need me.<eos> I'm ashamed.<eos> You're ashamed?<eos> What... y-you have nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hi. Oh, g-god!<eos> Blanca.<eos> You said i could move my things in here tonight.<eos> Right.<eos> I did.
We didn't have a lot in common.<eos> I'm delightful, and he's a slimy, little weasel.<eos> May he rest in peace.<eos> Sounds like you didn't like him very much.<eos> I didn't.
And that's why i'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, i do.
I'll be right back.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm friends with marisol.<eos> She sent me over.<eos> She did?
[Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street.<eos> You can tell me my dress is ugly, and I can tell you that I don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?
Would you mind?<eos> Not at all.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sweeping.<eos> I just did that part.
You wouldn't have to share with anybody.<eos> So butano and kovic are in business together.<eos> What happens when they start to wonder what's in it for you?<eos> Don't you have work to do?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Two tabs, isn't that a lot?<eos> We don't usually take that much.<eos> I've never taken two at once.<eos> No, please, Charlie, he said he'd be back,<eos> Elliot did.
You asked me before if I had faith.<eos> I remember.<eos> I told you I didn't.<eos> That wasn't the truth.<eos> I do.
You're you're clearly delirious from your time in jail.<eos> I mean, we botched the plan.<eos> You were arrested.<eos> It just happened.<eos> So did this.
You're wanted in the armory.<eos> My love!<eos> My love.<eos> The warriors need your help.<eos> They do?
Chancellor, i can explain.<eos> We'll be back in a minute.<eos> I just have to reset.<eos> You know how vital the neural connections are to us.<eos> I do.
You disgust me.<eos> Meanwhile, the King is bouncing another man's child on his knee.<eos> Your morality will not stand, Musketeer.<eos> How do we know you won't betray us?<eos> You don't.
How many more times do you want me to say it?<eos> No, but you can clearly see that I sent it, right?<eos> And when a text doesn't go through, you get that little red exclamation thingie,<eos> - which, as you can see...<eos> - You did not.
No, but you can clearly see that I sent it, right?<eos> And when a text doesn't go through, you get that little red exclamation thingie,<eos> - which, as you can see...<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did not.
Did you know that when you're not using your chopsticks, you should place them in front of you, parallel to the edge of the sushi bar with the narrow end in the hashi oki?<eos> That's what this cute little thing is called... hashi oki.<eos> I googled it.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> Well, now you do.
Tell me you didn't just bring Scott in this conversation.<eos> No, I'm just trying to explain...<eos> Did you get closure when you met with him today?<eos> I told you I was going to see him.<eos> That, you did.
- Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> You're not... you're not supposed to be in tonight.<eos> Uh, this is true.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
You know, I was talking to Lucy, and she really does feel bad, so maybe you could ease up on her a little?<eos> Mom, we had a nice day.<eos> Let's not mess it up, okay?<eos> I understand why you're upset.<eos> I do. But...
You're only going to make her more upset.<eos> Well, I can't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> I'm taking care of her. I promise.<eos> So, you had a key to the house. Yes.<eos> But a lot of people did.
He was happy.<eos> That's the thing -- the police said my son killed himself.<eos> Now, why would a happy man take his own life?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
You messing with Joss's head...<eos> That's hurting her.<eos> I'm not messing with her head.<eos> No, no, you're trying to control a situation in which you have no control...<eos> Except you do.
I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
Well, I took it.<eos> It's a big hit, actually, should you want to start dating.<eos> Anyway, this guy's anecdote was about his fatty lipoma.<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, I didn't either.
Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it? Did you get it? !<eos> Yeah!<eos> The whole world did.
And the doctor says if everything goes good, I can go home in a couple of days.<eos> Oh! Thank god, because the lighting here does nothing for me.<eos> Yes, your coma has been so inconvenient for carmen.<eos> [ chuckles ] Well, anyway, i have a little announcement.<eos> You do?
My father would be so upset about this.<eos> I think he'd probably be more upset That you and your mom are fighting.<eos> She forbid my marriage before i forbid hers.<eos> I thought you liked javi.<eos> I do.
Monica and Chandler start dating?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You are the worst time traveler ever.<eos> You tell me everything I don't want to know.<eos> And nothing I do.
Bartender, can you serve this melon-head some IQ points?<eos> Sean.<eos> What?<eos> You got a real mouth on you, pal.<eos> Most humans with a face do.
Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
I was thinking... you might want us to...<eos> Now, do it calmly and clearly...<eos> Do you want to marry me? Yes!<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes, I do!
Yeah. Yeah. And also, a lot of the other classes were already full so it was between this and Environmental Studies...<eos> - ...and hippies don't use deodorant, so...<eos> - Do you even know what critical theory is?<eos> - Is that a trick question?<eos> - You don't, do you?
And you have to go to school and learn french.<eos> You need to speak the language with the other children.<eos> Otherwise, we'll have to go back to Sri Lanka.<eos> Do you want to go back there?<eos> Do you?
Here. That's all there is, I swear.<eos> Your son stole 150 grand from us.<eos> If you don't tell me where the money is and I end up finding it in this house, I swear to God... the two of you are gonna be begging me to shoot you.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> ! Do you? !
I don't even know what my job is anymore.<eos> It's all bullshit.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> Do you want to take your dad up on his offer?<eos> Only if you do.
I beat his ass for you.<eos> Don't you blame me.<eos> And I'll do it again.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> He... didn't.
Just let it go.<eos> Okay? It's over for you here.<eos> I'm not leaving again.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't.
I'll get it to the House right away.<eos> - Green light on the release?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't remember giving you my phone number.<eos> You didn't. Your publisher did.
Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
This wasn't the gun that was used to kill Matt Skokie.<eos> This also is not the gun that was in Carter Nix's possession when he was arrested.<eos> Do you understand what the problem is, Hector?<eos> I mean, um, it looked like the gun.<eos> No, it didn't.
He just wants everybody to be happy.<eos> When me and papi would fight, it would really bother Tony.<eos> So, to keep things cool, he would lie for me.<eos> I didn't know I was making Tony feel like he had to protect me all the time.<eos> But he did.
Hurt... Me.<eos> How?<eos> You're the boss... This time. Markham:<eos> So... You got a boyfriend?<eos> No, I don't.
It's all gonna work out.<eos> Come on, papi.<eos> Eat it.<eos> I came here because you and I actually have a lot in common.<eos> We do?
Splendid.<eos> Fetlocks?<eos> - Good. Teeth?<eos> - I lost one.<eos> Ah, so you did.
Never the same rifle.<eos> Each rifle has a character.<eos> You need to understand and handle the rifle as you would your wife.<eos> Do you have a wife, Captain?<eos> No, I do not.
'We are here' to establish the facts of the Queen's infidelity.<eos> You are accused of seducing the Queen at the convent in Bourbon-les-Eaux.<eos> And of fathering her child.<eos> Do you swear to give us the truth of this sordid encounter?<eos> I do.
- Mom?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Monster, do you know where babies come from?<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> He does. He does.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?<eos> It appears quite black.<eos> You've come to wag your finger?<eos> I love a good finger-wagging.<eos> Yes, you do.
Here's what I like, Francis.<eos> I've felt no sympathy from you.<eos> I like that.<eos> Sympathy feels like spit on my cheek.<eos> And I don't do self-pity.
You wanted to see me.<eos> I did.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> You know the legends... of the monstrous Minotaur, of the architect Daedalus, of the labyrinth he designed and built for King Minos of Crete?<eos> I do.
Ah.<eos> She was carrying your child.<eos> I...<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - What if you did?
The Aswang's real too.<eos> Why'd you lie to me?<eos> We were trying to protect you.<eos> How do I know you're not lying to me now?<eos> You don't.
~ Sir!<eos> Commissioner.<eos> Wait!<eos> We do have a suspect.<eos> ~ We do?
Crawford?<eos> As in...<eos> Yes, her brother, Eddie Crawford, who fences their stolen goods.<eos> And you believe Beatrice Crawford has the strongest motive.<eos> I do.
The residue was found only at the insertion point of the knife.<eos> It must have been transferred to the wound by the knife itself.<eos> So the killer was holding the knife in close proximity when he fired the gun.<eos> - That looks rather awkward.<eos> - It certainly does.
No, you don't, ethan. No, you don't.<eos> That is a bad idea.<eos> That is a really bad idea right now.<eos> -I don't give a shit.<eos> -Yes, you do.
I know where you're going with this.<eos> You wanna break in.<eos> I don't wanna break in.<eos> I want to buzz every buzzer until someone buzzes us in.<eos> And then when they don't, yeah.
Oh, you're a Grimm again?<eos> I don't know what you are, but you know what's wrong.<eos> Where's Monroe?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Interpol were pleased to have the killer's weapon.<eos> With untraceable prints?<eos> Doesn't seem much use to me.<eos> - We have faces of all the attackers.<eos> - So does the world.
Tell me.<eos> My whole world exploded in that moment.<eos> I hated you.<eos> And I wanted to kill the son of a bitch she was with.<eos> I really did.
"Why does life suck..." Double underline... "So hard?"<eos> Any thoughts?<eos> Because people are selfish and petty.<eos> I love that passion, but no.<eos> It doesn't?
- Colette says you hate her.<eos> I love your mother.<eos> Does she love you?<eos> Yeah, I think, you know, in a way, yeah.<eos> Sure, yeah, she does.
So, the idiots get to go to class while the bright girl stays at home and takes care of your kids?<eos> What kind of message does that send to Kat?<eos> Or to your daughters, for that matter?<eos> - I'm sorry, I just didn't think...<eos> - Yeah, guys never do.
I could be so much more than what I am.<eos> What does that mean? I don't even know what that means.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> God!<eos> Of course you don't! God!
- Is it Kat?<eos> No, it's not Kat.<eos> This is a really nice office.<eos> Yeah, I thought you would like it.<eos> I do.
Good, good, I think we were able to work through most of his doubts.<eos> Did you tell him about the kiss?<eos> I didn't tell him that. - What?<eos> - Why would I tell him that?<eos> Why not, why didn't you?
What are you doing?<eos> I'm afraid I'm making another mistake.<eos> I don't think of what we did as a mistake.<eos> It didn't work out.<eos> It did...
It's been three days since I've eaten.<eos> I don't have anything, man.<eos> You don't have anything?<eos> A coin, anything?<eos> No I don't.
You don't need to see this.<eos> No, no.<eos> I want to.<eos> You don't need to see this, Mom.<eos> You really don't.
Perhaps today is a good day to thank God for our victory.<eos> Hmm, lucky me.<eos> To have a friend like you, the luck is all mine.<eos> - Cassel will come.<eos> - And if he does not, Sire?
You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> I do!
- I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Ketchup. - Oh!<eos> I put ketchup on my ketchup.<eos> - Those shoes look like they would hurt a lot.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
- How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Do you have rooms available for one night?<eos> - One night?<eos> Yes, I do.
Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
I want to have this baby.<eos> What I feel for you... is real.<eos> And this baby is real.<eos> I know what I want.<eos> But do you?
Oh, Dave...<eos> Dave...<eos> Can you take me back to my room? Sure, sure.<eos> So, does Molly want a bedtime story?<eos> - Yes, I do. - Mm.
Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.<eos> Because you had your client cause one?<eos> No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea.<eos> Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> I do, too, your honor.
We all do, but sometimes you just...<eos> Have to accept not knowing.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You have no other choice.<eos> I do.
No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.<eos> - I didn't manipulate anyone!<eos> - But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't.
You know me.<eos> So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her.<eos> She stopped answering her phone.<eos> I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.<eos> Didn't you?
I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> - So stop trying to change my mind.<eos> - I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?
You know me.<eos> So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her.<eos> She stopped answering her phone.<eos> Sam: I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.<eos> - Didn't you?
I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> So stop trying to change my mind.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?
I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?<eos> You love her.<eos> No. I don't.
Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
Feel free to remarry, and find the kids a good dad. Aah! Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not. - Mnh-mnh.
Hey, give me a second, Zo-Zo, okay?<eos> Happy Birthday, Dre.<eos> Thanks, J.D.<eos> You know I danced for Whodini, right?<eos> Uh... Yes, I did.
Except Eustace kinda runs the show at my house.<eos> I lost the moral high ground once I bought a jet ski in his name<eos> - and ruined his credit.<eos> - You own a jet ski?<eos> Technically, he does.
I lost the moral high ground once I bought a jet ski in his name<eos> - and ruined his credit.<eos> - You own a jet ski?<eos> Technically, he does.<eos> Or did.
Wouldn't let the poor man die until he paid what he owed.<eos> Poor bastard lived to be 126.<eos> 126!<eos> Pops, I think you're gonna be fine.<eos> - You do?
Listen, your mom was thinking maybe we could go to the dance together.<eos> - Oh, I don't know what...<eos> - So you already have a date?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, you do now.
- Still got it after all these years?<eos> - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust. - I trust her!<eos> - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
I can't take anyone else lying to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to tell you one other thing.<eos> If this is about Keisha, I know.<eos> You do?
So, if it was a dude, it would've been all right?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> You got a sidepiece too.<eos> - Hakeem got a sidepiece?<eos> - Yes, he does.
Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO goes through and I die,<eos> Anika will become a billionaire in her own right.<eos> But it will not happen if I can't get... A key man policy.<eos> Does Anika know about this?<eos> No, she does not.
No, the kinetic energy is actually...<eos> Who cares about the face?<eos> All right? The DNA is all that matters.<eos> How'd they screw this one up?<eos> They didn't.
You, Ian.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option, but I know what you really want.<eos> You do?
I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option, but I know what you really want.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.
Of course you know it. - What was his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You're sure? - Yes.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Yes, you do.
- No.<eos> - Everyone called him Mimo.<eos> You don't know him? And you?<eos> You know him? - No.<eos> - You don't?
- He gives us information.<eos> Like which flats we'll raid in Les Agnettes?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - How much do you pay him?<eos> - We don't.
- Milan.<eos> - Yes. - MAN:<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> - I thought I'd found him.<eos> - Did you?
I do miss it dreadfully.<eos> So... Your boy failed.<eos> He was no boy.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> And yes, he did.
It's possible.<eos> No harm will come to you.<eos> You have my word.<eos> She told me she would wear it always.<eos> Who did?
Ah, you are Constance's husband.<eos> I am Bonacieux, the finest cloth merchant in Paris.<eos> Then it's you I'm looking for.<eos> She asked me to tell you she will meet you at home.<eos> - She did?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> There you go.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Why won't you fly, damn you?<eos> You, doing okay over there?
Bravo, bravo, bravo.<eos> Great!<eos> Only the bride miss.<eos> And where there is the bride?<eos> What did with Defne?
Hilda.<eos> You haven't denied it.<eos> Promise not to tell.<eos> Cross your heart.<eos> You do.
You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
So what shall we do now then, Jo?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Go on - you tell.<eos> No.<eos> You do it.
Strong motherfucker.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
How did it all come to this?<eos> I think he is right.<eos> You should call the police.<eos> Hey... I saw it on television.<eos> Everybody did.
The lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack nothing.<eos> He shall feed me in a green pasture and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort...<eos> They will be happy to have you.<eos> But I do not believe.<eos> It does the soul good, regardless.
I'm going to make Slotter pay for every broken bone, for every man left dead in that mine.<eos> He's broken up bad still.<eos> He will heal.<eos> Robin said the angel of death was down there with him, hovering for his take.<eos> I did not.
Go to Rebecca's.<eos> See if you can be of use.<eos> Thought I'd have seen you a couple of days ago.<eos> Word of the mine must not have got to you.<eos> It did.
A genuine investment.<eos> Real capital torn from your pockets, like flesh from bone.<eos> Which deserves consideration.<eos> I should like, indeed, require that consideration... you have already 25%.<eos> I do.
Cut right through it.<eos> Clean cut.<eos> Was a nurse tended him after, made it so.<eos> Didn't suffer then?<eos> He did.
Since we were kids, I love you like a brother.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Always.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do, I do.
Do you know what hubris is?<eos> Do you know?<eos> ! Sorry.<eos> I thought that was another... rhetorical... question.<eos> Yes, I do.
Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> I don't.
But, Harvey, I can't do that without your help.<eos> Look, I know you're riding high, what with getting over on Loeb and all.<eos> But there's one thing you should always remember:<eos> Fly too close to the sun, you're gonna get burned.<eos> - You done?
Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Well, I'm not.<eos> And I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> And if a bus hit me tomorrow, no one would care.<eos> That change things?<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
Jim, I do so love our give-and-take relationship.<eos> But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> You already do.
The beginning of a theory.<eos> Come on, Angie... You need more than that.<eos> You just got back. So why cross the man who's got the deputy chief's ear?<eos> Because the Montgomerys are hiding something, and you know how I feel about secrets.<eos> I do.
- Two, please.<eos> And a diet root beer.<eos> What planet am I on?<eos> I got to get down to the range.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sorry!<eos> Right.<eos> Alec, I want you to run the same tests on the samples we've got from Dawn Ashworth.<eos> - I thought you had a confession.<eos> - We do!
This is me.<eos> This is my unique code.<eos> And this... ..is the code of the killer.<eos> You don't need to be here, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
His own wife, my husband.<eos> He destroyed my family.<eos> Why didn't you tell the detectives five years ago?<eos> Do they know what we're talking about?<eos> We do.
I'm asking around, seeing if I can get you a deal, but guns aren't cheap.<eos> Well, I might be falling into some money soon.<eos> How soon?<eos> You know I'm more the bartering type, anyway.<eos> I do.
- What?<eos> - The Panther member roll.<eos> I want to see everybody who was supposed to be at that meeting last night, and the attendance sheet, so I can see who was not.<eos> You think it was a Panther?<eos> - Your brother did.
Suddenly, I have a "reputation"<eos> for boning other guys' wives and girlfriends.<eos> I can't even get a job.<eos> - I thought you had a job.<eos> - I did.
You know, it makes me happy to think that someone was there, taking care of you.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You do.
And they dropped the charges, but I cannot mess up again, okay?<eos> I can't be arrested again.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now you do.
And won't it be fun to tear it all down? ♪ My poor heart is sentimental ♪ ♪ Not made of wood ♪<eos> Good evening, officer.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> Well, ma'am, there's a small matter of that traffic light you missed back there.<eos> I did? !
The army wanted something that would keep soldiers awake for days at a time, but it failed.<eos> Caused symptoms similar to sleep deprivation...<eos> Anger, hallucinations, psychosis.<eos> If you knew all that, why use it in Finow?<eos> I didn't.
- Not the way I do it.<eos> Five minutes out there and you'd end up in intensive care.<eos> Hey, I handled myself pretty damn skippy against baldy and his tattooed gorilla.<eos> - Tell him, K.<eos> - No, you did.
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Okay, ew, just... What did you get?<eos> Tully really is on an island that he bought with the money that Confed Global is paying him for all his real estate holdings in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Then, that's the link!<eos> I mean, it ties Fisk directly to what's happening in the tenement case.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Hello, handsome.<eos> You're wearing that aftershave.<eos> - You remember?<eos> - Of course, I do.
She already spoke Greek.<eos> Whatever happened to her?<eos> She was smokin'.<eos> Man, it didn't work out.<eos> When does it ever with you, buddy?
I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
Really don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> They started tearing down Elena's tenement building today.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
We're all done, so just take the suitcase to the car, okay?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> So you think you know me now?<eos> You think you know Hillary?<eos> 'Cause you don't.
Darius said that people were getting shot.<eos> I can't be a part of that.<eos> I won't be a part of that.<eos> You have a 10-year-old, Doc.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
This needs to stop.<eos> My son's your responsibility until I say he isn't.<eos> Nurse Polk?<eos> You have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Dr. Ellison.
OK?<eos> Enough of this.<eos> They can't take you away from your home.<eos> - You know how to get out of here? - Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Well, hey,<eos> I know I'm the new guy here, but shouldn't we be calling some Powers for help?<eos> - Yeah. - The first name that comes to my mind is Retro Girl.<eos> She's right, we need help.<eos> No, we don't.
What's the situation with your hair?<eos> Did I call your number?<eos> Are we in a deli?<eos> We are not.<eos> And I did not.
Well, I think that's all gonna change.<eos> But I have one criticism, and do not take this the wrong way.<eos> I'm just saying, maybe tinker with the name of the band, you know?<eos> You don't like "The Wildcats"?<eos> No, yeah, no, I don't.
Had to light my cigar.<eos> Show was just starting.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Nah, you didn't see nothing.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Go get your shade tree back.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hey, by the way, why doesn't it sound fruity when you say that?<eos> You don't have time for the explanation.<eos> - I don't.
- Get his stick!<eos> Come on, you little hicks.<eos> So that is the whole story, it's crazy.<eos> Joe, we love you just the way you are.<eos> We do, Daddy!
Not on my property, you're not.<eos> Oh, damn, Waymond, it just got real out here.<eos> Have you ever seen anything like this?<eos> Anders, do you think we should shut this down?<eos> No, I don't, Montez.
Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
- Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.<eos> - Join the club, honey.<eos> And you're using this, like, for... adult lubricating purposes?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, we both do.
- I struggle to believe you.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> Where were you, in a bunker in the sixties?<eos> That's where the rest of us discovered you don't need a man to define yourself.<eos> No, you don't.
She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
Yeah. It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Jackie...<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
Hey, don't...<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You think you're saving people?<eos> You do, don't you?
Look... When terrible things happen, you have to remember<eos> to look forward.<eos> He didn't deserve to die.<eos> Hey. I know what will cheer you up.<eos> I do.
I went down there to make sure that her window shade was working, and clearly she hasn't slept in her bed.<eos> Her car's still there, so I... Just seems odd.<eos> Did you see her at all last night?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I live, um, over the hill...<eos> South face.<eos> You know, we're neighbors.<eos> Oh. I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors over the hill on the South face.<eos> Well, you do.
I, uh, just talked to Rafael.<eos> And I made a decision.<eos> I'm taking the teaching job.<eos> Look, if I had a talent for writing telenovelas, that'd be one thing.<eos> But I don't, so...
You have been acting so strange since I got back.<eos> I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics Either end up in rehab, in jail or dead.<eos> I chose rehab.<eos> There is no need to give them every single detail, luisa.<eos> In any case, you need a job.<eos> No, I really don't.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Hello, jane.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I thought you left.<eos> Oh, I did.
Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
Just curious.<eos> How do you know for sure you're in love?<eos> It sort of feels like...<eos> Your heart is glowing, if that makes sense.<eos> It doesn't.
And maybe for the better.<eos> Maybe it's time your life changes, too.<eos> I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right?<eos> In grandma's house?<eos> - No, I don't.
Almost every day.<eos> Well, according to the network logs in Evan's laptop, he connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi the morning after the murder.<eos> You still think it's a possibility that he framed himself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You never were.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> There's still time.<eos> No, see, I don't owe you a damn thing.<eos> No, you don't.
How do you know about that?<eos> That's classified.<eos> Where I come from, it's history.<eos> Look, you're never gonna believe me. I get that.<eos> Cassie does.
- You still don't believe me, do you?<eos> I believe that this cult is real, but, no, I don't think you're Marty McFly.<eos> Who?<eos> - Do you think she's already...<eos> - No, I don't.
Seems pretty conservative, though.<eos> Okay, consider my source.<eos> I'm getting fashion advice from Mrs. Purple Doc Martens.<eos> I don't have Purple Doc Martens.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, that was fun, but I feel like I know way too much about all of you.<eos> But, like, not so much about Becca, though.<eos> What?<eos> I drink.<eos> I did, a few...
I mean, we both know the old Becca never would have considered having one.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I mean, what's the point of having a do-over if I'm just gonna be the same old Becca?<eos> Well, let's find you a target.<eos> Whoo! Okay, what do I do?
This is my second chance at life.<eos> I am the new Becca, and I am gonna live this life, and I am gonna have sex with a stranger tonight!<eos> Not him.<eos> Plenty of options here.<eos> Okay, what do I do?
Potential.<eos> I mean, you got a long ways to go, but the foundation, it is there.<eos> You want to feel something?<eos> Do you?<eos> You do.
Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah...<eos> I do.
I'm not angry, Barry.<eos> I'm just disappointed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Does Eddie know?<eos> Yes, he does.
- Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's get practical here, okay?<eos> The stuff you took?<eos> You said you dumped it?<eos> - I did.
I'd say it's time to cut your losses.<eos> That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Eric told me you left.<eos> I did.
It had been a very intense day.<eos> It was an error of judgement but I had her removed as fast as I could.<eos> How am I supposed to deal with this in court?<eos> Do you realise how the defence will use this?<eos> ~ Yeah, I do.
The case is tainted.<eos> Nobody wants to get near it.<eos> That's my failing.<eos> I've got to put it right.<eos> What if he didn't do it?
None of it is true.<eos> Make sure everybody understands that.<eos> ~ Oh, who cares!<eos> Everyone knows what a trial's like.<eos> ~ No, they don't.
~ No-one regular.<eos> Did you fancy her, Ricky?<eos> She was my niece.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> No, you didn't.
I can take a loss, but this one mattered.<eos> Now the whole town knows I failed.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, life does.
What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Something did.
Libby, you look great.<eos> Oh, thanks, sis.<eos> I'd look better with a drink in my hand.<eos> Well, you know where the bar is.<eos> - I do.
But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I don't know... I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
Well, this turned out great.<eos> A romantic dinner with my sister and her husband.<eos> I'm sorry Erica stood you up.<eos> - Can't say I didn't see this...<eos> - Then don't.
You talk a lot.<eos> Hazard of the profession.<eos> If you dig up the mountain where the Lenape are, you wouldn't find any of this.<eos> They have no real Indian ancestry.<eos> Yes, they do.
I know you, Phillip.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - No, you don't. I know you.<eos> I know you. I know you care about people.<eos> No, you don't!
Not to me.<eos> Everyone is always trying to be funny or cool or someone they're not.<eos> The last thing I want is to be with some clown.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Or at least, I did.
No, not "cut."<eos> I'm in the middle of my Juilliard audition.<eos> Hon, I love the spirit and the passion and everything you're doing here, but it's, like, "gag me with a spoon."<eos> Sorry, do you kids still say that?<eos> We never really did.
Excuse me, sir...<eos> Ma'am.<eos> What's going on?<eos> 'Cause we got married here.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Ma'am.<eos> What's going on?<eos> 'Cause we got married here.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Pints taste like a possum's piss over here.<eos> So, we are switching to whiskey.<eos> Ha-hoo! To Martin!<eos> Feel that one going down, don't you?<eos> Yeah... you do.
I promise.<eos> I'll keep it between you and me.<eos> We can play these games all you want but I do not have all day and I think you know exactly what that means.<eos> You really don't want to do this.<eos> I really do.
- It's a conversation, not a decree.<eos> - So he said "no."<eos> It's a scary situation, so that's understandable, but you gotta give me that. Huh?<eos> He'll come around.<eos> - And what if he doesn't?
Unless you protect her.<eos> As, apparently, I no longer can.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is.<eos> You already do.
Marty. Are you gonna start Facebook stalking me next?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, I think you know I'm here.<eos> Yeah, you want that big ol' payday.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm actually scared of you right now.<eos> Good.<eos> Monica: Oh, God. Marty:<eos> Oh, we're gonna make these motherfuckers bleed. You said "we."<eos> I did?
And now I'm paying for it.<eos> I gotta go, kid. He's beside himself!<eos> - You told Sol I kissed Byron!<eos> - I didn't know it was a secret.<eos> - Of course you did!
And half of them did not see DeCarlo with a gun.<eos> The other half are either dead or unreachable.<eos> Which is why I am thinking of a plea deal.<eos> You don't want to plead out a cop killer.<eos> No, I don't.
"Five-o!<eos> Five-o!" That's what you do.<eos> - You run.<eos> - We just wanted to talk to you.<eos> You did?
Okay, well then, just tell me what you need.<eos> I need you to stop looking at me like that. Okay?<eos> Everyone. Please.<eos> There's a uniform posted at the door.<eos> No need to do that for me.
I don't even live there anymore, so piss off, you fucking prick.<eos> Hey! Is there room for one more? I have money, wait...<eos> Somewhere. I have eight or nine here.<eos> How much did you say the rent was?<eos> -I didn't. 1500.
Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do. - Mm-hmm.
"I don't like that guy.<eos> He aplexes me. "<eos> Yeah?<eos> He's going. You want me to follow him or not?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Who in the hell was that again?<eos> - That's Ava's uncle.<eos> He and the other Randolphs never did forgive my deceased brother Bowman for how he treated Ava.<eos> Doesn't seem like that bottle's gonna get it done.<eos> No, it does not.
You know it's gotta be cash and only cash, right?<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.? Hmm?<eos> That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
If you're the key to all of this, then you have to find a way to fight back.<eos> I did.<eos> And he sliced Will in half, right in front of me.<eos> I don't know if I have any fight left.<eos> Yes, you do.
I wasn't sure she'd let me see you.<eos> In your last letter, you said you were doing good.<eos> My last letter out of the dozens that you've ignored?<eos> I wanted to answer them, Emma.<eos> I did.
Brooke, I am not judging you.<eos> After everything that we've been through, I just want to make sure that you're actually seeing this clearly.<eos> Are you?<eos> 'Cause after what happened to Will, it seems like you just need to hold someone accountable.<eos> I do.
He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
And Survivor Girl in the back of an ambulance, just like somebody predicted.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Except today, we're all sitting in the back of the ambulance together.<eos> Well, not literally, 'cause then we wouldn't all fit, but you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
I got an old Texas fix for twisted ankles.<eos> Please.<eos> May I?<eos> - Is this gonna hurt?<eos> - Eh, more than it does right now.
- Okay.<eos> - Spencer... You have to lay flat.<eos> It'll slow the bleeding.<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> Well, of course you do.
What was her name?<eos> The papers didn't say.<eos> Hmm. It's Adele.<eos> Lizzie said that she thought that this Adele might have run off with Spencer.<eos> Of course she did.
- No!<eos> You gave him something over time...<eos> Stop it!<eos> You really think that I'm capable of murdering your child?<eos> I didn't before.
- Good answer.<eos> - That is a good answer.<eos> Well, what about my stuff?<eos> Well, take it easy on her.<eos> You never do.
Was it him or you?<eos> - No one left anyone.<eos> - So why aren't you with him?<eos> - He didn't love you.<eos> - He did.
Sood was becoming a lightning rod for all sorts of other discontents, which, although he played no part in them personally...<eos> You wish to close the book.<eos> To end it, yes.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> ~ You do?
You'll have to speak up, he's a little deaf.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Yes, you do.
There came a man who asked to hire an empty room for a single night.<eos> He paid cash so that the agreement could not be traced.<eos> He offered me 50,000 crowns, and I just needed to let him, -and then come and unlock the next morning.<eos> - It seemed innocent.<eos> - It always does it.
What pawnbroker, what ring, what wedding?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Eva.<eos> If you're making another scene, I want to know what's going on.<eos> - You do? -Of course.
I need to get out!<eos> I just want to be with Eva.<eos> Eva.<eos> You really want to be with me?<eos> I do.
We'll figure out a way to protect you.<eos> We?<eos> He's coming for me, not you.<eos> I know!<eos> You don't.
You wanted to know how many of us there are?<eos> The last time I counted, I had 99 gifted friends in this borough alone.<eos> And now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull.<eos> And they hate attempted murder.<eos> They really do.
Screw it, I'll cancel.<eos> No, things have to appear normal to Kilgrave.<eos> I can help.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't need you.<eos> - Uh, yeah, you do.
No, things have to appear normal to Kilgrave.<eos> I can help.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't need you.<eos> - Uh, yeah, you do.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
None.<eos> But you could potentially change the world.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
See, I hate that.<eos> I want everything to be my fault.<eos> Good or bad.<eos> Means I have some control.<eos> - You don't.
There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
Senior year, this son of a bitch tells you he loves you.<eos> He steals your virginity, knocks you up, and then heads for the hills.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> I wanted to kill him.<eos> I still do.
We don't have time for PR, Milton.<eos> This isn't PR.<eos> We have a contract with the Israeli government.<eos> They're concerned the judges won't ever give us permission to film.<eos> And what if they don't?
I'm orthodox.<eos> I live with a whole host of expectations.<eos> This isn't about just our kiss.<eos> - No, I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
(monitor continues beeping rapidly) Can you come back another time?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why did you lie about the divorce?<eos> I didn't.
Let me guess.<eos> You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As. Ha ha ha!<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I don't get it.<eos> Why would they just leave like this?<eos> I don't know, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, I do.
I did... say that.<eos> It had been a while.<eos> Too long, obviously.<eos> Look, we hunkered in, and we kicked back a couple of beers, waited for George to mosey on home.<eos> But he never did.
You can go anywhere.<eos> You can go to Tulsa or New York or anywhere.<eos> What's in Tulsa?<eos> You told mother?<eos> Amantha did.
We had some good years.<eos> And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back.<eos> You know all about that, Harry.<eos> You know all about the darkness, don't you?<eos> I do.
I haven't got the proof I need.<eos> This, to my mind, is evidence of malpractice but it doesn't actually prove anything.<eos> Geoffrey Inler says he burned the proof seven years ago.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> No, I don't.
- I've got me long johns on.<eos> Tosser.<eos> Hey! What's going on? Ow!<eos> All right, lads. That's it.<eos> Well done.
In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?<eos> We did not.
- Cat, don't do this...<eos> - No!<eos> I am... I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do.
So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
- I have more to lose than you do. - No, you don't.<eos> Ghost ain't gonna kill you if he finds out about us.<eos> I don't need you to be my man, okay?<eos> I'm gonna have to be my own man from now on.<eos> No, you don't.
That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
Turns out I could only save one of us.<eos> I pick me.<eos> So you're completely done with Tommy?<eos> You don't care what happens to him?<eos> No, I don't.
Nice try.<eos> You referred to lunch as "chow time."<eos> Military jargon.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> I did one tour.
Not down the middle; it just nicked the corner.<eos> Regardless, I missed it.<eos> And what's worse than that, I blasted Sergeant Gormley, the guy who hit it on the screws.<eos> I owe him an apology.<eos> Yes, you do.
"What?<eos> It just ended."<eos> "I know."<eos> "I hate hot weather."<eos> "You do?"
It would be too perfect if we saw the stars now.<eos> By the way, Saori, it's your birthday, isn't it?<eos> Today.<eos> Did you forget about it?<eos> Well, everyone did.
What's that doing there?<eos> But...<eos> You told me you like sukiyaki.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.
Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
Cards?<eos> I got Aota and Kawakami of the Giants, but not Mizuhara.<eos> Not baseball cards. I mean bank cards.<eos> Why would I need those?<eos> You don't?
- You will?<eos> - Yes! - Oh!<eos> Do you, Carol, take me, Phil,<eos> - to be your husband?<eos> - Yes, I do.
It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
I tell her that she is.<eos> And I believe that she will be okay.<eos> But I can't control what happens.<eos> - I mean, you know...<eos> - I do.
You're curating the ceremony, arranging the seating charts, not to mention figuring out what you're gonna wear.<eos> Hey, at least I got my tux already.<eos> - She still doesn't have a dress.<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - You don't.
Because that's the deal.<eos> There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go. You know that.<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> But not before your wedding.<eos> And I need to make a decision about what may be the only book I ever write.<eos> I thought you'd decided.<eos> So did I.
You know, who have I become?<eos> Blowing all this money and taking drugs?<eos> I mean, it's all so reprehensible.<eos> Kind of sounds like what our dad was doing the year before he died.<eos> Hm. It does.
He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
Looks like our vics were living pretty much off the grid:<eos> no bank accounts, no tax returns.<eos> Can't find a vehicle registration or driver's license for either one.<eos> Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.
Yeah, I'm gonna have a look.<eos> A quick shop, and then...<eos> No, no, then we'll get it done really fast.<eos> A quick shop, and then the store's closed.<eos> Yeah, because what time does the...
Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- And this is, of course, Wendy Dale.<eos> She's spearheading Mergers and Acquisitions.<eos> Can I grab two of those? Here.<eos> Let's kick this party off with a toast here to welcome the new blood.<eos> - I don't actually...
What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know; I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.
We are here for a very legitimate, non-creepy reason that... Henry will now explain.<eos> We're working on the Aaron Brown murder.<eos> I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed.<eos> Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me?<eos> He didn't.
You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day?<eos> Come on, mom.<eos> I love you so much, Abraham.<eos> Henry: We both do.
You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
Here's to fate bringing us back together and justice served.<eos> I'm not quite sure that's the case.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I thought you had a confession.<eos> We do, but...
Recreationally.<eos> I know what ketamine is.<eos> Did you catch that?<eos> He...<eos> Of course you did.
Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
I already told you, you fucking priss.<eos> You're fucking nothing to me.<eos> I don't fucking want you.<eos> I don't want to come with you to fucking Bristol.<eos> I never did.
You need to de-stress.<eos> Easier said than done.<eos> Prenatal yoga, more sleep, lean on your family.<eos> You have anyone in town?<eos> She does.
I know all about Jess Murphy.<eos> I know you didn't have the jacket.<eos> And I know you didn't kill Tom.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Hey, Stan.<eos> I need to see Sandra.<eos> Of course.<eos> I thought he was gonna pull the trigger.<eos> I really did.
Thank you.<eos> Um, we're gonna need a couple of days here.<eos> Great, I'll pick up his homework.<eos> You know, if you want to watch TV, it's okay.<eos> I don't.
It'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC.<eos> No, these are our customers, and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera.<eos> We spoil their fun, it goes viral in an instant.<eos> You do want the girl, though.<eos> I do.
Have you lost your mind?<eos> Black out an entire city?<eos> Not the whole city, sir.<eos> Just the parts that... Do you have any idea of the panic it would cause?<eos> Oh, we do, sir.
Because it's time to rise up!<eos> Rise up!<eos> Somebody's gotta rise up this morning!<eos> Rise up. You buy all that stuff?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It was unbelievable.<eos> So?<eos> So, what?<eos> Did you win?<eos> No, we did not.
I believe a divorce is what Lady Worsley wishes for.<eos> There will be no divorce.<eos> Was Jane with him?<eos> - Did you see my Mary?<eos> - No, I did not.
I will have this court cleared if there is not order!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Sir, does the plaintiff have your verdict?<eos> Yes, he does, my lord.
I mean, if you can't because of the money, that's totally fine.<eos> No, no, I have a ton of money.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Actually, that's a lie.<eos> I don't...
- Next day shipping, my ass!<eos> I am so sorry for all the trouble, Mr. Pizza Delivery Man.<eos> Here's a really big tip for you.<eos> Oh, well, thank you so much, and I actually have a really big tip for you, too.<eos> - You do?
That was really early.<eos> Who's gonna watch me enslave all these cute, adorable, fuzzy creaters?<eos> I said "creaters." What's a creater?<eos> Cut.<eos> Just do the other guy's line... do Ian's line?
Doctor says that I am fit for duty. He even gave me a letter.<eos> I can't remember the last time I got a note from a doctor.<eos> Um, does anyone else know?<eos> I don't think that's necessary, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
You must really like this. I found a whole case of it in the basement, and I hear it's pretty hard to come by.<eos> It is.<eos> Nicole and I bought that when we spent the weekend at Scarlet Hills.<eos> Chelsea really liked that, too, didn't she?<eos> She did.
Please.<eos> She's alive.<eos> All right, here.<eos> Well, he ain't gonna.<eos> You do it, Charlie.
- Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right.<eos> Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
I found him when I was looking for Dennis.<eos> He was buried.<eos> He needed help.<eos> I had to help him.<eos> No, you didn't.
It's like this.<eos> I wasn't at Operakällaren.<eos> I was with a female acquaintance in Kärrtorp.<eos> A female acquaintance who your wife knows?<eos> No, she doesn't.
"Norrell is too afraid to question why The Raven King "would do such a thing, "too afraid to explore where those roads might lead.<eos> "Afraid it will take us to places we never intended to go."<eos> We must not let this stand. You must not!<eos> Do you really think the Raven King cares what happens to England?<eos> He does not.
He knows you.<eos> Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't.
Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't.
- Are you kid...<eos> I was just trying to help the guy make up his mind.<eos> And, hey... look how it all worked out.<eos> Yesterday you had a huge Jed problem.<eos> Now you don't.
-Get what?<eos> -You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it.<eos> You're stronger than me.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
He became a ball player. He's playing at...<eos> So Suat is dying, huh?<eos> What a man he was.<eos> He used to say nothing would hurt him. He died, huh?<eos> - No, he didn't.
- Took me here forcibly, right?<eos> - Brother...<eos> Tell me if I am wrong.<eos> Have you not kidnapped me?<eos> I did. Yes.
The Raza's gone.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> We lead you into this. If you hadn't taken the time to give us those weapons, you'd never been caught down here.<eos> We wanted to help.<eos> Still do.
That all came out of the restaurant account.<eos> This was her personal one.<eos> Another one of her secrets.<eos> What did you say you were up to last night?<eos> I didn't.
Three jacks.<eos> (Clears throat) Shall we keep playing?<eos> I, um... .. I seem to be low on funds.<eos> But you hold an IOU signed by my father.<eos> Yes, I do.
If that's all it was, then why keep this photograph?<eos> I forgot about it.<eos> I don't want Stanley to find out and get the wrong impression.<eos> So, your husband doesn't know about your history with Mr Lawson?<eos> STANLEY: Yes, he does.
Sorry. Yes.<eos> -What?<eos> -No, it's good.<eos> It's... -Do you not want to?<eos> -No, I do.
She just said, "mm-mm, I love the smell of pussy in the morning!" No, I did-<eos> - Joshua! Don't tell them I said that!<eos> Tell her that her journey's an inspiration to me.<eos> Arnold thinks you've put on weight. He did not say that!<eos> He did.
I could do a speech. - No.<eos> You will not make a speech.<eos> Thanks, everyone, for coming.<eos> Another year older. Yes.<eos> I don't...
-How'd you meet ben? -On grindr.<eos> Then he came over.<eos> -Trust josh to try and have casual sex and then wind up in the hospital.<eos> -He outstayed his welcome, okay? We chatted, it was nice, But I told him I didn't want to see him again.<eos> -But you did.
- You seem distressed.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> What you said makes sense.<eos> It does.
What is this about?<eos> A shipment.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> I... I never did.
Lenny Simmons is a free press crusader.<eos> (Amaro) You, on the other hand, are just Scott Russo's cleaning lady.<eos> He's really worth 20 years in jail?<eos> I swear I don't have the footage.<eos> LMZ does.
- ♪ Go 'head, go 'head ♪ - ♪ It's yours... ♪ You guys sound amazing!<eos> Why don't y'all come sing a chorus?<eos> - Come join in.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> Heck no, I don't.
Literally.<eos> So maybe you could just be a man, and get this done on your own, and not turn your wife into a geriatric whore. 'Cause I am so over it.<eos> ♪ No longer down, I'm moving up higher... ♪ You look good, Keem. Mature and so handsome.<eos> You know, you got to switch up your style sometime, you know what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, I do.
No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.
Pete had the perfect summers.<eos> Pete had the perfect grandparents.<eos> All that money from the bond business, but they loved you anyways.<eos> They had the time for you, until Mommy pissed them off 20 years ago.<eos> They did.
All of it happened.<eos> I told you that I was in love with someone, and what?<eos> You grabbed him out from under me, and you lied about it?<eos> I tried to tell you.<eos> I did so many times.
It's not your fault.<eos> - 'Cause I stormed off.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> None of that matters anymore.<eos> Yeah, it does.
You're a good man, Kevin.<eos> But I spent half my life in jail, Kirse.<eos> So, whatever was good in me, it's been beaten out.<eos> - It never should have happened.<eos> - No, but it did.
How are you gonna teach him about French cooking?<eos> I will get a French cookbook. I'll figure it out.<eos> Why don't you teach him diesel mechanics or karate or something like that?<eos> You don't think I can figure out how to help him be a French cook?<eos> No, I do not.
It just means so much to him, and when I look back, Kristina, if you remember where I was at when we started The Luncheonette, I was terrified.<eos> I know. I get it.<eos> But, honey, you ran the numbers.<eos> I don't think you know how terrified I was when I lost my job at TNS.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while.<eos> And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?
It's just for a little while.<eos> And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.
And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Hey, I thought you stopped reading that magazine.<eos> R-really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You said it was a dumb magazine for kids who play too many video games.<eos> I-I did?
Why is that?<eos> Well, because that's just what I was taught, and...<eos> You were also taught that assault is against the law.<eos> Or do you think it's legitimate to go around hurting people?<eos> No, sir. I do not.
Is it just to think that people can be like that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I know you're a nice guy. You know?<eos> Well, you don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Lose either her bliss or ignorance.<eos> Watch Anna.<eos> Make sure she comes nowhere near this shop.<eos> - But if I had the choice...<eos> - Well, you don't.
This company does not do that for clients anymore.<eos> No, she's not a hooker.<eos> He just thought she was a hooker.<eos> - Okay, super.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Joseph.<eos> Hi.<eos> [Sighs] I know things got off to a bad start with us.<eos> But... I still feel like we have a chance.<eos> - You do?
Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
OK, OK. [straining] OK, I give up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, Daria just texted me.<eos> She wants to know if we wanna come over.<eos> - Do you?
Yeah, she seemed pretty pissed off.<eos> I mean... she said that I lied to her.<eos> And I was just like the others.<eos> Um... then I told her to leave.<eos> And... and she did.
Projects are due Monday.<eos> Monday?<eos> !<eos> I thought we had six months to think of something!<eos> We did, six months ago.
- Yes.<eos> Because you don't want to become close to her?<eos> - But you want her to be close to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm thrilled for you.<eos> Bomb at City Park.<eos> Got your old bosses written all over it.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.
You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did!
Phil?<eos> I called it!<eos> We'll just go over here.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, how you doing back there?
Wait, you used to have a VW Bug?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I used to have a VW Bug!<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
He said he did.<eos> At first!<eos> - Maybe the cops made him talk crap.<eos> - Too easy.<eos> First you do it, then you don't.
Come on, one more big push. - I can't.<eos> - You have to.<eos> You try doing this, you dick!<eos> - She doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do!
You need new papers, a new life.<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.? Hmm?<eos> That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
It freaks me out.<eos> Franny, you're 12 years old.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Besides, I don't really have much of a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
He says he's my father and mother, too, because they died.<eos> He makes me hamburgers whenever I want.<eos> I can't make them anymore.<eos> Do you have a brother?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're not thinking of doing the same thing, are you, Gord?<eos> I couldn't do that to you.<eos> Then drive me into town.<eos> It was the Creekers. Yeah, I know.<eos> You do? How?
- We're less than ten minutes away.<eos> Then we'll get you out.<eos> What about you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Or what?<eos> - Hey! - What are you doing?<eos> He was just asking a question.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yes, we did.
So what's the big deal?<eos> You're gonna get married, eventually.<eos> I don't know if we have to.<eos> I don't know if I want to.<eos> You don't?
Did she hurt you?<eos> She tried to.<eos> - I'm gonna kill her.<eos> - Nick.<eos> I almost did.
It might help verify some of what she's saying.<eos> I'll send a car.<eos> All right.<eos> I think you and Finn are going to get on like a house on fire.<eos> You do?
What suspicion.<eos> If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, let me ask you a weird question.<eos> How'd you know I liked apricot jam?<eos> Everybody likes apricot jam.<eos> No, they don't.
I need, uh, something to write.<eos> A pen and paper.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
She's not a monster, she was just...<eos> Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
No, don't apologise.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> What's it said to you?<eos> Simon has had nothing to do with this.<eos> Yes, he... Yes, IT does!
I mean, do you want to go somewhere?<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.<eos> Really, really do.
Don't talk to me like that.<eos> That's how men talk.<eos> ~ So you do like Grace?<eos> ~ I like Flora.<eos> You really don't.
Every...<eos> Look, last one I had were millennium.<eos> Now, when were that?<eos> ~ I thought I knew you.<eos> ~ You do.
He wasn't all bad, my dad.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Right, who wants to be mother?<eos> You do.
Sure.<eos> You know, you were the one, that night, saying that's why it could never be a good idea, you and Robbie.<eos> What I said the next day, I was just agreeing with you.<eos> I have no memory of that.<eos> Well, no, but you did.
Yeah, well, he's asked me and I've said yes.<eos> I can't... I can't let him down again.<eos> I thought we said we were going to pretend you never told me about Eddie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
~ Good Lord.<eos> ~ I thought you got her through an agency?<eos> I did, she had references!<eos> The agency obviously knows nothing.<eos> Well, presumably they don't
~ So, my God! What happened?<eos> ~ Oh.<eos> Well...<eos> This Holly sounds like she needs her arse kicking. ~ She does!<eos> She seriously does.
~ He did! John did!<eos> ~ When?<eos> When he moved in. At your house.<eos> Greg, when Greg moved in!<eos> ~ John did? !
When he moved in. At your house.<eos> Greg, when Greg moved in!<eos> ~ John did? !<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ John did? !
~ You never wanted me to marry him!<eos> You can't keep saying that, not now!<eos> ~ Who didn't want you to marry him?<eos> ~ She didn't!<eos> Caroline didn't!
You can't keep saying that, not now!<eos> ~ Who didn't want you to marry him?<eos> ~ She didn't!<eos> Caroline didn't!<eos> ~ Didn't she?
Hey, how are you?<eos> You come here often?<eos> I know you guys are just sticking up for Justin, but my dad raised me himself.<eos> I don't really have a choice.<eos> No, you do, actually.
Of course.<eos> It's okay, just keep going.<eos> Hey, man, good to see you.<eos> This your lady?<eos> Damn, Doc, you doing all right.
I am writing you a song.<eos> A song?<eos> Really?<eos> Gee, that sounds like a lot of work.<eos> Yes, it does.
A song?<eos> Really?<eos> Gee, that sounds like a lot of work.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> It really does, Titus.
We'll go dance all night. And then, bing, guess what... It's midnight.<eos> We're pumpkins.<eos> My prom playbook was simple...<eos> Tried to have sex...<eos> And I did.
To collect his share of the take.<eos> Who passes up on that much money?<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> They know where Lomis is, they have to.<eos> No, they don't, Krumitz.
I'm mean?<eos> No, you're nuts, not mean.<eos> So it goes.<eos> - How do you say "nuts" in German?<eos> - We don't.
I mean, we're gonna talk all about individual responsibility. (door closes)<eos> Nothing, huh?<eos> Do you know that I believe in you, Roscoe?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No.<eos> I do not.
You go upstairs, take a look at it.<eos> If you like it, it's yours, and we'll work out the finer details later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really appreciate this.<eos> We both do.
About an hour ago.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> All he said was, you've got Preacher James to thank.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Yes, I do.
They don't?<eos> No, they make up much more intricate schematic plans.<eos> Girls are a lot more complex than boys.<eos> You don't know what girls do to each other. - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
What's the latest with terrance? - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
I got to go see a '67 Cobra.<eos> Gorgeous American car.<eos> Best we ever made.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't, um...
Best we ever made.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't, um...<eos> No, no.<eos> You didn't.
Why do you think people have children when they're young?<eos> Because only the young can raise children.<eos> We can't.<eos> - Harry has problems. - Mm-hmm.<eos> He does.
- Let's just leave it at that.<eos> And to the extent I can keep you out of it, I will.<eos> I don't need to be kept out of it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You do.
Well, his house is, but we haven't found him yet.<eos> You're looking for him?<eos> Well, I was hoping he could... Write me a happy ending.<eos> But that book seems to have great power.<eos> Oh, it does.
- It's Scottie.<eos> - Aw, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this, and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Who?<eos> - Black Benny?<eos> Jakey, don't make me try to throw a drink at you again.<eos> Mm, I don't want you to do that.<eos> - Nobody does. - Mm-mm.
Now... one fell, one fell. Oh, oh. Five-second rule!<eos> You have a girlfriend!<eos> Heart attack!<eos> Kay's got a girlfriend!<eos> No, I don't.
I'm their father.<eos> They're safe with me.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, I guess that's all of it.<eos> If... If I let you go, they're just gonna barge in here and take everything back.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We don't.
I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Thank you, Daniel.<eos> See you next week.<eos> Did Daniel tell you why he had gone to Florida,<eos> Mrs. Talbot?<eos> He didn't.
I asked Daniel.<eos> About Teddy's part?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He didn't, really.
About Teddy's part?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He didn't, really.<eos> Of course he didn't.
He loves you...<eos> Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
But not enough?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure what enough is.<eos> I thought I loved someone once.<eos> Maybe you did.
I'm damaged goods.<eos> Lord, they pick up on them labels, don't they?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Little pitchers have big ears.<eos> They still do.
People suck.<eos> I-I'm just sick about this.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You bought paint already?<eos> I did.
Last night.<eos> The can...<eos> Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
No, they don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Daniel.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I still want to pay you for the paint.<eos> I-I don't...
I don't know that Daniel Holden was ever a part of the old crew, or that there was even an old crew.<eos> But to your point, no,<eos> I haven't spoken to Daniel Holden since... Since high school.<eos> Did you know he'd gotten out of prison?<eos> I did, yes.
We got to follow procedure, Trey.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to stay here while we do this?<eos> Of course I do.
I don't know what to do anymore. Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah? Of course I do.
You're Walt McCready's daughter, god rest his soul.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, I'd offer you a drink, but we're in a bit of a hurry, so what can I help you with, Miss McCready?<eos> You know I own the Bennett land?<eos> I do.
It is.<eos> And maybe it's our kindred spirits that's prompting me to make the offer I'm about to make.<eos> Arlo's home and plot.<eos> You know the land I'm speaking of?<eos> I do.
'Course not.<eos> Those boys don't have no soul.<eos> They don't know what it is to really live it down.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do not, no.
You're gonna be tempted to leave that loose so as to allow a valiant escape.<eos> You best perish that thought.<eos> You got any duct tape?<eos> - Got some over here.<eos> - No, you don't.
- It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there.<eos> I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Uh, no, I di...<eos> Yes, I did.
You all right?<eos> Has Joe said anything to you about marriage?<eos> Oh. I think he's gun shy.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
- Insurgents are loose in the sewers.<eos> Sound the alarm if you see any rebel activity.<eos> On to the next one.<eos> Spectre-5, do you actually know where we're going?<eos> Of course I do.
He's still searching for Kanan.<eos> Move, you stubborn junk pile!<eos> You're gonna get me fried!<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
- Maybe?<eos> All that for "maybe"?<eos> Hera, none of us want to give up on Kanan.<eos> And you think I do?<eos> No, I don't.
Just like your master.<eos> Tell me, Jedi, how did you survive Order 66?<eos> It was your Master Billaba who laid down her life for yours.<eos> Do you remember her last word to you, her last and final breath before she died?<eos> You do, don't you?
You know, I have the box set if you want to borrow it.<eos> Maybe we could watch it together sometime. (Enthusiastically) Yeah!<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> If you... if you want to.<eos> I definitely do.
I'm not judging you,<eos> I mean, I pegged you last night without any judgment.<eos> Why would you judge that?<eos> I didn't.<eos> And I did it on the first night.
The guy we just turned over to the feds?<eos> The guy the feds just released.<eos> There's a lot more you don't know.<eos> Like he wants David Clarke dead?<eos> How did you...
I've been... so busy.<eos> Where... have you been looking for me?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
[chuckles] Oh, gosh.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think that I was talking about you and me, did you?<eos> No. [forced chuckle]<eos> I didn't.
- Hungry?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't like to be sad with other people.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Neither did mommy.
How about "I want..."?<eos> I want... A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.
You are inspiring, too.<eos> In what way?<eos> I need olives, can you bring me olives?<eos> Not again.<eos> You did this a month ago.
I assume Change thinks I sound like distant explosions and crying babies, you know, he's unstable, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, a transcript for Ruffles.<eos> - You think that's our guy?<eos> - I do.
Geller, prisoner ID 042098.<eos> Okay, go on.<eos> Have a nice night sir.<eos> Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?<eos> I do.
Have a nice night sir.<eos> Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?<eos> I do.<eos> Willy Seibert Smith, do you accept that the 13th amendment abolished slavery for everyone but convicts, and that we have no choice but to pay you $0.13 per hour or less.<eos> I do.
You wanted a relationship.<eos> A real one.<eos> It's real.<eos> Do you not think, Honda makes good products?<eos> Of course, I do.
Yeah, I heard there was no paintball.<eos> I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole. Oh! Aah!<eos> Seriously, you don't?
That's a no.<eos> That beleaguered sigh means, no, I can't have black nails.<eos> Don't look at the camera.<eos> You absolutely can, and we all will when our bodies decompose.<eos> Please don't Jim the camera like that.
You literally just defined co-dependence. Here's to synergy.<eos> Oh, look at you. You little helper.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.
Oh, look at you. You little helper.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, Johnny.
I do, Johnny.<eos> We invented a new game.<eos> Celebrity Garrett marriage.<eos> Christian Slater to be your lawfully wedded wife.<eos> I do.
That's a list of things you love about me, yeah.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay. Garrett, do you take Stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife.<eos> Stacy, do you take Garrett to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold and to honor.<eos> Yes I do.
We're treating him like a leap-year baby.<eos> Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.
- You're trying to take advantage...<eos> - Seriously.<eos> The governor is stepping in for an absentee mayor in the city's time of need.<eos> You don't want to make an enemy.<eos> No, you don't.
Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it. Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.<eos> Uh, yes, it does.
My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?
It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.
- Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!
Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I do!
You saw him.<eos> What happens now?<eos> GSW to the torso!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, y-yes, you do.
Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Mike!<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Don't let him strip that from you.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> No, you don't!
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't think Heather fully grasps the unique... Reynolds family connection, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's right.<eos> I don't.
Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Apparently, he fell off a train.<eos> The same 1:30 train that you were on to DC.<eos> They found his body outside of Baltimore.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Your mother is dead.<eos> That creature took over her body.<eos> Her one goal is to turn you.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Councilwoman Faraldo, I worked with Nora Martinez at the CDC!<eos> Hey!<eos> Get his ass out of here!<eos> I believe you know my son, Zack?<eos> Yes, I do.
- sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.
No, thanks!<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Did you hear me ask,<eos> "Would you care for some pineapple?"<eos> No, you did not.
Michelangelo, William Blake...<eos> God knows who else you reminded them of.<eos> And one poor boy... an airman, head bandaged, was weeping in the stalls bar, comforted by an older man... once blonde, now gray, parchment skin and dainty hands... who went on saying, "There, there, Adrian, it's only a play.-"<eos> Which didn't seem to me any comfort at all because if it hadn't been a play, then "There, there, Adrian" wouldn't be so upset.<eos> - Michelangelo, did they?
- $400.<eos> That's five.<eos> You guys mind if I play?<eos> - Nigga, do you even have any bread?<eos> - No, I don't.
Man, we turned up in this bitch.<eos> - We turned up in this bitch.<eos> - All the way up.<eos> All the way. You know?<eos> I do.
How we gonna get home?<eos> Sean!<eos> We'll get home, bruv.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
In the event of a change in circumstances.<eos> I don't understand you. What change?<eos> If your brother were no longer King.<eos> Do you realize I could have you hanged for talking like this?<eos> I do.
With what leverage, Katya?<eos> We don't have any.<eos> Do you want to talk more about what I said to Alex?<eos> - About the affair?<eos> - No, I don't.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
Kinda caught me by surprise.<eos> Oh, no need to apologize. I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no. It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
Two friends who were worried about each other's future?<eos> Well, yeah, that's one perspective.<eos> It just seems like you have feelings for each other.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We do.
Well, yeah, that's one perspective.<eos> It just seems like you have feelings for each other.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We do.<eos> We do?
How do you think we get out of your Christmas parties?<eos> What's with the games, Holly?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to be here.<eos> I really did.
The new you is gonna get laid any time you want.<eos> Is everything okay in there?<eos> Yeah, everything is so good.<eos> - Do you know what EDM stands for?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a...<eos> Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.
Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
But we're still gonna need a code word for your daughter's pussy.<eos> Muff.<eos> Muff is not a code word, asshole.<eos> - They know what that means.<eos> - No, they do not.
We don't have a venue.<eos> What if you host our events and we split the door?<eos> Have your shows here, you mean?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> Do, like, a five show run.
How did you get me out?<eos> Will you stop with that?<eos> No, I'm worried, Ray.<eos> I owe you something, I need to know what it is.<eos> No, you don't.
Ray Donovan. Where's Father?<eos> He said to push the meeting with Mr. Liu.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know, Paige.<eos> The fuck you don't.
Let's get you home.<eos> I'm looking for Tina Harvey.<eos> Drunk bitch headquarters, right there.<eos> So I hear you don't feel like performing today.<eos> No, I don't.
Ray?<eos> Tommy.<eos> How are you, Tommy?<eos> Avi told me you retired.<eos> He did, huh?
- Yeah, shit's running itself.<eos> Ah, what a blessing you are.<eos> - What up?<eos> - These guys have snorted every grain of coke. We got to wind it down.<eos> No, we don't.
You let the business go to shit,<eos> - you're punishing Avi.<eos> - Can't blame me for that.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't have to punish me.<eos> No, I didn't.
You got fucking nothing.<eos> Well, to be more precise, you got 3% of fucking nothing, which is still fucking nothing!<eos> I'm so disappointed in you, Ray.<eos> I mean, you didn't think I'd find out?<eos> You really didn't, did you?
Yeah, the old pistol-whip thing, that's some bitch shit, man.<eos> - I like the suit.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You got the money?<eos> I do.
I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.
No, we don't.<eos> I need to show you something outside.<eos> You said your piece yesterday.<eos> We got nothing more to talk about.<eos> We do.
You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
Yeah, go for it.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You all right?<eos> I didn't know you remembered that stuff.<eos> Of course I do.
Whitney, you look very nice.<eos> - Are we leaving?<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> I thought you didn't want to go.<eos> I don't.
I catch you in the middle of something?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> - This is fucking bullshit.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Don't ever do that again.
And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
that I'm not a real person, that I'm just a... a figment of people's imaginations.<eos> I...<eos> You know, when I was a child, I thought I would do something with my life, I would make a difference.<eos> I was certain of it, certain that I would matter to people.<eos> - And you do. - No, I don't.
He'll have one too.<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> I hated that party.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, you didn't.
Okay, I got it.<eos> I hated that party.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> That doesn't look like good terms to me.<eos> No, it does not.
As Alison, Sasha Grey.<eos> How hot would that be?<eos> Mm, yes.<eos> You know who she is, right?<eos> No, you don't.
No women on the railroad, plain and simple.<eos> The men will ask questions.<eos> I'll keep a tight lip, but that's as far as I go with this.<eos> Now light the damn fuse.<eos> She does good work.
Throw it here.<eos> It's all there.<eos> We've been trying for so long.<eos> You're sure this will work?<eos> It always does.
Russell!<eos> - Russell, he's coming!<eos> Russell!<eos> - Now you see me.<eos> Now you don't!
And what do I do?<eos> I just type that into Google?<eos> Yep.<eos> Boy, she really knows this stuff, huh?<eos> - She does, actually.
- Yay?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I think it's--<eos> - I think that's great.<eos> - You do?
Well, yeah.<eos> I think it's--<eos> - I think that's great.<eos> - You do?<eos> I do. I do, I do, I do, I do.
- Dad hid something in our heads and it needs us all to make it work. - What is it?<eos> I think it's a way to give consciousness to other Synths.<eos> Can you imagine a whole load of new ones being made?<eos> - I mean this changes everything.<eos> - Does it?
We know what you did to Fred.<eos> You'll never see any of us again.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I have the code your father used to make them.<eos> No, you don't.
He wants Beatrice.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
What happens to you when you can't control your power?<eos> I can.<eos> You saw it at the parley.<eos> How do I know you weren't lucky?<eos> You don't.
There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
So, um... We wanted you to be the first to know.<eos> Um... Yeah.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> Hey! I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.
Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> That is for us.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do? You do.
No hard feelings.<eos> Patrick, do you take Teresa to be your lawful, wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?<eos> I sure do.<eos> And, you, Teresa, do you take Patrick to be your lawful, wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?<eos> I do.
I need to call Lena.<eos> I'll let you do that.<eos> What does he think Peterson has on him?<eos> The bullet.<eos> Well, if he does, then Abbott's toast.
Cup your hands and then pound on my chest like this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You've got to do it harder.<eos> You've got to knock all the stuff off the walls in my lungs.<eos> I-I don't...
No.<eos> What makes us not animals is that we make choices.<eos> You can't help what you think, what your impulses are.<eos> We all have crazy ones.<eos> I do.
I've gotta be real. I've gotta be honest,<eos> - and I've gotta be open...<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - with everyone in the church!<eos> - You don't, you don't.
Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Then why did you wear Kevlar?<eos> A shot to the heart would have been too messy.<eos> That's not the way I wanted to go out.<eos> You wanted a head shot.<eos> I still do.
- Yes.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
[ Pounding on door ]<eos> Y'all need to go.<eos> I can't have the police here.<eos> [ Dog barking in distance ]<eos> How you doing, Mrs. Thompson?
Was that your intention... To knock the gun away?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Why not shoot him in the head?<eos> Did you not have a clear shot?<eos> I did.
We could, or...<eos> I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
She'll know.<eos> - She hates me.<eos> - What?<eos> That's not true.<eos> - She does.
You mean as of tonight when I'm doing it instead?<eos> I don't have great taste. So what?<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
- What the fuck did you just say to me?<eos> - Hey, come on, chill, Spencer.<eos> You know I don't talk money without Reggie.<eos> - You hung up on Jason.<eos> - No, I did.
There's work here I believe in.<eos> You took a hit.<eos> You took it to heart.<eos> You have other choices.<eos> We all do.
Do it slowly.<eos> Get back up in here!<eos> Let's go, let's go! He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
Um, and I am good with the expletives and the superlatives and I know I am a quality imperfect soul, but good god almighty, I try, you know.<eos> I put up an awful lot with Vicki.<eos> If these 12 fucking dogs are any indication.<eos> But we have beautiful children.<eos> Oh, my god... you do.
Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - with the males carrying the eggs? - Oh.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now.
Mark entered eight tournaments.<eos> You were not an official for two of them,<eos> - where he finished 83rd and 95th.<eos> - It happens.<eos> Yes, it does.
No.<eos> And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.<eos> Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.<eos> Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.<eos> Nobody does.
Mrs. Lewis was right.<eos> Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.<eos> She was a patient of another doctor in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.<eos> - How did we miss that?<eos> - We didn't.
We both were.<eos> We practically live here.<eos> Though it's obvious we're not talking as often as we should be.<eos> There's security footage if you want to see it.<eos> We do.
- The fact that "your father"<eos> and "murder" are in the same sentence.<eos> We talk about murder all the time.<eos> Okay, it's obvious that something is going on between you and your father and has been for a long time... because you have absolutely no poker face.<eos> Yes, I do.
And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He does.
Hey, Boss.<eos> How'd it go, Lieutenant?<eos> How's Bullman holding up?<eos> He got lucky.<eos> He and Muldoon both did.
I just think we have different expectations, that's all.<eos> How so?<eos> About what this could be.<eos> Hey, I think this could be something serious.<eos> - I do.
There are certain things you have to do to protect your family.<eos> Well, what if it's the other way?<eos> What if you were the one who got killed?<eos> No, no, that wasn't gonna happen.<eos> No, but what if it did?
Because according to the police report he had 80 joints on him at the time of arrest.<eos> And... There's a shirt pocket and two back pockets even though Thomas taught us never to put joints in your back pocket.<eos> So if all the pockets were packed, then he could have had 42 minus a wallet, 32 joints on him at the time of arrest.<eos> - What if he had a bag?<eos> - He didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> I have coffee and tea, if we need it.<eos> - It doesn't matter. Do you have wine.<eos> - No, I don't.
Thanks for tonight.<eos> - Have you worried about it at all?<eos> - Does he know?<eos> Bye.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I don't remember saying it, so it must be fake.<eos> It was real!<eos> (All) Oh! To Terry's kids at their birthday party.<eos> Oh, I remember now.<eos> Oh, do another one.
It was real!<eos> (All) Oh! To Terry's kids at their birthday party.<eos> Oh, I remember now.<eos> Oh, do another one.<eos> Do another one.
I'm pregnant!<eos> I'm fucking pregnant, okay?<eos> You know, you have a real anger problem.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Sixty?<eos> - Do you need money?<eos> - I don't need money from you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Because if you do...
Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
- Because they didn't.<eos> - I hate you!<eos> - Oh, that's great!<eos> - I wish I'd never met you!<eos> - You never did!
- How much is it gonna hurt her?<eos> - It'll be a bit uncomfortable.<eos> She might cramp a fair amount afterwards. - But the procedure shouldn't hurt.<eos> - Mine hurt.<eos> Mine did.
Yes.<eos> Sheila I'm not defending him, but, um... the fact is...<eos> - young men...<eos> - Gerald knows what I mean.<eos> Yes. I do.
That's...<eos> I'll help you with the entrance exams!<eos> But me going to university...<eos> Don't you want to know more about the things you don't know?<eos> I do.
I've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.<eos> What?<eos> I have dementia.<eos> Early stages, but I've got dementia.<eos> No, you don't.
You have to hear what I have to say, and if you still feel the same afterwards, then... fine.<eos> I love you so much for your concern...<eos> But there's nothing we can do about this.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Todd Spanna had an apartment across from Lucas Reem.<eos> One night, he sees Reem hosing blood off his hands, so he calls the cops, turns him in, ends Lucas Reem's run.<eos> Well, it looks like he's turned that into a little celebrity for himself.<eos> Did a couple of talk shows. I think he even wrote a book?<eos> Yes, he did.
Let's go.<eos> You found that in Cruella's car?<eos> David, that belonged to Maleficent,<eos> - you know how much that meant to her.<eos> - I do.
Why is that?<eos> Because everyone describes a different person.<eos> They're just curious.<eos> But... You do have a man... Right?<eos> I do.
I mean, she'd have to have a reason of some kind.<eos> In her deranged logic, she probably thought she was protecting Fred.<eos> She cloaked all of her terrible behavior under the guise of protecting her family.<eos> Well, I know how hard it can be to turn the other cheek.<eos> I really do.
Yeah, I've been eating a lot of stuff that requires spoons for the past week so, um...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Did you know there were two General Tsos, both from the Qing dynasty?<eos> This dish was named for the one that suppressed the Dungan Revolt. No.<eos> But I do now.
Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia?<eos> Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
I'll call you back.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Diane, this is Eli.<eos> Eli, I don't have time right now.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
This is completely unnecessary, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Prima stated on the record he never received an e-mail from Toronto.<eos> Then he shouldn't mind us taking a look at the backup.<eos> You know you only have four hours left, Counselor?<eos> I do, Your Honor.
Okay, good.<eos> Now, can you access the individual e-mail archives?<eos> Mm... I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> It's probably best if we don't talk.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
-Listen, a woman came in Complaining about an incident<eos> -At a hotel last night. -Yeah?<eos> And when i saw a photo of the suspects,<eos> Sarah, they look like that prolethean freak, mark.<eos> They both do. Cal:
-It's a clean cell.<eos> For contacting your dodgy friends.<eos> For scheming and manoeuvring, Setting things in motion...<eos> I have no use for it.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mark?<eos> -Mark, are you all right?<eos> -Go back to sleep.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -(water running) -i'm almost done.
What?<eos> If anybody knows about castor, it's going to be her.<eos> I'm not authorized.<eos> I'm not even supposed to know where she is.<eos> Yeah, but you do, don't you?
There's only one way to launder money.<eos> You pay taxes on it.<eos> You guys need a front, and I'm sorry, Allie, but your garage-made soap's not going to cut it.<eos> - I... I have a plan.<eos> - You do?
No one needs to know.<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
Okay, yeah, all right, okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I'll send someone.<eos> Great.<eos> That doesn't sound ominous at all.<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Until the rug got pulled.<eos> We can't let anything compromise our mission in d.C. Tomorrow.<eos> Don't introduce even a possibility of lexi To your mind, to your heart.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yeah, you do.
How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us Until we know more about it.<eos> How do we know it'll work on the espheni?<eos> - We don't.
You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula Back into its capsule, It suddenly became non-lethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient Lethal to the espheni?<eos> We don't, not yet.
I mean, it's horrible, but it's... admirable in a way.<eos> It's brave.<eos> They don't have a lot of choices.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.
A job and a kid is not having it all.<eos> It's just two things.<eos> And besides, you won't be alone.<eos> You have phenomenal friends.<eos> I do.
Well, you can't stay here.<eos> There's a dust vac over there if you'd like to clean up your crumbs.<eos> Hi. Can I speak with Mr. Perez, please?<eos> You said you were coming to Leila's funeral.<eos> You never did.
You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> My compulsions tell me they're keeping me safe.<eos> They didn't work today.<eos> No, they didn't.
Hands reaching, groping, skin quivering with lust, yearning to be touched.<eos> A whispering so close to your ear that you can feel the hot breath tingle down your spine--"<eos> This does not mean that I forgive you.<eos> I didn't ask you to forgive me.<eos> Well, I don't.
Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
I think what we all want is to uncover the essential link between scent and human sexual response.<eos> Well, that might be what we're interested in,<eos> Virginia, because our work is the work of scientific inquiry, but I think Mr. Logan has other interests.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Another version of the Wash U lab where we first had sex.<eos> "Ground zero" makes it sound unnecessarily grim.<eos> Starting a relationship in a lab is hardly a proper courtship.<eos> We had a courtship.<eos> We did.
Uh... yeah, I'm, uh... I'm afraid so.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You have any kids?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> I do.
Don't you?<eos> Don't you want him to love you more?<eos> The truth.<eos> I do, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him?<eos> Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
- for women...<eos> - But--<eos> Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.<eos> "Do I want to feel sexy and aroused tonight?<eos> Yes, I do."
And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me.<eos> And so, just then, I slipped.<eos> But it was just a slip.<eos> And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense.<eos> It does.
- Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Oh. Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
He-- he told you...<eos> He always tells me.<eos> We've been through this before.<eos> Did you think you were different?<eos> They all do.
The death penalty is undeniably popular.<eos> 32 out of 50 states have it.<eos> 62% of Americans want it.<eos> - Do you know who James Surowiecki is?<eos> - I do.
You just can't see it.<eos> He's so excited about watching you fight.<eos> But I'm gonna lose.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
28.<eos> Martin, I want you to know that I don't want to put any restrictions on you.<eos> You're young and need to feel free.<eos> I know. I mean, I don't have a Teddy, but I have other special friends.<eos> You do?
- Fuck.<eos> Hello, Officer.<eos> Just having a little seat belt problem.<eos> You didn't see that red light, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Walter has a manservant.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
I knew Gold couldn't keep the dragon on her leash for long.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing from you.<eos> But your daughter, I hear, has a talent for finding people.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And I don't have a corner office on Wall Street with a hot assistant who's secretly in love with me.<eos> - This is a wake-up call.<eos> - Yes it is.<eos> - We got to start networking.<eos> - Yes we do.
It seems an age ago, that night in the alley When you came to my aid.<eos> Thank you for being a trusted friend.<eos> A loyal servant.<eos> What i did not know that night Is that you did not need my aid.<eos> Yes, i did, as i do now.
Find out who that someone is.<eos> What memory?<eos> A memory she has no memory of.<eos> You said you had the situation under control.<eos> - I do.
I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9:00.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you.<eos> But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
And I'm not half-demented or bullet-ridden this time.<eos> We're not going to try anything.<eos> Just let her leave.<eos> I don't think she wants to leave.<eos> Do you?
I was always tired.<eos> I could never sleep.<eos> You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.<eos> I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.<eos> He never did.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.<eos> That's a crime, Agent Keen.<eos> Going back to the Cold War, the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders, internal CIA policy, and promises made by every president since Ford.<eos> And you know who kidnapped this agent?<eos> I do.
If this is true and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths, then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good, but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> They don't?
Her heart's in the right place.<eos> So, what was he upset for?<eos> I thought he never wanted it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> He didn't.
It was...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like... the world lit up.<eos> And we were weak, we were daft, we were old enough to know better, it shouldn't have happened.<eos> But it did.
~ Did you hear what I said?<eos> However, today isn't about that. ~ Look... .. please don't take this the wrong way,<eos> ~ but you don't mind if I don't come, do you?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Yes, I do, actually.
You have been there.<eos> And you have been amazing at times, but you have got to get your act together.<eos> And if you don't want to talk about Dad, make sure you write it down.<eos> It's not about Dad, I don't give a shit.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You know what, dude, shut up.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Don't tell me to shut up.<eos> Don't tell him to shut up.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mom, do you remember what year it is'?<eos> It's 2013.<eos> Thank God. You really scared me.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, I don't.
Let's go to your friends.<eos> Well, you have your interview tomorrow.<eos> You don't want me to meet your friends?<eos> I thought you wanted me to meet your friends.<eos> Of course I do.
If we touch anything, that's tampering with the evidence.<eos> Evidence that could convict Ali.<eos> And me.<eos> And I don't have a good alibi.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm not angry.<eos> You're not?<eos> It's a brilliant move.<eos> Jackie must have lapped it up.<eos> Oh, yeah, she definitely did.
Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
Hanna!<eos> Okay, I... I went there to move everything out of the unit.<eos> I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there, maybe her body.<eos> I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.<eos> I didn't.
Right.<eos> So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> The lighting was really good. Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Improper, inflammatory, irrelevant.<eos> Sustained. Do you have any other questions for this witness?<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Do you think Hanna knew about this?<eos> She did.
This chick gets a letter from a pal claiming a death threat, and she never mentions it to the cops for months.<eos> Can we not talk about that?<eos> She's making you and your friends look like a coven of witches.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?
- Why?<eos> No jury is going to be swayed by a witness who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand, and was picking up NPR through her cavity fillings.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We don't have anybody else.<eos> Yes, we do.
Same here.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> Love you. Ah! Ow!<eos> We just had an accident.<eos> Yeah, I did in my pants.
Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
You're not... you're not dying.<eos> You're not gonna wake up gorked.<eos> Shepherd knows<eos> - what she's doing.<eos> She does.
- what she's doing.<eos> She does.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Sure.<eos> - She does!
It's just a basic temporary shutdown.<eos> A cheap trick.<eos> I could not have do anything with them anyway.<eos> What does it say?<eos> What does what?
I don't remember the moment when I reached my limit, but I do remember never being the same.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> You never loved me.<eos> I liked you.<eos> I still do.
It's not my business.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I'm not that fat.<eos> It's OK if Marie says it.<eos> But when I do...
But it was nice.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Is this me?<eos> It doesn't look anything like me.<eos> Yes, it does.
Another one?<eos> Why do you wanna kill yourself now?<eos> I feel bad, I told you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You don't?
And they are resistant to all weather and temperature changes.<eos> They don't need food or water to live.<eos> So much has changed.<eos> Once quiet and comfortable life inside the Wall I want it back.<eos> We all do.
Parker?<eos> Parker.<eos> Tell Laverne to let you out of there right now.<eos> Laverne, did you see who killed Karl?<eos> Okay, you didn't.
I answer, you could charge me with accessory.<eos> Yeah, and if you don't, I charge you with impeding an investigation.<eos> I told him not to do it.<eos> I told him I didn't want no part of it.<eos> None of us did.
"The pathogen doesn't affect human beings exposed to it."<eos> It's abundantly clear that Spivak's development of the LoPS pathogen was and is the primary catalyst for the extermination of all upir.<eos> - Does Roman have it?<eos> - Not to my knowledge, no.<eos> Of course he doesn't.
We have to give up searching for Red.<eos> Times up.<eos> If Rumpelstiltskin has the mirror, why has not he attacked yet?<eos> Because he has not it.<eos> Red does it.
Because he is employing strategy, unlike some.<eos> If we attack him with an army it might trigger his invasion.<eos> It is probably best to destroy the fragment.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - If only you do.
You were there, too.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> I understand, Roman.<eos> I do.
These women are warriors.<eos> They live by the code of the ancient Amazon.<eos> A sisterhood that had each other's backs.<eos> Wow, I wish I had that.<eos> You do!
This is us.<eos> So grown-up.<eos> You drink tea out of a thermos, and you go for... country walks.<eos> I must seem young... compared to the people you work with.<eos> You do.
You don't have to answer.<eos> How do you admit to someone you've never been in a relationship?<eos> Who wants to hear?<eos> And when they do, who wants to stay?<eos> I do.
So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
That's a very peppy perspective.<eos> I'm a peppy person.<eos> I think maybe cheer brain has kicked in already.<eos> I'm fairly certain you've got spirit.<eos> Yes. I do.
And then when I got there she told me there was no point me being there if her mother wasn't.<eos> So.<eos> ~ She said that?<eos> ~ Did she?<eos> ~ Caroline did?
~ Don't I?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?
I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.
More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.<eos> I do.
Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, actually.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Eh, lady.<eos> You and me need to have a conversation about school.<eos> Yeah, we don't.
Do you renounce Satan?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I suppose.<eos> Do you believe in God the Father, creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
This was a ritual... a blood sacrifice.<eos> - Maybe Tetra was trying to help.<eos> - Come on, Mar.<eos> You don't believe anything good could come from something that evil, do you?<eos> But I do now.
Yeah, just one s... Well, look who it is.<eos> I was wondering if I could maybe interview you again.<eos> Me?<eos> I thought you wanted your report to be about a hero.<eos> Yes, I-I do.
This is really beautiful.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> This is my buddy's from Iraq.<eos> I told him I was bringing a very special lady here this weekend.<eos> You did, did you?
They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Agh!<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
And Krieger...<eos> I swear to God, if I catch you near this child again,<eos> But-- and the implied threat here is that I will shoot you in the genitals, and then sit here sipping amontillado sherry while you bleed to death.<eos> Wait, you already knew the code?<eos> Of course he did.
Is I bet the sound an avalanche makes. Uh, no, it's more like a freight train full of tornadoes, which are in turn full of smaller freight trains.<eos> Which are in turn full of shit. Sorry?<eos> She just had a baby.<eos> Ya know...<eos> I didn't.
And maybe we were given this baby for a reason.<eos> April.<eos> You called your mom.<eos> Yeah. People need their mom in a crisis.<eos> No, not everybody does.
He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
Do I know him?<eos> No.<eos> By myself.<eos> You didn't want to see Derek?<eos> I did.
You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was...<eos> I was not a good big sister.<eos> I'm so sorry. Will you forgive me?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - You do?
- It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
You can control what's happening to you, Molly.<eos> The headaches, the urges.<eos> You see that they've already started to recede.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> Yes, you do.
- It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
You can control what's happening to you, Molly.<eos> The headaches, the urges.<eos> You see that they've already started to recede.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
I'm saying I don't care what happens,<eos> I'm not making the wrong decision again.<eos> Shut the program down, Charlie.<eos> You realize we could go to jail for this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Jumping at shadows.<eos> I think I know what Mr. Smythe was burning.<eos> Try to stay calm.<eos> Father Brown always has a plan.<eos> You do, don't you?
Where he removed the dressing, no doubt realising his wound was far more serious than he thought, burned the evidence, then cried bloody murder.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> That doesn't explain why you agreed to marry him.<eos> Yes, it does.
If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
Which way, Molly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This room was supposed to only have one doorway, not three.<eos> I thought you said you had this place memorized.<eos> I did.
- You don't... have to do this.<eos> - I have orders.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> Yes, you do.
Now I'm not.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
A medical improbability.<eos> That's what he called it.<eos> And I told you we could raise Siamese cats for all I care.<eos> But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.
If it's true.<eos> But if it's true, don't you want to be part of it and away from all the corruption and misery out there?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I want to believe.<eos> I truly do.
I'm really tired.<eos> Pretty much been... been harvesting nonstop, you know, and Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant.<eos> That's not going so well, plus the Rams have had a terrible start to their season, so this whole utopia thing's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now.<eos> You obviously didn't come here to talk about football.<eos> No, I didn't.
- How are you?<eos> - How are you doing? - What's going on?<eos> Hey, look at the little chief.<eos> He's even got the old man's furrowed brow.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Anyone? Ah, yes, please.<eos> Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
Because you taught me that.<eos> I saw you get up early in the morning to go to the shop.<eos> I saw you come home late from the union meetings.<eos> It made an impression.<eos> It still does.
Know what?<eos> I suggest you take a look at the original articles of 1783.<eos> Should either side be victor for ten successive years, they claim ownership of the land in perpetuity.<eos> ~ Did you know about this?<eos> ~ No, I didn't.
But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I don't know- - I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
But what... what's happening here?<eos> Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.<eos> We do things together.<eos> You think 20 years just happens?<eos> No, it does not.
Just take her hand.<eos> I want to stop.<eos> If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.<eos> I don't want to learn.<eos> Yes, you do.
I swear.<eos> I'm only here to broker peace.<eos> Well, peace requires a compromise, which is something our dear mother is utterly incapable of.<eos> Be that as it may, she does have your best interests at heart.<eos> Does she, now?
And we just didn't know it.<eos> We should be pirates, not farmers or watchers or judges.<eos> Connie.<eos> You don't even know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Richie.<eos> Hi.<eos> You got pictures from the barbecue?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm your best friend?<eos> That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.
I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.
Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
And yet, we do.<eos> And it's good.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Gary Weschler thinks I'm good?<eos> Yes, he does.
I mean, of course I wish I was pregnant, but I'm not.<eos> Let's have one of our legendary nights.<eos> Remember when we stole your dad's pickup and we drove to Vegas, but we just stayed in the car 'cause we were too young to do anything?<eos> We saw stuff out the window, though.<eos> Yeah, we did.
But I'm not one of you.<eos> I'm just a nobody from the streets.<eos> My father recruited you, trained you.<eos> I've known you since we were children, and I know there's greatness in you.<eos> Maybe you do, but the rest of them...
I think you need to ask yourself why.<eos> Mr. Avery.<eos> I never got to thank you for all you did to find Clara.<eos> You don't need to.<eos> Yes, I do.
Are you counting on my son?<eos> 'Cause there's something you should know.<eos> He's never had the nerve to go up against his father.<eos> All right?<eos> He still doesn't.
I knew he would.<eos> I've known guys like this my whole life.<eos> I went straight at him, he slipped every punch.<eos> I don't know what happened up there.<eos> Oh, I do.
Right. So somebody stole your mallet, then killed Justine with it, and then what?<eos> Planted it back on you?<eos> Okay, I shouldn't have lied.<eos> But I was scared that you would think that I killed Justine.<eos> We do.
Yeah, why not?<eos> Oh, man. Wait till they see--<eos> Wait, that's how you ask a woman out?<eos> Yes. Wait, no, I don't need a back-story.<eos> Yes you do.
It gets the job done.<eos> What kind of photography are you into?<eos> A little bit of everything. Well, it has good color reproduction, nice tonal range.<eos> Um, you'll want to shoot raw if you don't want the highlights to get clipped, and...<eos> No. No, I don't.
She's in there right now.<eos> Says her husband's a saint.<eos> How he can't change a light bulb.<eos> She doesn't think he was our mastermind.<eos> No, she does not.
Bentley Duke has invited me to go shooting on his estate.<eos> Bentley Duke?<eos> What, the theatrical impresario?<eos> But, My Lord, you loathe the theatre.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.
I think marriage is sacred, Mr Redhill.<eos> ~ Well, that is not quite the same thing.<eos> ~ Peter...<eos> You said in The Times, and I quote, that "we should treat the ending of a marriage as seriously as the death of a person."<eos> I did indeed.
Did you have to administer gas or any meds?<eos> She needed a filling in her lower second molar, so there was some Lidocaine and there was some nitrous, but they wear off rather quickly.<eos> She was fine by the time she left.<eos> I understand you have a suspect in custody.<eos> We do, yes.
Morgan was right.<eos> What?<eos> Don't say anything else.<eos> Danny, I know.<eos> - You do?
I can't pay bills, and did you know that I keep my side-view mirrors attached with straight up derkt tape?<eos> Rishi, I don't think you're a screw-up.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I'm so hard on you.<eos> And, yeah, I know that Greg is handsome and cool and that photo implies that he owns a boat.<eos> I do.
Until I considered another riddle.<eos> And then it all started to make sense.<eos> If the killer had no way out of the workshop, then they had to still be there!<eos> But we'd have seen him.<eos> Oh, but you did.
You couldn't understand why Mom and Dad would pay for grad school for me, but not buy you a car.<eos> Right after that, you left home.<eos> And I've done fine for myself.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> You always do.
Got friends upstate doing hard time for selling weaker schwag than that.<eos> Yeah, the government, it's-- it's pretty diabolical.<eos> Do you want some ice cream?<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Oh, sure you do, Trey.
It's not that simple.<eos> Well... she's a little high-maintenance.<eos> ♪ But I'm not lonely... ♪<eos> Doesn't really work as a duet.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Mom, my life here is over.<eos> People think I'm a slut.<eos> Well, then the best way to change their minds is to show them that you're not the person that they think you are.<eos> You don't even care.<eos> Of course I...do.
We would lay low and try not to attract someone's attention.<eos> Now you have the police after you!<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I certainly hope so.<eos> You did something to me.
I was at the scrap yard to warn your brother Tore, but he wasn't there.<eos> Do you have any contact with your third brother?<eos> I need your help, Ylva!<eos> Mm ...<eos> Yes, you do.
Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
- Sir, they saved our lives!<eos> - You have no authority here.<eos> This is not your world.<eos> We do not follow your laws.<eos> Yes, you do.
You have a monster case.<eos> How about "mont" as in...<eos> You have a case the size of Montana.<eos> These medical bills are going to be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Remember the day I left for the convention?<eos> Well, that morning just plays over and over in my head.<eos> And you said, "I owe you."<eos> Yes.<eos> And I do.
- Are you crazy?<eos> Here.<eos> Stopping me from entering my own house.<eos> Who appointed you?<eos> Who? Your father did.
Champ...bring a cup of tea.<eos> One?<eos> Sitara never shares her tea.<eos> I don't feel like.<eos> - You don't.
That's a classic, bro.<eos> I don't believe it!<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> I thought you didn't use social media.<eos> And I didn't.
Everyone is trying to be the best at something.<eos> Even if it's just a fritter.<eos> But you don't have this view in São Paulo.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, we don't.
And then in high school I kept going and he stopped.<eos> When was the last time you ran together?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Do you?
Well, smells bad to me, boss.<eos> Did you take the opportunity to discuss the pension increase?<eos> Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
- You can count on me.<eos> Give me another...<eos> - You really think you deserve a second chance?<eos> I do, please.<eos> You do?
I am outraged, Your Honor.<eos> Well, you're welcome to your outrage, Ms. Krause, but I am inclined to decide that the plaintiff has proved likeness.<eos> I believe that this episode, though fictionalized, does defame Mr. Sweeney.<eos> Unless you have something else.<eos> I do.
What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm saving your life, that's what's going on.<eos> Next time, answer your phone if you want a heads up.<eos> Liam got Alton, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he did.
What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay?<eos> I-I'm dying.<eos> And without those meds that Julianna made to keep me alive, I-I don't have much time and I'll be damned if I die before Liam does.<eos> I understand what you're going through...<eos> No, you don't.
♪ She said a diamond wouldn't hurt... ♪ ♪ Free me ♪ Free me from my...<eos> You used beast vision.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, your eyes glowed. I saw 'em.<eos> No, they did not.
Bull.<eos> It is.<eos> Go on, tell me why.<eos> I guess I just don't want to be weak around you, okay?<eos> I don't.
What if you just did it and let him see how wonderful you are?<eos> You're right.<eos> I am wonderful.<eos> Felix Unger wants a fist bump?<eos> I do.
We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
She don't get scared.<eos> Not Hallie.<eos> But me, I can't write.<eos> She say "Boy, you got greatness in you."<eos> You do.
That's how it works.<eos> And frankly, well, I'm glad it's you.<eos> So, I can approve your training, or... you can stay right here and we can continue to work together.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> I do.
What's your plan?<eos> I... I don't know yet<eos> Don't start the fire until we're a half hour away.<eos> Stay out of sight.<eos> Do the boy first.
_<eos> - Count of three, we fire.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't need him alive.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- So many elegant uniforms.<eos> A special occasion?<eos> Just an informal gathering to decide some matters close to the Fuehrer's heart.<eos> The Fuehrer... I had no idea.<eos> No, you don't.
There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
I just gave him to the nurse.<eos> Baby... she was wearing a uniform.<eos> She said he needed a hearing test.<eos> But I should've known.<eos> And I didn't.
The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> ♪ We'll try to get it right this time ♪ (Jenna) You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
You're still here.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, I-I, I figured...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> On the upside, that means your mother's budget cuts won't affect the position.<eos> You know who my mother is?<eos> I do.
What? !<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I need to get closure on this, Gwen.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Good because I don't.
- Hold your tongue.<eos> Do you have proof?<eos> A witness?<eos> No, but you said I would go free if I got a confession.<eos> Ah, yes, I did.
I'm afraid it's... bad news.<eos> I am not taking you to St. Petersburg.<eos> You are if you want to know where the safe is.<eos> - How do I even know you've found it?<eos> - You don't.
- Yeah, that's her.<eos> Bella Turner.<eos> What was Zack's relationship with Bella?<eos> I don't think he had one.<eos> Nobody does with her.
Ricky, what are you doing?<eos> Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You spun me.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
Suspect down.<eos> Restrain him.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Sorry, no, I do not.
But if parenthood<eos> - is something that doesn't interest you...<eos> - No.<eos> It does, actually.<eos> More so than it does my husband.
Bash.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you here.<eos> I've decided it's far past time that I danced with my wife. I'm sorry.<eos> - Bash, you don't need to...<eos> - Yes, I do.
I have no mother.<eos> You may not have a mother, but you used to love your mother.<eos> Do it just to make your mother happy.<eos> Please, just go put the money back.<eos> You do it.
You won fair and square.<eos> I mean, I murdered you.<eos> That was pretty shady.<eos> Also, it was crazy assertive and I feel like maybe I don't actually need power pose training.<eos> You don't.
I have no idea.<eos> Think harder.<eos> Or we're charging you with accessory after the fact.<eos> After what fact?<eos> What did Roger do?
Only 10% of Americans have computers.<eos> Only 15% of them have modems.<eos> Not to mention the fact that you're only on Commodores.<eos> I mean, how do you really know that there are enough users out there to make us all a killing?<eos> We just do.
I'm sorry.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hey, it's Gabby.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?<eos> Okay, Erin...<eos> Is this about Teddy?<eos> Teddy?<eos> No, no, no. Nothing to do with Teddy.
That cat's back.<eos> See, Max?<eos> I am excited.<eos> [baby talk] Oh, I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
Oh no, she's trying to flirt.<eos> I travel a lot for work.<eos> I'm a venture capitalist.<eos> So you know how it is.<eos> Oh, I do.
I travel a lot for work.<eos> I'm a venture capitalist.<eos> So you know how it is.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I absolutely do.
Is that what you want?<eos> Is it?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is that if you're gonna send detectives in to my jurisdiction, to arrest somebody, at lea...<eos> What do you mean the Commissioner's Office told you not to tell me?<eos> What the hell does that...
I love you for everything that you are and everything that you make me when I am with you.<eos> You are my partner in life and my one true love.<eos> You are my partner in life and you are my one true love, and I will cherish this marriage always, and I will love you more and more every day.<eos> Do you, Vincent Keller, take Catherine Chandler to be your lawfully wedded wife, to love, honor, cherish and protect?<eos> I do.

Ring.
Well, there goes your safety net.<eos> Any sign of them?<eos> No.<eos> Do you think that means that they're, uh...<eos> No, I don't.
Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way.<eos> I wish you hadn't seen that.<eos> Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man,<eos> Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part?<eos> I do.
Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
What are you doing all the way out here?<eos> Did you hear our news?<eos> Did Peter tell you?<eos> Matthew and I are having a baby.<eos> No, he didn't.
Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
Are you sure you want to wait until it begins?<eos> I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I'd rather have a dishonorable life.<eos> And you did, by all accounts.
I never planned to leave.<eos> I'm right where I want to be.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> No, I do.
She was supposed to be on the bus that day.<eos> That's right, but she wasn't.<eos> Instead, she lost her sister, the closest person to her in the world.<eos> And the thing is life forces you to keep on living.<eos> It just does.
Go ahead.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Do you know how stupid you are?<eos> Do you?
I should go check on David.<eos> So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> Oh, but girls like you never do.
I can't- I can't get out of it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just like to keep doing that 'til the laughter stops.<eos> Fuck, he's really- This is getting upsetting.<eos> What if I just did that for, like, 40 minutes?
It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Well, it's all dirty now, 'cause it's in your apron with a dirty dishrag.<eos> So dirty.<eos> Hurry up, it's getting all mushy.<eos> Well, I don't really want to now, it has a dishrag on it.<eos> Sure you do.
As you wish.<eos> Ooh! Shiny.<eos> Give that back.<eos> I saw it first.<eos> No, you didn't.
Ready?<eos> Okay!<eos> This is so embarrassing.<eos> Anyone got a light?<eos> I do.
- Oh, bugger.<eos> - Alfred.<eos> - You knew, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.
- I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.<eos> You let me make a right mug of me-self.<eos> Alfred, I had no idea.<eos> - You did.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us.<eos> - We have a deal?<eos> - We do.
Luckily, I have the other half.<eos> - Do you like magic tricks?<eos> - What?<eos> Of course you like magic tricks.<eos> After all, I do.
If you ask me, he under-promised and over-delivered.<eos> (Giggles) Marketing speak.<eos> Gabi, I just remembered that you have to leave early because you have an appointment.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - You do!
True that.<eos> So listen, I've been thinking.<eos> We got off on the wrong foot here.<eos> And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar.<eos> - You do?
It's gonna be in your life for a long time.<eos> True, but it's also still just a mattress, you know?<eos> It's a lot of money to spend on a rectangle that's filled with springs and goose hair.<eos> - You know it's feathers.<eos> - I didn't.
Can we ask you a question?<eos> - Mm-hm. - Why do you smell like fish?<eos> Is it hygiene?<eos> No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?
No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.<eos> They didn't.
NYPD!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
- Russian? Mm-mm.<eos> - North Korean? - Mm-mm.<eos> Greek?<eos> I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.<eos> No one does.
And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
Camille is ambitious, adventurous.<eos> She always has been.<eos> Of course she wants to go to Paris and work undercover, and although I'd rather she stayed here on the island, safe from harm, I know it would be best for her to leave.<eos> And you must know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Who is Liam?<eos> VINCENT: Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
You're the only one who has a chance, and only then if I inject you with the serum I made, to enhance what you are.<eos> Look, how do we know you're not just making this Liam guy up to justify what you've done?<eos> That is the justification.<eos> Do you think I wanted to experiment on innocent people, and make them super human?<eos> I didn't.
He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> He didn't.<eos> I just... I used my beast senses.<eos> Vincent, you don't have that power.<eos> No. No, I don't, okay?
- We didn't know that.<eos> That's why Jews can't stand us Christians, that's why they killed Christ.<eos> And that's why I can't stand them.<eos> - Do you know what I do with pork-haters?<eos> - We don't.
- Yes.<eos> - Me, having a Gypsy here? - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit...<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
But the devil can bring in money, too.<eos> Right.<eos> - We know your kind.<eos> - You all say you didn't steal.<eos> I didn't, kind lord...
Olivia is the godmother of my baby and my friend.<eos> And, believe me, I will avoid at all costs any harm coming her way.<eos> But the fate of our nation is more important than the life and liberty of one individual.<eos> You believe that, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
There are worse things than rape.<eos> Olivia, don't you dare.<eos> You went to war.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You did.
We need an autopsy.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go light a fire under Dr. Helpful out here.<eos> I bet all the inmates know exactly what areas are covered by surveillance.<eos> That they do.
Good job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, take care of yourself.<eos> Come on, you know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry, guys.<eos> We're broke.<eos> Now hang on a second.<eos> You said those Mikkei guys gave you a nice bonus for setting up that mining deal.<eos> They did.
Let's meet in the airlock in twenty minutes.<eos> Don't forget your comms.<eos> Hey, you find anything worth selling?<eos> No.<eos> Okay well-um, if you do...
Guess there's no place like home.<eos> I saw some more of your memories.<eos> I know what happened to you, I know where you're from.<eos> I already know.<eos> You do?
So you two are best buddies now?<eos> Hardly.<eos> I just think he might have a point.<eos> You were the one that said you didn't Want to go back to what we were.<eos> I don't.
Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast<eos> This momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
Or they can watch you get blown out into space.<eos> So what's it gonna be, folks?<eos> Don't give him anything. Hey, hey, hey, do you think i'm bluffing?<eos> I mean hell, you're just the first.<eos> After that we do the kid.
I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
They got in their shuttle, flew back to their ship, and they jumped.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't just leave me.<eos> [ROOK] They didn't have a choice.<eos> For the moment, at least, neither do you.
Now what?<eos> I'm coming down.<eos> What?<eos> You think someone's in there?<eos> No, I don't.
Though-though technically, I'm not a police officer.<eos> I mean, as you can see, I'm not licensed to carry a sidearm.<eos> I am employed by Secure Enforcement Solutions, which is private contractor hired to work in tandem with campus security.<eos> Wait, so you don't have a gun?<eos> No, I do not.
Did you escape, or did you kill him?<eos> Because if you did, you need to tell us all of the details, including what his eyes looked like when he took his last breath.<eos> They say in that moment, the soul tells all of its secrets.<eos> No, they don't-- no one says that.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
I nominate Chad.<eos> Screw that, Evil Harrington.<eos> We're locking you upstairs in my closet until we can find a way out of here.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Yes, they do. Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No!<eos> No one did!
- I'll get Mr. Kooky.<eos> - Okno, no, no.<eos> No Mr. Kooky.<eos> What? She needs him to eat.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
As I am.<eos> Jimmy, what happened to your hand?<eos> Oh. Funny story.<eos> Uh, did you know that epidurals don't work on five percent of patients?<eos> I sure didn't.
She's like, "I don't care."<eos> Where's your accent from?<eos> You have an accent.<eos> - What does it sound like?<eos> - No, you do.
It was just a "he came on my stomach" type thing.<eos> Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that.<eos> Didn't they?<eos> -Yeah. Yeah, they did. Yeah.
-Okay.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Her dad doesn't know.<eos> -Doesn't?<eos> -No, he doesn't.
You want me to kiss the ring, Louis, after what you did?<eos> You're damn right I do, because I don't care how it got up there.<eos> My name is on that wall.<eos> And if I had a crowbar handy... I would pry it off.<eos> Well, Jeff, you don't.
I have very good contacts, in my country and in yours.<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Abraham Levi handed over the book to the Queen Isabella of Castile. In exchange for protection.<eos> I think you know the story.<eos> Yes, I do.
You don't like his work?<eos> He painted like God.<eos> He could make a perfect annunciation on a fingernail.<eos> That has its merit, right?<eos> It does.
~ Really?<eos> Do you really have to?<eos> Yup.<eos> Rob, do you smoke?<eos> No, I don't.
- now I would be there, in the Invincible Armada<eos> - No, you'd be hanged.<eos> As Miss Folch knows, Lope joined the Armada<eos> Well, we don't know for sure.<eos> - Yes, yes we do.
- It is.<eos> So you can stop complaining about women being in charge,<eos> I never complained.<eos> When did I complain?<eos> Last night you did.
Well, there must be over a dozen fish in that basket.<eos> It seems like you're getting the short end of the bargain.<eos> Well, I'll be the judge of that.<eos> So have we got ourselves a deal?<eos> Apparently, we do.
William Thatcher still wants to see me rot in hell.<eos> Nothing I do is ever gonna be good enough for his daughter.<eos> Well, at least it's a step in the right direction, Tom.<eos> You just think I'm one big screw-up, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
A wife.<eos> A kid.<eos> A family.<eos> Just never seemed to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
Maybe in time I might have.<eos> But...<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> Hey, hang on. You don't seriously think I had anything to do with his death, do you?<eos> ~ Did you?
But I told you, he did.<eos> He did sign the contract.<eos> And you saw Stevie sign it?<eos> No.<eos> - Pete did.
Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
--Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
Repast.<eos> Couture.<eos> We're going to see the board of directors at Stern Investments.<eos> I didn't know I had any clothes left here.<eos> You didn't.
What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.<eos> Or I didn't when I started talking.<eos> I do now.
Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
You're not... you're not dying.<eos> You're not gonna wake up gorked. Shepherd knows<eos> - what she's doing.<eos> She does. - Okay. Sure.<eos> - She does!
This diaper bag is just a recycled purse from my single days!<eos> I got a lot of these notes lying around for quick getaways.<eos> - You guys don't think that I can do this, do you?<eos> - No! - We always thought you could do it.<eos> - I certainly don't.
Now I can't hear you.<eos> Put it in front of your face.<eos> Oh! How'd you get in my phone?<eos> Does this mean when we talked the other day - that you knew I was in the can?<eos> - I do now.
I'll send Cornelius to collect.<eos> We're to lavish money on Tiberius, the man who expelled thousands of our people from their homes in Rome on a whim?<eos> How far will you go to keep Rome happy?<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We don't, no.
I-I had to walk.<eos> What?<eos> He... he said everything that we thought we knew was wrong.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
That is past.<eos> What matters is who you now choose to be.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God, who died on the cross and rose again on the third day?<eos> I do.
Are you ready?<eos> Yes, governor.<eos> You have enough men?<eos> They understand their duties?<eos> They do.
Of course it is.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Oh, Abigail, I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy. Oh... Oh!<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy. Oh... Oh!<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
Are you having sex with Lyndsey while you're sleeping with our social worker?<eos> Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Look, look, this thing with Lyndsey just happened.<eos> A-And, honestly, I-I'm glad it did.
Have a seat.<eos> You knew Olivia was missing.<eos> Yes?<eos> You knew Olivia was missing, and you didn't tell me!<eos> - I didn't.
It looks good.<eos> Can you get a hammer?<eos> Now?<eos> I don't have a hammer and nails.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I need help.<eos> Juliette.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> You told them?<eos> No, I didn't.
Hey, I was just about to call you.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking about it, and with the benefit of hindsight, y-you're right.<eos> I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.<eos> Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Are they stark raving bonkers?<eos> These people, sometimes, they infuriate me!<eos> Oh, they come out here with their starched uniforms and their stiff upper lips and their dirty great flags hanging out.<eos> - Think they own the place!<eos> - They do.
So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
You were always funny. Argh!<eos> I had a really good time tonight.<eos> You don't say that to a man, unless you want to kiss him.<eos> Do you want to kiss me now?<eos> ~ No, I do not.
I would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit.<eos> Which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing.<eos> And Sophie, you don't really want me to be your maid of honor.<eos> That's right.<eos> I don't.
But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!<eos> , we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it.<eos> - They're getting divorced.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I mean... I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Boy, and how.<eos> And do you, Gail Dana Starfield, take this man, Jonas...<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Gene Jenkinson, to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
Well played, Jim.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You did it.
Well, the last time I lost two guys this fast, was when I told the three guys I was dating in high school I was pregnant. (Laughs)<eos> You may have gotten rid of Frank, but it doesn't matter.<eos> I'm still gonna win. Do you just wanna concede now?<eos> If concede means I win, then I do.<eos> - It doesn't.
I knew how you'd feel about it.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me this morning?<eos> Because I knew how you'd feel about it.<eos> As I recall, you had plenty of problems with Danny when you were his boss.<eos> Yes, I did.
You be safe and you come home soon.<eos> We haven't got many days left.<eos> I don't want to be alone at the end.<eos> I know, Mum.<eos> None of us do.
I don't even know where my son is.<eos> So, really, it is very stressful.<eos> Rhonda, relax, OK?<eos> We have all the time in the world.<eos> Yeah, but we don't, do we?
Thank you so much for saving me!<eos> You are just, oh, the best boyfriend in the world.<eos> True.<eos> We both know I didn't do the saving.<eos> Now everyone else does too.
Still triangulating.<eos> The wind was blowing, and we just... we rolled down the windows even though it was cold.<eos> We didn't even care because the music was blasting on the stereo.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Yes, I do.
I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
I hate to say it, gentlemen, but it must've been something prissy, right?<eos> Because... I mean, like, Archibald or Percy or something, because otherwise, why... why wouldn't he use his own name?<eos> A man needs his Christian name on his grave marker.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Miss Shippen.<eos> I am so pleased that you could come.<eos> I was happy to, if only to thank you again for your intervention with that mob.<eos> Of course. Did you see the house?<eos> I did.
It's too much excitement for one day.<eos> He'll sleep soundly now, though.<eos> He's had his fill.<eos> He'll sleep soundly because his father's home.<eos> I did a lot of thinking in prison.
Now, get off my tail.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> No, you're standing on my tail.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to leave the house to appear on The Grill.<eos> No, I don't.
I heard you talking about how you'd always dreamed of having kids, and I felt terrible.<eos> You should be marrying someone you can have children with.<eos> Joy, you're the woman I want to marry.<eos> If you don't want to have kids, that's fine.<eos> But I do.
"With the engine running, depress the brake with the left foot."<eos> Done that.<eos> "Push the selector lever forwards and hold.<eos> "A flag symbol appears in the instrument cluster."<eos> It doesn't.
'.. where there were no spare bedrooms.<eos> 'So I decided to try another new sort of tenting.'<eos> ~ Do you know what?<eos> ~ What? ~ We started this, I liked all three cars.<eos> I still do.
~ Crocodile's ear.<eos> ~ It's hairy.<eos> ~ Crocodiles do have hairy ears.<eos> They don't even have ears.<eos> They do.
Travis, he'd rather sleep in that place than his own bed.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know if I want him to come home.<eos> I get it.<eos> You do?
- Not like what?<eos> Hey, I've got Danny in my back pocket, so how about I wait and see if things work out with Ben first?<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't know how I felt.<eos> And you do now?
[chokes] Lauren.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You have not been yourself lately.<eos> I think I know why.<eos> You do?
Does she know about the bunker is all?<eos> What? !<eos> Does she know about the bunker?<eos> No, no. OK?<eos> She doesn't.
Katie Springer? !<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> Which everyone does.
Oh, cheers, Danny.<eos> Thanks for making me do this..<eos> Hey, listen, Archie...<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
You can't force someone to drive.<eos> I did.<eos> - Now her parents hate me.<eos> - They won't hate you.<eos> Her mum does.
Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
Then the next thing I know, that ponytailed, tofu-head barista is sitting with Shelly.<eos> They're getting married on Saturday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know I can't drink coffee anymore, Brick?<eos> I did not.
I remember now.<eos> You rolled a 6 off the board.<eos> - It doesn't count.<eos> - Does.<eos> - Doesn't.
It's all set up.<eos> Don't make me do it again next week.<eos> Take off your hat.<eos> - This is bullshit.<eos> - What did you just--
Come on, get up there!<eos> No!<eos> You guys, are we gonna pull over soon?<eos> 'Cause Doc says I got to move every couple hours, or the fluid builds up, and that's when the gastro esophageal reflex kicks in, and you do not want to smell it.<eos> No, we do not.
All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
Really?<eos> How come I'm just hearing about him now.<eos> She just remembered him from a pile of photographs of Ganz's associates.<eos> It's not that you have a history of lying, but you have a history of lying.<eos> We both do.
There's a friend in the hospital.<eos> He asked me to pray for him, but I just... I-I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I-I don't believe in it.<eos> The way you do.
I like that, Terry.<eos> It shows real heart.<eos> But I'm going with Gina's "suck an egg" idea.<eos> You get the Beyoncé tickets.<eos> Of course I do.
Daniela's right.<eos> You are really rockin' those shorts.<eos> Is there a Mrs. Whistle? why do you have my egg timer?<eos> You don't know how to make eggs.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Guys, it's a note.<eos> Received by our Vic the day she disappeared, one your consultant just admitted he wrote.<eos> She was a cleaner, maybe he wanted to hire her.<eos> Before we came here, you said this was a waste of time, you knew your guy.<eos> I do.
Like they should.<eos> Holmes is not a cop, but he's close.<eos> They got to protect their case.<eos> You have any luck with that list I sent you last night?<eos> We did.
I'm not following you.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You need my help, or the SEC needs my help?<eos> We both do.
Mr. West, I know that you always drive the Batmobile, but it would be an honor and a privilege if you allowed me to drive the Batmobile today.<eos> You drive the Batmobile?<eos> It's always been a dream of mine.<eos> Do you have a driver's license?<eos> I do.
I want to talk to the guy at the DEA who trained those two soldiers.<eos> If anybody has a better idea of what we're dealing with, it'll be him.<eos> Well, let's hope he's easier to find than Richards.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
I want to tell you what I did.<eos> In the States, you get a lot more bang for your buck cos you can use dollar bills, y'all!<eos> You've already given me like £300.<eos> Rob, I need to talk to you.<eos> Do you?
And from what I can make out, nothing like that has been stolen either.<eos> So... .. a man is shot dead, inside his locked cell, located within two additional locked security doors.<eos> There's no way the killer could have come in via the prisoner entrance, which can only be unlocked and opened from the inside.<eos> And to come from the courthouse entrance, the killer must have passed Dwayne and JP, unseen, unheard.<eos> Which they didn't.
I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks? No.<eos> You don't.
(Boden) I'm afraid I've got no choice, Donna.<eos> Well, I hate for you to go, you know that.<eos> I know.<eos> - But if they need you...<eos> - They do.
I know.<eos> - But if they need you...<eos> - They do.<eos> Then I understand.<eos> - You do? - Yeah.
Sure he does that here.<eos> He'll come out of the closet when he's good and ready.<eos> To be honest Deb, we have tried stuff.<eos> Books, and watching Dr. Bill.<eos> We even did a mediation thing with the priest.
-Guns for product.<eos> Are you telling me marty stein is a drug dealer?<eos> Stein ain't no dealer, stein's a kingpin.<eos> We need you to tell marlon you know where leo's hiding out.<eos> I do?
Did you get it before or after the murder?<eos> I'm worried about you, I am.<eos> I gotta take a piss.<eos> I do.<eos> I really fucking do.
Okay.<eos> Just sit tight, I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> I just need to make a phone call.<eos> -You got something more pressing right now?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Marty says, "go get the file."<eos> You know, clean house, make sure nothing's there That attaches hutchings to marty.<eos> And that's when you took the camera?<eos> I swear to god, I didn't know they were gonna kill him.<eos> Yeah, you did.
The M.E. ran it through CODIS, and it got a hit.<eos> Just say it, Erin.<eos> It matched your father, Ennis Walker.<eos> I knew it would.<eos> You did?
Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
Sit.<eos> He is in breach of contract.<eos> I want that whore out of my house.<eos> The contract says I can have a life as long as I'm discreet.<eos> Yes, it does.
That's your job.<eos> You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...
You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...<eos> I do not.
Well, it's good you know what you want -- before anyone got hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course I have the receipt. Ow! ...<eos> Kay, what if I didn't?
- Victory?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Billy is gonna lose his mind.<eos> You knew Wilbur was smuggling?<eos> Yeah, I did.
She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did? Hm.
I'll introduce you.<eos> Eugéne...<eos> Jean, the new guy I mentioned.<eos> He wants to butcher the foreman too.<eos> Everyone does.
Nihilists he and Elisée met in Brussels.<eos> Austrians.<eos> Elisée's waiting for them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
- Where did you come from?<eos> You drive me so mad, I could go out without a headscarf.<eos> I said leave.<eos> Why did you call her useless? A she-donkey?<eos> - Did you or didn't you?
You drive me so mad, I could go out without a headscarf.<eos> I said leave.<eos> Why did you call her useless? A she-donkey?<eos> - Did you or didn't you?<eos> - I did!
Too easy?<eos> You listen to me. A jealous man destroyed me.<eos> I'm done with that!<eos> You don't order me about.<eos> No one does!
We're gonna grab coffee with some girls from the meeting.<eos> Do you want to come with us?<eos> I can't.<eos> I got plans.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm sorry. What?<eos> I deserve a raise.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> You know what?<eos> You do.
Give you no shit to send a car over the river into New Jersey, no sweat.<eos> [Click] We're done here.<eos> All right.<eos> You need anything, you know where to find me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - [Chuckles]
Yeah, guys, mind your own business and finish your homework, will you?<eos> Come on.<eos> We haven't been out in months. What do you say?<eos> Do I really have a choice?<eos> No, you do not.
Hey, you got a gun behind the bar, right?<eos> Did you forget how to use it?<eos> Did you?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, Rusty, Rusty!<eos> Did you?
Yeah, I completely understand, which is why you need to tell me whose joint this is, or I'm gonna have to tell every bartender on 10th Avenue how you've been spending your Saturday nights.<eos> Come on.<eos> What? We go back a long way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, we do.
Come on.<eos> What? We go back a long way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, we do.<eos> We do.
I was taking a walk.<eos> Alone?<eos> So to recap-- I.D.'d at the scene of the crime, no alibi, and name on a vigilante hit list.<eos> And your response is: "I was taking a walk."<eos> What do you...?
I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
Your Honor, if I may...<eos> A citizen of this district has been brutally murdered...<eos> Not just a citizen, but a public servant, a lieutenant for the Metro P.D.<eos> And the people have a right to access and evaluate all evidence...<eos> No, they don't.
I'm a criminal.<eos> Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must have known how strange all of this was.<eos> Of course I did.
Tell her what?<eos> About Tom.<eos> You should have told her some time ago.<eos> I don't know how do that, Dembe.<eos> Yes, you do.
But I was thinking about the Black Business Leaders speech.<eos> Oh, yes. I was just working on it now.<eos> Well, I... I'm having second thoughts.<eos> I think it's a mistake to throw Peter under the bus.<eos> You do?
We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
The ones they still have anyway.<eos> We'll take them from here.<eos> Excuse me? I'm taking these statues.<eos> I have no authorization to release these to anyone.<eos> Now you do.
It popped in my head.<eos> I wanted to sing it.<eos> It's a song I used to know...<eos> I know that song.<eos> You do?
It's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?<eos> - Jason!<eos> - Mr. McCready, if you'd like to stay here with us, thank you.<eos> Looks deserted.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
- That's why she was killed, wasn't it?<eos> - To shut her up.<eos> - No comment.<eos> Do you know what the Coroners and Justice Act is?<eos> He does.
No, when I was a kid, the grocery store wouldn't charge you for a grocery bag.<eos> Plus, all the food you ate while you were in the grocery store was free.<eos> - No, it wasn't.<eos> Not ever.<eos> - Yeah, if you do it fast.
Okay, trust me.<eos> You gotta schmooze 'em and booze 'em, or you're gonna lose 'em.<eos> I don't even know where to start!<eos> Where do I go?<eos> What do I do?
- Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.<eos> Oh, it is no matter.<eos> Do you have anything upon the nature of clouds, rain, atmospheres?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.
- All right, I'm going to study magic.<eos> Will that do?<eos> - Why on earth would you want to do that?<eos> I met a man under a hedge who told me I was a magician.<eos> - Did you indeed?
- Why?<eos> - Do not you trust me?<eos> - Still nothing.<eos> - Likes to blow up?<eos> - No, I did not do.
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
When I heard what you said about the dresses... It's just--<eos> It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something.<eos> No.<eos> Caroline thinks you have great taste.<eos> She does?
You need to get to zhulov and talk to him.<eos> Zhulov hasn't said a word since we took him down.<eos> As I recall, he told me to screw myself forever.<eos> Because you never had any leverage over him.<eos> Now, with his connection to Christoph, you do.
But Nell is coming tomorrow, so you won't be, you know... '98?<eos> No, no, not '98.<eos> April 2000.<eos> 34lb, that salmon. Do you remember?<eos> Yes, I do.
If I could teach healthy lungs to hold and reproduce the cure the same way yours do with the virus, well, then I could...<eos> You could make the cure contagious.<eos> Of course, the trick would be understanding just how your body does it, to be able to compare the D.N.A. sequence change between yours and the primordial.<eos> You have my blood samples.<eos> I do.
The one I should be talking to is the one who's always been there for me... my cigarette.<eos> Forget about your sister.<eos> You've got me.<eos> For the rest of your life I'll be the first thing you think about every morning.<eos> And the last thing you do every night.
An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now?<eos> No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.
What did he want from you?<eos> I thought he meant to kill me.<eos> But instead he wished to preserve me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Neither did I, at first.
Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
Yes.<eos> I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not. I know.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
*** move like a teenager that's about to get caught?<eos> We're getting a divorce.<eos> We're not supposed to be sleeping together.<eos> Who says we have to go through with it?<eos> I do.
- What are you doing here?<eos> What...<eos> I come to see my little girl in the big city, huh?<eos> Holy shit, you got a tattoo there.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Oh, why?<eos> Do you hate the color?<eos> He doesn't like commitment.<eos> Do you not have Gigi's name on you?<eos> No, no, actually, he doesn't.
It's just like the old ax.<eos> I know;<eos> I was trying to make an impression.<eos> Well, you would have.<eos> You did just now.
Like, I'll do it, like, two or three times to keep him interested, and, you know...<eos> It's my system.<eos> Okay... you have a system?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> Every girl does.
That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you gonna do?<eos> Well, for your information,<eos> I have an apprenticeship with the very famous<eos> Chef Charles D'Arby.<eos> You do?
And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.<eos> So when I found out Josh had feelings for you, I panicked.<eos> I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.<eos> Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this.<eos> Yes, I do.
It is now blue collar and no It is now blue collar and no collar. Collar.<eos> Four nor blue collar. Four nor blue collar. No collar starting to panic now.<eos> No collar starting to panic now. No collar can't get anything No collar can't get anything going.<eos> Sierra can win it right here.<eos> She does!
What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
How do we know we're not witnessing the birth of a major player?<eos> All right, well,<eos> If Moon is the real deal, the good news is we've got a chance to crack this kid before he makes his mark on the ice trade.<eos> Find them.<eos> You done?
No, thank you.<eos> You're getting really good, Kono.<eos> A year from now, you'll be paddling out at Pipeline.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
Break it down.<eos> "Into-me-see."<eos> You say that kind of crap to Jamal?<eos> I was a heroin addict back then.<eos> I didn't do that much talking.
- No.<eos> One-night stands.<eos> I had my first one last night. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, man!<eos> I remember my first one-night stand.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, even my gift has its limits.<eos> Was it your gift... or your medicine that healed me?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Does it matter that much to you how?<eos> Yes, it does.
This case is not about what happened to Morris Black's body after he was dead.<eos> This case is not about what Bob Durst did after Morris Black died.<eos> The sole issue for you ladies and gentlemen to decide is how Morris Black died.<eos> We started getting over to the jurors this thought about, "It doesn't change what happened<eos> "to Morris Black, anything that Bob Durst did with the body afterwards."
I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a codex which is sort of a-a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools, and it should help crack "The Book of the Damned."<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.
I want my son... Dead.<eos> After -- Now.<eos> Once I cast the spell -- and you need me to cast that spell -- who knows what will happen?<eos> I don't have time for this!<eos> Right, you don't.
Ditto.<eos> I'd shake your hand, but, uh... Hmm. Well, I have to say I am impressed the way you charged in here all guns blazin'.<eos> I'd buy tickets to that show.<eos> You didn't think that was really gonna work, did you?<eos> Usually does.
Please.<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we?<eos> Let's talk about what I'll take -- my freedom guaranteed and the codex.<eos> Sam, you can't be --<eos> Do you know which spell?<eos> I do.
The rest of my memory.<eos> The Desert Wolf.<eos> Why didn't you tell Scott?<eos> I didn't think you wanted me to.<eos> I don't.
Well, let me guess.<eos> You don't start fires anymore.<eos> You been rehabilitated.<eos> Yeah, I done it before. So what?<eos> I didn't do this one.
- without a warrant.<eos> - Please.<eos> Main Justice wants to shut down our murder investigation<eos> - and we have to play by the rules?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Ha.<eos> This is my mother...<eos> Natalia.<eos> She doesn't speak English.<eos> I do, too.
This is my daughter.<eos> She's my son.<eos> You know, Cris, it isn't all ama's fault.<eos> You want her to say how great you are, but I'm not sure you know it.<eos> Yes, I do.
I want the surgery.<eos> It's really risky.<eos> Your body's very weak.<eos> - You don't know what you're saying.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Okay.<eos> I just need something good to come out of this day.<eos> Abdominal injuries are under control.<eos> I'm ready to close.<eos> You about done, Kepner?
I know this is a difficult time and it's the last thing you'd want to think about, but you do have a decision to make.<eos> Do you know if your sons would have considered becoming organ donors?<eos> They were always helping people, even as little boys.<eos> That's why they wanted to be policemen.<eos> Well, Brett did.
That's not fair.<eos> Technically, he died of a loophole.<eos> A win is a win.<eos> - So you know what we do now.<eos> - Yes, unfortunately, I do.
Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
No...<eos> Custody Service agreed that Peter Stay with her mother for some time.<eos> It is still not for the fact that he spit in my future.<eos> - He just drifting, eh?<eos> - What does Peter?
Sorry, mate.<eos> 775 UCC.<eos> You have it?<eos> Er, no.<eos> We did.
And just so I can be absolutely clear, as well as Jimmy, I think you said you knew Vincent Erskine as well.<eos> Vince? Yeah.<eos> And Beth, his girlfriend.<eos> - You knew Elizabeth?<eos> - 'I did, aye.'
- I went to look for him but er...<eos> Somebody offered me some gear.<eos> By the time I was straight again it was two days later.<eos> And sir, did you find out if he'd been robbed?<eos> No, I didn't.
And you.<eos> He told me he'd stolen some of your jewellery.<eos> He wouldn't tell me why.<eos> Oh, he needs help, Grace.<eos> He really does.
Yeah, we courted for, er, a year or so and then got married, before we moved to Dollis Hill.<eos> That's where I got the job at, er, Arlingham House which was, er, which was round the corner.<eos> 1971, er, that was.<eos> Yes, she-she wanted kids im-immediately because, you know, we were neither of us spring chickens.<eos> Which, I did too, very much.
So maybe Morten has more half-siblings.<eos> Why didn't you say that straight away?<eos> I had to convince you that I didn't believe a four-year-old had shot two people in two countries.<eos> - It sounded as if that was what you thought.<eos> - Oh, did it, Saga?
I love you.<eos> But now that's how it is.<eos> - I hate it.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't.
Can you come with me?<eos> Yeah. Did something happen? No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- In principle, you could do that.<eos> Thanks so much for coming.<eos> It's always good to get some tips.<eos> - Do the pieces have anything in common?<eos> - No, they don't.
Why point to Holst if he's the next victim?<eos> I don't know. To scare him, maybe.<eos> I didn't see Alice and the girls this morning.<eos> - Should you have?<eos> - I usually do.
- The museum guard.<eos> The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures.<eos> I don't know. Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
You ever think about getting married, having a family?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> You're 23. How do you know?<eos> I just do.
All right, Mac.<eos> I fucked him once, ages ago when we were drunk and we said we'd never speak of it again.<eos> How's that going?<eos> I don't even fancy him.<eos> I don't!
All right, bitches, on the line!<eos> Get on the line right now!<eos> That's better.<eos> I happen to know that none of my DPB sisters or brothers at Kappa Tau Pi are gonna want anything to do with any of you if you all suck.<eos> And right now, you do.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Okay.<eos> God, that's disgusting.<eos> When my lawyers are through with you, you'll wish you never met me.<eos> I already do.
No, it's not him.<eos> I just don't feel like eating, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't know what you're missing. (hesitantly): Mmm...<eos> You really don't.
(inhales deeply) Four dollars for all of this.<eos> I mean, even if the chicken is pigeon, you can't beat that price.<eos> Sure you don't want any?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Of course I do.
You just keep your mouth shut.<eos> Well, tell that to your partner.<eos> 'Cause I think that's his problem.<eos> Now, now who has a problem?<eos> You do, man!
Guess he was in a good mood.<eos> He said take tomorrow off and the next day and...<eos> Three days, tops.<eos> Mike, I know what's really going on.<eos> You do?
Shake your tail feathers.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.<eos> Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.<eos> You don't have to clown for these people.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Eminem tickets.<eos> I took you to that concert for your 17th birthday.<eos> You remember?<eos> And I hated Eminem.<eos> You did not.
First up: "The Max".<eos> It's just whiskey.<eos> On the rocks, like Max's job.<eos> Whatever mine is, I want my rim salted.<eos> Of course you do.
But I am drunk.<eos> You think I could've done this sober?<eos> I just figured, with everything around us being so black lately, I thought we needed a little pink.<eos> You're right.<eos> We did.
You want a beer?<eos> Whoa, wait!<eos> Who says we're done here?<eos> Come on Stash.<eos> I do.
– Shut up.<eos> – You've ruined her life.<eos> You've made her miserable.<eos> I love her.<eos> No, you don't.
We'll see about that.<eos> Regina, go!<eos> Bishop: Let all who have gathered here...<eos> Do you, Zelena, take Robin to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
~ Coming.<eos> ~ Father?<eos> ~ Yes, Mary.<eos> When Mother was dying, she said you would remarry.<eos> Did she by God?
You're not, you're looking dubious.<eos> I know dubiety when I see it.<eos> ~ Raise your objection.<eos> ~ I have no objection.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to know why? (LAUGHS)<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Zero seed money.<eos> - I got some socked away. - Enough to launch a company?<eos> Enough to convince a bank to lend us the balance.<eos> Do you know how to run an entire company?<eos> 'Cause I sure as fuck don't.
We've crossed paths.<eos> Gang Squad tell you his brother, George, is in charge of west coast operations?<eos> Yes, they did, only they referred to him as "Mountain Master."<eos> - Because they like to show-off.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
I'm sorry, that must have been very hard on you.<eos> I didn't kill Ken.<eos> I'm angry. I'm not stupid.<eos> You know who his brother is, right?<eos> We do.
I can't give you any information without a warrant, Detective.<eos> Well, you see, the information you have could help me solve a homicide, and that sounds like a social service to me, so...<eos> Come back with a warrant.<eos> You're a cop, you know how this works.<eos> Yes, I do. I do, right.
Angie, I've got your confirmation.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.
So, you know why I'm here.<eos> I'm guessing because...<eos> Teri sold me out.<eos> Did you know the three cardinal tiles in mahjong represent the three cardinal virtues of Confucius.<eos> Of course I do.
Right away.<eos> You're not a policeman anymore so stop behaving like one.<eos> That man who was killed, he's somehow connected to a woman by the name of Edna Brooks.<eos> - Yes, I know who she is.<eos> - You do?
Just wait a moment.<eos> You know something?<eos> He said your mother<eos> - was a prostitute.<eos> - He did, did he?
Three weeks and a day.<eos> You're counting down.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Means you want to go.<eos> I do.
- He was my...<eos> No, he was Jake's...<eos> - He was my when he was a little kid, and then he was Sally's, and now he's mine.<eos> - He looks like he's had a lot of love.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Yep, look at all of these...<eos> Jacob!<eos> - So many cookies.<eos> - Anna!<eos> Do something!
You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower Of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> But nothing did.
Mom -<eos> You don't have to apologize again.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry. I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> You know what i mean?<eos> Yeah, i do.
But Mrs. Grant has a job.<eos> Being a mother is the hardest job in the world, and she...<eos> You know...<eos> I know people love to say that.<eos> I do.
Ensign Martin is integral to our operation, and she has some duties she's neglecting at the moment.<eos> Back to work.<eos> It's better if he's not too damaged.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
That's how he lets her know that...<eos> You can't take command, son.<eos> Yes.<eos> She never had a chance, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.
What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.<eos> No, she doesn't.
When my daughter did take it... This is how I justified it...<eos> When she did take it, She might have been able to focus more in school, but it took the joy from her, so I kind of felt like...<eos> I justified it, like, well, it really isn't good for her.<eos> And every time I'd get it refilled, I'd say, "I'm not going to do it this time," you know?<eos> And I always did.
Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
- That threw me, too.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> So you didn't know she was Amanda Clarke?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did.
I-I'm friends with my ex, and I have two dates lined up, one of which is a straight-up sex date.<eos> I'm about 69 percent sure of that.<eos> I have even more to lose than you.<eos> And do I look nervous about it?<eos> No, you don't.
- Tomorrow it's going to be a bloodbath... - Don't even ask!<eos> These people died hundreds of years before you were born...<eos> - I'm not running!<eos> - I have a duty of care.<eos> - No, you don't.
No, no.<eos> No, this is real.<eos> Everything about you is real to me.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I do.
Matty, you were right.<eos> I only hooked up with Collin because he was everything you weren't, including an [bleep].<eos> Jenna, listen.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> No, you don't.
And she'd stop everything to take care of me and I can't ask her to do that.<eos> Not... not yet, at least.<eos> So, um, if we had to switch back to XTs, how long would that take?<eos> We're not gonna have to do it.<eos> Okay, but just in case we do,
All Donna did was behave like you do every day without bailing you out for it like usual.<eos> - You know, maybe you didn't like it...<eos> - I never because it was like looking in a damn mirror!<eos> People have other things going on in their lives that you don't know about.<eos> And you do, huh?
How are you?<eos> Can I have a name for the drink?<eos> Bob.<eos> And you got a tall Americano, right?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Better late than never.<eos> Miss me?<eos> All the 3s have been played. Mm-hmm.<eos> Question is, do you have a heart?<eos> Hm, of course you do.
I want you to tell your little brother he's got one hell of an arm.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Hailie, you have to keep it open.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- I didn't give it.<eos> We seem always to be running into each other, don't we?<eos> Are you with the Herald?<eos> I think you know very well who I am.<eos> I do.
- Me?<eos> - I know he's doing it mostly just to get out of being grounded and get out of the house at night.<eos> - At night?<eos> - Anthony has a band after school.<eos> - He does?
Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> Uh, I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> - Oh, I do.
So you knew?<eos> That you and Heather connected, yes, I had a feeling.<eos> But she doesn't know you.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I know I'm right, I do! And, and...<eos> I know why Ryan would lie, but what I don't get is why you would go along with it.<eos> I just have to ask, why do you care so much who Ryan does or doesn't date?<eos> I... don't care.<eos> No, you do.
- Yeah. - Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't need to.<eos> Right.<eos> You had a feeling.<eos> I did and I do, all the time.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died.<eos> You do?<eos> We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.
We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.<eos> I feel very connected to Grace in a way that maybe you...<eos> Abigail, I know you mean well...<eos> I do.
She left you a note.<eos> It's, uh, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> But you not talking about it is almost worse than you talking about it.<eos> I don't.
There are rule followers and rule breakers.<eos> You're the first, not the second.<eos> I won't always be here to help.<eos> I don't need you to be.<eos> You did tonight.
Well, "luck favors the prepared".<eos> - Louis Pasteur.<eos> - Father of microbiology.<eos> You do have an eclectic reading list, don't you?<eos> I do.
Being a cop in Middleton can be a pretty uneventful.<eos> I just don't want to let you down.<eos> You won't.<eos> And hey, you never know what'll happen, right?<eos> No, you don't!
- She was looking forward to it.<eos> Was she?<eos> You two chatted?<eos> We did. She has a really good sense of humor.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Was she?<eos> You two chatted?<eos> We did. She has a really good sense of humor.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Doctor's orders in fact.<eos> I don't know that being on the road is such a good idea.<eos> I think you two should check back into Grey House, give me a chance to get Eve in the office tomorrow,<eos> - Well, if you think that's best.<eos> I do.
I told you.<eos> I told him.<eos> Apparently she told me.<eos> - We want to help.<eos> - We do.
Yeah.<eos> One and the same.<eos> - He didn't tell you? - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
I'm stuck between them and they really hate each other.<eos> Dad wants me to stay here, and Mom wants me to go with her.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - I just do.
Nick, I...<eos> I love you.<eos> And I want things to go smoothly for you with your mother and Geoffrey.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - I do.
I love you.<eos> And I want things to go smoothly for you with your mother and Geoffrey.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Great to meet you.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> All right, and this is the big man right here.<eos> What's up, little man?<eos> - How you doing?
Afraid of what?<eos> I don't know, but I've been around enough true believers to know when they're really praying, and Ostrov was.<eos> The guy that took me hunting this afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way.<eos> Could something have happened to change that?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, something did.
There may be a way to resolve this.<eos> A deal that even he can live with.<eos> But we're gonna need to go through back channels.<eos> And we happen to have one.<eos> We do.
That's where we'll jump in.<eos> If we're on the go, we should reach the target in under six minutes.<eos> The bird will be on station, so we shouldn't be on the ground more than 30 minutes.<eos> Sir, do you know if the package is still there?<eos> No, we do not.
In what capacity?<eos> We did have dealings in livestock.<eos> She did sell a cow to me of late.<eos> And after a short time I surmise this cow did die, did it not?<eos> Yes, it bloody well did.
Karaoke machine?<eos> Where?<eos> In the box that says "Karaoke Machine" on it.<eos> Oh.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Detective Brian Lucas, hello.<eos> I've heard great things about you from my friends in financial crime.<eos> You too, sergeant. You're a legend.<eos> So, you, uh, you like homicide?<eos> I do, very much.
I need you to tell me, 'cause...<eos> You say one thing, and I think you mean something else entirely, and I want to understand.<eos> I am trying to.<eos> Because I want what we started here.<eos> I do.
Victoria still has the drive with the evidence on me.<eos> She hasn't made a move yet, which means she's planning something.<eos> I have Nolan tracking it.<eos> Well, you guys will figure something out.<eos> You always do.
She loves you, Jack.<eos> I can't hear that right now.<eos> And I certainly didn't hear it from her.<eos> We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels are two very different things.<eos> Yes, we do.
You missed your flight.<eos> Seeing that look on your face almost makes the past year worthwhile, the key word being "almost."<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yes, we did.
I raised you to be practical, so I guess that's why I got a practical gift.<eos> [Sighs] Mom... [voice breaking] It's just that my mom was so flaky and all over the place that I guess I went in the opposite direction with you, and somehow apparently ended up crushing your dreams.<eos> Mom, don't cry.<eos> I still have some dreams.<eos> No, you don't.
- What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
You're human.<eos> You don't want to feed on me.<eos> - Yes...<eos> - Please.<eos> Elena, I do.
Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
Me?<eos> Oh, I don't do anything to help mankind.<eos> I'm completely self-absorbed.<eos> So where does Kirsten fit in all of your good-doing?<eos> She doesn't.
I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Are you ready to face judgment?<eos> You're all sure you want to do this?<eos> Like you even need to ask, Red.<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
- Run!<eos> - You're human.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.<eos> That little girl almost drowned right in front of me.<eos> But she didn't.
If I wasn't certain she was one of us now.<eos> She's here to help us find my daughter.<eos> Is Dr. Bloom still working on the umbilical cord?<eos> When Hektor went after Joe, it wasn't just me who tried to stop him.<eos> Dr. Bloom did, too.
- Ben, I'm sorry.<eos> Jack's flight leaves in 20 minutes.<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
This is a much better way to wake up.<eos> Yeah? Your snoring is like a train.<eos> It's much cuter.<eos> I don't snore.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> Really?<eos> No, no,.<eos> Look, the cops don't know anything.<eos> They don't?
You definitely a contender.<eos> What do you mean "three"?<eos> Three girl group.<eos> On Instagram, it didn't say anything about a girl group.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Rise and shine, baby.<eos> Good morning, Ms. Ford.<eos> Just-Just wait a second.<eos> Article 45 states no warrant can be served in a federal case without a signature from the presiding judge.<eos> No, it doesn't.
It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah, if tacky and ugly is beautiful.<eos> You think that's, uh, tacky and ugly?<eos> No, he didn't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Which it will...<eos> The price of the original is gonna just skyrocket.<eos> I want the original.<eos> You already got the original.<eos> I do.

Ray.<eos> Jason Faber.<eos> Are you sitting down?<eos> You really think we can make up for all the things that we've done?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, if he does call, and I'm sure he will, have him call us.<eos> Call me.<eos> I'll do everything I can to get him home safe, I promise you.<eos> So you believe that he's alive, then?<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay. St... What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.

You don't remember?<eos> Mm, I think it was before my time.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing in the world.<eos> I wanted to wear it to prom, But mom said I'd lose it.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR.<eos> (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.
- Amy.<eos> We have to talk about Karma.<eos> She's out of control.<eos> I know, but I don't know what to do, unless you have some tranquilizer darts handy.<eos> Do you?
That's exactly why he thinks you did it.<eos> Is he always so circular in his reasoning?<eos> You told me that you were called to that house, that you knew a woman was there.<eos> Do you know who she was?<eos> I do.
He said Lena had broken off their engagement and moved back to Switzerland.<eos> And that was...?<eos> Early February 2002.<eos> So you didn't think it was strange that she didn't say good-bye to you herself?<eos> I did, actually.
Maybe outside.<eos> It's--it's a dog or a cat or squirrel or something.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Go.<eos> So I did.
If we don't get back online soon or get a lucky break in this case, we're gonna be looking at more drugged victims and dead bodies.<eos> Ahem. Getting online is gonna be a lot harder than you think.<eos> Whoever engineered this, he did a complete and total network and infrastructure shutdown.<eos> But I thought we had firewalls to protect from this kind of breach.<eos> We totally do.
You have to talk about it.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Yes, tonight, while it's still fresh.<eos> I can't.<eos> It doesn't...
Audi A6, 2012.<eos> With a highway to city ration of 4 to 1, averaged to 29 miles per gallon, which is standard for that make, model, and year, he traveled roughly 450 miles, which assuming one way and back<eos> puts his destination-- 225 miles away.<eos> I want to believe you, Ezra.<eos> I really do.
You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> True.<eos> And Bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.<eos> He does.
You a sniper like him?<eos> Female Engagement Team, yeah.<eos> Connor used to talk about it.<eos> Killing somebody from a distance... didn't feel real.<eos> Until... it did.
I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm just trying to do my job.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I'm also gonna need the visitors log.<eos> Lots of people are in love with the idea of having kids, but most have no idea what they're getting into.<eos> Did you and Michelle?
Excuse me?<eos> Are you going to procreate at some point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I think about it sometimes.<eos> I don't... Why?
He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
We're not besties.<eos> It's not like she shares.<eos> Well, you'll just have to make sure she does, hmm?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We still do.
Great!<eos> So you know them.<eos> Look, no one outside of this room is gonna know what you say.<eos> Who tried to rob the truck?<eos> They did.

Ah. Flatterer.<eos> She wants to go, he decides to go with her, and she doesn't want to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, well, it does make sense.<eos> It... it does.
She disclosed.<eos> And I got a call from dodds, who got a call from the mayor.<eos> So we are going to investigate.<eos> We don't even know who this girl is.<eos> America's Worst Crimes does.
I'm assuming this is about that broadcast?<eos> It is.<eos> So the victim said that she was shut down by the university.<eos> Do you know who she spoke to?<eos> - I do.
That text was to check in on a friend.<eos> That's not proof of a criminal act.<eos> How about the others, Brian?<eos> We have DNA proof that you weren't the only one.<eos> You do?
Carbonated yogurt drink popular in Arab countries.<eos> It's hard to believe bubbling yogurt is popular anywhere.<eos> I figured it didn't belong to the Ayers, so I called the American distributor.<eos> No place on the island sells it.<eos> Six stores in the city do.
I imagine they would.<eos> Because Louis Eisely was a particularly cutthroat Wall Street trader.<eos> From the early 2000s.<eos> A man whose downfall, at the height of his career, made his name synonymous with Wall Street greed.<eos> I did my time.

And my family.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people! You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.

I am really glad that you're doing this, Ryan.<eos> It's good that you guys spend some time together.<eos> Yeah, well, he never had time for me my whole life, so I gave up on him.<eos> But you said you wanted to put that all behind you.<eos> I do.
Like this.<eos> It's all in the reflexes.<eos> Now you try.<eos> Did you at least see the safe?<eos> I did, yes.
The first vote.<eos> Does not count.<eos> Does not count.<eos> Does in the count.<eos> Does in the count. Jenn. Jenn.
No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
_<eos> Miss Hapstall, how often do you go to the Gladness Spa?<eos> Once a week.<eos> I've got a herniated disk.<eos> How we doing?
He's leveraging my health, my life.<eos> Harold, you're a decent man.<eos> The man I fell in love with, and now you're asked to do something indecent.<eos> But if you are telling me that your life depends on whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants, you know my opinion.<eos> I do.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. Nolan, in your meeting this morning with Mrs. Florrick, did you say that you wouldn't have swung the vote for her because she turned down a bribe that you offered?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Shall I repeat the question?<eos> - No, I did not.
If you burn him, the sickness will not spread.<eos> We don't know how it spreads.<eos> I understand.<eos> You knew this man.<eos> Yeah, I did.
She's your friend.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - I do.
And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
It gave her great comfort.<eos> Though I was never the one to prepare it.<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Yes, I do.
Of course.<eos> What about the angels?<eos> The angels?<eos> - Do you see them now?<eos> I do not, Sire.
She was going to stop being my friend.<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Do you know what you almost did to yourself?<eos> Do you know what it would do to me if anything ever happened to you?<eos> Do you?
Where is he?<eos> You got anything to tie him with?<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> How do we kill him?<eos> We don't.
Because of it, your entire unit was killed.<eos> That was you.<eos> I wouldn't be here.<eos> Your friends would still be alive.<eos> You did that.
I mean, hell, I worked for them for 16 years.<eos> It's got to be worth something.<eos> 16 years?<eos> Did you know she had a film?<eos> She did.
Yeah.<eos> You turned him down, didn't you?<eos> I can't accept his money for something that's a total waste of time.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe God wanted us to know that she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that... We have to let her go.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
I'm happy, Dr. Tyler.<eos> I get to be with my wife again.<eos> And I don't really care why it's happening, and I don't want to be cured.<eos> If you'd lost someone like I did, you'd understand.<eos> You did, didn't you?
- Does he get on with Philip?<eos> - They were friends as boys.<eos> I'm afraid she doesn't like my daughter-in-law.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - And who does?
You think you know someone, and then this.<eos> Dr. Nash.<eos> Charles.<eos> I have a theory.<eos> Of course you do.
Do you know what this means?<eos> Probably that your computer downloaded a ton of meaningless and random brain activity?<eos> Or that we recorded an actual experience of what somebody has when they die.<eos> It's worth investigating, don't you think?<eos> I do.
Don't you think he would want us to keep looking if it led to a new discovery?<eos> But that's not for anyone to say...<eos> Not you or me or Ivan Turing.<eos> Look, Julie, I understand how hard...<eos> No, you don't.
There may not be another way.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> We will keep looking.<eos> We have time.<eos> Maybe you do.
And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
Where did you go to school?<eos> I went to medical school at Penn.<eos> And for my undergraduate...<eos> Did you get good grades?<eos> I did.
There was never anything real between us.<eos> So you need to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I do.
I... if you still want to go.<eos> So...<eos> What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say... I do.<eos> I... do. Ohh.
- Barely.<eos> I don't know how to say this, so, I'm just... going to be direct.<eos> Are you aware that your husband kept secrets from you?<eos> You mean... did I know that he slept with men?<eos> For a long time I didn't.
Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
I'm just trying to -- oh, mom!<eos> Stop!<eos> Forget it.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Yeah, you really don't.
You're kidding me, right?<eos> You gamble away my McLaren and now you're frolicking by the pool.<eos> Relax, Ashok.<eos> We have a plan to get your precious car back.<eos> You do?
- Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.
You are indeed a sphinx, Ma'am.<eos> Whatever do you mean?<eos> Well, let us just say that I do not know if she has, in every sense, what it takes to complete what she's begun.<eos> But we may find that out tonight due to her timely invitation.<eos> And if she does not?
Might seem like it's at cross-purposes, but I'm getting results.<eos> Whatever works, bud.<eos> Okay, so Loretta was able to retrieve enough tissue from under Jorge Gomez's fingernails to run a search.<eos> And you got a hit?<eos> I did.
And I just... I...<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
I'm not going to get all sentimental.<eos> And you promised you wouldn't make a big deal.<eos> No, you're right, you're right.<eos> I promised you I wouldn't.<eos> - You did.
You guys, I blocked out my schedule every day after school for band practice.<eos> Every day?<eos> That's a lot of practice.<eos> We don't want to sound too rehearsed.<eos> Uh, yeah, Gene, we do.
shida Jones.<eos> Uh, big fan.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She likes tank tops, too.<eos> She does.
I'm a businesswoman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
That which does not kill me.<eos> Plus, with Lasalle at the mermaid's funeral, you could use a wingman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, you want to see everything that's come in in the last week.<eos> Yes, we do.
And the only way I could deal with it was by blaming you.<eos> I get it.<eos> My kid looked me in the eye and he said he didn't want to live with me.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that hurts?<eos> Actually, I do.
- I'd like to see it.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - I'll be in London on Wednesday.<eos> - Edith has a date.<eos> - No, I don't.
I-I know, my phone died and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I..<eos> ...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.
Why?<eos> What'd you do, follow me?<eos> No.<eos> - I put a tracker on your car.<eos> - You did what?
Um, not exactly.<eos> I, um..<eos> Sorry. Um..<eos> I don't know if you know my story.<eos> I do.
Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
I tell you, after a long day in the field, the last thing you need is to hear some bimbo screaming, "Harder,"<eos> through the walls, you know?<eos> Well, small world.<eos> You know, Colby, I actually do have a room opening up here.<eos> No, you don't.
If my mom comes with us.<eos> Emily, I've gotta go home.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you said your mom....<eos> I did.
No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
No, I think she got what she needed.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> Alison's never had anyone like you in her whole life.<eos> Somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable and genuine.<eos> I did.. ...but I don't anymore.
You guys are totally off base.<eos> Whose photo did you plan on shooting with this?<eos> Look, get your hands off of me, alright?<eos> You guys have no idea what you're doing.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yes!<eos> Uh, excuse me, sir, can I borrow your cell phone?<eos> I locked my keys in my car, and I got to call my husband.<eos> Uh, I don't, uh, have a cell phone.<eos> You don't?
- Passports, please. - Yep.<eos> Guess it's on 17:55.<eos> Thank you so much, have a nice day.<eos> Get ready for the Riviera.<eos> We do well as underdogs.
It's so pretty.<eos> It's awesome. Who wants to treat their partner?<eos> - You do it.<eos> - Ok. Who wants to treat their partner?<eos> I do, I do.
You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
You want to run them from the catwalks?<eos> Yes, space this size-- no communications will get in or out. I'm confident of that.<eos> I don't need to tell you there is no margin for error.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You do not.
I'm 10 months sober now, and I don't belong in here.<eos> So if you write about me...<eos> I'm not writing about you.<eos> You want to know about Alice or not?<eos> You do.
Hey, fisher, i was right.<eos> Ed clark didn't commit suicide.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> He does.
Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion On turning liam down--<eos> I don't.
- Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please.<eos> - Sir, please.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
Well, you've come to the right place.<eos> How's an American citizen end up in a hole like this?<eos> Just look enough like Yamamoto to piss off the Rotary Club.<eos> Or just look like a plain old white fella who went to the wrong meeting.<eos> Well, did you?
What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
That's why I've decided to step up and come with you.<eos> Ah, n-no offense, Russell, but having you there will exponentially increase our chances of failure.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I'm not so sure you know the proper usage of "no offense."<eos> Yes, I do.
So, helpless?<eos> And yes, I didn't want Chris to find out because of the money but that wasn't the main reason I didn't tell you.<eos> Selfish? Nasty?<eos> It's because I still love you.<eos> Despite all this, I do.
No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
I don't have a choice.<eos> Now move!<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> Move!<eos> But you do.
You're not being rational.<eos> When he gunned her down, she looked right at me.<eos> I can still see her face.<eos> I understand your loss.<eos> No, you don't.
- Where are you going?<eos> So is it a boy or a girl?<eos> God. Do you know how broken you are?<eos> I know exactly who I am, doctor.<eos> Most people don't.
You'llbesniffingcokeoff ofsomesororitygirl'stits , thinking," iwonderhow Charlie'ssobrietyis coming?"<eos> Lift your scrotum, please.<eos> Itjustcoversyou likea-- awarmblanket insideandout.<eos> Hey, it's a new guy.<eos> How you doing, new guy?
No? Okay, Charlie.<eos> Well, just know that if you continue to refuse to accept the disease that put you here, you will continue to be a repeat offender.<eos> Don't you mean repeat customer?<eos> You have a disease, Charlie.<eos> We all do, all right?
I can't publicly endorse what you did, but you got something.<eos> It's not for everybody.<eos> It's for you, just being up there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Give Jonathan his hat back.<eos> Who... who are... who are you here for?<eos> Owen Farhidi.<eos> Mr. Farhidi, he call.<eos> Uh, yes, he did.
You heard his demands.<eos> You got the address.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I do.
You just gave me money.<eos> Just keep it.<eos> C'mon.<eos> - Why don't you pay your debt?<eos> - I did.
- Why don't you pay your debt?<eos> - I did.<eos> Akbar is upset with you.<eos> - Pay your debt.<eos> - I did.
And I stayed behind.<eos> And I held stuff down.<eos> And I silenced myself so that you could grieve.<eos> If you need to grieve, we can...<eos> I did!
You need a place to not be Catherine Avery... To not be decisive and set agendas and rise to the level of accomplishments that the world has come to expect of you.<eos> You need a place to fall apart.<eos> I will be that place... should you require it... in perpetuity.<eos> Richard, do you take Catherine to be your wife for as long as you both shall live?<eos> - I do.
I will be that place... should you require it... in perpetuity.<eos> Richard, do you take Catherine to be your wife for as long as you both shall live?<eos> - I do.<eos> - And, Catherine?<eos> I do.
Jack?<eos> She's dead because of you.<eos> I had no choice, Jack!<eos> I had a family.<eos> So did I!
Back to my mother?<eos> She wants you dead.<eos> What about you?<eos> How... How do I know that you won't just turn me in?<eos> You do not.
Is that me?<eos> No, I think that's the big-boned lass from the bus.<eos> PAM: This is unacceptable.<eos> Ellie has a very vivid imagination.<eos> Actually, she does not.
It's thanks to him I found my vocation.<eos> Come in, Dad.<eos> Listen, Andrea... we haven't discussed this matter yet... but I think it's time I told you what I think of your vocation.<eos> I already know.<eos> - You do?
In 1996 he received a conditional sentence of violence Due to an attenuating circumstance.<eos> The customer had raped the girl.<eos> In 1997 it happened again.<eos> "Then he sat in three months.<eos> - Then I did the lump.
But it's weird... I haven't seen any of my friends.<eos> No, th-they're here.<eos> You know, th-they're around.<eos> Yeah, no one wanted to miss the chance to party with San Francisco's... sexiest bachelor.<eos> No, they didn't.
Well, then we're the most healthy, normal couple you'll ever meet.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> There you go.<eos> You have my blessing.<eos> - We do?
"The meal danced across my palate with a symphony of flavors"...<eos> "Which is fitting because, according to his mother, "the owner Nathaniel Marlowe's approach "stems from his philosophy that food is like music, every ingredient a note."<eos> - You read my cards.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I did.
If you spoke to Donna that way, no wonder she left you.<eos> Because you don't just pay people to be loyal.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I don't give a shit about the money, and I never did.<eos> No, you didn't.
Even with my spider powers, I could never scale Sauron Tower undetected.<eos> A fine pair of Saurian sad sacks you are!<eos> You want to change the way dino-people think, we've gotta take action!<eos> The angry red human has a point.<eos> Of course I do!
- The old question marks.<eos> - You used to wear question marks.<eos> Oh, I know, yes, I did.<eos> They were nice. Why don't you wear them any more?<eos> Oh, I do.
I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course we do.
- Olivia.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thank you for meeting me here.<eos> Your squad know about the situation?<eos> They do now.
Well, all right.<eos> You should think about taking it.<eos> You'd be on the fast track here.<eos> Don't want to be a detective forever.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He was holding a shard of glass to her neck.<eos> Eventually he surrendered, at which time, we placed him under arrest and read him his rights.<eos> Do you see the man you apprehended<eos> - in this courtroom today?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I grew more in my last 4 years with you than I did in the 12 years that I was with him.<eos> You know, that relationship, whatever it was, didn't allow for anything else.<eos> But with you, with your support...<eos> I have a family.<eos> Yes, you do.
- to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
It's OK.<eos> We just want to talk to you.<eos> Seems I have their attention.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Kelli is in...<eos> - a small room with cement walls.<eos> - Yes, but did you notice...<eos> - the walls are covered with plastic.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Listen closely.<eos> Breadsticks. Redskins. Breadsticks.<eos> Redskins. It just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if it does.<eos> It doesn't, no.
And then you walked through the door.<eos> And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right...<eos> you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
Sure, it'll be fine, but how are we supposed to have a real conversation with his girlfriend here?<eos> A conversation about what?<eos> We haven't seen each other in 20 years, Mom.<eos> You don't think we need to talk about why?<eos> No, I don't.
It'll just upset your father.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Dad still doesn't know about this?<eos> About what Nate called you?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> She was.<eos> She was doing great.<eos> So what happened?<eos> He did.
Hi, Anna.<eos> - Hi, Bob.<eos> Harrison, you okay?<eos> What do you want, Anna?<eos> What do you...
You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
We trust to our peril... but to not is to be alone... and then...<eos> Oh, the silence.<eos> Is that not why you keep us all so close?<eos> You see, I understand you, Inspector,<eos> I really do.
Come on, Castle.<eos> No woman is worth dying for.<eos> Come on. Where is she? !<eos> I believe that you're telling the truth.<eos> I do.
No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.
Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.<eos> Then why is she keeping me in the dark?<eos> - I don't need protecting.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It could be black market.<eos> You should ask hunter to contact the back-alley traders he knows.<eos> Hunter's not talking to me.<eos> You know why?<eos> I do.
How come you're no longer manager of Legia?<eos> How come...<eos> I left because of a... let's just say because of a difference of opinion.<eos> And was this difference of opinion with Victor Arshad?<eos> To do with your connection, to the right-wing followers of the club?
Thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> All right. Let's go see aunt Beverly.<eos> Do you think she knows we're here?<eos> You didn't. Right, mom?
Well, if you insist...<eos> Please... please take me to my brothers and save them.<eos> No!<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> Aye. That I do.
How come you're not married?<eos> Kent?<eos> Just haven't met the right woman yet, sweetie.<eos> I think you'd be a good daddy.<eos> [ Chuckles ] You do, huh?
God, I wish.<eos> But, you know, i have my patients, and...<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> What?<eos> We do.
Can you see him? !<eos> Now I got you.<eos> He's on the reservation! Ugh! Where are we, pop?<eos> We've never been here before.<eos> How you doing, Ed?
- He loves you, too?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know how many of you there have been?<eos> Do you?
Well, I'm eager to hear what was so urgent.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> You know, I thought that we were gonna be friends, Hap.<eos> I really did.
- Did you get a look at him?<eos> - Not right now, Hap.<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> Cody, did you see him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- what you're going on about.<eos> - Jules, I saw you at the hospital.<eos> I know how Hap looks at something he thinks belongs to him.<eos> So does he love you?<eos> He did.
- What's that mean? !<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> All you need to know is, you do not want to get mixed up with him.<eos> And you swear to me... you swear to me you don't know where he is.<eos> What if I did?
I'm sorry. I was just remembering the promise you gave to the farmer in Oklahoma.<eos> Now the only thing that lives on the land is misery.<eos> Well, you've heard half the story.<eos> And you have a better proposal?<eos> I do.
I'm willing to take another chance on you.<eos> On us.<eos> Look, if that's not what you want, then you just...<eos> You really got to be honest now.<eos> No, I do.
You're running around here half naked.<eos> Just be what you are.<eos> Hmm? You're an exhibitionist.<eos> You like to be looked at.<eos> - Oh. - You do.
We'll go get Mexican.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.
- That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
You've said a thousand times there are no coincidences.<eos> Listen to me, Barney Fife. You know when there are coincidences?<eos> On the 4th of July weekend when we're scheduled to go to the Dodger game tomorrow night. That's when!<eos> Now if you don't call your Watch Commander back, do you know who's coming down here?<eos> Do you?
Now we've heard enough.<eos> Andrea, what do you think?<eos> If he agrees to eventually write all that down, Mr. Sloan may participate in the marriage ceremony and stay through the first dance with his daughter, provided the police escort him every moment and he doesn't try to get away.<eos> Mr. Sloan, do agree to the very generous terms offered to you in front of your family by the State and witnessed by the L.A.P.D.?<eos> I do.
Yes, and before that?<eos> There are entries here, not only one as the prosecutor indicated, in 1990 there are one, two, three, four, five, six entries with "Payment to J. M. 255,000 pesetas".<eos> The amount isn't significant.<eos> I agree on year but I don't think it's José María Aznar, I didn't pay him that.<eos> You didn't.
I admit...we're corrupt, dishonest.<eos> We live for no one but ourselves.<eos> I admit to everything.<eos> But don't we have any self-respect'?<eos> Of course we do.
This way, I can give you two at least a chance of continuing your research.<eos> Maggie, I can't let you do that.<eos> I'm sorry, Professor.<eos> You don't have a choice in this.<eos> Yes I do.
It's because he's bored.<eos> He probably sent the message because he's bored.<eos> Go ahead and reply.<eos> - I did mention that we were together, earlier.<eos> - You did?
Who gives a shit, christina?<eos> They're grown men.<eos> Well, they're still our children.<eos> And why do you get to start over?<eos> You do too.
No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you are.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
[ gulls crying ] Anyway...<eos> This fight with you and ryan.<eos> I've been giving it a lot of through.<eos> I want to see it happen.<eos> I do.
There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter s. Thompson.<eos> Ah, hunter s. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
Oh, my god, right?<eos> I am freaking out.<eos> You don't think that's because of what he heard us say, do you?<eos> No, lots of people gain weight during their engagement.<eos> - You did. ‭
Go easy?<eos> Pablo has always taken the easy road.<eos> MiraTío, perdóname. Okay, you got every right to be upset at me.<eos> I completely dismissed everything that you did here, but I was so wrong, and I know that now.<eos> Do you?
Something you'll have a lot of in here.<eos> Not as much as you think.<eos> Be seeing you.<eos> You really think that leopard's gonna change its spots?<eos> I do.
That's what you meant, right?<eos> Yes, it...<eos> - No.<eos> - Yea... I...<eos> No you didn't.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do you think... do you think I had something to do with this?<eos> Because if you do, I...
The intruders have been removed.<eos> You are free.<eos> I don't know how to thank you, Cad.<eos> William "Cadmus" Drake.<eos> Well, I do.
Stop, you can't tear our building down!<eos> So excited, I feel like I'm in "Legally Blonde."<eos> Those Tiffany windows are over 100 years old, making it a historic, landmark building.<eos> Do you have documented proof of this?<eos> Yes, I do, your honor.
It is.<eos> It's my PPT.<eos> Then I totally get it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Max.<eos> You always do.
Married the diamond(! )<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
You're not invited.<eos> Shouldn't you have to have a permit or something?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You told me she wanted to apologize.<eos> She does.
Mm, Mondays are rough, but these could take the edge off.<eos> Could we save them for tomorrow?<eos> Only if I take them with me.<eos> [laughs] I do know you.<eos> You do.
A new approach.<eos> Those days are over and done with.<eos> That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police."<eos> And do you remember what you said to me?<eos> No, I don't.
Those days are over and done with.<eos> That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police."<eos> And do you remember what you said to me?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You don't.
I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired.<eos> We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
See how I'm doing on Farmer.<eos> Ooh.<eos> I got a love sprout.<eos> "Want to meet up?"<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay.<eos> You win.<eos> Nobody treats me like that and lives.<eos> Do you even know who the hell I am?<eos> Do you?
No.<eos> I want payback.<eos> You don't get to take that away from me. Yeah.<eos> We knew what we were getting into when we joined up with you...<eos> Well, no we didn't. Not even a little bit.
You're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me.<eos> Your people know nothing about my physiology, and that's exactly the way I like it.<eos> I have lived for many, many centuries, and the longer my people live, the more difficult we are to kill.<eos> So why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
Of course not.<eos> We were just being nice to him for the discount.<eos> You're our Ash.<eos> Don't you know that by now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, what do you want me to say?<eos> Just tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it.<eos> Colby was an informant.<eos> You tried to get him to be an informant.<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I have to clear.<eos> See, that's the thing.<eos> You don't.
Thank you.<eos> So... Now what?<eos> He wants to see you fight.<eos> But I thought he loved me.<eos> He does.
- Tammy...<eos> Remember we went to that sweet little shop in Venice and we tried, like, 12 different cakes?<eos> Remember, honey, we fell in love with this? Sarah, okay? Just calm down.<eos> - I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Remember, honey, we fell in love with this? Sarah, okay? Just calm down.<eos> - I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> I have the soul of a warrior!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> I have the soul of a warrior!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I do!
Finish it!<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Got it now.<eos> - Come on, do it, Maddox.<eos> - Just do it!
Hey.<eos> I left her first.<eos> She was depending on me, and I got on that bus, and I left her here.<eos> So I know how you feel.<eos> [Crying] No, you don't.
I was just hanging on to the smallest possible hope, you know, but... You knew... you knew that... even if she survived that... she wouldn't...<eos> she wouldn't be living.<eos> God, she'd hate that.<eos> I think you made the right decision.<eos> I do.
You shut me out?<eos> You go against my wishes here?<eos> It's not easy, Deacon, but we have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I don't want to feel anything.<eos> I don't want to think.<eos> I don't even want to dream.<eos> You got something for that?<eos> I do.
What are those?<eos> An apology.<eos> For being overly sensitive about the tour last night.<eos> - You don't have to say anything about that.<eos> - I do. I do.
I mean, she grounded me for getting onstage, if you can believe that.<eos> She doesn't know, does she?<eos> What?<eos> That I love you?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> I want you to hear what I heard.<eos> Oh. So now you want me to sing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
So, what'd you think?<eos> I think it's great.<eos> Good job.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I did.
I'd like a few minutes of your time.<eos> I'm sorry you found out the way you did.<eos> There's probably not a good way to find out Juliette's trying to worm her way back into our lives.<eos> You do know that she signed away her parental rights.<eos> I do.
You stole this from Simon, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Alex, wait!<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> Do you like the tea?<eos> I... Yeah, I do.

Okay, everybody stay together.<eos> If you have all of your stuff, we're gonna head over to the National...<eos> Hey, does anyone have eyes on the guy with the tweed blazer?<eos> I think he's one of the suspects they showed us.<eos> Oh, you do?
Tonight we've got dinner with that woman from DeGraaf's.<eos> Roxanna Whitman.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
Do you expect me to believe you actually care about them?<eos> I care about the account, and we're running out of time.<eos> Do you have anything useful?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - No, you don't.
Clara!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Why would you think it was okay to take a photo of my son in an anti-vaccination onesie?<eos> But I thought you said you wanted him to be famous.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
[chuckles] Why?<eos> Say we were to have another kid, Mindy would probably stop working.<eos> Oh, you don't say.<eos> I wasn't aware that Mindy wanted any more children.<eos> Oh, we do.
I like to keep the seat next to me empty so it's easy for me to get away.<eos> at least I know now who my workplace nemesis is.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I hope you all had a very nice weekend.<eos> I sure did.
how did your therapy session go?<eos> Did Christina show up?<eos> - No.<eos> man.<eos> - She didn't.
- Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> - And I'm sorry that I said<eos> I know why your wife can't stand you.<eos> - You never said that.<eos> - I didn't?
There's nothing to learn from this.<eos> It's possible it's not inert.<eos> Alien metals have different properties.<eos> We don't know for sure.<eos> Yes, we do.
£200 just for you. £200?<eos> I've had to increase my commission, I'm afraid.<eos> If you don't like it, you can have it paid into your own bank account.<eos> You know I cannot.<eos> Yes, I do.
Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
Well, it's one of 'em. I'll give you each fifty thousand dollars!<eos> We're federal agents!<eos> Okay, how about, uh, a hundred thousand dollars each?<eos> Open the door! I have a gun.<eos> No, you don't.
That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
When I break Vera out tonight, you do with your brother what you want.<eos> That's the only outcome where you got the possibility of living.<eos> It's your best move.<eos> What makes you think I still won't kill you afterwards?<eos> I don't.
I've been kicked.<eos> I've been spit on by girls before, and I always manage to keep it together.<eos> - But, you know, my own daughter...<eos> - You don't have to explain.<eos> Yeah, I do, okay?
He's good at it.<eos> Whole fucking night, man.<eos> Whole fucking night to showcase Alicia.<eos> Meanwhile, I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> You... we both do.
I think we should take it easy for a little while.<eos> - Let's just keep it chill.<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> We both do.
You know, I think I am.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> What're you going to do down here?<eos> I have an interview tomorrow.<eos> You do?
- No.<eos> The game against the Canucks when you were robbed of the hat trick?<eos> That's because Horvat tripped you, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah. Nobody saw that.<eos> I did.
But the steward needed vellum and demanded I retrieve it.<eos> Aiden, you have no reason to fear.<eos> Your devotion is between you and your God.<eos> This secret does not hold us.<eos> Secrets never do.
Agathe.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Do you like Schubert?<eos> Yes, I... I do.
Their tears.<eos> And their families' tears.<eos> You shut down your emotions for long enough, you don't want to spend all day with somebody else's.<eos> Does it bother you when I talk about my mother?<eos> It did.
Now, I'll have this Ativan ready to stop it, if I need to, but I want to return to exactly what was happening When you last seized.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're ready.<eos> That does not look like a momentary lapse.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I wanna stay.<eos> _<eos> Positive.<eos> I have those feelings too sometimes.<eos> You do?
She'll be there.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - But you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, but, the entire car is a Vauxhall Frontera.<eos> Yeah, you are left with a...<eos> What?<eos> Look, for 140 quid, I wouldn't care if it said "dog dirt" on the grille.<eos> It pretty much does.
And we need money for boat tickets and a bribe for the visas.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This shit is fascinating.<eos> Did you know there is such a thing as inherited trauma in your actual DNA?<eos> No, I did not.
I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.

[ Folder thuds ] Before I continue the investigation into the Fifth Dynasty,<eos> I need to discuss what may be some... relevant legal work... in which Chandler was involved.<eos> What the...<eos> This has nothing at all to do with the Fifth Dynasty.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You okay, Gus?<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I-I appreciate very much being able to lay Mariana to rest like this.<eos> But I just feel it's unfair, making me agree not to meet with Paloma till she's 18.<eos> Do you want Paloma to lose everything that she has, Gus?<eos> No. No, I don't.
You married me, and I'm doing my best.<eos> Don't you remember what you said to me?<eos> You said that you don't want me to be like your mamma.<eos> Not, tied to the kitchen sink in an apron, working my fingers to the bone, but somehow I think, that is exactly what you want.<eos> No, I don't.
~ Why are you doing this?<eos> ~ To help you to see who he really was properly.<eos> ~ You were supposed to be his friend.<eos> ~ Well, I didn't know him very well.<eos> None of us did.
But there are still doubts over his conduct.<eos> ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
You do not understand.<eos> You have never understood.<eos> The holy marriage of heaven and earth is wasted on an ignorant and ungrateful peasant girl!<eos> You want him.<eos> I do not.
Stop it.<eos> That ain't Dollie.<eos> There will be no more of your foul magic here!<eos> Who says so?<eos> I do.
This is Leopoldo Borghini, from my club, the funniest pharmacist in the world.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> - Hi. - We know each other.<eos> We do?
Damiani!<eos> - What are you thinking about?<eos> - Giulia.<eos> What's Giulia got to do with Dante's Paradise?<eos> Sorry, nothing at all to do with it.
Darius McCrae wrote something for me?<eos> He did.<eos> He wanted to apologize.<eos> You don't have to read it if you don't want to.<eos> No, I do.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Those hot spots you see are nodules -- very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying? I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon,<eos> I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
I realize this isn't how you intended this to happen.<eos> But he's come all this way and he's got the money that we need.<eos> What money?<eos> He doesn't have any money.<eos> Yes, he does.
That is... that is the ultimate good luck.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> So, you helped, uh, with the mission yesterday.<eos> So you knew which families, which houses, were going to be visited and at what time.<eos> Apparently, so did the Red Hand.
An independent contractor proposed the project, ran things out of a lab complex.<eos> Facility shut down years ago.<eos> Maybe worth looking anyway.<eos> Do we have to guess who it was that funded this independent contractor?<eos> No, you don't.
Mr. Tull, your therapist's testimony is coming, and when it does, your ability to cut a deal goes away.<eos> Drop this matter, and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all.<eos> You went to see a company-provided therapist, and you never told me?<eos> I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Well, it goddamn does.
- Because I can't.<eos> - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
Take a catwalk<eos> Nice try kitty cat, with the voice-jack<eos> I've got friends looking out They've got my back<eos> Now you know, stealing the show is a crime<eos> Unless you do it right
Hey, why are we hiding?<eos> He doesn't approve of this.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> Okay, Toros wants you dead.<eos> Yes, Toros does.
- Yeah.<eos> It looks crazy, but...<eos> I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
I think I'm gonna be running everything that has to do with the Sarkissian family.<eos> It's going to be mine to manage.<eos> And I'm thinking a great man can use a beautiful woman by his side.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> I do.
You gotta get well.<eos> You gotta be ready to quit this shit.<eos> And I'm ready.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't.
Is everything OK?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Nothing happened between us.<eos> It didn't?
Okay, so, you do know him?<eos> 'Cause a minute ago...<eos> I think silent Sam was better off not speaking.<eos> Why did you lie to us, sir?<eos> I didn't.
- No.<eos> One-night stands.<eos> I had my first one last night. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, man!<eos> I remember my first one-night stand.<eos> No, I don't.
Probably just tired.<eos> Nate?<eos> Headachy, fevery.<eos> You want to examine me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yaz. - What song?<eos> - "Only You."<eos> Did your dad teach you that move?<eos> He said it always works.<eos> Did with me.
I don't know.<eos> Feels good, doesn't it?<eos> Indulging every impulse, wielding great power, doing whatever you want.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
Well, I guess it's even worse than I thought.<eos> You can't even see any future at all with me.<eos> That's not it. Don't you get it?<eos> I'm afraid because I do want a future with you.<eos> - You do?
As you recall, I imbued it with magic to rip your heart out.<eos> Well, go on, then. What are you waiting for?<eos> The last time I tried helping you, you betrayed me.<eos> - How do I know I can trust you now?<eos> - You don't.
Because if I said that Brooke hit me, then she would have told.<eos> And if I test positive for drugs at any time during the application process, then that's it.<eos> You can never join the army.<eos> So, you have other options.<eos> No, I don't.
- but I am now.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
I noticed on Facebook that they were your favorite.<eos> Oh, that's so thoughtful.<eos> See, most men wouldn't know what to send.<eos> But you know what I like.<eos> Yes, yes I do.
He overheard things about me, about his dad.<eos> He's not about to let that go.<eos> Well, can you blame him?<eos> All of a sudden, he finds out he really didn't know half of what the man was up to.<eos> But you did.
All of them students at Eton College.<eos> I was not summoned home because of the Ripper killings.<eos> It was to protect me from infection.<eos> You had no idea about the outbreak?<eos> No, none of us did.
You could've given me a chance, you know?<eos> All you guys ever did was tell me I wasn't good enough, tell me I didn't belong.<eos> Well, I belong here.<eos> Gustav, you have no idea what you're getting into!<eos> Oh, yes, I do, Hiccup.
Do you really think so?<eos> I knew you were up to something.<eos> Fishlegs, have you been training to take on the Quaken?<eos> - You don't have to answer that.<eos> - Oh, yes, he does. Fishlegs?
- Hurry up, Na Bong.<eos> - No...<eos> Chef, please just once.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> - Do the dishes...
The ships are guarded by no more than 60 men.<eos> The rest of the army will be inland looking for food.<eos> We kill the men, we burn the ships.<eos> And you really believe Scorpa will then go to Guthrum?<eos> I do.
You realize that you're stalking me?<eos> What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> 'She needs to be controlled.<eos> They both do.'
Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
Is that so wrong?<eos> I have all the possessions in the world.<eos> But you were never a possession.<eos> I always cherished you.<eos> I still do.
I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah.<eos> I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
How do we end it?<eos> Heh. If you hurt me, I know a certain someone who won't react very well.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> You think because you know someone like Klaus, you know someone like me?<eos> Well, you don't.
And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
So, pops is circling the drain.<eos> No, mom and webmd say balloon angioplasties are easy.<eos> Balloon?<eos> I want a balloon.<eos> Not in your heart, you don't.
Ruby, I told you I don't like the kids eating a sugary breakfast on a school day.<eos> Since when is Thursday a school day?<eos> Besides, I have a right to spoil my grandbabies.<eos> Now, who wants ice cream?<eos> - I do!
Moop! Okay, and listen.<eos> So, we left enough food in the fridge, right?<eos> Did we put the lights on a timer?<eos> And did you call Charlotte, like I asked?<eos> - You did?
Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> But Zeep did.
You're going to have to get used to seeing me like this, Bella.<eos> As Dr Jekyll.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't want Jekyll.<eos> Right now, I want Hyde.<eos> Everybody does.

-You've never seen Home Alone?<eos> -I've never seen it!<eos> -Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.<eos> -Neither do I!<eos> -No one does.
The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - You're right, it makes perfect sense.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
And you just roll into my life like a hurricane.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we knew each other for five minutes 30 years ago?<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - You do. I don't.
- Alicia, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> You don't ask open-ended questions.<eos> You ask yes or no questions and only about bail.<eos> - Yeah, but I need to know his story.<eos> - No, you don't.
It's an assembly line.<eos> Keep the court moving... that's all.<eos> Here's the other thing.<eos> You didn't make any money today.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Then he'd come for me.<eos> Confirm the kill and bring me home.<eos> - Why do you want to know?<eos> - Because I want to find him.<eos> You really don't.
He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.<eos> The next time, that could be you or Iris.<eos> I'm just wondering if going after him now is premature.<eos> I mean, we barely know anything about his abilities.<eos> Wells does.
I mean, we had such a good time that summer.<eos> Yeah. Uh, you probably don't even remember it.<eos> No, I remember some...<eos> I-I remember all of it, yeah. I remember all of it, yeah.<eos> Of course I do.
Um... some years back.<eos> I passed it on.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> I thought it had gone.<eos> It rarely does.
Took away my whole life.<eos> And I can't do anything.<eos> I got you a coffee and a tea this morning.<eos> Which would you prefer?<eos> - I don't...
- But I am now.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
They're willing to sell it for 100,000 yen.<eos> Joe, if I agree to this, you guarantee that they will honor this bargain?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Joe, I need to know that you understand what I'm saying.<eos> I do, sir.
W-What gun?<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Yes, it was him.<eos> I have right to kill him.<eos> Yes, you do.
We account for every cent.<eos> I take personal responsibility for that.<eos> Maybe you don't consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> Yeah, it is-- do you or don't you?
They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
No one should have to live like this.<eos> I just said you don't have to.<eos> I'm not talking about me.<eos> Well, I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
- He moved to Conference C.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can I call for you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing on the data penetration?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you for taking care of me.<eos> You have somewhere to go, I hope?<eos> Someone to look after you?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> I told you there is no one else.<eos> I'm counting on you to do this.<eos> And I just told you I would.<eos> You did.
This.<eos> You.<eos> Following me around.<eos> I want you to know I don't believe what they're saying about you.<eos> None of us do.
And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
Why can't he be reached?<eos> Remember, this man had already been illegally imprisoned once before.<eos> One could argue that in extraordinary times the state is justified in taking extraordinary measures.<eos> I used to believe that.<eos> I really did.
He doesn't know our names, does he?<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Peter didn't shoot my son.<eos> I did.
I mean, is there anything you don't know how to ruin?<eos> Dude, what was up with that?<eos> Yeah, why didn't you tell us?<eos> Well, do you guys want the whole story?<eos> Yeah, we do.
In the real ending of the story, 117, the Spartans are betrayed and slaughtered.<eos> It is their sacrifice that actually saves and unites Greece.<eos> But we had more choices.<eos> The men you hit with rocks didn't.<eos> No, sir, they did not.
Your priorities are to follow orders, and to preserve your life and the lives of your team.<eos> Is that clear, Squad Leader?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We heard what happened.<eos> Everyone on the ship did.
You want me to feel better?<eos> About what?<eos> Dora Cargill walloped you, ha!<eos> It must've hurt awfully.<eos> It did.
You haven't told me if she's all right. LEWIS GRUNTS<eos> Come on now.<eos> I've told you, please.<eos> You went for a walk, you got friendly, you got to friendly with her, she said no, you lost your temper.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Mummy did her best with it.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - Not too bad.<eos> Why is it the only time he does it to me, it has to show?<eos> Yours never do.
That's life or death.<eos> I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on. Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Guys.<eos> I cracked the phone's encryption.<eos> The shooters received calls from only one number.<eos> - Are you able to trace it?<eos> - I already did.
So, do you need a lift, or are you just checking in on me?<eos> I'm happy you're alive.<eos> So, do you believe that Allison Hyde masterminded all of this?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Neither do you.
You're a handsome young man.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Noah. I'm your grandson.<eos> I don't have a grandson.<eos> Yes. Yes you do.
Ah, I don't intend on leaving just yet.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> You really know the place on that map?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do?
Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen. No one does.
The only part I don't get is you don't even really seem to like him.<eos> It's kind of a complicated relationship. Hmm.<eos> Like most 4,000 year old relationships are, I guess.<eos> A week ago, I was a barista and I really didn't have a plan for what I was going to do with my life.<eos> And now you do?
Accept apparently Star City.<eos> Your approval rating is up 10 points.<eos> I have an approval rating.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Otherwise, I would be at home, not out patrolling the streets to keep humans out of your minion's fangs.<eos> We found Malcolm in the towns square last night, his heart removed.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't because we didn't do it.

Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.

It's humiliating.<eos> Oh, meh, I do wish I could spare you the terrible pain of embarrassment.<eos> I'm sorry, Datak.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> None of you do.
We should be going to parties.<eos> We should be getting laid.<eos> We should be leaving.<eos> I need this, Hanson.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, maybe she was just being nice.<eos> No, she's a slut.<eos> She wants me in her bed.<eos> I thought you loved me, Dana.<eos> Of course I do.
- Yeah.<eos> With friends and people that identify with me and I identify with them, and the stories we've had.<eos> And no matter h... how many people say they understand and support...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - they don't truly
What kind of person asks a cancer patient for proof?<eos> But why would anyone fake something like this?<eos> It's funny you should ask.<eos> Laura has a theory.<eos> Of course she does.
I just thought that maybe because you saw us together that it might make you feel differently.<eos> It doesn't really matter what I feel.<eos> Laura, is there something you're trying to tell me?<eos> Or that you want me to say?<eos> You already did.
Sold!<eos> What a bargain!<eos> Next up, item number 200!<eos> - You didn't wait for me.<eos> - I did!
But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
Can we talk?<eos> Look, we've been through a lot together, and you know I'll always be your donor, but I need you to understand I have to publish this manuscript.<eos> But you're compromising us at the same time!<eos> I get that you're upset, but you can't just...<eos> You don't!
You're free.<eos> Mike?<eos> Don't thank me yet.<eos> You haven't heard my demands.<eos> How you doing, guy? Huh? You with me?
How do you know that she will move to the mouse?<eos> She will have to.<eos> She will not lose contact with our world.<eos> Come on, come on, come on...<eos> She didn't more to the mouse!
I was.<eos> But then I figured out you knew it was me anyway.<eos> How?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No, it doesn't.
You're being stupid.<eos> So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
Killian!<eos> It worked!<eos> - You're alive!<eos> - Aye.<eos> It did.
I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
They just were looking into each other's eyes, into each other's soul.<eos> I have never seen such courage.<eos> I was watching people and wondering, "When will they run?"<eos> And I'd understand, if they did.<eos> But they didn't.
I really feel like what we're really trying to do here is kind of normalize this as much as we possibly can.<eos> KATE: Well, part of the reason you want to is 'cause you don't want to be a freak. CAITLYN:<eos> I really feel like what we're really trying to do here is kind of normalize this as much as we possibly can.<eos> KATE: Well, part of the reason you want to is 'cause you don't want to be a freak.<eos> And who does?
Look, can I just have the letter back please?<eos> I don't want to run the risk of it falling into the wrong hands.<eos> I don't even have the letter anymore.<eos> I threw it out.<eos> - Oh. You did? - Mm-Hmm.
But that's what she said.<eos> She said, "I want Ricky to do me in my office."<eos> Lots of times.<eos> Didn't she also say, "Lots of times?"<eos> Yes, she did.
- I'm not even going to bring her the watch.<eos> I'm not going to bring her birth control either.<eos> Let's maybe just bring her that one last thing.<eos> - She doesn't need it.<eos> - No, she does, though.
I'm not going to bring her birth control either.<eos> Let's maybe just bring her that one last thing.<eos> - She doesn't need it.<eos> - No, she does, though.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
See, now that's... That's the Kevin I know.<eos> Never giving up hope, never showing signs of progress. Whoo-whoop!<eos> Eight... nine... 56... 57...<eos> We have a problem.<eos> - We do?
- Yeah, I heard that.<eos> - Cool.<eos> So, are you and me doin' our thing?<eos> Oh, sorry, Ricky already asked me, so...<eos> Oh, he did? Oh.
- What are you talking about?<eos> I have an unpayable debt with Heitor.<eos> I can not even think about his death.<eos> Who was talking about death?<eos> You did.
Worse, if he mentions the dinner.<eos> He does not need to do this.<eos> Clara, I do not fear anyone.<eos> But Cesar intimidates me.<eos> He always did.
What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No she didn't!
Get 'em!<eos> It's time you and I put aside our differences.<eos> Nolan will be caught.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
After you drugged him, he came to, and he raped a woman in his hotel.<eos> I didn't drug him, and he gave me that flute.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> - He did.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna be charged with the rape of Alessandra Bay.<eos> What? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪<eos> DNA says you did.<eos> So does she.
- "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
Walk away.<eos> - And then what?<eos> What do you think would happen to me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Always.<eos> We need to deal with Jekyll before he knows the whole truth.<eos> And as soon as we've done what we need to with him, I will give you carte blanche... to kill as many of his friends as you wish.<eos> You know the way to a woman's heart.<eos> Yes, I do.
I knew you've been wanting one.<eos> Quentin, this... this is so nice!<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's beating.<eos> When did it start beating again? I don't know.<eos> The hard reason to do this -- the "No Heart Rhythm" part --<eos> We don't have it anymore.<eos> No, we don't.
Excuse me.<eos> Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Jessamyn Eubanks.<eos> I didn't break up with Teddy;<eos> I just didn't take the ring.<eos> Doesn't mean we broke up.<eos> No, it doesn't...
I'm sorry.<eos> You know what I remember about that night?<eos> His eyes.<eos> They had this shine.<eos> Just like yours did on that subway platform.
The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
Welcome home, ladies.<eos> Do they still have that tampon making workshop?<eos> Ah, yes, they do.
Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
I will arrive at your hall after the new moon.<eos> I shall expect you.<eos> Then we have peace...<eos> - at least for a time?<eos> - Oh, we do.
To the Danes.<eos> There is a peace.<eos> Did you not know?<eos> - Odda has made a peace?<eos> - No, I did not.
- Lord.<eos> Peace was secured with hostages, including my friend Brida and my brother, young Ragnar.<eos> Peace was further secured by Earl Guthrum's baptism and acceptance of the Christian God.<eos> Do you renounce the devil and all his work?<eos> I do.
Because they weren't professional killers.<eos> Sir, it's simple if a father sees his daughter's dead body will he cry standing outside the room or run to hug her?<eos> Has your daughter died?<eos> Do you know what it feels like to lose a child?<eos> And you do?
That he saw a skeleton?<eos> What skeleton?<eos> "I don't know what skeleton.<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> But the patient did.
Hey!<eos> -Black.<eos> -Black, pink, black.<eos> I like pink, go with pink.<eos> -Of course you do.
You need to hurry, you have to do it now.<eos> All right, locating it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You must go farther Lucas, all the way to the back of the tongue.<eos> -Now do it.
That's good, Lucas.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'll take a beer and a shot of whiskey.<eos> You forgot to shut the door.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't care.<eos> You want to come up?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
My grandson, Tyler, he's applying for college.<eos> His sister, Samantha, she just had her first period.<eos> And my son, Greg, had our fourth grandchild with, uh... his wife.<eos> - Your dad just forgot my name again.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Elisabeth decided it was time for her to learn piano. So we set up some keyboards on the floor, and she would run over and turn them on and start to play.<eos> Lolabelle played every day for two years, and she got reasonably good.<eos> She was trained with a little clicker that Elisabeth used.<eos> She also played more experimental music, and she used some of the same programs and samples that I use.<eos> She also did a lot of benefit concerts for other animals and for various animal rights organizations.
It's okay, sweetie.<eos> We just need to clean this up.<eos> But alas, the day had left its mark.<eos> - _<eos> - The important ones do.
Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
I really don't think that's a good...<eos> With all due respect, this is my face and I need to see it.<eos> Show me.<eos> - I knew that... - I knew it was gonna be bad.<eos> I just didn't...
Chop, chop.<eos> You need to, you know, shrink her, mobilize her legs.<eos> You want me to analyze her?<eos> Don't you think that's above my pay grade?<eos> Maybe, but I don't do feelings, especially other people's.
Cocaine Niklas stole the Broman.<eos> Without him, it never happened.<eos> It was Niklas who took it?<eos> Have Stein said that?<eos> What the hell did you, then?
Her only request was that we use some of it to buy this bookcase to keep these books together.<eos> They're my father's books.<eos> And your mother's.<eos> I never knew why she did it.<eos> And now I do.
Kind of ironic since under special skills I put "extensive knowledge of plate tectonics."<eos> But, whatever.<eos> Roxie, what are you doing here?<eos> Did you know that there was an earthquake last night?<eos> Yes, I did.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't even know that I'm here and not there.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she knows.<eos> Everyone does.
I came to see Kevin. Is he okay?<eos> Why was he in the gym?<eos> Did he have to get stitches?<eos> You're asking questions like you care.<eos> While, Kevin, on the other hand, does not.
A little.<eos> Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't. Does he?
Have a seat.<eos> I'll start with the obvious.<eos> Do you know Morpheus' identity?<eos> No.<eos> Nobody does.
Just ignore them.<eos> They're being sheep.<eos> If I'd listened to what other people said, I'd never have rocked my '90s frosted tips.<eos> We've got pictures.<eos> No, we don't.
It's just going to be a little Nick on the side, and then we go to the game.<eos> They're gonna see that it's true.<eos> They're gonna feel horrible because they didn't believe us, and then we don't have to go to anything for a whole year.<eos> - Mm. - I have to say, it makes sense.<eos> No, it doesn't!
Thank you.<eos> It's very awkward with Barry.<eos> Why is it awkward with Barry?<eos> You know, because... he wants to have sex with me.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
You know what, the thing about Anthony was, he was very sad.<eos> No... no, he wasn't.<eos> He was fine.<eos> I think the reason is, is because he... you know, he wanted to have sex with me.<eos> He most certainly did not.
No R-rated movies, no sugary snacks and I want you standing up and asleep by 11.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I can't turn it on.<eos> Well, drop your towel and tell it has a big nozzle.<eos> Did you even do a rat check?
When you find your place, your thing, you must feel better.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It's like how some people can make you feel good or bad...<eos> Do you know anyone like that?<eos> Of course I do.
That explains your muscles.<eos> You think so?<eos> They're pretty discreet.<eos> I didn't think they showed.<eos> They do.
There are moments like that, but they never last.<eos> You're wonderful, Constance.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> True, I don't.
I have always had an iron fist in a velvet glove.<eos> You took the gloves off and that was a grave mistake.<eos> You need to subjugate your subjects.<eos> And I, luckily for you, have a plan.<eos> - You always do.
But he was my love.<eos> And I messed it up.<eos> Royally.<eos> - So if you have feelings...<eos> - I don't.
He bailed and I ended up going to senior prom with my best friend, Duckie.<eos> That's the plot from Pretty In Pink.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I deserved that.<eos> You did.
See?<eos> There it goes.<eos> You okay, bud?<eos> I really miss my dad. I don't think anyone gets how much.<eos> I do, kid. I do.
Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear.<eos> - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
- Really?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> And, by the way, Castle, no matter what you say here, it doesn't prove that your new bff, Billy, didn't off Dave.<eos> No, it doesn't, but his alibi does.
I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't? Hi.
We were wrong about Hank.<eos> He didn't have anything to do with my dad's death.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Just...<eos> I do.
I can't let you hurt anyone.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Your mother signed the death warrants of our entire race and she used you to do it.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Yes, you do.
CatCo security, in conjunction with National City police, They're seizing your computers, your ipads, your mobile devices.<eos> And as for you...<eos> Gentlemen?<eos> Make sure the press get plenty of pictures of him being dragged out.<eos> - You did it.

You're Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know...<eos> I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Um, how you doing?<eos> - Handling.<eos> Digital called, sounds like you are, too.<eos> - That guy knows Superman, right?<eos> - Yes, he does.
But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I'm sure he'll appreciate the sentiment and the eggplant parm.<eos> Yeah, well, guy goes under the knife to save his kid, the least I can do is make sure he gets a decent meal.<eos> Speaking of which, you got any plans tonight?<eos> Weird segue.<eos> No, I don't.
how do you even know that?<eos> Have you been using my face soap, again? Hmm?<eos> Well, Monty has very sensitive skin.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> Oh, does he?
Yep. I need a favour, though.<eos> Can I take half a day?<eos> Nate's taking me punting, don't you know?<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> I do.
You know Luna Bars are for women, right?<eos> Oh, I did not.<eos> Yeah, I think they have, like, menstrual blood in them.<eos> Stop that.<eos> No, they don't. Oof!
David, me...<eos> Adam.<eos> - You're a mathematician too?<eos> - No, I'm a chemist.<eos> We do the lectures every year.
But...<eos> My whole life, there hasn't been a day that he wasn't a part of.<eos> He was my brother, so never make the mistake, Inspector, of thinking that I didn't love him.<eos> How well did you know Paula Guitteau?<eos> I didn't.
"Work alone is noble"?<eos> Bit outdated, isn't it?<eos> Being noble.<eos> I'm not sure I even know what it means any more.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Just like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am surrounded by robots.<eos> Now that we have some privacy...<eos> We don't.
The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.<eos> Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.<eos> I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.<eos> You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.<eos> Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry to hear your friend is sick.<eos> Seriously? We have to put a bell on you.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
- I haven't been there since...<eos> - Since you were hooked up<eos> - in a milk bath, I know.<eos> - No.<eos> Actually, you don't.
- Or is that too hard to talk about?<eos> - Okay, please don't turn this into every relationship I've been in for the last ten years.<eos> Yes, it was a traumatic event and, yes, there's some stuff I need to deal with.<eos> And I will when I have time.<eos> But right now I don't.
I'm going to need details, photos.<eos> We don't need details or photos.<eos> Unless you have them, and they're hilarious.<eos> We definitely don't need details or photos.<eos> Yes, we do.
Just two nights ago, we had a late dinner together at the Congee Noodle House.<eos> He likes the number 8 with duck sauce.<eos> Abby, are you absolutely sure this was two nights ago?<eos> The building security insists that Zac never left his apartment.<eos> Well, he did.
If I had the chance, I would tell him that being independent doesn't have to mean being alone.<eos> He always said he was fine.<eos> I just wish...<eos> I wish I had made him open up to me more, you know.<eos> I do.
Wish me luck?<eos> Oh, you don't need luck.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> You always come back.<eos> And when you do...
And if you have orange in your skin, you have to stay away from anything in the pink family.<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have boxy shoulders or orange skin, so.<eos> Did you know that our daughter knows all this stuff?<eos> I didn't.
Police!<eos> Yes, Le Coz? Where are you?<eos> We've not heard from you.<eos> I've not had time.<eos> I still don't.
I mean, I could see it now-- you and Catherine in matching camouflage cargo pants on some very exotic shooting range, and you get down on one knee, and you say, "Babe, I want you to join my unit for a lifelong mission."<eos> I mean, it's every girl's fairy tale.<eos> Oh, yeah, you want to hear a secret?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do? Mm-hmm.
Which means the killers are still here.<eos> Yo. Boss man. Want a slice?<eos> I got pineapple-pepperoni.<eos> A bit Luke, still tasty.<eos> No, I don't.
NARRATOR: With three races to go, Lorenzo was the only rider with any hope of beating Stoner in the championship.<eos> There were 65 points between them.<eos> The odds were stacked against the Spaniard.<eos> But you never know, Stoner might make a mistake.<eos> He didn't.
After all that talk of armies and ships, you defeated the English with nothing more than a letter.<eos> I can't take much of the credit.<eos> It was Mary's plan.<eos> How did you know it would work?<eos> I didn't.
Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
Because of Agatha?<eos> Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?<eos> Because she found one.<eos> The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.<eos> Maybe still do.
Double-double, animal style.<eos> My treat.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> You know they make animal-style fries, too?<eos> Of course I do.
You're amazing.<eos> It was one of those moments when it felt like it was all right there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I want this.<eos> Shauna, I do.
I worked with one in Lisbon, and I heard about another in Bangkok.<eos> You went to Lisbon? Twice.<eos> I never know where I'm going or what I'm supposed to do until I have to do it, but... I mean, there are sections of HW all over the world.<eos> Do they pay you for this?<eos> Actually, yeah, they do.
They're crazy, what they're gonna do.<eos> They told you? No, no.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I thought you said they didn't talk to you.<eos> They didn't.
And here's your anti-convulsant.<eos> Do you want me to crush it up and put it in your food?<eos> No, I can still chew.<eos> No, he doesn't need the meds yet, anyway.<eos> Yes, he does.
Say hi to Maggie.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> - You called me in here for something?<eos> - I did not.
- to see you guys!<eos> - How are you?<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Yeah, so I see you got some drinks.<eos> - Yeah, we did. We did.
She thought her world was over. Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
LEONARD: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
So, then what is it about?<eos> Is he hurting you?<eos> Dr. Miller's looking for me, so...<eos> I should get to work.<eos> How we doing on the O neg situation?
And then the horse acts like a [bleep] asshole.<eos> Throws her. Tromps her face with its little horse hooves...<eos> - She what?<eos> - Tromped her face.<eos> What do they do?
But she didn't get off Scott-free.<eos> I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!
I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!<eos> - I totally do, too!
Have him sign my new contract.<eos> Of course I didn't read the contract.<eos> Who reads contracts?<eos> That's what I have lawyers for.<eos> At least I did, anyway.
Just try and breathe.<eos> Breathe slowly for me, okay?<eos> Breathe slowly.<eos> She needs an EKG, stat.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I want a lawyer.<eos> Rosie, I think we're gonna nail Ian.<eos> He had access to the bacteria that's used in...<eos> - Perfume, yeah, I know.<eos> - Of course you do.
9th or 10th, what difference does it make?<eos> Just the books get a little thicker.<eos> Yeah, but you must have new teachers?<eos> Yes.<eos> We did.
What?<eos> What do you know?<eos> That she's your mother.<eos> Then you must know where she's been going these days.<eos> Yes, I do.
Damn it.<eos> Terrence's lawyer just pushed the interview, time TBD.<eos> And he's insisting we do it at his house.<eos> I hate rich people.<eos> I do.
I was in bed with my wife when that crash happened.<eos> - You can ask her.<eos> - We will.<eos> Maybe one of your biker buddies wanted some highway justice, huh?<eos> They all did, but not with violence.
Pretty much.<eos> Hi.<eos> So, as everybody saw last night, fozzie bear --<eos> Lost touch with reality? Yeah, and speaking from personal experience, You never quite get it back.<eos> No, you do not.
- Yeah.<eos> Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that.. She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
Can you give us a minute, Deadly?<eos> Kermit.<eos> You seem to be under the false impression that I want to be in this room.<eos> - Huh? - You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
It's okay. I'll just, um, call Mom and tell her I'll be home a little late.<eos> You know what?<eos> Tell your mom not to wait up.<eos> You have a hot date tonight.<eos> I do? Cool!
I am not asking about your job.<eos> I'm asking what you believe.<eos> Elizabeth Keen is not a terrorist.<eos> So you believe she's innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Her agent said she's willing to screen test.<eos> - I-I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You do.
_<eos> Okay, Mateo's down.<eos> So... let's talk about Petra.<eos> I mean, if you still want to.<eos> No, yes, of course I do.
He trusted you.<eos> - Hey, you Ben Forsick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How do you know Roxy Richards?<eos> - I don't.
Got probation, but he was ambushed at a stoplight less than six months ago.<eos> And the third, one Terrence Jenkins.<eos> Arrested for multiple sexual assaults of underage girls.<eos> None of them would testify at trial, so he walked.<eos> He did.
We are on the record on October 13, 2015.<eos> This is the videotaped deposition of the defendant, Mr. Kevin Harper, being taken according to federal rules of civil procedure on behalf of the plaintiffs.<eos> Sir, will you raise your right hand?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.

You know what?<eos> I-I think I got a better pose for you.<eos> Allison...<eos> I always knew I loved you, (Voice breaking): But I had no idea how amazing it'd be to build a family and a life with you.<eos> But I do now.
You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
Afraid you can't handle me?<eos> I'm Thanos' daughter!<eos> I worked for Ronan.<eos> Tell me you never wondered if I had something to do with the destruction of your family!<eos> I didn't, but...
Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you really dislike me?<eos> I mean, never mind.<eos> Of course you do.
Oh, speaking of girls.<eos> I have this, er... friend and he's seeing one.<eos> But, er... he doesn't trust her.<eos> - She's got this mother.<eos> - They always do.

They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
S.E.S. (famous girl group in the 90's)<eos> S.E.S...<eos> Did you like dramas, too?<eos> -Yeah, I liked it.<eos> -What did you like?
Suicide.<eos> DCI Howe called me.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.

You mean there was stuff we didn't do?<eos> A lot of stuff.<eos> Sex isn't casual to me.<eos> I want the woman that I'm with to feel amazing.<eos> And I did!
Copies of my official schedule from last week, when we were meeting about the whole...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Not here.<eos> I thought Russell Jackson had her under control.<eos> He does.
H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
We're gonna start with, uh...<eos> Let's go back to our first story.<eos> Uh, Louis, Silla, and Edwin.<eos> Hi.<eos> Cass. How you doing, buddy?
You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
Do you?<eos> Hmm. Ever think... That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Well, let's just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.
Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.<eos> None of us do.
There's a lot of people that are looking for you.<eos> Sarah?<eos> You know my name?<eos> I know all about what happened to you.<eos> No, you don't.
Very much.<eos> - As you can see, she's still the same.<eos> You have to manage her well.<eos> If anything goes wrong... you know?<eos> Of course I do.
Chief Nurse!<eos> Where is Patient Kim Young Shik?<eos> Excuse me, where is his guardian?<eos> - He doesn't have a guardian.<eos> - He doesn't?
Kim Sung-yeol is helping the prince!<eos> A daughter despises her father and wishes to rise above him...<eos> Rather amusing.<eos> Do you still want to be queen?<eos> I do.
What?<eos> - In there.<eos> - Come on? !<eos> - I don't have to get you anything back, do I?<eos> - No, you don't.
Ah, well...<eos> What I've lost in speed, I've made up for in accuracy.<eos> Look, Jake, I understand your, erm...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
We will be running it against the fingerprints you provided today, and we'll have the test results back in a few days.<eos> Are we going to find your DNA on this item?<eos> No comment.<eos> DC Hawkins, I believe you have another exhibit for us...<eos> I do.
I'm fine!<eos> How can you say that after what happened to you today?<eos> You had someone pull a gun on you!<eos> You nearly died...<eos> - But I didn't.
Yeah, I feel you.<eos> Is that James Whitaker?<eos> Oh, he's the captain of the 31st, right?<eos> Like the Black Pope of Chicago.<eos> Does a big card game.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> She does.
It's a halfway house.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Got a Jessie Mandel living here?<eos> I did.
You married one.<eos> Very different situation.<eos> They won't receive her.<eos> It's never going to happen.<eos> It just did.
The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment<eos> - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
Unbelievable.<eos> You guys set me up.<eos> And we almost got away with it.<eos> Oh, wait!<eos> We did!
Yes... What?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> They switch Allens sometimes, Bobby.<eos> No, they don't.
And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
Pardon my French, your honor, but bull.<eos> My suspicions are raised, too, Miss Keating.<eos> Do I need to open an investigation into how you obtained this recording?<eos> You wanted evidence to discredit Helena's testimony, and I've given it to you, your honor. - By obtaining it illegally.<eos> - I did nothing illegal.
She wanted a new identity, so I put her in that cabin.<eos> Before I could get the paperwork ready, a new identity, a group of men showed up.<eos> Who were they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she did.
You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> You didn't?
Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> You didn't?<eos> You didn't.
Please talk to me.<eos> You should be helping Laurel prep Dale.<eos> Can I at least explain to you my version so you can hear it from me instead of Sinclair, who I assume is the one that told you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who told me.<eos> - It does.
That can't be the only reason.<eos> I told you I don't expect anything from you.<eos> But shouldn't you?<eos> Because I want to be the person that... Can give you what you want.<eos> I do, but...
You want the trophy, it's in a box in the basement.<eos> Is this because of Frank?<eos> 'Cause out of all the terrible things that happen in that house, us being together...<eos> - I don't care that you two are screwing.<eos> - You do.
Congratulations... On the case.<eos> Look, I screwed up big time.<eos> And, yeah, I was wasted, but y-you're right.<eos> I saw them go up there, and I didn't do anything, and... Maybe that says a lot about me, about how stupid I was and how stupid I am, but I didn't know they were gonna do that.<eos> I didn't and...
We have good news, though.<eos> We're testing Philip's DNA against the sample we found at the crime scene, and if it matches,<eos> Sinclair will drop the charges against you.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - We do.
Let's eat at home, alright?<eos> Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.
You wouldn't be putting out all these salacious, irrelevant details if you had a real case.<eos> This woman's story is made of cardboard.<eos> That's for a jury to decide, not me.<eos> I saw how she was hanging all over Gerry at the protest.<eos> Everyone did.
You have something I want-- now I have something you want.<eos> I know what you want.<eos> You want a way to help clear your son, and you think I have that.<eos> That's right.<eos> But I don't.
Well, the price for my cooperation is a civilian oversight position with your department's training program.<eos> You're overplaying your hand, Reverend.<eos> Am I? You wouldn't give up a finger of your grip to save your own son?<eos> I don't have power.<eos> The office does.
This qualifies under the exception, Your Honor.<eos> I'll allow it for now, Ms. Reagan.<eos> Can you tell us the name of this friend of yours?<eos> You do know that you're still under oath?<eos> (voice breaking): I do.
Sir, did you hear anything of note?<eos> No one appears to have seen anything.<eos> - And you believe them?<eos> - No reason not to.<eos> We didn't.
Well, I think by living in my car, I am sending a pretty strong message.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> If she's gonna be in your face with her boyfriend, you're gonna be in her face with your boyfriend.<eos> - I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> - You do now, girlfriend.
What if we could discern the method of delivery?<eos> It may at least help us determine whether the poison was slow or fact acting.<eos> Good.<eos> If the poison was cumulative, we would have seen damage to the organs and tissues,<eos> - which we did not.
Even myself.<eos> Is your wife home?<eos> No. Why?<eos> I understand she has a knowledge of poisons.<eos> As did the rest!
I wonder if we should call a doctor, sir?<eos> I dare say we should.<eos> Detective, you are a Water Pig.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - No George, I did not.
I have to ask if your husband has tried to contact you in the last 48 hours.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> [Scoffs] See that girl sitting out there waiting for me?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> I did.
Same M.O.<eos> Posed body, head wound, strangulation.<eos> He's sending a message.<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Otherwise, the farts have nowhere to go.<eos> Here, I can do it.<eos> Oh, thanks, Greg.<eos> I don't like a hot butt.<eos> Nobody does, Dad.
Nah, it's just...<eos> The thing is, he's always been there for me, my whole life.<eos> The only person, actually.<eos> God... it's nice that you have that.<eos> 'Cause not everyone does.
The thing is, he's always been there for me, my whole life.<eos> The only person, actually.<eos> God... it's nice that you have that.<eos> 'Cause not everyone does.<eos> That whale didn't.
- Come on.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Let's go. - Oh, oh, oh.<eos> I think I might have forgotten something.<eos> No, you didn't, you didn't.
- Let's go. - Oh, oh, oh.<eos> I think I might have forgotten something.<eos> No, you didn't, you didn't.<eos> - It's my baby, y... okay.<eos> - No, you didn't.
It worked?<eos> Since then I've been sensing things you've sensed and feeling things that you've felt.<eos> I wanted to bring us closer.<eos> I'm sorry, I had no right to do it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Who needs the English lion anyway?<eos> Our bags are packed and our carriage awaits.<eos> We're going to Paris.<eos> I didn't know we had plans for Paris.<eos> We didn't.
Shut up.<eos> So how did it go?<eos> Oh, you know, I threw in a little case law here, a little due process there, and I talked it off with some exculpatory evidence.<eos> - So you won.<eos> - No, I did not.
It's calling to me.<eos> You're upset, imagining things.<eos> No, I'm not. It's here, isn't it?<eos> You have it, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't care about his judgment.<eos> I care about yours.<eos> Which in this case was nonexistent.<eos> I know, look, I...<eos> No, you clearly don't.
Everything back to normal at home?<eos> Jake is safe.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Well, that's not the only thing that matters.<eos> You do, too.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> They really have something special, don't they?<eos> Yeah, they do.
- That's a good choice. - Mm.<eos> You know, I tried dating an attending.<eos> It just... it doesn't work.<eos> - Prioritize according to...<eos> - Wilson does it.
It'll do the job.<eos> Hang in there, Turner.<eos> God.<eos> Here I am, complaining about my butt burn.<eos> Don't do that.
You're gonna say you love me but...<eos> - You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
You're family.<eos> We'll see you soon, Walter.<eos> Sorry for discounting your plans for Megan as science fiction.<eos> You didn't want to lose her.<eos> Neither did we.
You're wasting your time.<eos> Look, nobody on my team would let some thin-skinned ex-con or his wide-eyed little brother get in the way of a $50 million payout against Manny Garcia next year.<eos> We're way too smart for that.<eos> You're acting like the kid doesn't stand a chance.<eos> He doesn't.
Max is a special boy, Merri.<eos> A brilliant boy.<eos> We only have 90 minutes left.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure you do.
Or do you seek something from him?<eos> Come here.<eos> I need his vote to gain control, which I need to protect my family.<eos> But for him to give me this power, he needs to think that he has power over me.<eos> And he does.
Then you know what?<eos> Why don't you jump in here? A little community consciousness could just change your fortunes, huh?<eos> Women love a doer.<eos> Thanks, man. Hey, you see something over there that looks like something that wire would plug into?<eos> - I don't.
And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
This may be the only time you ever hear this, Vega.<eos> But I couldn't agree with you more. I need to get to my apartment.<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> Blomfeld has the weight and reach of D.I.A. behind him.<eos> Unless he doesn't.
If he follows, let me know.<eos> Pick me up out front.<eos> You got a stalker.<eos> So there's a Space Blue leaving D.C. to Barcelona in two hours. We don't have passports.<eos> Now you do.
How is she?<eos> I, uh... think she's still in shock.<eos> Well, she's been through a lot.<eos> She needs time to process everything.<eos> You both do.
Thank you, friend Rocket.<eos> You knew I could withstand the flames.<eos> Uh... Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did, friend Drax.
Fine, but... (screams)<eos> Bob?<eos> You okay?<eos> Looks like you fell down.<eos> I did, Gayle.
Oh, she fakes injuries when she's sad.<eos> Or when she's happy.<eos> Or bored. Or injured.<eos> Oh, Lin, I hate your sister.<eos> No, you don't.
That's actually understandable given that your blood type is gravy.<eos> That is a nice-looking vehicle, Mike.<eos> I still don't get that whole old-car thing.<eos> You said you had a '65 'vette.<eos> I did -- in 1965.
He would've signed those papers.<eos> Yeah, well, now, he doesn't need to.<eos> Jane Doe ties us to Daylight.<eos> I've done my job.<eos> Now, you do yours.
That... and we found a partial print, which confirms that you're part of the ring.<eos> There's no way you have a print.<eos> I-I've never seen that book before.<eos> I didn't think we had a print for Olivia.<eos> We don't.
I wasn't looking at that.<eos> - 'Cause I took an oath.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> - Oh, I made a mess of that.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
- Those were... Sorry... good times.<eos> Um, okay, so... to boobs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
Lee Majors is going to be at the next one.<eos> The Six Million Dollar Man?<eos> Apparently, he's only worth 100 grand now.<eos> - That's why he...<eos> - BOTH: .. does the conventions.
Guess who we found there.<eos> Troy Abate!<eos> That's two down, eight to go.<eos> All right, I got a question for you.<eos> What do Bill Gates, Justin Bieber,
Say hi to Scruffy Face Joe over there for me.<eos> We need to find Hector.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> They do.
No! Great! Both are great!<eos> Don't tell me what to say, I'll say it!<eos> You look totes adorbs!<eos> Yeah! Totes magotes.<eos> I do, don't I?
♪ If I could see you One more time ♪<eos> ♪ It's sorry, I would say ♪<eos> ♪ Mo-Mo, You my bro-mo ♪<eos> Do you understand what you have to do now, Julien?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
_ Stop, please!<eos> I don't know where he is!<eos> He's your brother.<eos> Of course you do.
- Hi.<eos> So, is this a six-month anniversary surprise?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> - Because you didn't know.<eos> - I did.
That's very impressive, doctor.<eos> You do know your ortho.<eos> I want to apologize about before.<eos> It's not that I don't respect ortho.<eos> I do.
Come on, Reid.<eos> Spit it out.<eos> You've been sitting on it all day.<eos> Doctors, we have a problem.<eos> Yes, we do.
Let me see.<eos> Yeah, there.<eos> What number were youputtingin ?<eos> You don't know my birthday, do you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Enjoy it.<eos> What?<eos> You don't think that I can do it?<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You'll see.<eos> Dominic, meet Detective Jay Halstead.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Works with me in Intelligence.<eos> How you doing?
- That's what I thought.<eos> - Good.<eos> Gonna change.<eos> I don't know what this means.<eos> - Of course you don't.
He hadn't seen or heard from Lily all day.<eos> Is this her iPad?<eos> What's the password?<eos> She doesn't have a password.<eos> Yeah, she does.
That made you mad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No one does, Robby.
Yeah.<eos> I'd smile, ask her if she could give me a smile back.<eos> Okay. And last week?<eos> I asked her if she wanted a soda, a Vitamin Water, something.<eos> And she did?
BOB: Louise, it's okay.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> Santa stopped giving you presents ages ago.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You really don't, Bob.
What's going on?<eos> As you can see, I've been running a-fowl.<eos> Oh, it's classic.<eos> You have something for me?<eos> We do.
He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
The terms are he'll be off completely if he puts together a list of everyone involved in the dealing.<eos> So, basically he's gonna rat his way out of it.<eos> - (Elizabeth) Sounds that way.<eos> - Hey, we don't know for sure he's gonna give you up.<eos> We don't?
So, we'll be taking that tainted Utopium now.<eos> Yeah, some bad news on that front.<eos> You said he knew where to find it.<eos> No, he...<eos> He does...
Aubrey, we've noticed from your medical records that you've lost quite a few pounds over the last year.<eos> From diet and exercise.<eos> You don't have a prescription for thyroid medication, but we've known some girls to sneak their mom's pills.<eos> Do you have a prescription, Mrs. Clark?<eos> Yes, I do.
I get to erase all the genitalia that was drawn on the cupcake board.<eos> And I love Thursdays 'cause I get to redraw them.<eos> I need some more paper towels.<eos> Oh, I think they're downstairs.<eos> Max, you do fake stairs so well.
That's not why i did it. It's not?<eos> You said --<eos> If we bring liz in, she will die.<eos> First cooper tipped them off about wing yee, And now you're protecting them. Cooper didn't tip them off.<eos> I did.
They're gonna hurt me if you don't.<eos> You like getting hurt, jilly.<eos> You wouldn't be here with them if you didn't.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
Well... I might be losing my mind, but thank you, and you are not leaving here without pouring yourself a thank you drink.<eos> Uh, I'm on duty.<eos> So as much as I would love to, I'm gonna pass.<eos> You don't want to break the rules a little?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, Chief, can we get a minute with you?<eos> What's up?<eos> Remember when we all went to see Aerosmith<eos> - back in 2001?<eos> - I do.
Tony, you remember Dr. Taft.<eos> Mm, the man, the myth, the legend.<eos> Nice work, Doc.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Gibbs did his part.
Morning, Gibbs.<eos> Bishop, sitrep.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Ducky found something that...<eos> No, I didn't.
They took David?<eos> Dr. David and Joni-- they took them?<eos> Who took them-- what bad men?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Sure you do.
Yes, you have.<eos> And you're welcome.<eos> Thank you, Tony.<eos> I owe you.<eos> No, you don't.
Yes, ma'am, Pride told me.<eos> Turns out the good doctor treated a patient while that patient was serving time in prison.<eos> Ed Tagget.<eos> Arrested 2006 for armed robbery in Georgia.<eos> Did time from 2007 to 2015.
She's getting herself all worked up about this brouhaha with the boss.<eos> She actually thinks he might be putting in his papers.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You don't think he's done, do you?<eos> You do?
- My tits hurt.<eos> - Get over here.<eos> They hate us here.<eos> We're scum!<eos> No, they don't.
I'm really sorry.<eos> Mike, I really wish I could say yes.<eos> You're an amazing man, but it wouldn't be fair.<eos> You deserve someone who is all in.<eos> We both do.
Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do. Oh. Another?
Thank you.<eos> I don't understand why she'd do something like that without telling me.<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> You don't?
school, career, friends.<eos> I'd see you, what, three times a week?<eos> But now, Noah, I got to be honest, um, it feels like it's only the washing-up part, like there is no in-between.<eos> - Okay, do you want me to leave?<eos> - No, I don't.
You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No?<eos> You don't?
Okay, well, that's only a few days a month.<eos> She can't have kids.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, I know.<eos> - Well, I want you to come home.<eos> I want to raise Joanie together.<eos> I want to get married.<eos> Do you?
We got a kid together.<eos> Let's stop making things so difficult for ourselves.<eos> Let's get married and settle down, be happy, be normal, raise a family.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
I don't need my damn lawyer.<eos> I just need y'all to let me up out of here.<eos> Well, the judge has ruled that you'll remain in custody pending the result of the new trial.<eos> You got nothing shows I killed those people.<eos> You never did.
Well, I was thinking we would just tell the truth.<eos> Or we stick as close to the truth as possible.<eos> All right, first they're gonna ask<eos> - if we had permits and security.<eos> - Which we did.
Worked for you, didn't it?<eos> Ben, let us help you.<eos> No, you can't help me, all right?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Is yours still FatIdiot@BadBreath.cunt?<eos> - I don't have bad breath.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
You never call me Jane.<eos> I had a word with Steve's best mate, Matt.<eos> Now he hadn't seen Steve, but Steve did call him.<eos> He was upset.<eos> Something to do with that girl, that one with no name.
Nice.<eos> It's a package deal.<eos> Champagne brunch, couple's massage in the room.<eos> Don't care, Baxter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You're Rebecca's neighbor, right?<eos> - I met you at her party. - Oh.<eos> You got really drunk, and then you slow-danced with that giant fish. Oh.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> No, it did...
I'll coach the way I coach.<eos> Just spitballing here, but we want just the opposite of that.<eos> You know, why are we even having this conversation?<eos> We don't have a sponsor?<eos> Oh, yeah, we do. Huh?
I know, I know.<eos> I saw this coming.<eos> He just wants to know that you appreciate him.<eos> - Well...<eos> - We do.
I... was trying to protect you and trying to protect NCIS, because... because John Quinn didn't kill Boyle.<eos> I did, and I did it to protect Tiffany.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you mean you know?<eos> No, you don't.
Serena Holmes.<eos> Serena Holmes is singing like a bird.<eos> She's telling us how you paid her to frame Wallace Boden, how you stowed her away at a fancy inn at Lake Carlyle, how you told her to stay hidden until you can get her out of the country.<eos> That sounds like the delusions of a woman with an axe to grind.<eos> No, sir, it doesn't.
You are successful.<eos> You're a great father.<eos> You have a beautiful, intelligent, tolerant wife.<eos> You don't need this stupid Ping-Pong game to prove yourself.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
No.<eos> I think he knew the killer pretty well.<eos> He must have dropped this in the struggle.<eos> Do you know who it belongs to?<eos> I do.
Whatever happened last night, didn't happen. Okay?<eos> So we're not dating?<eos> Dating?<eos> You said, let's date.<eos> I did?
- What?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> - Stamp!<eos> - You don't believe me?<eos> - Of course I do!
- Now, Frank...<eos> - "Now Frank, now Frank" nothing!<eos> I am gonna speak!<eos> You think you can put on slacks and talk to a grown man like that?<eos> Well, do ya?
You don't believe so?<eos> Didn't you check it?<eos> I did.<eos> So don't you know it not to be true?<eos> - I do.
The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
Murder?<eos> A-As in... murder?<eos> Pavel Ostrov<eos> - had an embolism.<eos> - He did.
I'm not stopping the witness from answering.<eos> [Kelly] You're trying to tell her what to say.<eos> [man] When you said, "You said this," and she didn't say that,<eos> -I'm gonna object...<eos> -[Kelly] Yes, she did.
You told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that's really lame, but I think that you should do it.<eos> This is a really good opportunity for you.<eos> You do?
Well, I wonder what that makes us, Mr. Pembridge.<eos> Since when?<eos> It started a couple of weeks before we left on tour.<eos> Look, it really has nothing to do with you.<eos> Yes, it does.
Oh, thank you, Andrew.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so pleased that you're putting a nice, fresh coat of paint on this old vessel.<eos> Oh, you know how it is.<eos> - I do.
You know, primates are fascinating.<eos> I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> And now you do, too.
Should I be preparing for another crime scene?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry to ambush you at work like this, but we need to talk.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
Hello, Nicholas.<eos> You got my letter.<eos> You found me, Donnie.<eos> You found me.<eos> I did, that.
And he worked out a plan to get me out.<eos> But Eddie got to Dan first.<eos> But I spoke to Dan.<eos> Yeah, Dave.<eos> But you did... Not me.
You know, do you really wanna start again?<eos> A new career at your age.<eos> You love being a copper.<eos> I used to.<eos> No, you do.
All they've been hearing, for what, 15 months, is, you know, Teresa Halbach was burned.<eos> Bones were found on Steven Avery's property.<eos> Which is a horrible fact.<eos> But what they don't know is that there's evidence those bones were moved.<eos> And so... And neither does the media.
And I said, "I think I found the vehicle."<eos> [Kratz] How long from when you entered that property did it take you to find Teresa's vehicle?<eos> I believed we entered at ten to ten... and by 10:20 to 10:25, we had found the vehicle.<eos> Ms. Sturm, do you know how many vehicles are on this property?<eos> I didn't at the time.
Correct.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you remember on that first search a note with Ms. Halbach's phone number being seized<eos> - from Mr. Avery's computer table?<eos> - Yes, I do.
The deviation that I requested was appropriate for this situation.<eos> - It was OK'd and it was reported.<eos> - But, ma'am... you did not disclose in that report, that official report, that courts and juries and judges and lawyers and everybody else relies on, you did not disclose that in order to make that call,<eos> you had to do something so rare, you've never done it before, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
[Buting] And they did that because they thought,<eos> "Well, if the victim had been killed here, perhaps her blood would've soaked into those cracks," right?<eos> I assume so.<eos> Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA on any of those swabs?<eos> No, I did not.
No, I don't recall.<eos> I'll show you exhibit 356, which is a Division of Criminal Investigation report.<eos> The second paragraph may be the most helpful, which you're welcome to read to yourself, any or all of that report.<eos> - Did that help refresh your recollection?<eos> - Yeah, it did.
You have to understand, they probably would have no fear of ever being caught doing this.<eos> You know? Who better than a police officer would know how to frame somebody?<eos> [bailiff] Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in the matter now before the court be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Mr. Dassey, didn't you tell your mother in a phone call on May 13th that you had gone over to your uncle Steven's after school<eos> -and before she came home?<eos> -Yes.<eos> And on May 15th, she's asking you why you didn't tell her.<eos> Why didn't you?
- Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
Hey! You can eat first for the other days.<eos> Hey! Quick! Don't want to do it?<eos> Where are Ping, Little Guizi and Lung?<eos> Bill, did you tell them?<eos> I did.
Did you stay up all night?<eos> You must be very tired.<eos> Do you need me to do anything?<eos> Do you know how to brew coffee?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's right.<eos> My brother used to run a curry restaurant here, but he had to go abroad abruptly.<eos> So I took over the lease and opened a shoe store.<eos> Do you have pictures of the curry restaurant?<eos> Of course I do.
You never know.<eos> So you're thinking that Kwon Jae Hee won't recognize you... if you're wearing the same clothes and similar hairstyle as Cho Rim?<eos> We'll be able to get him when he's confounded.<eos> Does Cho Rim know that you're wearing the same clothes?<eos> She doesn't.
Okay, so we'll hook up. What will you contribute?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm rescuing you here with a strategic plan and you're wondering what I'll contribute?<eos> Does anyone have a boyfriend?<eos> I do.
And you know the Take Me to Church song they played all the time?<eos> Yes.<eos> I kept thinking if that was the next song that came on, I should go for it.<eos> So did it come on?<eos> No, it didn't.
I'll...<eos> You do it every day.<eos> Teach me.<eos> Sure.<eos> You do a lot of laundry, Makocchan.
-That's trouble.<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> Oh, you're done.<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> Oh, you did.
That's true.<eos> Yes, two washing machines in the dark.<eos> He was saying something there. You know...<eos> Yes, about Yuriko.<eos> Yes, Tatsuya did.
I thought my feelings might change after that incident.<eos> -Toward Makocchan? -Yeah, yeah.<eos> But they didn't change.<eos> -I see.<eos> -They didn't.
Nothing. How do I put this?<eos> But, Makocchan, I thought you liked Minori, so I'm...<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Well, I did, but... I did...
-Yeah.<eos> For Minori<eos> - A "present" Let's go running again!<eos> - Makoto<eos> -You're doing it.
You'll need the chalk.<eos> But I... I hadn't completed that proof.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
Now, all that means is there are five ways to add up the number 4.<eos> 1+1+1+1, 3+1, 2+1+1, 2 + 2, and 4.<eos> Seems simple enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So it does.
Please tell me you didn't propose him.<eos> He's gonna crack partitions.<eos> He's worthy.<eos> You're the one who told me to let him run like a damn horse.<eos> Well, I did.
Let's take this one.<eos> What?<eos> 1729.<eos> I don't see what's so special about this one.<eos> Neither did I at first.
Didn't you just take one of those a minute ago?<eos> Gerda, I know what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just going to get some fresh air.<eos> You know, sometimes I do wonder why you let me go through all this, if you thought that everything would be the same afterwards.<eos> I didn't.
Fine with seeing Ryan with his new girlfriend?<eos> Also, Ryan has a new girlfriend.<eos> Ryan has a girlfriend?<eos> Ryan has a girlfriend.<eos> Of course he does.
Ifyouhave anyinformation, pleasecontact CrimeStoppers.<eos> Amos Jenkins, how you doing, pal?<eos> Hey. Part-time.<eos> How's it going, man?<eos> -How you doing?
Yes.<eos> I'm the piano tuner.<eos> Piano tuner?<eos> Didn't you call for a piano tuner?<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
It's true.<eos> Back then I was against it.<eos> And now?<eos> Does she still dance?<eos> Yes, she does.
You don't need me.<eos> It's the whole Manhattan thing, isn't it?<eos> Why would I care if you moved to Manhattan?<eos> - I don't know. Why would you?<eos> - I don't.
By the way, that is a lot of calls, just to bug someone to hire you.<eos> Which is why I also checked Gino's phone line too.<eos> See if anyone called Manning back.<eos> I'm thinking, if it's not about a job, maybe we find the person who's helping him hide out.<eos> - And did you?
Please.<eos> Sorry, never saw him before.<eos> - Are you sure? - Detective, I have said, I don't remember anything from that day.<eos> Do you understand whay "anything" means?<eos> I do.
That's illegal, Miss Meadows.<eos> The truth is not illegal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have to start over again.<eos> - I most certainly do.
-One sugar or two.<eos> Diplomacy, all those silken phrases.<eos> Why don't you just come out and say what you mean for once?<eos> Why don't you say what you mean when you see a friend wearing a dress you don't like?<eos> She does.
Think of all this double track railway line laid through Poland, coming our way.<eos> Theirs is a partial mobilisation, Not a general one.<eos> But a general one wouldn't be difficult to provoke, would it?<eos> I always expected to lose your magic powers when we deprive you of those.<eos> We do!
Well, I put oil in that car.<eos> Where?<eos> In--In the oil hole.<eos> Why aren't you working, Dad?<eos> Oh, I did... work.
Okay.<eos> How are things with your grandmother?<eos> Uh, she keeps nagging me.<eos> But I have two interviews next week.<eos> You do?
Why?<eos> Because I might want to have a baby one day.<eos> So you don't have a boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Spencer was just trying to protect you.<eos> No, she was trying to control the situation.<eos> Like she always does.<eos> Emily, look, she thought that you were making a mistake.<eos> I did.
I used to be a real tomboy.<eos> I would spend more time in the tree in our front yard than I would in my own bedroom.<eos> - What changed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
What look?<eos> The Spencer look.<eos> The look that you give everyone when you're really disappointed in them.<eos> I didn't know I had an official look for that.<eos> Oh, you do.
We're all tired, Spencer.<eos> Figure it out, so we can get on with our lives.<eos> No matter who gets hurt.<eos> You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.<eos> Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
I just want to get off.<eos> Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yeah.<eos> When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing, I... I couldn't stop thinking about it.<eos> I had to get to the bottom of the story.<eos> Did you know who I was when we met?<eos> Yes, I did.
I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.<eos> I did get cold and then I got the sweats.<eos> You know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.<eos> They said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.<eos> It did, mom.
You're up early.<eos> Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.<eos> Okay, I'll grab my jacket.<eos> No, Dean, you don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.
What about him?<eos> Is it true he was attracted to men?<eos> What?<eos> - No. Who says so?<eos> - John does.
We did it.<eos> ♪ I don't want to fall asleep ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause I miss you, babe ♪<eos> ♪ And I don't want to miss a thing ♪<eos> Oh, I don't.
Goodbye... and welcome to America!<eos> What just happened?<eos> They just really liked your music and didn't know how to express it.<eos> - You like movies? - I do.<eos> - You do?
- You like movies? - I do.<eos> - You do?<eos> - You like... you like Robert DeNiro?<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do?
I'm saying we can.<eos> - Come on, try with me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Didn't God tell us to try everything once?<eos> - No, he didn't.
- How did this happen?<eos> - It's a Christmas miracle.<eos> Where did you get the money from, Hannah?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Because it does.
Should I put your picture with theirs?<eos> They found these on the boat.<eos> You gave him a complete security breakdown and that's not important?<eos> Did I say it wasn't important?<eos> Did I? !
All right, I'm here for you, you know that, yeah?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look my heads just all over the place at the moment.<eos> I know how hard you're trying.<eos> I do.
He's coming over with a lawyer.<eos> No-no-no-no.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> - I have this under control.<eos> - What do you
Do you mind if I sit down? Wow. You're a lawyer.<eos> I thought lawyers were supposed to argue all the time.<eos> You were the quiet one-- you never said anything at all.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm worried about you.<eos> Why don't you answer my texts?<eos> Are you still hanging around with him?<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
Are you still hanging around with him?<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it does.<eos> I know I acted like it didn't before,<eos> - but it does.
Tara, it's okay.<eos> We're doing the best we can.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> We'll find something.<eos> What if we don't?
It's just a nickname.<eos> Yeah, I have one for you, too...<eos> Tessa... dactyl.<eos> I texted you after school to see if you wanted to get a yogurt, and you said you had plans?<eos> And I do, with Junebug.
They took our guns.<eos> The knives.<eos> They took my dog.<eos> - Maybe your dog just ran away.<eos> - He didn't, okay?
"Come to me and take me with you."<eos> "Here he comes!"<eos> "He gets connected well to me."<eos> "Here he comes to show his charm."<eos> "He does wonders."
Sir! He is a donkey! A donkey!<eos> Donkey!<eos> A small request! - Oh! You should somehow break the match with IG's daughter.<eos> The pitch has to be higher!<eos> Brother! Please do me this favor.
We haven't heard from him in a long time.<eos> How is he?<eos> Does he say anything about Valentina?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> He doesn't.
Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you...<eos> I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
Maybe I used to have a reason to be on your side, but like you said this morning, it's over.<eos> Vega.<eos> The Trags have honored me by making me their leader.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I do.
Hey, where are you going?<eos> It's ok.<eos> We've got nothing but time.<eos> Hey, how do we know this is the right way?<eos> We don't.
I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
Prove it.<eos> When's your birthday?<eos> February 23rd.<eos> Ha! February has no 23rd. You...<eos> Yes, it does.
He wakes up early to get papers and muffins.<eos> He watches foreign films with me and does all the voices.<eos> He explains the universe so that black holes sound cool, not scary.<eos> - You don't want to see me.<eos> - No, she does.

I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did.<eos> I always did.

She has 30 days to change her mind, right?<eos> She still has two days left.<eos> Well, it's not just about the date.<eos> Does she have a job, a place to live, money in the bank to support the child?<eos> And what if she did?
The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.<eos> Break all the rules.<eos> They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.
Isn't a prime...<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
- That sort of thing.<eos> It's about adaptability, Nathan.<eos> Sometimes we have to change our shape so that we fit in.<eos> That was you pushing the cage.<eos> - I did not!
I don't know.<eos> You said that my baby had red hair.<eos> Yes.<eos> I, uh... I didn't see her for very long, but...<eos> Yes, she did.
Shouldn't you be upstairs?<eos> I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.

If I don't end Sam and that halo burns him out and I...<eos> God, I was so damn stupid.<eos> You were stupid for the right reasons.<eos> Yeah, like that matters.<eos> It does.
Damn it, cass!<eos> Your body is regressing to the state it was in before gadreel.<eos> Do we have enough grace for the summoning spell?<eos> Sam.<eos> Do we or not, cass?
Why are hunters here?<eos> Maybe because of this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you think...<eos> I do.
Fair enough.<eos> I was messed up, man.<eos> Kevin was dead, and I... I don't know what I was.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hell, maybe I still don't.
Susan!<eos> Susan, hang on.<eos> I had to make myself ready to die fo them? I know.<eos> I know.<eos> No, you don't.
I know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't know.<eos> That's the problem, you don't know.<eos> None of you do.
It felt like the only thing to do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really am.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does, though.
You all right to hang around for a couple of secs, Les?<eos> Jo's got an idea she wants to go over with you.<eos> All right, sir.<eos> What idea?<eos> From now on, Les does the press conferences.
According to Denton's statement, when you worked together, your relationship went beyond the purely professional.<eos> First half-baked theories, now innuendo.<eos> You must want to face a suit for wrongful arrest.<eos> You deny an affair with Lindsay Denton?<eos> I do.
Maybe I put it in another place?<eos> Maybe, in the bathroom?<eos> I'll call Noah to bring me.<eos> Noah?<eos> What does Noah?
Assuming it's Anna you're here for. Yes.<eos> I should have guessed with all the trips to the city.<eos> She's been talking to you about Gino.<eos> You know about him?<eos> I do now.
Hazel's trapped in the city.<eos> She's got nowhere to go.<eos> James Earl should be here instead of your charlatan ass.<eos> He is a gifted mind reader and a dear friend.<eos> Actually, Lassie, she does.
I just thank God for it.<eos> Every day, Daniel.<eos> Every day.<eos> 'cause it gave me something to live for. You feel me?<eos> I do.
- I was just telling my son that someone reported we had restricted technology.<eos> We don't have restricted tech, so you can just stop!<eos> They can threaten us all they want.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> Actually, we do.
TAJ: it's a hard fucking sell, Dom.<eos> Does anyone even know what Portuguese chicken is?<eos> - It's a Peri-Peri.<eos> -I know that.<eos> - Does anyone else?
- See that guy over there?<eos> -Oh, my.<eos> I've got a soft spot for, you know, the old men who masturbate in the ass-less chaps.<eos> And I bet you've got a pair of ass-less chaps in the back of your wardrobe somewhere.<eos> Maybe I do and maybe...
-Oh, my.<eos> I've got a soft spot for, you know, the old men who masturbate in the ass-less chaps.<eos> And I bet you've got a pair of ass-less chaps in the back of your wardrobe somewhere.<eos> Maybe I do and maybe...<eos> I do.
And he was kinda shit at keeping his books.<eos> You know?<eos> And when he got sick, I mean, I was 17.<eos> So I didn't know anything about running a restaurant.<eos> Well, you do now.
- Okay.<eos> - But not today.<eos> Oh. I feel like maybe I opened up enough today.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> But I do.
This thing with paying CJ and not telling you...<eos> It was wrong on every level and I can-- Totally, I admit it now.<eos> Can you please come out here and talk to me?<eos> You don't want to hear what I've got to say.<eos> No, I do.
I'll break numbers.<eos> I always do.<eos> You answer to me. I'm SVP of sales, so you're dog shit around here until you close a deal.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - I do.

Bosworth here.<eos> John, it's Dale Butler, Senior Vice President of Sales, North America.<eos> What can I do you for, Dale?<eos> You got one of my boys down there.<eos> Why, yes, we do.
A police officer has the right to stop you if, and that's the important word here, if he has reasonable grounds to believe a crime is going to be committed.<eos> Now, you're absolutely sure about this?<eos> Police harassment, dear.<eos> I could set it to music.<eos> And if he does?
Oh.<eos> Hi.<eos> I want to learn to dance.<eos> We need to make something happen.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.

Look -- we have over 86,000 square feet to search.<eos> You really want do that -- room to room, holding my hand?<eos> The holding hands part is optional.<eos> - We don't have time to argue about it. - You're right.<eos> We don't.
No.<eos> But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
This is D.L. Tangent is safe and sound.<eos> - We are go for takeoff. - Roger that.<eos> I need it.<eos> You don't need it.<eos> I do!
If my girlfriend finds out, she'll totally dump me.<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I did not. Oh.
So, first things first.<eos> I got my results back yesterday.<eos> They're negative.<eos> I assume you got good news, too.<eos> Yeah, I did.
It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
I don't acknowledge it, then it'll just go away.<eos> So if I never tell my dad that I lost my job, and I'm moving to Malibu, that will go away?<eos> See?<eos> Running and hiding has its appeal.<eos> Mmm, yeah, it does.
- Let me do it.<eos> - You can't see well.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Done.
I went to Europe because of you.<eos> In my line of work, there's a lot of worry about Detective Andrews,<eos> NYPD trafficking specialist.<eos> "Specialist" suggests an asshole like you is hard to find, or handle.<eos> I do okay.
Pulled your strings pretty easy today.<eos> That's because you're out of options.<eos> - I'm out of options? - Yeah.<eos> You really think you're going to walk off this roof?<eos> - I do. - You do.
- You do? - Yes.<eos> The hardest moment in every cop's life, it's when they realize how scary it is to be the police.<eos> Scary?<eos> You think it's about fear?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's not a motto.<eos> But it does need to be said.<eos> Let's talk about your appearance.<eos> Now, we've got a weight issue In this general area here.<eos> We do. Yeah, we do!
And we'll take care of each other.<eos> We're all we've got.<eos> We're brothers.<eos> I wish we had a motto to shout.<eos> We do.

Her and... that...<eos> Who?<eos> Margaret?<eos> Didn't we think much of her?<eos> No, we didn't.
Margaret said that my son... ..raped that child.<eos> Yeah, and you didn't believe her?<eos> Of course I didn't believe her.<eos> Do you want to know the truth about Margaret?<eos> Yes, I do.
Being lied to feels great.<eos> I screwed up, okay?<eos> But it was during a turn.<eos> I didn't want it to happen!<eos> - On some level, you did.
No, you can fix this!<eos> This is your chance!<eos> You can change things!<eos> - You really think that?<eos> - Yes! I really do.
- Sally, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop apologizing.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You don't know what this curse is yet.<eos> You don't.
Oh, I heard that you can compel vampires.<eos> That even gave me a little tingle.<eos> Looks like the juniper's working.<eos> - You want to let me go.<eos> - No, I really don't.
I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.
Let's get you home, all right?<eos> Guess you've gotten quite an education tonight, huh, choir boy?<eos> I guess so.<eos> You probably don't even go to church, do you?<eos> In this burg, we all do.
I thought I could ignore it, bury it.<eos> But I get these dreams.<eos> Dreams.<eos> Do you want to be normal, Randolph?<eos> Yes, yes I do.
Bring the French and Gascon troops there to rejoin the rest of my army.<eos> Florence is safe, for now.<eos> I have Louis' blessing to take Bologna.<eos> - The French know nothing of politics.<eos> - Does Florence?
Before I existed!<eos> That's right.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But you did?
How did that photo end up online?<eos> No clue.<eos> It was originally posted to a Thinman fan forum, but the I.P. address was blocked.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. This thing has fans?<eos> Of course it does.

I hope you were nice to your father.<eos> What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, we got the Blade.<eos> You do?
No one bends the rules like you two bend the rules.<eos> He's one misfit kid.<eos> He impacts no one.<eos> You don't bend that rule, okay?<eos> You don't.
Since when do you play their game?<eos> And since when do you let your dad sell you to some dick from New York?<eos> You think I had a choice?<eos> !<eos> You did!
Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
I don't know.<eos> Stop saying you don't know.<eos> You can't think I would allow something like this.<eos> Cass, I know you try to be a good guy, okay?<eos> I do.
Are you asking or telling?<eos> We're not asking.<eos> You sure you don't want to go back, Cass?<eos> Look, if Dean is right about Tessa...<eos> No, I, uh... I do.
But I was too weak...<eos> Till Castiel gave me a reason to die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, that just doesn't sound like the Cass I know.<eos> But doesn't it, though?
Like yours?<eos> Do we have the same now?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you like them?<eos> - Of course I do.

Wrong.<eos> This one is better.<eos> Now... pick a bracelet.<eos> I like this silver.<eos> Unless I-I don't.
Guess.<eos> No, forget it.<eos> I'll just tell you.<eos> I got into Brown.<eos> You did? !

We had a bit of a set-to.<eos> She seemed to think none of us really understood her.<eos> And now nobody knows where she's gone.<eos> Do you fear that she might have left Nonnatus House altogether?<eos> I did.
- Money.<eos> I mean, they buy them out or they raise the rent.<eos> How much do you think I'd get for a place like this?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
A guy?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's OK. I don't care.<eos> I think it's hot.<eos> You... You do?

And I just sort of realised that a person's not like a fixed thing.<eos> A person's just the stuff other people know about them.<eos> And you only knew the good stuff.<eos> But you know everything about me.<eos> I do...
Pulling a fire alarm on Mischief Night is one thing. Doing it when there's a mass murderer spotted nearby is insane!<eos> If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.<eos> What?<eos> Coach, that doesn't make sense.<eos> Oh, well, it does to me!
- You go, then.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> - That's even more pointless.<eos> - Do you guys even want to go home?<eos> - Sam, we all do.
Look, if you don't want me to hang out with him, I won't.<eos> I know that you really like him.<eos> A momentary lapse in judgment I can only attribute to a hormonal shift and/or... sheer boredom.<eos> But if you wanted to get with Drake, then...<eos> I don't.
- You know, it's funny.<eos> I seem to remember you being in my pod without permission.<eos> Was that part of some Red Hawk plan to bug the place?<eos> I think we both know what this is really about.<eos> We do.
He'll have them cut down before they can get anywhere near him.<eos> Thieves!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your God brings it?<eos> No, He does not.
Thieves!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your God brings it?<eos> No, He does not.<eos> Rome does.
They wanted to send us on a wild goose chase.<eos> Why sacrifice such hugely valuable intel to do it?<eos> Sarah: I agree.<eos> They had the resources to sabotage Lakenheath, to devastate us.<eos> No, they didn't.
Work.<eos> This would cost you nothing. But for me...<eos> You can't court your boss and expect people to respect you.<eos> So, we have to choose.<eos> Well, at least I do.
It's just a car you wanted to do, isn't it?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Christ, be careful with it!<eos> Where did you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
Then a prison camp.<eos> Then I was moved around a lot.<eos> Joe, I've spent the last year being pushed down corridors with a gun at my head.<eos> But at the end, they said I would have you.<eos> And now I do.
Well, he wanted me dead. He even tried once.<eos> But I did not kill him, Lucrezia.<eos> And I am wounded that you would even ask.<eos> You do believe me, do you not?<eos> I do.
That someone else committed the crime.<eos> The man whom tomorrow I will marry.<eos> Lucrezia, I swear, I am the guilty one.<eos> Swear upon the love you and I share.<eos> I do.
Excuse me.<eos> Just what the hell do you think you're doing here, Secret Service?<eos> This is where the FBI works.<eos> Agent Finley, I thought I made it clear you are not working this.<eos> Yes, Agent Dunn, you did.
But you were tougher.<eos> Yes, ma'am, in that moment, I was.<eos> Tough and useful, and yet 26 kids go missing on your watch.<eos> You still think I'm in on it.<eos> No, I don't.
- It's true!<eos> You guys are both hilarious and a pleasure to park near.<eos> Seriously? (Annika moaning) Ah!<eos> You're so hot. Mmm, so are you. You want to get dirty?<eos> Yes, I do.
I do.<eos> So, just give Esme a hug for me, will you?<eos> And tell her, um...<eos> Well, you know what to say.<eos> I do.
You have somewhere else to turn for love and support.<eos> If we love each other, we can deal with the truth.<eos> I slept with someone in San Francisco. Oh.<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> You don't.
I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.
What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
He is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, I do hope you are as crazy about him as he is about you.<eos> My son deserves a wife who thinks he is the sun, the moon, and the stars.<eos> Yes, he does.
You're so much like your mother.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm nothing like her.<eos> Why do you give your father so much power over you?<eos> I don't.
Couldn't have taken one night off?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> Of course... you know that.<eos> I can't take a night off.<eos> My parents don't.
Well, it's what you want, isn't it?<eos> I'm open.<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
Kill yourself.<eos> If you can't stop, you must kill yourself.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> If you can't stop, you have to kill yourself.<eos> Do it. Just do it.
What do I have to do, change his diapers?<eos> You got to be kidding!<eos> I don't care!<eos> She said you had to keep me, huh?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm out of my depth.<eos> Hey.<eos> I very much doubt you're out of your depth, but even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move over.<eos> Come on, I don't have enough space.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I simply don't see the possibility of your success.<eos> We shall see, sir.<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Oh, I'm not his type at all.<eos> Oh. Not like that.<eos> He likes the dusky ladies.<eos> Right.<eos> They, on the other hand, do like men, dusky or otherwise.
Well, that's good.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I can call you if there's news.<eos> That's if you want to know.<eos> I do.
We understood you, would be able to handle the volume.<eos> And we can.<eos> Then why didn't you?<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> But it did.
Maybe you should go.<eos> I can't.<eos> She's your mother.<eos> I mean, what if this guy saw her?<eos> No, he didn't.
For the moment...<eos> I'm gonna let her go with you, all right?<eos> But you're responsible for her.<eos> If anything happens to her, you answer to me, do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.<eos> Let the public fatigue on it.<eos> And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?<eos> - It'll lose steam.<eos> - What if it doesn't?
And sometimes they interrupt our class, But they're here to reopen the mine,<eos> And I think that's a good thing, Because it means It will bring prosperity back to coal valley.<eos> I don't like them.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I just don't.
What... how'd you know I was here?<eos> Peter Gregory is invested in a company that uses GPS in phones to track people.<eos> That's creepy.<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> And neither does congress.
I love Zoe.<eos> You think you can just throw me away for some junior varsity mall rat?<eos> I made you, Kyle, not her.<eos> You owe me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
It's impossible!<eos> I'm immortal.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Tough shit. Who does?
Let go of me!<eos> I love you!<eos> Oh, Jesus...<eos> I know you love me!<eos> I don't!
I'm not staying here.<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> - N.Y.P.D.!<eos> - I got her!<eos> - Oh, no, you don't!
Now I'll tell you what we're gonna do.<eos> We're closed.<eos> Mr. Kell sent me.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Now you do.
Look, was he black?<eos> Was he white? It was too dark.<eos> If I don't go now, I'm never gonna get clean.<eos> - She knows more than she's saying.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
So, why were you coming to see me?<eos> Um...<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.
Um...<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
And I want you to know that...<eos> I-I don't regret everything.<eos> I did love you.<eos> We had some good times, right?<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, we did.
And she's humble.<eos> So, you, you tell anybody else yet?<eos> I'm gonna tell the partners on Monday, and I was gonna give two weeks.<eos> Does that sound right?<eos> - Does to me.
I never realized you were such a good actor.<eos> All that yelling... You scared the crap out of me.<eos> [Chuckles] Listen, um, thanks for helping me with this.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You like when people need you.<eos> Dom doesn't need you.<eos> He just loves you.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
Apparently, he knows where the money is.<eos> And he's the only one who answered the door when the FBI came knocking.<eos> Well, him and me, of course.<eos> But you don't know where he is any more than the FBI does.<eos> Do you?
I just... [Chuckles] Yeah, I thought you were mad.<eos> Look, Harry, I know...<eos> Deep down, you still hate me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
- And a... and a harpist at the ready, but I figure, why not break out the Crosley a little early?<eos> That way it's playing when you walk down the aisle.<eos> You don't have to say yes, but, um...<eos> You want to marry me today?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I was in the military, first Gulf War.<eos> Re-upped after 9/11.<eos> I did a tour in Afghanistan.<eos> - You saw combat.<eos> - I did.
And every murder is the tale of a city.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Somebody. Think it's true?<eos> Yeah. I do.
All of it.<eos> No.<eos> I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
No, he wants another week in the press.<eos> He knows public sympathy is building.<eos> Don't let him do it, Jim.<eos> He has no grounds.<eos> I do.
I mean, is it so wrong for me to just want that?<eos> And that's what you have with David, sorry, Harry?<eos> Will you please help me?<eos> Sonia Dana, despite all that's happened, do you continue to love your husband?<eos> Yes, I do.
- You knew that?<eos> You put me in an awkward position, Jack.<eos> I had to go because I knew you wouldn't.<eos> If you had gone like you wanted, I wouldn't have had to.<eos> Why didn't you?
My name... is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.
You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - No, I don't.
Your witness.<eos> Dr. Chilton,<eos> Will Graham spent his time catching murderers for the FBI.<eos> You don't see a contradiction between that and your description of a coldblooded killer?<eos> No, I do not.
- She has a heartbeat. - What?<eos> - She's in rigor mortis...<eos> - She doesn't have a pulse.<eos> She has a heartbeat.<eos> She doesn't...
Tell me what you believe is happening.<eos> What do I believe?<eos> What do you believe?<eos> Do you believe Will killed Freddie Lounds?<eos> No, I don't.
Like the good book says, it's all about burn time and cloud cover.<eos> But I know your mom will be watching.<eos> I've never seen anyone love someone the way she loves you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I did.
- Beauregard.<eos> He was pretty chatty.<eos> So you had a good day?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I did.
But I didn't walk out last time either.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> You, um...<eos> you want some wine?<eos> I do, but still on duty.
Stop!<eos> You're a Grimm?<eos> It's okay, Zuri.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah, he does.
She do something to you?<eos> "No," as in my personal life has nothing to do with this investigation.<eos> Your life includes your sister and your niece.<eos> So maybe it does.<eos> It doesn't.
We did what we thought was necessary.<eos> And we didn't report it because?<eos> I haven't gotten that far.<eos> - You think we crossed the line?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Purgatory.<eos> Step on it, Crane!<eos> Reverse! You don't know how to reverse.<eos> - No!<eos> I do...
Drink this.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Lieutenant, no!<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> You both do now.
- [Crying] You don't love me.<eos> - No, listen, I really do.<eos> - That's it.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> - No, I really do.
- Good.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good. Real good.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good, good. Doing well.
A suspected gang informant got merc'd two weeks ago at that same spot.<eos> Who killed Agent Clark?<eos> I don't know for sure, but that's the Gaki Boyz style.<eos> Why would the Gaki Boyz want Agent Clark dead?<eos> They don't.
Oh, dude, nice.<eos> We know chicks.<eos> Yeah, well, we do know chicks.<eos> But I don't think we need to hire anyone...<eos> - No, we do.
Where'd you learn that...<eos> From your wife that has you on that diet?<eos> Damn!<eos> I don't want to be on his wife's diet. Do you?<eos> - No, I don't.
Freedom, Agent Burke.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Look, this could be a setup.<eos> We don't know what's in there.<eos> - I do, evidence.
Peter, I'm in.<eos> A bad guy wants to hire a bad girl to do some really bad stuff.<eos> I'm the best person in the division to keep that from happening.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
I hope you enjoy the softer of the two sexes.<eos> Hi. I'm officer Garcia...and I do.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I thought something happened.<eos> Something did.
Actually, we don't.<eos> I think you're running away from your problems.<eos> Please don't make this any harder for me than it already is.<eos> I really need to do this.<eos> No you don't!
We might.<eos> That guy who came after you at your mother's house... he could be one of them.<eos> He's the right age.<eos> Do you have a picture of him?<eos> Up here, I do.
I thought this island was a secret known only to a few.<eos> And so it is.<eos> I have to go, but you'll see him... Today?<eos> I have your word?<eos> You do.
They know you've been helping me, so they're watching you, too-- our cell phones, our online activity.<eos> Ryan, I work at the NYPD Intel Division,<eos> I trained with the best CIA techs at the academy.<eos> Do you honestly think that they can trace anything I do online?<eos> Yeah, I do.
In other words, you can't prove it.<eos> I've seen Ryan's shrine to all things Joe Carroll.<eos> Are you of the opinion that Carroll's alive, as well?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness.<eos> I think you owe me a beer.<eos> Damon, stop!<eos> You said you had a plan, Bonnie.<eos> I did.
Well, you still want to go to Paris?<eos> For free?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I think I should go.<eos> Oh, uh, uh, before you do, just curious.
- All right, come on.<eos> Come on, let's walk quicker. We need to get out of here.<eos> What's our GPS doing?<eos> You got a signal?<eos> - Does, yeah.
Go on, I'll catch up.<eos> Beth Ann, do you trust me?<eos> I know you don't trust anybody, but... do you want to trust me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I d... I do.
What about my school?<eos> My friends?<eos> I remember when I was your age, and I know that it's tough now...<eos> I don't need a new beginning!<eos> Honey, we both do.
Everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Teenagers.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
You may not know this, but that one ... when he falls, he falls hard.<eos> So you can't mess with his heart, okay?<eos> Uh, I don't think our badges are gonna do too well here.<eos> I can talk my way in anywhere.<eos> Well, then, you do the talking, James Bond.
- I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
Meanwhile, George was processing his own loss.<eos> - So, that's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> But I thought you liked Nora.<eos> I do, just not in that way.
Would have killed her again.<eos> Oh, where are my manners?<eos> Would either of you homicidal maniacs like a sweet tea? ♪ Oooh, oooh ♪ Sweet tea?<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I think I lost my balance.<eos> - Lulu, you need to knock.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> This sheet says Dan has to be tested every two hours to make sure his head is working.<eos> It does?
You're getting me the hell outta here.<eos> You just didn't have the right nurse.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You need someone with experience in your type of injuries.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know that I have security clearance on a federal level, right?<eos> And I also have Lulu.<eos> Um... I don't celebrate my birthdays.<eos> But you secretly want to.<eos> No, I don't.
- Okay.<eos> I'm gonna get a drink.<eos> I'll be there in a second.<eos> Hey, D., want a beer?<eos> Papi, yes, I do. You good?
I don't even know what that means.<eos> Or silence is a way to control the people who love you.<eos> And you think your wife is trying to control you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends?<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - I don't.
- Sit, damn it.<eos> What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?<eos> I was with my girlfriend.<eos> Wanna hear the details?<eos> Yes, I do.
Cassandra Chadwick, seated at this moment to my left.<eos> Very pleased to meet you, Miss Worthington, though I do wish it were under more pleasant circumstances.<eos> Well, I apologize for not sharing in your delight, but I've never understood my brother's fascination with dollymops.<eos> You have some nerve.<eos> But yes I do!
Stupid... ..and too tall.<eos> Fred. You'll find the keys to the safe in the top left-hand drawer of the chest.<eos> You'll find a package in there, marked "Property of Miss Antonia Keville".<eos> I know that name.<eos> Of course you do.
She's moving in, huh?<eos> Yeah. How'd you know?<eos> I, uh, bumped into her.<eos> You really love her?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway,<eos> - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
What they're doing here, Norma... it's just standard procedure.<eos> Okay, well, when can we go home?<eos> When they've got all the facts down.<eos> You're a lawyer. Do you know how all this works?<eos> I do.
I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?<eos> - And you still don't?
Did... did I do something wrong?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - Well, then what is it?<eos> - Why don't you believe me?<eos> - I do.
- How long?<eos> Probably a couple of days.<eos> We don't have a couple of days, buddy.<eos> How do you even know if the cops even know anything?<eos> Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.
So more than $100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
We got a bowling alley in the basement.<eos> All this for doing Detroit's dirty laundry.<eos> You know what?<eos> When this ugliness blows over, you ought to come on over and do my laundry, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> We done with him?
I always have and I always will.<eos> Don't lose faith in me now.<eos> So what did you tell her?<eos> That I have the situation under control.<eos> But you don't.
So why don't you take your fat asses out of here?<eos> What, she supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Oh, you don't know her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Nah.<eos> You know, if you shoot someone, you got to have a reason.<eos> Then you got to go fill out a whole lot of paperwork.<eos> Not for you, huh?<eos> No, we don't do that shit.
You lied to him, didn't you?<eos> Moved the money and didn't tell him.<eos> I'm not a total moron.<eos> Even though you knew it might get him killed.<eos> It didn't.
This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay? This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Is this the last one, Leash?<eos> I cannot walk another step with my Louboutin heels.<eos> Yeah, Louboutin.<eos> Right. And who wears fake heels at breakfast time?<eos> - Dee do.
He'd be surrounded by people he loved.<eos> That's how unbelievably stupid I am.<eos> That's how it was supposed to be.<eos> I wish I could just... Change.<eos> You did.
Not much.<eos> She was a nurse at the Fleur-de-Lis Sanatorium.<eos> Recognize her?<eos> Top row, second from the right.<eos> No. I don't.
Lukas is dangerous to all that.<eos> You don't have a lot of options.<eos> With everything in my fucking heart, all I know is I've got to protect this.<eos> You know how that feels?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.<eos> We don't know if anybody got out.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
She's just that kind of person.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
I'm just saying everything because I owe you.<eos> We all owe you.<eos> We can make this better now.<eos> Things changing in here doesn't change things out there.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Alex will take you, ask you a few questions. Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.<eos> If you could just lay them down in front of you.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'm sure you understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I mean, sure there was some downsides, like I was never allowed to have Cocoa Puffs in the house.<eos> But that was more than made up for by her teaching me how to shave, and how to drive, and how to hit a curveball.<eos> I mean, we were always together.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have your mom take you to a Bulls game?<eos> No, you don't.
Listen.<eos> I know you've been away, Father.<eos> But I think it is important that this is an inclusive, progressive church.<eos> - You think that that's important?<eos> - I really do.
I am not interested in being a prize, albeit a shockingly-undervalued one, in your little sex game.<eos> Fine.<eos> I lost my manipulative, gorgeous, psychopath ex and my sweet, kind, unfocused fiancé.<eos> I don't have a home anymore.<eos> Yeah, Chapman, you do.
Nichols!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Why you pickin' all the peaches?<eos> - I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
This is where you pee from. Ah!<eos> Now, ladies, I want each and every one of you to go back to your bunks tonight and get to know your own chachas, okay?<eos> No fucking way.<eos> I got a mons pubis.<eos> Yes, you do.
I believe I can use all the help I can get.<eos> You're getting new girls in the kitchen?<eos> - You're not allowed back here.<eos> - Did you put in a request?<eos> What if I did?
Bell, I want you all over that inmate like a fly on shit.<eos> You follow her.<eos> You find out how she's running.<eos> How about we just ask her?<eos> I already did.
Trust me.<eos> This is really over, isn't it?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want it to be.<eos> Yes, you do.
No lecture.<eos> Suppose you think I was wrong about Sebastian too, then?<eos> I think... that you have everyone fooled... because you want people to think that none of this gets to you.<eos> And that you don't need anyone's help.<eos> - I don't.
But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
So, please, just do as you're told.<eos> - John...<eos> - Now, Nurse Elkins.<eos> You see what it's doing to him?<eos> I do.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.<eos> Bertie the Wise. You saw Zinberg?<eos> I did.<eos> - You have information for me?<eos> - I do.
Do you remember anything?<eos> I've never seen anyone go into a hole like that.<eos> I mean, you were, like, not there.<eos> You take something?<eos> No, I... no, I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Thank you for taking my call.<eos> Well, I've actually been waiting for you to call.<eos> I've been thinking about what we talked about at the valet stand, and I have some ideas.<eos> You do?
It should.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're old enough that I don't have to lecture you about birth control and STDs<eos> - and...<eos> - Oh, my God, no, you don't.
Here, sit.<eos> Brandy?<eos> You don't drink, huh?<eos> No?<eos> I do.
You need some?<eos> No.<eos> No. We don't need some.<eos> Alana has plenty of natural pluck and sparkle.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Does she, though?
I think I need to be alone.<eos> Old sweatpants.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> - Who says that?<eos> - Well, clearly Amy does, huh?
I assure you, ma'am, the Indians do have souls, if any of us do.<eos> "If"?<eos> And what about witches?<eos> Do they have souls, too?<eos> They do.
- Roger, Jesus.<eos> You've said it many times, Ron.<eos> Davina's wasting her life.<eos> - She could've had anyone, Al is a drip.<eos> - I didn't.
I don't need to think about it.<eos> It's our child, Cornelia.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
I got nothing, either.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Tom, you got a cell?<eos> - Yeah. Have a signal?<eos> No, I don't.
No. Get out!<eos> What's in there?<eos> Nothing. You need to leave.<eos> You have no right to be in here.<eos> Yeah, we do.
This is why I have to bug all of the offices.<eos> Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus, I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
You're very observant, Mr. Jane.<eos> And perhaps you're right.<eos> I do protest too much.<eos> But I have grown weary and defensive on the subject, as I'm sure you might understand.<eos> I do, I do.
Oh, I don't like that bed.<eos> Too many lumps.<eos> Maybe you should get a new bed. Mm.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I always did like this couch.
It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
We're doing everything we can to find Amy.<eos> But you haven't found her, have you?<eos> Daniela, why'd you come back here?<eos> You told us you didn't know if Amy was even at this house.<eos> I didn't...
But you haven't found her, have you?<eos> Daniela, why'd you come back here?<eos> You told us you didn't know if Amy was even at this house.<eos> I didn't...<eos> But I do now.
Thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.<eos> There are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.<eos> But I take your point.<eos> Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.
Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.<eos> I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.
I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.<eos> And you.<eos> And you do.
Oh, my God. You noticed my glitter lotion?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
And they left four days ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some model scout set it up.<eos> Did you meet this guy -- the model scout?<eos> No, I didn't.
I mean, she was 15. I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did? Mm-hmm. She said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Yeah, apparently, it's good.<eos> No burgers.<eos> I wish my wife were here.<eos> Women really love this kind of stuff.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Of course not.<eos> I'm aware of your visit to the ER.<eos> You've been interviewed by a caseworker in the past.<eos> We've had some problems.<eos> Every marriage does.
Please tell me you can fix--<eos> You broke an immunity agreement, which means you're going to jail unless you start talking about the Alchemist.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - Got a cigarette?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- So?<eos> - So, people need to get up in the morning.<eos> - Where can I get it?<eos> - You don't want it.<eos> I do.
Harold Cooper.<eos> You think this is a coincidence?<eos> Reddington feeds you The Judge, and I'm next on that lunatic's hit list?<eos> - We need to take it seriously.<eos> - No, we don't.
Someone with high-level access is en route.<eos> Of course.<eos> A woman.<eos> If you came to advocate on behalf of Agent Cooper --<eos> I didn't.
Run, you idiot!<eos> This way!<eos> Hayley, what did you do?<eos> We have nowhere to go!<eos> Yes, we do.
Don't wanna waste time.<eos> Think of something cool, give me credit.<eos> But the door I'm knocking on is your home... - ...if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.<eos> - If you're the floor, you're already dead.<eos> Just do it right.
Tate is suspected to be in the company of this little girl.<eos> Bo Adams.<eos> A murderer with a kid.<eos> - I hate this kind of stuff.<eos> - We all do.
And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't.
Oh, that's a bit of a risk.<eos> I needed the money.<eos> Tommy Stonnall.<eos> You told me you didn't know him.<eos> I don't, not really.
Most of my employees have some sort of military training.<eos> - And who... who's that?<eos> - Bobby Hammond.<eos> - He work here too?<eos> - He did.
These dark lines are the shadows cast by hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of the Sun.<eos> Sodium atoms cast different shadows.<eos> Their electrons dance to a different tune.<eos> A grain of table salt is composed of sodium and chlorine atoms.<eos> Ten million billion of them doing their crazy dances in a single grain of salt.
No.<eos> Catch him.<eos> Make him tell me where Octavia is, then kill him.<eos> How do we know he's not leading us to another trap?<eos> We don't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - I've just been thinking.<eos> You know, for the first time we're making some good money, and the guys in Chisel are all buying houses...<eos> If you make it in America, you'll be able to afford a house or two.<eos> What if we don't, though?
I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Including a child?<eos> What do you know about that?<eos> I saw the way you grabbed Roland back there.<eos> Clearly, you have the touch of a mother.<eos> I do.
Hey. How was your day?<eos> Good.<eos> Storybrooke is a weird place, but cool.<eos> Did you know there's a library inside a clock tower?<eos> I do.
- Not the way I sing it.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> It is.<eos> - Dear.<eos> - I do a great Bonnie Raitt karaoke.
You know what it is?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know what will happen to you if you break it?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
For example, do you know, uh, how it feels when you're still carrying that extra baby weight?<eos> I've had two myself and, darn it, if it isn't hard to fit back into your favorite...<eos> I didn't have a baby.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Um... I did, and...
It was the truth.<eos> I assumed you were listening.<eos> Bill.<eos> We could have an affair.<eos> Millions of people do.
I did get dressed.<eos> Then you got undressed.<eos> I got a little hot.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
And I told you, they're coming after you whether you like it or not.<eos> And the difference between me and them is they want to tear your company apart, and I want to keep it together.<eos> You don't have the resources to do that.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I guess that means you've decided which relationship you want us to have.<eos> I have.<eos> But it's not what you might think.<eos> If you still want the job, it starts tomorrow.<eos> I do.
Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
I know that you've been replaced at B613 as command.<eos> I work for the Smithsonian.<eos> My title is chief curator.<eos> I'm just saying I know what happened.<eos> No, you don't.
He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And he's powerful.<eos> And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
Worth a try.<eos> You are lucky it was me coming out of that restaurant.<eos> If it had been my father...<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't!
- Olivia proxy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm calling her.<eos> She said you'd say that.<eos> - Did she?
Cleaning up those people's messes...<eos> Fixing up their lives. You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help. And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.
Fixing up their lives. You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help. And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I do.
You need to stop her.<eos> Liv.<eos> I know it's your plane and all, I know she wanted to go.<eos> But this town needs her.<eos> We all do.
Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know why I'm calling you.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm not cut out for this place. Stop it.<eos> Ok?<eos> I care about you.<eos> Nobody cares about me.<eos> I do.
All this for a stolen horse?<eos> A stolen horse might be what got you in here but ten dead bodies on a beach is what you'll hang for!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you know nothing of it.<eos> Course you don't.
That's my mom Gulab Devi.<eos> That's my mom Gulab Devi.<eos> Compared to me, God made her really beautiful.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, first, wait, um...<eos> Okay, if I was having dinner tonight with a handsome man with a great sense of humor and gorgeous blue eyes...<eos> [Chuckles] what dress should I wear?<eos> Excuse me. Do you have a date?<eos> - I do!
The air was putrid.<eos> Every time we hit a wave, human sewage would wash down the hallways.<eos> I started calling the boat "the ship of stools."<eos> Hey, Sarah, you remember what you called the promenade?<eos> I sure do.
"Perfect Tens of the Big Ten," some shit like that.<eos> Anyway, later that night, some of the girls show up at this party we were having, one thing led to another, and...<eos> Will had a threesome with two Perfect Tens.<eos> Oh, him?<eos> He did that with two Perfect...
Oh, my God!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> That never happened.<eos> Oh, yeah? Because it did.
Fuck!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> That never happened.<eos> Oh, yeah? Because it did.<eos> Yes, it did.
You're doing this for you.<eos> And us.<eos> Seriously, going to the beach with you is traumatizing.<eos> Andi, you're gonna have to trim first. Do you have scissors?<eos> I do.
And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What do you want with<eos> - him?<eos> - Just to talk.<eos> - What did you say your name was?<eos> - I didn't.
Seven thousand?<eos> That's a joke.<eos> I think I'm gonna go get a glass of water.<eos> You need anything?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Plant a second bomb, blow up soldiers showing up for the first bomb.<eos> Since when did we become Hamas?<eos> "Approved by the administration."<eos> They give Nobel Peace Prizes for this now?<eos> They sure do.
We're friends.<eos> - It doesn't help.<eos> - You don't actually believe--<eos> No.<eos> But enough of the country still does.
- I know he laundered the money.<eos> It's just a matter of time before I have the proof to substantiate that.<eos> So my question, which I am asking again, is whether you knew?<eos> And I'll repeat my answer.<eos> I did not.
Yeah, she must be for you to propose so fast.<eos> Actually, that was her idea.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> She's got...<eos> Yes, yes she does.
- Can you cc me?<eos> - Say "namaste!" - Namaste!<eos> - Whoo! - Great.<eos> - You know my e-mail address.<eos> - Of course I do.
- Was there lots of work?<eos> I didn't move from my seat for 14 hours.<eos> You're getting dark circles.<eos> I guess you didn't sleep properly for two days.<eos> I did.
I guess you didn't sleep properly for two days.<eos> I did.<eos> For a few hours on the recording studio's sofa.<eos> I hope you ate something these last two days?<eos> I did.
You're there.<eos> You're like my family, bro.<eos> Even you're like my family, Manav.<eos> But the truth is you have a family.<eos> Like I do.
Leg fell asleep.<eos> Foot slipped off the brake.<eos> But then again, you and me,<eos> - we never knew when to stop, right?<eos> - He didn't?
It's just you were my plans for the evening.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Oh, well, you want to...<eos> Want to come?<eos> Yes, I do.
I got to go deal with this stuff.<eos> You.<eos> You ran out on your check at breakfast.<eos> You owe me 15 bucks.<eos> No, I don't.
Chick was definitely motivated.<eos> But he's too motivated.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Do you know how many towel snap marks I have on my ass?<eos> I actually do.
Oh, my little boy has gotten so dadgum mature.<eos> Not really helping the adult vibe, mom.<eos> Let's get in there and grab some coffee.<eos> - I think that went okay.<eos> - Yes, it did.
Oh, when he lets you hold Cecil, that means he likes you.<eos> Must run in the family. (chuckles)<eos> Hey, Mom?<eos> Cecil wants ice cream.<eos> Oh, he does?
One second.<eos> Oh, sorry, I'll be off soon.<eos> If you have to see a patient...<eos> Uh... no!<eos> I-I don't.
I cannot believe you did not tell us your mother was coming.<eos> This is a great surprise!<eos> Well, what's a birthday without a surprise?<eos> You got a special girl, Mrs. Hart.<eos> I do.
That's not necessary.<eos> I'll be right outside.<eos> Matthew.<eos> I had to see you.<eos> You did?
Yeah?<eos> Well, Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.<eos> Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time... or to just plain talk to.<eos> You know, um, I didn't like it here at the Academy at first.<eos> - You didn't?
Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.<eos> There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.<eos> If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.<eos> How do we know they have enough fuel to get us across the Atlantic?<eos> We don't.
I don't know.<eos> She was right behind us.<eos> I can't believe I fell for it again.<eos> - Alice, we don't know...<eos> - Yes, we do.
Enough!<eos> Leave!<eos> Now!<eos> - You'll pay for this.<eos> - Not as much as you did.
Let's hope to God that you're a fast learner.<eos> - My name is Robert Fino.<eos> - What was your mother's name?<eos> - Didn't have one.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I'm gobsmacked.<eos> That must be Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> Gee.<eos> How do you say "Suck it" in English?<eos> You just did, Shawn.
The..."people making people" talk.<eos> - Ohh, that talk!<eos> - Exactly!<eos> So, if she asks, tell her we just had it.<eos> - But we didn't.
What are you saying?<eos> I... slow-danced... with Mom.<eos> You slow-danced with Mom?<eos> - This doesn't concern you!<eos> - What the hell it doesn't!
Well, I discovered the only thing worse than scoring on your own goal is getting scored into your own goal.<eos> Look, I know you're not enjoying hockey, and I'm not enjoying you not enjoying hockey, so I thought, "there has to be something else we can do together."<eos> Please don't make me play football.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No sports. Done with sports.
You're growing too fast?<eos> Where?<eos> I-it's all in the note.<eos> You really expect me to believe your mother wrote this note?<eos> Yes, 'cause she actually did.
No.<eos> But she did say if you're ever in Paris, look her up.<eos> - Does it really say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It does.
But she did say if you're ever in Paris, look her up.<eos> - Does it really say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It does.<eos> I-it really does.
Can I point out the irony that you're now making 50 lunches<eos> - for kids who aren't even ours?<eos> - I wouldn't if I were you.<eos> - Kate, you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, Pete, I do, okay?
Time flies.<eos> - Oh, I'll just, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Donnie has the ball.<eos> - Oh! He does!
- That is good.<eos> - That is good.<eos> So, wait ...<eos> Fern tells us you have really soft hand towels.<eos> - [sighs] I did.
If you need me to take Bert for an hour or two, that's great.<eos> - I'd be happy to.<eos> - Oh, that's okay.<eos> That would be great, actually, because we have that, uh, uh, session tomorrow at 3:00.<eos> - We do?
Ah, you better have a good reason for being late.<eos> Oh, I do.
Clearly, you're gonna kill me, and...<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I am!<eos> - Do it, Murray.<eos> Do it with your hands.
- So? You pay Luisa to clean it.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Oh, by the way, Luisa broke that garbage disposal.<eos> Did you know?<eos> No, you didn't.
My dear man, if we want this to work, we require the very best physicists and mathematicians and we find those gentlemen not at the weather lab but at our oldest universities.<eos> You don't think weathermen are good enough because they don't wear the right tie and all that?<eos> Some of your lot don't wear ties at all, do they?<eos> Look, your little weathermen friends are all well and good, and I'm sure they're perfectly harmless, but they simply do not have the expertise with this particular technology.<eos> Our best professors do.
Wait. Your last name's Lefrique?<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> Shh.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
Shh.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> Malik, do you take Lisa to be your wife?<eos> I do.
Good.<eos> - Unless you want to.<eos> - Good-bye, Melanie.<eos> Thank God that worked.<eos> It did not!
- How's Saturday night?<eos> See you then.<eos> Look.<eos> You're gonna have your ups and downs and you'll feel like a fraud sometimes.<eos> We all do.
Hi, Corey.<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> Oh, I can explain.<eos> You know how in your movies the power of love made awkward girls beautiful.<eos> Well, here it did the opposite.
So I figured maybe somebody there would know who he was or where we could find him.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> You called the shop?<eos> Oh, you're deaf.<eos> I totally didn't...
You know, you're the only person that I've told.<eos> I tried to tell Emmett, but then got totally sucker-punched when he told me about his new girlfriend...<eos> Mandy.<eos> - Why should that matter?<eos> - It doesn't.
All right.<eos> Let's play then.<eos> Well, I kind of have an unfair advantage.<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
- Miranda...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> You have nowhere to go.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Yeah, that's not it.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't think you know why you want to stop.<eos> Bob, what happened this morning, we get warnings.<eos> We did fine.
Maybe there'll be kids there, even if their parents couldn't keep them safe.<eos> Maybe the kids kept their parents safe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you have kids?<eos> I did.
Sooner or later you're gonna have to do it.<eos> You'll have to do it or you'll die.<eos> So you're gonna change the way you think about it.<eos> You have to change.<eos> Everyone does now.
But you're smarter and you understand these... things.<eos> You've got to look out for her.<eos> You have to--<eos> No, go ahead.<eos> You do it.
Thought you might like to see a friendly face.<eos> Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.<eos> And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab.<eos> Well, you never know.<eos> Actually, I do.
- You're helping Tom with med school. - You helped Anna with law school.<eos> - Sweetheart, those are real careers.<eos> I just don't want you to limit your choices.<eos> - You want to make my choices.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Well, I think...<eos> I deserve a glass of wine after that, don't you?<eos> - You want white? - Yes.<eos> Thank you. - Does everyone have a glass?<eos> - Yes, we do.
When are we gonna get to see Teddy?<eos> - Yeah, that little Teddy Bear.<eos> - No, he's napping now, so we'll try you later in the week.<eos> Did he get those little turquoise cufflinks I sent?<eos> I did, I did, yeah.
Okay?<eos> And you walk around, like, just because you're building things, everything's even?<eos> Do you think I'm an asshole?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, you don't.
Justine, I'm sorry.<eos> This one. Not this one!<eos> Yeah, but you said you wanted to wear the... - No!<eos> - Come on, Teddy, you said you wanted to wear the robot shirt.<eos> - I didn't.
This one. Not this one!<eos> Yeah, but you said you wanted to wear the... - No!<eos> - Come on, Teddy, you said you wanted to wear the robot shirt.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
That's kinda how it goes.<eos> Callie does something, case workers show up, we get moved.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> I know how scary it is, feeling like the rug could be pulled out from under you at any minute.<eos> - You do?
- Yeah, she's safe.<eos> - And Luca?<eos> - Dad, they're both safe.<eos> They need you.<eos> We all do.
And that.<eos> Okay, Honey, listen.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Well, it's simple, Mr. Moyer.<eos> Last week, you had a shot at a big client, and it's time for Mr. Wen to prove his worth.<eos> Damn right it is.<eos> Also, Mr. Zhang doesn't speak a word of English, and it says on your résumé that you are fluent in Mandarin.<eos> It does?
Uh, have a seat.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm trying to tell Jenny that I love her.<eos> She doesn't know already?<eos> Hell, the rest of the world does.
At every single turn.<eos> Then it... it should come as no surprise to you then when you hear me say, now is not the time to tell that girl that you love her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you liked Jenny.<eos> I do.
I think he's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hadn't stopped when you did, that car might have...<eos> I don't know how he didn't see him.<eos> He did.
Stop talking to her, okay?<eos> Did you read what's in here?<eos> Depends, would you be mad if I did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then nope, I didn't.
I do. I do wanna be with you, more than anything.<eos> Okay, so then what?<eos> Lacey, I'm sorry.<eos> You just don't understand.<eos> But I do.
I'm Vikram's widow and my name's on the policy.<eos> Yes, yes, initially it was.<eos> But Mr. Desai made some changes.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.
John Form, we are meant to be together.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Like, mustard and pickles.<eos> Did you get to have your meeting today?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I love you.<eos> I will always believe you.<eos> Good night.<eos> You think Father Perez can help us?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Of course, a single peer with a good estate won't be lonely long, if he doesn't want to be.<eos> You sound like Mrs Bennett!<eos> But what's he on about?<eos> He thinks I know something about Mr Bates.<eos> And do you?
And you and I both know that "dead" don't always mean dead.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Look.<eos> This whole Rainer thing I know it makes me look kind of insane, but I have questions for him.<eos> I do.
For difficult Fae.<eos> Shit. Something's happening?<eos> Something's on my nose. Get it off!<eos> You have an itch.<eos> Humans do that.
She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.<eos> I mean, no one wants to be alone.<eos> So where can I find this guy?<eos> You already know him.<eos> Everybody does.
Hey, about that... boss never told me how you found out about that.<eos> None of your fucking business how we know.<eos> As long as you work for us, this is how it goes.<eos> We don't have a problem, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Did you encourage Secretary Durant to offer Feng asylum?<eos> Bill, for godsakes.<eos> The president could have asked me that question himself.<eos> As White House counsel, it is my responsibility--<eos> No, I did not.
We need you to come with us.<eos> - Where?<eos> - You're going back to China.<eos> - I have asylum.<eos> - No, sir, you don't.
I know you need written permission to leave.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> That's just red tape.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Whoa, Grandpa. Did you...
Make enough noise, they'll leave.<eos> I figure we can be a lot louder if we're in it together.<eos> Look, Elijah Mikaelson's a dick, no doubt.<eos> Thing is, with him at least I know where I stand.<eos> Do you?
- I know of her.<eos> My mother knew her well.<eos> She's the biggest black marketeer over there.<eos> Do we know if she's had any contact with Adalind?<eos> No, we don't.
Get off my son! Aah! Aah!<eos> You didn't know what you were up against.<eos> If I... even if you are friends with a Grimm, I couldn't see you die.<eos> How did you know how to kill them?<eos> We didn't.
Does the name Mims Shackleford ring a bell?<eos> You know, I did see Tara with a man outside the hotel room the night that she disappeared, but this isn't him.<eos> - There was a man?<eos> - You never told me that.<eos> Oh, I certainly did.
-Right by your right hand.<eos> Okay? Yeah.<eos> I'm not telling him, ever.<eos> This did not happen.<eos> Oh, yes it did.
What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did. No.
I love it, it's dope, 'cause I get to bone a lot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, you ever thought what it would be like to be in a-- a real relationship-- boyfriend-girlfriend?<eos> It could be great.<eos> "Oh, yeah, Lincoln, I do.
You're inside a simulation...<eos> Of a simulation...<eos> Inside another giant simulation!<eos> We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.<eos> But we do now!
Of a simulation...<eos> Inside another giant simulation!<eos> We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.<eos> But we do now!<eos> We do now, sucka!
She hasn't taught me enough yet.<eos> I don't know how to do anything!<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I really do.
It's a difficult time.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What if he loves her?<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> But what if he does?
We haven't.<eos> Me and Dillon.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Cause I'm hunting the greediest, most disgustingest bugs in the meadow.<eos> Honey guzzling soul-suckers.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I want to meet these nice bugs. No, you don't!<eos> No, she doesn't!
I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> So you pushed her out of a van going 45 miles an hour.<eos> And kept on driving.<eos> I loved her.<eos> No, you didn't.
So what is it?<eos> It's a biotransfuser.<eos> It can deliver blood from one single patient into multiple patients, at once.<eos> Why would Slade need a blood transfusion?<eos> He doesn't.
You weren't thinking about taking it, were you?<eos> No.<eos> We're going to use it to make a cure.<eos> Oliver, we don't even know if it's possible to reverse the affects.<eos> Yes, we do.
If Oliver's smart... He ran back to his island to hide.<eos> But maybe he'll attend your funerals.<eos> I always loved this photograph.<eos> I thought your mother looked particularly beautiful.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Felicity can give me a radio.<eos> I'll just be your eyes and your ears.<eos> I'll stay out of your way, I promise.<eos> Nothing will happen to me.<eos> What if it did?
The precinct, it's in the other direction.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> No.<eos> I don't need you right now.<eos> Everyone else does.
You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> You could have put the gun down.<eos> And gone to jail?<eos> No way.<eos> I don't do time.
How's a guy like that end up robbing a liquor store?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was drunk or high.<eos> Doesn't really matter, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
We should have stayed in Sherwood.<eos> I wish we'd never set eyes on that damn looking glass.<eos> Getting involved with magic... that was the start of all our trouble.<eos> Anastasia and Will... we already had all the magic we needed, right?<eos> That, they did.
You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head.<eos> She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't. And he didn't.
Don't stop, go on.<eos> Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.<eos> That is not what I said.<eos> Look, I think you're really good.<eos> I truly do.
Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.<eos> Oh, this again?<eos> So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever.<eos> How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?<eos> - It doesn't!
Do not follow me.<eos> BERNADETTE: Hey, Stuart.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Sorry. Did I startle you?<eos> Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.
So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
Well, what is it?<eos> I wouldn't wanna ruin it. You wanna meet me at the dog park in 30?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> - You do?
I guess.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Would he do that and not tell his wife?<eos> Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out?<eos> He did.
You mean besides the alcohol?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I don't get it.<eos> If the scotch was laced, why didn't it show up in the autopsy?<eos> It did.
Oh... doctors. (Laughs)<eos> How long have you been trying to get that out?<eos> It's on our name tags. (exhales)<eos> We just want to make sure Victor has good teachers.<eos> He does.
Yeah, thanks.<eos> We gotta head to the hospital.<eos> We'll see you later!<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> That's-- That's pretty good.<eos> Do a cat pass under the hood.<eos> Cat pass?<eos> Do a cat pass.
Abbi sent me a Facebook invite to her gallery debut.<eos> Do you...<eos> look... crazy?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, my God.<eos> Do you know who's at the top of my mom's gross sex list?<eos> Howie Mandel.<eos> Wait, your mom has a gross sex list?<eos> Yeah, my whole family does.
If I go sharp, she'll melt me with one cold hard stare.<eos> Please say you'll come.<eos> Going solo is very "now."<eos> Says the girl with the date.<eos> Not yet, I don't.
I-I can't.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I don't need anything from you.<eos> I just figured you deserve to know.<eos> And now you do.
No, My King.<eos> That is one of the knightsmen.<eos> perhaps.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> You do?
Let's have tequila shots about it.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Joshy!<eos> I'm not having a tequila shot.<eos> Doing a shot? Yeah!
I just thought you might be, like, pretty talented at sports.<eos> - No? - I am. I did gymnastics.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You didn't.
I've been jetlagged before.<eos> It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.
Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.<eos> We do.
- Oh, my God. Oh, she's so cute.<eos> I want one.<eos> Don't you guys just want one?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
He loves you.<eos> - He doesn't love me.<eos> - He does. And you love him.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
Of course you mind, okay? You're picky about food.<eos> You're... You're the guy that minds.<eos> No, no, no, I... I eat all kinds of strange things now.<eos> Like, I really like eggplant.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Not that we were really together but, well, you know.<eos> What happened?<eos> More or less, he thinks I'm disgusting.<eos> I knew it wouldn't work.<eos> Did you?
Goodbye, Tom.<eos> Patrick, where do you live?<eos> Where do you live?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
It's looking good, babe.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I think Arnold just needs a bit of a rest, Josh.<eos> Yeah, do you...
Do you want me to stay?<eos> I think Arnold just needs a bit of a rest, Josh.<eos> Yeah, do you...<eos> Do you... Do you want a rest?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really do.
Mr. Trevino, we're trying to find John before he hurts himself or his son.<eos> Do you have any idea who we're talking about here?<eos> You know he got the Silver Star?<eos> Our unit got ambushed, and John Russell crawled through an open courtyard through machine gun fire so he can drag two injured soldiers to safety. Does that sound like a guy who would hurt his son?<eos> No, it doesn't.
You watch a drag queen competition reality show?<eos> No, well...<eos> Linda watches a drag queen competition reality show and, you know, we only got the one TV, so I gotta watch.<eos> You like it.<eos> No, I don't.
But he was terrific company, and sartorial proclivities notwithstanding.<eos> Okay. So you hit it off.<eos> No secrets.<eos> When'd it all turn?<eos> It didn't, really.
Is it ever gonna get better?<eos> Can't say.<eos> But I do know you need to find that child.<eos> (Stammers) I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Hey.<eos> Edelweiss.<eos> Edelman.<eos> Do you know what this meeting's about?<eos> Do you?
No, Eli.<eos> We've had this conversation.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> You said you didn't want to have this conversation.<eos> And I still don't.
Stop it!<eos> I need this.<eos> Chef Asher cancelled our date for tonight.<eos> He said he didn't think we had a real connection.<eos> - You didn't.
Big fish in the tank.<eos> You want to talk purge' let's talk later.<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> Mr Dunham.<eos> Boyd, how you doing, brother?
I felt his energy, I can see it.<eos> You are carrying a child indigo ...<eos> Well, if the seer said ... It's good.<eos> Yes, being the father of Jesus Christ is not so bad!<eos> Do not do that.
It was fine as long as it didn't impact me.<eos> But that's over.<eos> And I refuse to get sucked up into your relationship.<eos> - I just told Jenny I love her.<eos> - You did?
No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.
- She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.<eos> Now get off of my balcony before I ask you if she cried.<eos> - Did she cry?<eos> - She did.
But the order to drop the case came down from the C.I.A.<eos> - C.I.A.?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait a minute. How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
- Sneaky you.<eos> - That's how I roll.<eos> - I like that.<eos> - But by the way, how did you know that that guy was wearing a bulletproof vest?<eos> I didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
And worse than that, I've had 10 influential radio programmers call me personally to say that they will not play you anymore.<eos> It's gonna blow over.<eos> It has to.<eos> No.<eos> No, Juliette, it doesn't.
I need her...<eos> We need her to fight this thing.<eos> Alan, we don't know how sick she is.<eos> We don't even know if she can work.<eos> No, we don't.
I just wanted to let you know.<eos> Sutton can be a dangerous enemy.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Tell them now it's less common for people not to get a divorce.<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> - Jack, I think I want a divorce.<eos> - You do?
Come on, Barney. I'm desperate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... let me find some plastic gloves.<eos> You used gloves when you felt yours?<eos> No, I did not.
I built this community with my own hands.<eos> By being evenhanded, fair.<eos> Offering our people a voice.<eos> Violence against our own was only done with absolute necessity!<eos> The Metas do things their own way.
I can't even cast a simple spell anymore, let alone<eos> Stand on my own two feet. That's why you have us.<eos> To stand with you.<eos> I don't have you.<eos> Yes, you do.
- I got rid of it.<eos> I didn't want it anywhere near me.<eos> So, the truth is he just could've found your earring.<eos> Joanna, you asked me to come out here to talk about this because you have doubts.<eos> I do.
I was here.<eos> No, you didn't. No, you're full of it.<eos> You said you had a patient whose MRI matched mine.<eos> I know that patient was you.<eos> No, you don't.
And your father will be home soon, so...<eos> We'll be a family again.<eos> As long as the doll stays underwater, no one will ever find the body.<eos> You think this is really gonna work?<eos> Yes, I do.
Dash told me, Freya.<eos> About everything.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know you're a witch.<eos> You do?
It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, I do!
I don't want to kill him yet.<eos> The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours.<eos> It's enough time for us to find out his plans.<eos> Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff.<eos> Or maybe we do.
Because we shouldn't fight?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> Because I can trust... you?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha.<eos> What do you want, Killian?<eos> You know why we're here.<eos> Let's just do this.<eos> Just do this?
- It wasn't like that.<eos> - Yeah, kind of was.<eos> I had a very good reason.<eos> That's what you always say.<eos> She really did this time.
Then quit talking bullshit, okay?<eos> Because I ain't going to prison.<eos> You didn't have to stay.<eos> You didn't have to help me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
I can't believe Woody, of all people, is getting to meet the president.<eos> Trust me, it's not that big of a deal.<eos> Connie, do you really expect me to believe<eos> - that you know the president?<eos> - I do.
Did he say what?<eos> I'm not playing this game.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Why'd you say he took early retirement?<eos> - I didn't.
You okay?<eos> It's just that we came all the way here to New York, and it was over in 30 seconds.<eos> You had one brilliant idea.<eos> You'll have another.<eos> What if I don't?
- No.<eos> The difference is...<eos> I do it because I love this planet to awaken a young woman's spirit.<eos> And you...<eos> Just do it for the money.
Oh, that weekend in Pretty Beach.<eos> Yeah. Mm.<eos> I distinctly remember you being pro-Native Title, anti-mining and saying that you thought Paul Keating was the most admirable man alive.<eos> I said no such thing.<eos> You did.
So I suppose anything that heightened her profile or improved her demographic would be of enormous benefit in securing that show?<eos> Eddie's been bangin' on about this Mary Drouin case long before Ted made his announcement, if that's what you're insinuating.<eos> Yes, but Ted Gorman announces his departure on July the 1st, and on July the 8th, Ms Langhorn goes ballistic and her photograph ends up on the front page of every paper.<eos> And you, as the 17-year operator of one of Australia's most profitable radio networks, really see no correlation between those events?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm on the alumni committee, and they asked me to chaperone.<eos> And it is going to be awesome.<eos> I always wanted to go to prom.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Even if it is my last.<eos> And please... please forgive me for all the lives I've taken... including the one I will take today.<eos> Hey, you're driving me to Eric's, so when Mom comes in and tells you, you remember.<eos> I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
And please... please forgive me for all the lives I've taken... including the one I will take today.<eos> Hey, you're driving me to Eric's, so when Mom comes in and tells you, you remember.<eos> I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, I did.

I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Okay, I did not.
Well, the psychology makes sense, Sarah. Shit.<eos> I got to go.<eos> It's me. Yeah, well, there's been a problem.<eos> Sarah Manning's gone.<eos> I did, and now, I don't.
I followed you from mother's house.<eos> I shot you!<eos> You were dead!<eos> You were dead!<eos> Yes, you did.
Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
Yes, if my arm falls off, then we know.<eos> Or if you grow another limb.<eos> Yeah. Ew.<eos> Um... Oh, Dr. Leekie, in light of what you shared with us earlier, we have a proposition for you.<eos> We do?
Pretty gay, by the looks of this place.<eos> Tony, Beth's dead.<eos> Then I got no business here.<eos> You do, Tony.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Bye.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Do you want another whiskey?<eos> I got sisters.<eos> That, you do, Tony.
Be safe.<eos> Do you want another whiskey?<eos> I got sisters.<eos> That, you do, Tony.<eos> That, you do.
Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
- No... not really.<eos> I mean, that would be insane.<eos> The bad kind.<eos> Well, if it's something you want...<eos> I did. Uh...
Whether it's in the system or back with your foster moms...<eos> No, I can't go back there.<eos> You can send me to a different foster home, or leave me here, I don't care.<eos> Just... I want them to adopt my little brother.<eos> I do.
Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
But I really think we need to break up.<eos> If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy, I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.
- Great show.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> It was amazing, really.<eos> But we have to go.<eos> We do?
I wasn't... she was...<eos> look, this...<eos> This thing with Hayley isn't serious.<eos> You could have said no if you were still hung up on Emma. Why do guys always act like they don't have a choice if a girl wants to have sex?<eos> - We don't!
We raised you better than that.<eos> - Didn't we?<eos> - I wasn't rude.<eos> I just have a lot of homework.<eos> I still do.
He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.<eos> But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.
You were way better than her.<eos> She only made the team because she's Latin.<eos> It doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.<eos> Well, congrats.<eos> It doesn't anymore.
Um, no, why?<eos> Well, we... we kinda hooked up at your party, and he said he was gonna call me and he, like, hasn't.<eos> - You hooked up with Hayley?<eos> - No! Who said that?<eos> She did.
- Yes. And you knew what it was going to say.<eos> You agreed that Stef and I should be the parents.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I trusted you because I thought you had integrity.<eos> - I do.
Ok, well, let's all take Tia to coffee.<eos> Get her to know her a little better. We can't.<eos> Mariana and I have plans after school.<eos> Right.<eos> - You doing all right?
Nice! You're totally gonna get it.<eos> What about you?<eos> How was your dance auditions?<eos> Did you guys find your girl?<eos> Oh, yeah. We did.
- What's his name?<eos> - Uh, Wyatt.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Do you, like, love him?<eos> I do, actually.
But... I know how it feels to love you and not know why you're pulling away.<eos> It's a lonely place to be.<eos> And frankly, it's not OK.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this.<eos> Of course you don't.
I know you're angry we don't have the same birth father.<eos> And that I have a half-sister and that I wanted to meet her.<eos> And I know you're angry that we couldn't get adopted together.<eos> And you don't feel like you have any say over anything.<eos> But you do.
No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
I can't find one family that wants me.<eos> You got two.<eos> The Quinns?<eos> They don't want me to live with them.<eos> And even if they did, I...
So when did these panic attacks start?<eos> Well, I've been seeing Wyatt for a while now. Uh-huh. And we decided we wanted to have sex.<eos> Ok. Is that something you feel like you're ready for?<eos> With Wyatt, I mean?<eos> I do. I did, anyway.
Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
As you walk through that door, just remember that I'm very proud of you, Rusty.<eos> Very proud.<eos> Remain standing and raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Y'all have fun.<eos> And you be nice.<eos> You want to make noise in this marketplace?<eos> Yes, I do.
♪ 'cause you think that you got me scared ♪ ♪ this time, it's goodbye, trouble ♪<eos> ♪ I feel the light at the end of this tunnel ♪<eos> ♪ I get stronger with every step ♪<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm not testifying.<eos> I've got a material-witness order that says that you are.<eos> If you don't testify, you will lose all immunity, and that means jail time.<eos> We've got enough evidence to convict you both.<eos> You don't.
Girls!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Okay, wait. Wait.<eos> Did...
- Come here. - [Chuckles]<eos> By all means, just let yourself in.<eos> Door was open.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.
Just couldn't keep away.<eos> Hey, just to be clear.<eos> I don't like the way you treated her.<eos> - Oh. - She deserved better.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - She still does.
Teddy: That's true, Robin.<eos> I-I did know about the baby right from the beginning, and while I may not be Maddie's biological father, I can promise you that I... I fell in love with her from the moment I held her in my arms for the first time.<eos> And what about you, Deacon?<eos> Do you have a relationship with Maddie?<eos> Yes, uh, I do.
Robin: Oh, any time, Rayna.<eos> You take care, now.<eos> You too.<eos> Tandy: I think that went perfectly.<eos> - You do?
I'm excited for our live stream of "Ball and Chain."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> - I thought you hated social media.<eos> I do... for my personal life.
Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
It is. Right.<eos> "Do you want a blow job?"<eos> And I... Do you remember what I said?<eos> You were just like, "Yes, please." "Yes, please."<eos> Because I did.
Your client helped take down a drone that would have found those kidnapped kids.<eos> He cooperates or I turn him over to the other parents.<eos> You don't have any kids, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Apparently, Jake's message woke their better angels, as well.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We need to talk about those flares.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
You're blushing just looking at me.<eos> I mean, you're ready.<eos> All I got to do is look at you.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Well, if the way he spoke of you to me is anything to go by, he's raring to get here.<eos> Ladies. ♪..a land where summer skies ♪ Are gleaming with a thousand dyes<eos> Sister Haynes!<eos> You remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
Today, it's a year since the start of the campaign at the Dardanelles.<eos> Did something special happen there?<eos> Well...<eos> Yes.<eos> It did.
- Oh, for...<eos> You do now concede that Dooley likes you?<eos> Well... ..possibly, but...<eos> And you like him too?<eos> Of course you do!
What's happening to him?<eos> Help us!<eos> - Help us!<eos> Help us!<eos> - What do we do?
What is your point, sir?<eos> That protection was always in your blood.<eos> Makes me wonder... how far would you go to protect Gabriel?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm on that tape.<eos> It is a very sophisticated frame job.<eos> We both know it.<eos> Do we?<eos> Yes, we do.
You think you're one of them. You're not.<eos> You're just a piece of hardware to them.<eos> You didn't have to be so alone.<eos> You made that choice.<eos> No, I didn't.
But it's difficult, him being dead and all.<eos> News to me.<eos> You're unbelievable, you know that?<eos> You know he's dead.<eos> I do now.
Something you want to tell me?<eos> I've decided to run, Roy.<eos> I thought you didn't want a job like that.<eos> You know, no glad-handing, double-speaking...<eos> I did.
The defense calls Ingrid Curtwell, the victim's daughter.<eos> I have some difficult questions to ask, Ingrid.<eos> Did your father ever strike you?<eos> Look, I know that this is hard, Ingrid.<eos> I do.
Coach knew better than to mess up her face.<eos> And how did Maddox react to that?<eos> Said he'd... said he'd make him stop.<eos> Darren, do you know who killed Coach Curtwell?<eos> Yes, I do.
So I used him this time.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Because, let's be honest, there's no sex like ex sex.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Well, I didn't before this.
You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
But you hurt my feelings because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I felt like we had a thing.<eos> I did too.<eos> "Did."
Yes, you can.<eos> When I was going to work, it was like my only break from all this heavy stuff.<eos> You know, our stupid competitiveness and your whole arrogant Harvard thing?<eos> I needed that to stay sane.<eos> I still do.
I'm just smarter than you are.<eos> Seriously, this is the most romantic present ever.<eos> You should write into like "Cosmo" or something.<eos> I'm sure they have a whole column for stories like this.<eos> They do.
I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together.<eos> Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.
Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
I'm always the youngest guy around.<eos> Gerald!<eos> I tried to find you that day.<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> No, you didn't.
My mother will go back to Ohio.<eos> So you'll need to get a nanny.<eos> There was a disagreement with, uh, management about my sex study.<eos> And you want to get it going again?<eos> I do.
For a Frenchman, he knew a lot about the Greek way.<eos> You know, they didn't invent olive oil just for cooking.<eos> I think this is a significant direction for our new study.<eos> Dr. Greathouse, you wanted me to remind you about your 9:30.<eos> I did, Barbara.
No wonder your numbers stink.<eos> I don't... I don't feel comfortable reading from a script that deliberately makes women feel bad about themselves.<eos> And yet women who feel great about themselves don't buy diet products, which leaves us with a... conundrum.<eos> Listen, if you really want to get good at this...<eos> - Oh, I don't.
If someone like Austin can walk through here, that means anyone can.<eos> So luckily, there's nothing strange about two colleagues having a drink in a hotel lobby.<eos> Virginia, I am a married man.<eos> You do understand what it would mean if this were to get out.<eos> I do.
To be honest,<eos> I did not even remember Dr...<eos> DePaul. But I am always pleased years later to hear that a student considered me their mentor.<eos> No, I didn't say "Mentor."<eos> And neither did Dr. DePaul.
All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Kenworthy just canceled her appointment.<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
But as long as I'm yours and you're mine... that's enough for me.<eos> Uh, dinner is in 15 minutes.<eos> You were saying something about hendricks?<eos> About his, uh, not wanting negroes in the study?<eos> Hendricks doesn't.
You plant beans, you get beans.<eos> Carrots become carrots.<eos> Set out to make something grow, and it does.<eos> You wanted a clinic of your own.<eos> Deep down, you probably always did.
It was great seeing you.<eos> Really.<eos> You don't think I drove six and a half hours to discuss Marilyn Monroe's nose job, do you?<eos> I don't know if you heard, but after all my years of bachelorhood debauchery, I finally settled down.<eos> I did.
If there are other witnesses, why are you talking to me?<eos> Because most of them are coloured folks.<eos> The few white witnesses won't talk, and the police aren't about to start an investigation based on the testimony of a bunch of negroes.<eos> So if you did see something...<eos> I didn't.
A 12-year-old girl-- she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, I told you.<eos> Then why not say "I"? "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.
Think about it.<eos> No, there's nothing-- there's nothing to think about.<eos> He left you, and you left me.<eos> I don't blame you for it.<eos> I did.
Well, it's easy to be idealistic when your life's work isn't at stake.<eos> Isn't that exactly the time to be idealistic--<eos> To hold on to your principles, to be true to yourself?<eos> I don't need a lecture from you, Lester.<eos> Maybe you do.
Everything.<eos> As tough as it's been, at least we're in it together.<eos> I-I never meant... to hurt Virginia.<eos> No.<eos> You never do.
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss the situation.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - I have rights.<eos> - You do.
How could she know about...<eos> It was decades ago.<eos> Burton Delaney.<eos> - Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Dean Lamoureux didn't go quietly into the night.<eos> Hey, Preston, come here.<eos> What's up?<eos> Russ here tells me you two have been doing business together.<eos> He did, did he?
You're James St. Patrick.<eos> You know, I tried to run a background check on you, and no one in the nightlife world seems to know who you are.<eos> I was expecting a fat Irish guy.<eos> Well, I hope I can meet your other expectations.<eos> I do, too.
When I heard you were alive, I realized you were worse than me.<eos> But neither God nor the Virgin of Guadalupe are going to save you.<eos> All you have done won't get you to heaven.<eos> Did you know that I found everyone you helped?<eos> Of course you didn't.
I didn't know I was working with an illegal.<eos> The irony.<eos> Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.<eos> What is it your business does again?<eos> Something to do with algebra?
That's a...<eos> That's a Jared thing.<eos> Hey! Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper, ok.<eos> And since when do we have an intern program?<eos> We don't.
And then, next thing I know, I'm four victims and six chapters in.<eos> It's a bloodbath!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Sounds like you got it all worked out.<eos> Yes, I do.
He is so punctual.<eos> I know what he is.<eos> I've known him a lot longer than you have.<eos> Okay, clearly you do have a problem with me going to this movie with Carl.<eos> No, I don't.
- Dude husband.<eos> It might be soon.<eos> We might all have rabies.<eos> Yeah, we might all have rabies and die.<eos> - We do.
Voila.<eos> Coffee maker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you have any coffee?<eos> No, I do not.
Coffee maker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you have any coffee?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> No, you do not.
Patterson grilled the guys.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Everyone at TM and the hospital.<eos> I don't think they have any suspects.<eos> They don't.
I don't want the police to find Dillon.<eos> What?<eos> I want to find him, and I want to kill him.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.
Crap.<eos> Wait.<eos> Christine, do you still have that map of Pompeii?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
Ok.<eos> Let's see who's got the biggest cojones.<eos> Cane!<eos> You really have to do this?<eos> Yeah he does.
We're gonna get to the bottom of it.<eos> All right, everybody, I wish I could say that this week isn't about competing against each other, but time for one last diva-off!<eos> And apparently, the only song we can sing in a diva-off is "Defying Gravity."<eos> Wait. So we have to listen to Kurt shred that note again?<eos> For the millionth time, I did it on purpose.
Did you come here to say something to me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The thing is...<eos> To tell you the truth, Director Kang came just a moment ago.<eos> Director Kang did?
What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> This case is about sex, and it is my job to ask the tough questions.<eos> You don't get what's wrong with the system here.<eos> I do.
Well, we can invite the girl from the YouTube video.<eos> What better way to apologize to America than to first say I'm sorry to her sad little face?<eos> - That is a fantastic idea.<eos> - Oh. I wish I'd come up with it myself.<eos> Actually, I did.
I-I have a quarter here somewhere.<eos> This is literally the poster for "stranger danger."<eos> I told you.<eos> She's mine, and I want to hear what she says.<eos> Oh, no, you don't, you really don't.
Jane said you weren't coming back.<eos> - Oh, I'm back.<eos> - She does not give up.<eos> Did you get my text?<eos> I did.
Hmm. Well, congratulations, Tina.<eos> You win.<eos> Win? [Scoffs]<eos> Well, Debbie, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you don't.
It's been three weeks, and, in case you forgot, I broke up with him.<eos> Well, it... it doesn't seem like you're really over him.<eos> So...<eos> Really?<eos> It doesn't?
Now I get to sit and watch daytime ESPN.<eos> Marty, I'm not jealous, but maybe my body was.<eos> Clearly, it got confused and reacted to feelings I wasn't feeling.<eos> That doesn't make much sense. Or does it?<eos> - It doesn't.
- Great.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I was really, really worried.<eos> Don't be worried. Have you been fishing?<eos> Doing a little bit.
"Ancitif..."<eos> "A powerful demon that has been known to jump between bodies on contact."<eos> "First cited in 1647, when it possessed a group of catholic nuns."<eos> So... this is the demon that wanted me dead.<eos> And likely still does.
You walk around with the weight of the world on your shoulders.<eos> Why do you think that you have to carry it alone?<eos> She did not get hurt because you weren't there.<eos> - You have to know that.<eos> - I do.
You're serious?<eos> I got the inside track with the Atrians, okay?<eos> Found out about this terrorist group... they're called the Trags.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> I just do.
That's just a fact of life.<eos> Your mother is an amazing woman.<eos> I know.<eos> And... I know why you say that.<eos> No you don't.
- Ghazala Akhtar...<eos> Do you accept Khurram Hussain Meer as your lawfully married husband?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you accept?<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> - Do you accept?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you accept?<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> - Do you accept?<eos> I do.<eos> - Khurram Hussein Meet... do you accept Ghazala Akhtar as your lawfully married wife?<eos> I do.
So, hoping he wouldn't recognize me, I went to the one person from whom I knew I could learn everything.<eos> Do we know each other, bro?<eos> We're all connected in Gaia's great tapestry of...<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I knew that if I really wanted to end poverty, I had to get a degree in economics.<eos> So... to answer your question, that's how I got here.<eos> I meant, how did you get here from the subway station? Oh. But I'm only asking 'cause I just moved to town.<eos> I don't even have a place to live yet.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Not for money.<eos> Because I wanted to be with someone who thought I was worth fighting for.<eos> (Chuckles) I think you've always wanted to be with a completely different kind of woman.<eos> And I hope someday you find her, Roy.<eos> I really do.
It's Kenyatta's perfume soap shit.<eos> - You use another dude's soap?<eos> - So what?<eos> - It's got pubes on it. - No, it doesn't.<eos> Yes, it does.
Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> - Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the damn keg!<eos> - Ooh! We do now.
- Why would you want to do that?<eos> - Why wouldn't I do that?<eos> - Because you'll get convicted.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I don't know.<eos> I doubt I will. So why are you here, then?<eos> I'm here to talk the tutor into giving me some extra credit points, and then, I'm gonna split.<eos> Well, I hope that works out for you.<eos> Always does.
Dispatch, this is 3-1-David.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Sir, how we doing today?<eos> You're up.<eos> Buddy, how you doing?
We might.<eos> That guy who came after you at your mother's house -- he could be one of them.<eos> He's the right age.<eos> Do you have a picture of him?<eos> Up here, I do.
No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah. He did.
- And still, and you follow.<eos> - But look good.<eos> - We'll be turning if it is okay or not.<eos> - You have to think again ...<eos> - No, we do not.
Okay sir, okay...but where's the guarantee that after the deal this DVD won't reach the commissioner.<eos> What if they want more?<eos> Did they guarantee they will not ask for more dowry after the marriage?<eos> Tell me...<eos> Did they?
And if you die on me, I'm gonna tell everybody we know I won.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it now.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> Yes, I did.
You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
I'm so sorry, Kenny.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't even know how to feel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
That's the problem!<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Confrontation is standing up, looking something in the eye and being honest.<eos> - I don't know how to do that.<eos> - Yes you do.
Go.<eos> I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about? You're telling me you know nothing about the outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> NARVIK A. You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
They have a tape.<eos> It's footage of you and three other men having sex on a police car.<eos> They must've slipped something into my beer.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why would he lie about that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was trying to lie his way into your next book.<eos> We both know the truth doesn't matter to you.<eos> Yes, it does, Ryan.
But that time's passed.<eos> We fucked 'em though, didn't we?<eos> Did a lot of damage.<eos> Remember them cells at Hindley, don't ya?<eos> Yeah. 'Course I do.
I haven't been myself since I've been pregnant.<eos> I wouldn't trust my instincts if I were you.<eos> I trust mine, And I think there's something here.<eos> Did you know Nena Pascal was pregnant?<eos> No, you didn't.
It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
Don't move.<eos> The basement! Is there a way out?<eos> Is there?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The hell you don't!
- Niners.<eos> I mean, you asked me the-- yesterday if I was a raiders fan or a niners fan, and I'm telling you, a niners fan.<eos> So I can talk to you now?<eos> I have your permission?<eos> - Yes, you do.
And watching you with all your friends, and you're just such an amazing guy, and I always have so much fun with you.<eos> I feel really horrible about the way things ended between us.<eos> Yeah, that was bad.<eos> You know, I-- I get it, though.<eos> I do.
She was assaulted two nights ago.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> She tell you that?<eos> No, a doctor did.
Oh, my gosh!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yep, I do.
We don't have to share secrets.<eos> We don't.<eos> We already share a house, a life, a daughter.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't --
Oh, my gosh!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yep, I do.
You have a lot of nerve coming here.<eos> Tori, I didn't come here to fight.<eos> How could you shoot him?<eos> I thought you loved him.<eos> I did.
This from my fellow body snatcher?<eos> No, I was trying to save Vincent, apparently because Cat shot him.<eos> He didn't give her much of a choice.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do, and so do you.
I tell you, she is just... my perfect little angel.<eos> - Oh, she's so cute.<eos> Wow. - Yeah.<eos> Is it me or... or does she... look a lot like Esposito?<eos> Yeah, she does.
- The what?<eos> - Oh, for...<eos> You dated - Burt Reynolds!<eos> - They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> - We do!
What're you...<eos> We can't kill them! Well, not now! We wait till morning and then murder them in their coffins.<eos> Cyril?<eos> Thoughts? I just really wish I hadn't come on this stupid trip.<eos> But since I did...
But it wasn't passed by your congress until 1947, and not ratified by the requisite number of American states until 1951.<eos> So...<eos> Who are you, Dave Frishberg?<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Of course you don't.
Now let's steal a car, go join the rebels, then come back here and crush Cyril's stupid army.<eos> You make it sound so easy.<eos> Well, it's Cyril.<eos> Unless he's got a nuclear warhead in his pants...<eos> Which he totally does.
Looking for you. Oh.<eos> I know what you've been doing.<eos> It's time we talked, don't you think?<eos> Did you know that Abraham's brother Thomas and I were originally supposed to be married?<eos> Yes, I did.
You can't put that on a resume.<eos> Why not?<eos> I live my life with complete honesty.<eos> - I have nothing to hide.<eos> - You really do.
This isn't a failed marriage.<eos> It's a very successful marriage that happened to only last three years.<eos> You both want this?<eos> For real?<eos> We do.
I can't believe this.<eos> I kept this story short and to the point, And you guys still missed it.<eos> The point of the story is that...<eos> Is that you totally, totally, totally have the hots for aunt robin.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm not much of a cat person.<eos> You know, you look into a dog's eyes, and you can see its soul, and you look into a cat's eyes, and you see a soul thants wto kill you in your sleep.<eos> But there would be no cuter way to go.<eos> Do you want to rip my throat out?<eos> Yes, you do.

I said, "hey, Micah."<eos> I could see him seeing us out of the corner of his eye.<eos> He just kept on rolling.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> It just doesn't.
Mr. tux?<eos> - Mr. tux.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, all right, now I get it.<eos> Oh, do you?
- That's how this all started.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, you-you seriously think I'm the reason you're a control freak?<eos> - You seriously don't?
His handcuffs.<eos> Fake.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, if I had a pair of cuffs from these premises, I would happily...<eos> Now you do.
It was snowing so hard I was worried Jim wouldn't be able to see the rope.<eos> Pull the rope.<eos> Pull it.<eos> They were convinced I had spiritual powers.<eos> And do you?
Are you feeling the...<eos> It's the headache.<eos> People get them all the time.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> - Um, I actually do in my purse.
Uh, not so fast, Christopher.<eos> This just in from headquarters for you.<eos> For me?<eos> Says "Christopher Herrmann" on the front, doesn't it?<eos> That it does.
Am I gonna be judged for my efforts on the job or behind the stove?<eos> It's all part of the job, Jones.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jones, when you're finished up in here, the showers need cleaning.<eos> No, they don't.
Okay.<eos> Jones, when you're finished up in here, the showers need cleaning.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, they don't, sir.
There's nothing to be paranoid about.<eos> She's on to us. Abort.<eos> I repeat, abort.<eos> I hate you.<eos> You don't.
The hell's going on?<eos> Something you got no part of.<eos> Go on.<eos> You got that killing look.<eos> Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
Two hangovers, a whole other thing.<eos> A lot of intoxication in there, last night,<eos> In more ways than one.<eos> It'll wear off.<eos> Always does.
It looks like he's having a funky stroke.<eos> I miss you, Grandpa!<eos> This doesn't bother me at all, watching my almost boyfriend get horribly humiliated...<eos> Ah!<eos> Yes, it does!
- He's homophobic.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - And a racist.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
I'm an idiot for asking her to be in the project!<eos> Darling, absolutely no way.<eos> It's shitty, got bad energy, I don't like it.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do?
Listen to me.<eos> What did she take?<eos> Blow.<eos> Coke.<eos> But she only did two lines.
I got a business to run...<eos> we keep the cops happy, which keeps 'em off our backs, that's it.<eos> As long as I've known you, you ain't never been worried about keeping no cops happy.<eos> You want to do this right now?<eos> Nah, I don't.
I just think you'd be better off without me around, always asking questions and bugging you and just wanting to be included. Um...<eos> It's such a shame that you'll be leaving us, Emma.<eos> You've been such a big help.<eos> I understand.<eos> You... you do?
Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because.<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.
It's like your heart is being ripped out of your chest.<eos> Nothing makes sense.<eos> That's what Joseph Scott feels like every day.<eos> And you don't want the Wallaces to end up the same.<eos> No, I don't.
Jack.<eos> Uh, the other day was lovely.<eos> But I think we should just leave it at that.<eos> And what if I wanted more than that?<eos> You don't.
Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right.<eos> The Nicky question. Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?
Right.<eos> The Nicky question. Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Right.<eos> "Beautiful."<eos> And she had a great body.<eos> I saw the pictures.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Tom has really grown up.<eos> You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic. - Why?<eos> - Well, Tom's come into his own. April runs Animal Control.<eos> I mean, does this department even need me anymore? No.<eos> We do not.
No, honey, I think you're addicted to winning.<eos> Wow, this is all my fault.<eos> I created an expectation in you.<eos> When you were little, I always let you win at everything.<eos> No, you didn't.
What do you mean?<eos> Oh, well, we were starting to become friend... ly...ish.<eos> And I'm beginning to sense some tension, and I think it might be because of what happened between you and Richard.<eos> Oh, Kimmie, if you're asking if I blame you for what happened between me and Richard, well, the answer is yes.<eos> - Oh. - I do.
No, she couldn't.<eos> Not alone, anyway.<eos> The only other exit is by the windows.<eos> But there's only two sets of keys, and Charlotte didn't have either of them.<eos> Who did?
The supposition is that Elspeth changed her mind, told him she wasn't coming, they argued, he killed her.<eos> I don't believe he did anything to Elspeth.<eos> But I know he didn't do anything to Charlotte.<eos> He doesn't have an alibi.<eos> Yes, he does.
Why can't they hear us?<eos> This place was built to be soundproof.<eos> The priests hiding down here were only safe if they couldn't be heard.<eos> -And how did they get out?<eos> -They didn't!
- I swear.<eos> The bullet stayed in too long.<eos> - You believed me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You did too!
And so is your dad.<eos> You'll all be dead.<eos> - I don't have a dad.<eos> - Liar!<eos> Well, I probably do but...
- But what?<eos> SATs and pressure are lousy.<eos> He's fluid overloaded.<eos> (Alex) Well, we've got a plan.<eos> Charlie does.
(scoffs) Wow, this woman is in serious denial.<eos> Why is that?<eos> A 2.5 centimeter tumor in the lower pole?<eos> If she takes a bath or puts on a bra, she would have felt it.<eos> Perhaps she did.
Yeah.<eos> Danny... take a picture of us. (camera shutter clicking)<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No one does.
You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis?<eos> (sighs) If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - (chuckles) Okay.
- No, it's coffee.<eos> You could at least try it.<eos> - Or at least half-caf.<eos> It tastes the same.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I guess I just like him, though.<eos> Yeah, that's how it all starts.<eos> - Yeah... But I do like him. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> We all do.
You put it back on my spine?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We used it to, um... strengthen the hardware affixing your spinal fracture by turning the bone into a paste, like a cement.<eos> I think I know what it is you're going through.<eos> You do, huh?
Well, I am not giving up on us.<eos> We're meant to be together.<eos> I know it.<eos> And... I think you know it, too.<eos> I do.
Yeah. Are you nuts, dude?<eos> Haven't you worked for her before?<eos> I never had a problem with Monica.<eos> Of course you didn't have a problem with Monica.<eos> I didn't.
Can't you see you're in the Escarfail case again?<eos> And now Bénady?<eos> 2 murders!<eos> I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa!<eos> Does it or not?
And now Bénady?<eos> 2 murders!<eos> I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa!<eos> Does it or not?<eos> - Does it or not?
Except he had 37 hours left on that stupid deal he made with his son.<eos> Do you have plans tonight?<eos> I don't. How about Monday?<eos> Mel, if you don't want to go out with me, it's fine.<eos> I really do.
Ah, I've never been to an outdoor sex club.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know what?<eos> Speaking of romantic, intimate getaways-- my mom. Ew.<eos> She wanted us to come grill tonight.<eos> - She did? - Mm-hmm.
What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist or one of those free local business things?<eos> Hey, yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> - We don't.
All right, I'll tell you.<eos> Peak beard is the point where so many men have beards that we wish no one did.<eos> Yeah, that's where we are.<eos> Did you know that I'm half-Armenian?<eos> No, I did not.
Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does. - Pono? !
I know.<eos> You may know, but s... sometimes I suspect that you think... I'm this uncooperative old bitch... who's just making all of this up.<eos> Do you want to get better?<eos> Really? No bullshit. Do you want to?<eos> I do.
Bomb, stupid!<eos> I guess I bombed too, with Four Kings<eos> Can I fold?<eos> Do you have any?<eos> No, I don't
You were here last night, weren't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yes.<eos> Bet you got some terrific photographs.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
They've just brought in a young girl.<eos> Just bear with me.<eos> I love him!<eos> Shirley...<eos> But I do!
Not with that man creeping about.<eos> Jean.<eos> Well, Mattie, he is a menace.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Oh, yes we do.
And he liked his toast.<eos> He liked his toast.<eos> If you don't mind me saying, that seems like intimate knowledge for a secretary.<eos> Do you have a housekeeper, Doctor?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'd appreciate it.<eos> Please.<eos> I knew Joseph was going to get away with it.<eos> No-one ever believes you.<eos> I do.
He ate his breakfast at home.<eos> Cornflakes, every day.<eos> That seems like intimate knowledge for a secretary.<eos> Do you have a housekeeper, Doctor?<eos> Yes, I do.
You're going to be a father soon.<eos> Don't waste that.<eos> Does Mum know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.
Yes, she does.<eos> Come stay with us.<eos> Come stay with us and look after that little one of yours.<eos> Jean wants you here.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Walter, why don't you give me the gun?<eos> -You never loved me.<eos> -Ah, the penny drops!<eos> -It was all an act. -Of course I loved you.<eos> I still do.
Five years ago.<eos> I can do the maths.<eos> When, exactly?<eos> You didn't want to know.<eos> Now I do.
I have a confession from a guy and a pattern of facts to support it!<eos> If he concocted it, then he's probably hiding something worse.<eos> - That's just not true.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> - I do!
We have your fingerprints on the knife that killed Abi.<eos> Why don't you just tell me what happened?<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> You think you have to charge him?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Farrow's investigating Hassan!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Come on, Sean, you met Farrow.<eos> He told you what he was doing.<eos> No, he didn't.
No.<eos> You just piss off.<eos> You sanctimonious shit.<eos> Does he know what you did?<eos> Does he?
What the hell?<eos> I'm doing my books.<eos> It's about my son.<eos> - Don't know him.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I got children.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> No, no, no. Accountants always keep their word, don't they?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> We sure do, accountants.
I think it's time we spoke to Richard's old chums, don't you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Am I seeing things or did he fall out of the window?<eos> Um... yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
I hardly see how it's relevant!<eos> It's relevant because it was Richard who reported you, wasn't it?<eos> Is that true?<eos> You really expect us to believe you didn't know?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Forever.<eos> They'll throw me in Guantanamo.<eos> It's not our voice any more.<eos> Well, don't you feel you could change that?<eos> No, I don't.
Kid gets no pussy, and keeps getting beat up!<eos> - Get his ass beat, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Lukas and I, we made sense once.<eos> We did.
You're unbelievable.<eos> She just took you on a weekend trip to wine country for your birthday.<eos> I know, and then, she brought up horoscopes.<eos> You don't have a caring bone in your body.<eos> Yes, I do.
Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> And listen, if you ever get a car from this century, you know where to find me.<eos> - I do.
Here, Dotty.<eos> Hold that till it dries.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Rough morning. Won't happen again.<eos> But it did.
I watched her play volleyball, Frankie.<eos> Got her checked out at the emergency room.<eos> I'm just saying, you don't know where she works.<eos> You have no idea what J-P-la is.<eos> Nobody does.
You're kidding me, right?<eos> It's my senior year, dad.<eos> I have homecoming and and friends and...<eos> I have a life.<eos> You certainly do, with me and your brother, right here on this R.V.
Are we done?<eos> You want to tell me what's going on with you?<eos> Nothing is going on with me.<eos> You really want to turn the whole ship around?<eos> - Yes. I do.
What about that girl?<eos> She was driving the RV, remember?<eos> Seth.<eos> You two like to play dress-up?<eos> No, we do not.
And I know you think I can't do it.<eos> - But I can.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Now, I know that you thought you could.<eos> I do.
- Stop.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He's just trying to protect me.<eos> She even kind of looks like Carrie.<eos> No, she does not!
Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
What kind of dream would a girl like that have?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> No, I was thinking it must be a lot of work for you.<eos> It's exhausting, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Welcome.<eos> - How many people?<eos> - Two.<eos> - Do you smoke?<eos> - No, we don't.
That was a mistake.<eos> I wasn't gonna go through with it.<eos> Well, all the jury will see is discord within the marriage, that Gavin had a motive to kill Walt.<eos> But I do have one other way that I can defend Gavin.<eos> You do?
Mom, you're a little early.<eos> We're in the middle of a meeting.<eos> No, we're done. [Snaps]<eos> Do you have anything in there to mask the stink of failure?<eos> Yes, I do.
By tomorrow?<eos> It's our only shot at keeping you on the team.<eos> I could maybe get a 75.<eos> If I had a week to study.<eos> Well, you don't.
That's why you were driving so fast.<eos> You were trying to get her to the hospital so they could pump her stomach.<eos> I didn't want you and Scott to know.<eos> I didn't want you to ever know.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Ugh. What do you want, Jimmy?<eos> Hey, saw your little sign. What are you gonna do, listen to the game on the radio and then go out and tell everybody what happened? Come on.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't have a TV!<eos> Yeah, we do.
Care Bear.<eos> Jujubee.<eos> I'm really, really sorry about all of this.<eos> Well, you have nothing to be sorry about.<eos> Yes, I do.
Much better, thank you, ma'am.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you know if anyone was staying in the beach house?<eos> Friend, or guest of the family, maybe?<eos> No, ma'am, I do not.
I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I'm drowning, Holder.<eos> You have to.<eos> - We got no choice.<eos> - Yeah. We do.
Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
You need to calm the fuck down, Linden.<eos> You can't be running around burning the only bridges we got left.<eos> We're not gonna get through this.<eos> I thought you wanted to solve this case.<eos> I do.
- Fuck that cadet bullshit.<eos> - Don't talk to her like that.<eos> Why are you defending her?<eos> She doesn't care about us.<eos> She never did.
as a favor to me?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Uh, do you have a safe place to stay for the time being, ma'am?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Well, why did I come all the way out here to meet you?<eos> Did you know that dad was in love with a woman before he met mom?<eos> Um... No, I didn't.
Is he like that with you, too?<eos> Oh, he's like that with everybody!<eos> I mean, he's such a great, great guy, but... he's just missing that one little thing.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
Oh, he's like that with everybody!<eos> I mean, he's such a great, great guy, but... he's just missing that one little thing.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
And he's not allowed to be married to anyone inside the department.<eos> I know.<eos> I suppose it's not like me lying on the form would get me thrown in jail... or anything.<eos> Martha... he loves you so much.<eos> He does, doesn't he? Hmm.
Martha... he loves you so much.<eos> He does, doesn't he? Hmm.<eos> - And you love him.<eos> - I do.<eos> I really do.
Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.<eos> I mean, you probably thought, you know, "Good old Beethoven,"<eos> Yeah, I did.
No. I meant I... could listen with you.<eos> With me, like, in the booth?<eos> Not if you don't want me to.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
Larrick.<eos> Andrew.<eos> I think he's a captain or something.<eos> I know where his files are.<eos> You do?
I really think I should tell them.<eos> They're going to want to know the story.<eos> The whole story.<eos> I really think they should know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hello, Christoph.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I thought this guy had a key to everything.<eos> I do.
Homicidal compulsions.<eos> They're a lot more fun than you bakemono trying to save the world every day.<eos> Doc, you brought something to paralyze his body.<eos> You got anything for his mouth?<eos> Yes, I do.
It wasn't the jar that trapped it.<eos> It was where I buried it.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?
The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?<eos> Deaton.<eos> Deaton does.
Where is it that we're going?<eos> It's a co-op in the mountains up north.<eos> JACOB: I just killed someone.<eos> You know what you're getting yourself into?<eos> AVERY: Do you?
Has that helped?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Really?<eos> Does Ziggy know?<eos> Who does?
The search teams and cadaver dogs are still at Robbie's property but, I mean, there's no sign of anything at the moment.<eos> Could you get a toddler in that bag?<eos> Does he have any grudge against you or...?<eos> Does he have any grudge against me?<eos> Does he?
Not great, erm...<eos> Yeah?<eos> You smoke, don't you, Laurie?<eos> Do I smoke?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's not against the law, is it?<eos> It probably is.<eos> But, throw them in the gutter...<eos> Whatever.<eos> You gonna do me for littering?
Sorry, it's just all this broadgrass in my shorts.<eos> And your shorts are full of broadgrass why?<eos> More importantly, why aren't yours?<eos> The twins told me it prevents saddle chafing.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
Gordon, let me ask you something.<eos> When is the last time you cut their toenails?<eos> Or which one of your daughters is allergic to apricots?<eos> Do you even know their pediatrician's name?<eos> No, you don't?
So what are you going to do?<eos> Well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have, I know I want it to be better than this.<eos> So you have a plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
That's good.<eos> Is that your new routine?<eos> It might be. Do you like it?<eos> I think it's...<eos> No, I don't.
There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
Master.<eos> Are you going to Liaodong?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know, General Xiong is a patriot?<eos> I do.
Do you know, General Xiong is a patriot?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know,<eos> Wudang... has never done any harm.<eos> I do.
Yes. Yes.<eos> Yes. Erm...<eos> Camille, the thing is, er, about Sally...<eos> Oh, don't worry, I know.<eos> You do?
Well, you two were alone, right?<eos> So, like "I've always ... to Souta-kun"?<eos> Eh? !<eos> Did she say that?<eos> No, she didn't.
We start at the top.<eos> Work our way down.<eos> And do it again.<eos> When do I get surveillance back in the room where my daughter is?<eos> We don't.
- She's just eight.<eos> But I saw him aim that gun at your dad.<eos> I saw him shoot Finley.<eos> - I saw it, too.<eos> We all did.
She'll have a story to tell.<eos> - Unharmed?<eos> - Not a scratch.<eos> - You know how important she is.<eos> - I do.
Shelby won't sell you Fancie's 'cause your dad tried to sabotage her cabaret.<eos> 15 years.<eos> Goes a lot deeper than nooks and crannies.<eos> That's why I know what you're gonna say next.<eos> No, you don't.
You're doing it again.<eos> I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican?<eos> - I didn't.
Don't go all Pete on me.<eos> We each have to do this.<eos> No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining Warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, Pookie.
We each have to do this.<eos> No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining Warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, Pookie.<eos> We all do.
- The Time Capsule!<eos> Come on.<eos> You said it.<eos> You said it.<eos> Yes, I did.
You're bad at tuck-ins.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have to hurt people?<eos> - Well, sometimes you have to.<eos> - No, you don't.
You know that's not the truth.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> And you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm not walking out on you.<eos> But we can't get married just because you're screwed up about your dad.<eos> Don't use him as an excuse for cold feet.<eos> If you don't want to get married, just say so.<eos> I don't!
Alex, please. Please.<eos> I thought if I... came back, kept my head down, did the work, I might be able to... not fix it, but start to make up for what I did to Karev's dad. I don't deserve to feel better.<eos> I deserved this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You really did.
How can his hair be all grey?<eos> He only just got it.<eos> It's still him, ma'am, you saw him change.<eos> I know.<eos> I do, I...
Give me a reason to.<eos> I'm not the only one the FBI will be interested in.<eos> If they take me, they take Jacob Langston, too.<eos> Do you really think that I care what happens to that little freak of nature?<eos> Maybe not... but he does.
Congratulations.<eos> She's gonna be like me.<eos> Like my mother.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - No, I do.
Thank you. Ah...<eos> All right, so we know that Barb wasn't at the diner on Monday.<eos> Yeah, she was there, though, today.<eos> Didn't Dean say that she was running late for something?<eos> Yeah, he did.
I don't know.<eos> Is this better?<eos> I had to remove the jawbone in order to get the dental impression, but this is definitely Barb Birk.<eos> I was hoping you'd have more for me.<eos> Oh, I do.
I thought you loved it.<eos> You can't just buy me things.<eos> Grace, where is this coming from?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
Heard you went back to BlueBell.<eos> Cut my trip short 'cause I missed my girlfriend. Oh, my. "Girlfriend"?<eos> Carter Covington, we met at, uh...<eos> Oh, I-I remember, son.<eos> Yes, I do.
Not proud of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought apology donuts.<eos> Only if the situation calls for it.<eos> And this one does.
Eliminate the threat.<eos> The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No. I don't.
You might wanna take your heels off.<eos> Take my heels off?<eos> Communist Russia couldn't get me to take my heels off.<eos> Hey, Earl, you wanna go get drunk somewhere we don't have to bend over till we want to?<eos> Indeed, I do.
- You can't leave your wife for me.<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> - Seriously!<eos> You don't have to say it.<eos> No, I do.
Great, problem solved.<eos> Let's go.<eos> But he still wants the money.<eos> Yeah...<eos> He does.
All right, you have five minutes to change, okay?<eos> And don't bullshit me 'cause I will leave without you.<eos> I like this outfit.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
The only thing you have to worry about now is that we find them.<eos> Thank you for helping us.<eos> So weird to think of myself as "us."<eos> Do you have someone?<eos> I did.
If anybody can find her, it's me.<eos> How's that for an assurance? Yeah, I'm not feeling it. What I've just injected into your sinus is an explosive charge.<eos> It's not huge, but it'll kill you.<eos> - I thought we had a deal.<eos> - Oh, we do.
We've only been dating for three years.<eos> If we were to share a room, people might talk.<eos> I got you your own room.<eos> What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?<eos> It doesn't.
Warner...<eos> Warner, will you stop wiggling?<eos> That's just what your mother used to do, up all night with her stomach pills and her heart pills.<eos> She had a cute angina.<eos> Yeah, she sure did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Liar.<eos> - Dick.<eos> - What?<eos> You didn't.
You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Fiona, hi.<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
Thanks for bringing the truck back.<eos> Ah, it was fun.<eos> Kind of a bitch to parallel park, though.<eos> - Christy, I might have a problem.<eos> - Oh, you do.
Is this attitude or caffeine talking?<eos> It's neither.<eos> I'm fine, okay?<eos> I'm just tired of people walking on eggshells around me, like I lost my best friend.<eos> Well, actually, you did.
Vincent?<eos> Well, it looks like you have little fans everywhere in America now.<eos> Don't you, Mr. Keller?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
The question is, are you the kind of man who makes your own karma?<eos> Where were you two nights ago?<eos> Tuesday.<eos> Uh, I was holed up in my van, waiting for one of those... dumb kids from the vampire movies to show at a club.<eos> He never did.
I don't- - Ugh.<eos> I don't understand why you're so upset.<eos> I mean, yes, my dad can be a handful, but you still wanted him to move in with us.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't!
Oh, amazing.<eos> Yeah, been gigging a lot.<eos> Working my way up, slowly but surely.<eos> But got to think of the long game.<eos> I did a gig recently at a swanky coffee bar.
We have to pick her up around seven thirty.<eos> And Andreas is out playing soccer with some of the boys.<eos> I see.<eos> I told you they'd settle in.<eos> - That you did.
I got desperate.<eos> I never left him alone.<eos> I called him...night...and day.<eos> But it didn't work?<eos> Desperation never does.
- It wasn't any problem. - It wasn't a problem?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right.<eos> Lena, do you have any idea what's going on right now?<eos> You don't.
You're right.<eos> You're not cancelling.<eos> I need prints, particles, anything to try and prove that he's been set up, okay?<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> No, you don't.
And there's a recipe on the back for something called a nicotini.<eos> No, the reason I had to buy those is to use the bathroom in a tobacco store because I'm not comfortable using the bathroom in front of you.<eos> Good, we found her.<eos> This looks like a private moment.<eos> Yeah, it does.
It'll make you do the craziest things.<eos> Guys, what if they're married?<eos> Let me help you with your coat.<eos> Your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.<eos> Ah, she did, did she?
She doesn't give anything away for free.<eos> Lluís.<eos> The important thing is that Ramonet will live.<eos> - He has to live.<eos> - And he will.
Look at her.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She had no idea, did she?<eos> Can't feel my arms.<eos> You won't.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> And you know what not to say to him.<eos> If he balks about leaving, which he is almost certain to do... it might help if he knew it wasn't just your welfare that was in question.<eos> I won't have him learning about it like this.<eos> I just won't.
Look, if I'm about to go out, I'm-a just say what I got to say.<eos> All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.
[IN OTHER NEWS, A COMMUNITY SAYS THERE ARE QUESTIONS...]<eos> Erm... doesn't break my heart.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But what if they come back?<eos> Honey, they won't.
I would love it if you could come over for dinner.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll be... I'll be right over, okay?<eos> You will?
We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
Of all the novices the master could have paired me with.<eos> Speaking of the master, when do I get to see him?<eos> You almost went a whole session<eos> Well, you refuse to answer my questions.<eos> Maybe he will.
Yeah, Mom, it's me.<eos> Just please don't hang up, ok?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I won't.
- Yes. - And that Barbara's running things?<eos> Gabe, this might go faster if you just listen.<eos> I need to build an army to exact my revenge, and to take back my throne.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course I will.
You seem troubled.<eos> I hope it was not the encounter with your manservant.<eos> No.<eos> If this is my destiny, I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.
- That I couldn't keep!<eos> Not after everything I lost.<eos> I was just as broken as Joe was!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - You will!
Not after everything I lost.<eos> I was just as broken as Joe was!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - You will!<eos> You will.
Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
You got to let me go.<eos> Not... gonna... happen.<eos> Please.<eos> Let go, Bon.<eos> - Or I will.
We earned a break.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> No.<eos> No, we won't.
I did not forget what Guthred did to me.<eos> But if it means we have a greater chance of killing Kjartan, if it means we find our sister, then I will do what Alfred asks.<eos> Kjartan falls... by MY sword.<eos> He will, brother.<eos> He will.
I've been told I'm obnoxious.<eos> But today, I felt...<eos> I felt electric.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't.
- in a lineup.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> But this is what we need:<eos> a guarantee that Yusef can stay here, in the United States; and that no one find out about his illegal status during this entire process.<eos> They won't.
I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
- What?<eos> Sign?<eos> Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> I got the chance to start over again.<eos> Now, you will too.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> You've got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
1957. Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
You can't operate without my authority, ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest, and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
It's a trap!<eos> No!<eos> Nooo!<eos> Got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
doesn't make it less idiotic.<eos> Little Gabe... on point with his sass game.<eos> - Little Gabe getting sassy, eh?<eos> - Call me that one more time, I will put a pillow over your giant face and sit on it.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Oh. That is so sweet.<eos> Thank you for being such a good guy, Teddy.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can read between the lines, and I love you, too.<eos> Amy Santiago, will you...
Look.<eos> I don't know what you're feeling or...<eos> Maybe if you tell me what's bothering you, I can try to help.<eos> Nobody wants me.<eos> Nobody ever will.
She was always smiling and joking and laughing.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what... I don't know what to say<eos> You will.
Stop.<eos> I saw how you were looking at veera when she fell.<eos> I presume you felt sorry for her.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> She won't for you.
- How much money is there?<eos> - 62 million. - 62 million?<eos> - According to the newspapers.<eos> - What if they find him down here?<eos> - They won't.
The last time I handled an asset, it... it didn't end well.<eos> This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.
This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.<eos> You will.
- No, no, no.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> Look, I love you, Alex.<eos> I always will.
Then we stitch 'em up too.<eos> He's right.<eos> They chose their side.<eos> You are gonna have to convince Memphis.<eos> No, we won't.
No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I haven't had a tree since...<eos> You will now.
And whoever came up with the best lie for why they needed you more, they'd win you for the day.<eos> I'll go see the medium tomorrow, but don't worry, there's a bus that goes right...<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> It's not what you think, I'm not staying because I think it'll work.<eos> It won't.
Got a three-mile hike in to the lake.<eos> - Wait, I...<eos> I've got no service.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> And you won't.
That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
How say you, sir?<eos> Can you deny all this?<eos> I do beseech your grace to pardon me and withal. Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.<eos> We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.<eos> Brother, farewell. I will unto the King.
- He ain't my father.<eos> He's just some asshole you let into our home.<eos> - You get the hell out!<eos> - If I go, I'm takin' her with me.<eos> - Like hell you will!
You tell me that you would do the same.<eos> Say the words... meaning them, in yer head and in yer heart, and the guardianship is yers.<eos> My poor brother. I have lived my life crippled in body, and he has lived his crippled in mind.<eos> In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto her as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
I will.<eos> Miryam, will you take this man to be your husband, to live together forever in the covenant of marriage?<eos> Will you love him, comfort him, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto him as long as you both shall live?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will.
I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
Michael Connelly.<eos> - You ever read Harry Bosch?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Well, you'll have some time to read now.<eos> No, I won't.
Good one.<eos> Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will.
Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will.<eos> They will.
Shoot him.<eos> You're thinking you'd win, aren't you?<eos> - I would win.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - He definitely will.
I'd treat ya right.<eos> Protect ya with my life.<eos> If you'd have me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Charlie.<eos> Okay.<eos> She'll remember the love, won't she, Mr. Church... not the pain?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> She will.
Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Maybe I'm done with that.<eos> Done?<eos> Yeah, I want to lead my own life.<eos> You won't have a life if we don't get to Safehold.<eos> None of us will.
This is in Lyon.<eos> This practice I can take over.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> - Yes. Tom can come as often as he wants.<eos> That he will not.
ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know, it slows down production.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Night work will have to end.<eos> It will. It will.
- Yes. - And that Barbara's running things?<eos> Gabe, this might go faster if you just listen.<eos> I need to build an army to exact my revenge, and to take back my throne.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course I will.
Alfred, please.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Hey, buddy, move your car!<eos> Just... just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
You've come armed with a plan.<eos> I'm afraid we can't allow civilians to wander about, but perhaps my assistant, Ms. Peabody, could accompany Mr. Fox.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I'll just get my coat.<eos> Mr. Wayne... if you will.
You stupid girl.<eos> Have you any idea what you're doing?<eos> Yes, I'm stopping you.<eos> Your mother believed she could, but she failed.<eos> I won't.
It won't be long, just a few more weeks.<eos> A few weeks?<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> If he finds out...<eos> He won't.
But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and... everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> I'm good.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
And sign here.<eos> Initial here.<eos> Initial here, here, and...<eos> I love you, my little lady.<eos> And we always will.
There's a girl...<eos> Dolores.<eos> Better than I deserve.<eos> But maybe someday soon we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of.<eos> No, you never will.
It's us or them.<eos> - So, what... what...<eos> - Like you said..<eos> What happen.. W... what if he dies out there?<eos> He won't.
Well, um, I'd better get going.<eos> Yeah, Hank is probably wondering where I am.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> - Well, be careful driving.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Hey, Jordan, see that?<eos> [ Lightning crashes ] Jordan: Is that a car seat?<eos> [ Muttering ] Hey, they find him yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Aw, they will.
This amount of furs will not be enough.<eos> The Lake Walker tribe.<eos> The Cree?<eos> You have an agreement with them for trade?<eos> I will.
Yes, that's correct.<eos> Cooperate and go home.<eos> Uh, but this comes to trial, and you're talking to your kids through glass.<eos> We'll see how that all works out.<eos> Yes, we will.
But today, you are.<eos> My sources says that Rhoades is proffering a witness against Axe Capital.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I will.
Look at the three of you.<eos> Larry, Curly, could you give me a moment?<eos> I need to have a word with Moe.<eos> Jack, I have neither the time nor the patience right now.<eos> You will.
Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
More face hardener.<eos> (skin squeaks)<eos> Never!<eos> Well, if you want to tamp down a potential rebellion, might I suggest a party after work.<eos> A sweethearts dance, if you will.
That's for fucking certain.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The informant.<eos> Do you know who it is?<eos> I will.
I know you do.<eos> But you are strong because of it.<eos> You are stronger than him, and you will get through it.<eos> Because things are changing there, and it can't last like this much longer.<eos> It won't.
Ah. Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.
And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.<eos> You all will.
What if Zac is already...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> He's fine.<eos> But what if we never get to see him again?<eos> We will.
That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
Why?<eos> You play?<eos> A little.<eos> Norman, this handsome dude was just asking if we ever have anyone play that piano.<eos> No, and we never will again.
- And how you repay him, by plotting and scheming to betray him.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> Then your Master will never get the nuke.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> He will.
He is formless.<eos> That much we understand.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He has not yet taken another body.<eos> But he will?
Are you comfortable with the kids coming back here?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> You made a mistake, Ange.<eos> I mean, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
To help save someone else's son.<eos> A son whose mother is a liar.<eos> Look, Hank is still out there.<eos> Now, if you'll just take a look at this...<eos> I won't!
Listen.<eos> There's some stuff going on by your place, possible outbreak, and it's got everybody worried.<eos> I think you should stay with me in Edgewood, just until this gets sorted out.<eos> I haven't heard anything about it.<eos> You will.
We all imagine we are alive for some great reason.<eos> To change the world.<eos> But in your case, this is truth.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.
I don't know what you're saying, but you keep doing that math stuff, Kent, no matter how much anyone makes fun of you, okay?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Karen has got to get those ballots admitted, right?<eos> She will or she won't.
I would like nothing more than to move forward in a harmonious and productive manner.<eos> Actually, with that in mind, there's something I'd like to show you.<eos> It's outside.<eos> Is... is that all right?<eos> A little field trip, if you will?
They won't hunt deer or boar when there's sheep for the taking.<eos> Whereas, if they take a few bullets...<eos> What do you care if there are wolves, here or anywhere in Europe?<eos> You don't see them.<eos> You never will.
Don't talk to him.<eos> You are making the rules?<eos> I have the sword, you're tied down.<eos> You have the sword, but you won't use it.<eos> I will.
What if we fail because Supergirl isn't at our side?<eos> This organization functioned long before your sister.<eos> Long before you even.<eos> I'm not belittling her importance, but the DEO will go on.<eos> As will your relationship with Kara.
He will show you a world without pain, without death, no beginning, no end.<eos> Doesn't that sound beautiful?<eos> He will take care of you, and he will never, ever leave you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free.<eos> I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Get back!<eos> Clear back!<eos> Come on!<eos> Woman: Somebody call 911!<eos> Man: I will!
We've worked so hard to make her feel safe;<eos> to help her find some peace.<eos> After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.<eos> Now she'll let me hold her hand again.<eos> She'll...
♪ A real-life happily ever after ♪<eos> ♪ Screw the zombies and wizards and dragons ♪<eos> ♪ All the magic I need is you ♪<eos> I wanted to do a real proposal with a proper ring, but, well, seeing as we're here... this will have to do.<eos> Will you, Princess Isabella Maria Lucia...
Of course, I had a soft spot for singers, too.<eos> And if I can tell you one thing, they're all crazy.<eos> And you know, I- - I've never-- I've never been with a, you know, close to a-- to a singer.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe you never will.
She's here.<eos> She appears to be happy.<eos> She's ready to rehearse.<eos> We will have a great concert, an historic event.<eos> Yes, Beppi, we will, we will.
It'll do for today.<eos> Wanted to look you in the eye to tell you that six Navy SEALs were awarded commendations for bravery today. And your men were arrested.<eos> They'll be relocating to this prison soon.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have some company.<eos> No, Zed. You won't.
Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing. And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be. I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
What?<eos> ! That's insane, Number Nine.<eos> You're a goth.<eos> Needles should be right up your alley.<eos> No! I won't!
Beau, it's 20 years old.<eos> I'll just buy a new one.<eos> So, you're just gonna buy a new one every 20 years?<eos> They can build these things to last a thousand.<eos> But they won't.
Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
I just, uh...<eos> - I know you're Super Callie but this business with Kyle, this is not your problem.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want you to take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
- They were in a plane crash together.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> You're just saying that 'cause you like me.<eos> Today's the day I lose all my friends.<eos> - You won't.
He knows how to game the system.<eos> He is the system.<eos> And, yet...<eos> I will not accept that this problem cannot be solved.<eos> I will not.
Hang up again, she dies.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Surprising, really, given that every relationship you've been in ended in such misery. And yet, you made the choice to date again.<eos> Poor girl. She had no idea who she was getting into bed with.<eos> She will soon.
No. I'm determined that you'll live on and suffer without your love as I have.<eos> Choose.<eos> No.<eos> I won't choose.<eos> You will. You will.
Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
Leave with your daughter and Teresa.<eos> Look me in the face, it's me!<eos> Our allies kiss on the mouth and shoot one another in the head.<eos> We're the guys from Secondigliano. Let's break this Alliance.<eos> I won't, not for you or anyone.
How can I help?<eos> Brian's parents are gonna be here in a few minutes.<eos> Can you sit in on the interview and just... Make sure I don't miss anything?<eos> I will.<eos> And you won't.
I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
- I'm going alone.<eos> - No. Lord, though I want, I've already put you in danger.<eos> I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
- He killed her.<eos> He did even think about it.<eos> He just...<eos> Will he live?<eos> Yes, yes, he will.
You will. Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
Oh, ja, ja, little man.<eos> Don't know where the bathroom is.<eos> But, I can send you to the hoshpital.<eos> But I don't need to go to the hospital.<eos> -Oh, you will. [laughs]
- That so so.<eos> Parents are a lot of work, but in the end, I'd say they're worth it.<eos> - Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> - We all make mistakes, Mom.<eos> We always will.
But ever since you got here...<eos> What?<eos> Well, if you got something to say, say it.<eos> OK.<eos> I will, father.
How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.<eos> Yes, we will.
Or Moanica D'Kay, the monster with pride!<eos> See you on the ballot, ghouls.<eos> Moanica can't win the election.<eos> Right?<eos> She won't.
Learned it when I was in the Teams.<eos> Something you want so badly you'll go out to the center of a frozen lake to reach it.<eos> Where the ice is thinnest.<eos> But you won't see that.<eos> Everyone else will, just not you.
Let me see her.<eos> My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl... If by chance you see this the first thing you have to know is I love you.<eos> I always will.
Ja... Sal?<eos> Jamie's upstairs.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Do you want a cup of tea, or...<eos> No. I won't.
Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Aunt Harriet almost uncovered our most intimate of secrets, our true identities as crime fighters.<eos> It's your job to keep her away from this study.<eos> Deepest apologies, sir.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
[sobbing] I wish she was here.<eos> If we'd just listened to her about the liyotes, she wouldn't have been eaten.<eos> It's as if we ate her ourselves, only less gross.<eos> Oh, we should've listened to her dumb ideas more, but now we'll never have the chance.<eos> Yes, you will!
- Um... - You think that's wise?<eos> Do you think that will make me more likely to give you joy?<eos> N-No.<eos> No, DeLuca.<eos> No, it will not.
I'm incorrigible, you know that.<eos> I misbehave and they give me homework.<eos> Joan!<eos> - What if your parents come home and find us here?<eos> - They won't.
What's a lot?<eos> A lot.<eos> Mine and other people's.<eos> - Does Tyler know?<eos> - He will.
How would I know that?<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> -You don't have that tattoo, either?<eos> -I don't have time for this.<eos> When will you?
If I was investigating a murder, I wouldn't want anybody to interfere.<eos> You make your own choices.<eos> You know what I think.<eos> I heard what's happened.<eos> -And soon the whole town will, too?
He said he had a sexy dream about me.<eos> He made me feel young.<eos> He took me into his bedroom, and... I had no idea he was filming.<eos> Does Maya know about this?<eos> No, but she will.
Maybe I should postpone the mission, stay here with him.<eos> Ezra will be fine.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> (SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.<eos> We will.
My weight. And now you're telling me after all this time that it's not me at all, it's this stupid tumor that's making me hungry when I'm not even hungry?<eos> It's simple.<eos> I want this thing out of me.<eos> And if you can't do it, I will find another hospital<eos> - that will.
Got him!<eos> - I told you I'd fall.<eos> - You fell because you knew you could.<eos> What if you're endangered and we aren't there? Next time, we'll climb sans the safety line.<eos> We'll?
Good.<eos> Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> No one else knows what happened to him. No one knows he's dead.<eos> If we all tell them, they'll believe us.<eos> No, they won't.
- I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Here, look.<eos> bed linen, towel, everything you need.<eos> You hear?<eos> I don't know if the mattress will fit here.<eos> Of course it will.
You left the boy there?<eos> -I did, Val. How was I going to study, do the exam? Would I bring the boy with me?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you won't bring the boy?<eos> Yes, I will.
But I do.<eos> And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will. Very soon.
Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will. Right now.
- Is 10 bucks enough?<eos> - No, it's on me.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> - Have a nice night.<eos> - I will.
What do you have to say about that?<eos> You better leave before I lose my respect for you<eos> And punch you in the face<eos> Oh but you will regret this!<eos> You both will!
I just had a contentious phone call with U.S. Attorney Sandoval.<eos> Her office was alerted by TSA about your brother's flight.<eos> She asked that we hand him over.<eos> I mean, you said that I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> Well, you won't -- just yet.
Wichita is beautiful.<eos> And wholesome.<eos> And not the city and not Cos Cob.<eos> And you'll have a plane to use at your disposal.<eos> We will.
We need something to begin.<eos> And I have just the thing.<eos> An underground dance competition.<eos> I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.<eos> But someone here will.
A lot of money for a man on a salary.<eos> Not for one who works hard and saves judiciously.<eos> If you have any further questions, you can refer them to my attorney.<eos> You have one?<eos> I will soon.
TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.<eos> It's TV, it's comfort.<eos> It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.<eos> And it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with Levar Burton and never come back.<eos> Because eventually, it all will.
Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
I love her.<eos> You can't have a relationship with Miss Calthorpe.<eos> You are her employer.<eos> - I don't care that she's staff.<eos> - Other people will.
That's...<eos> It-it-it's not fair... to AnnaBeth or George.<eos> Not to mention, it's just plain craziness.<eos> It won't work.<eos> It will!
Who are you protecting right now?<eos> You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
- No, no.<eos> 60 enough?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Yeah, I sure will. Ooh!
I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.<eos> But if it did, she would.<eos> But it won't.
Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
I never should've called you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin. We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.
I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
You are poison.<eos> You put her in Ra's al Ghul's gunsights.<eos> You had her kill Sara.<eos> Thea knows nothing about Sara.<eos> And she never will.
Why would anyone want to undo a nuclear meltdown?<eos> Not undo, sir... contain.<eos> Imagine this possibility.<eos> Somehow, through technology we're not yet familiar with, you're able to contain...<eos> trap, if you will... the energy of that meltdown.
If anyone can do it, it's me.<eos> She's scared and alone and doesn't know how to control her powers.<eos> I was that girl.<eos> Will you be careful?<eos> I will.
I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
I do that to guys.<eos> You noticed me two years ago.<eos> Two years, right?<eos> You can't forget me.<eos> You never will.
Don't go!<eos> Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
Dead serious.<eos> We'll be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jamal, why you gotta be so dramatic?<eos> Look, I'll leave the keys on the table for you; you'll probably need 'em in the morning.<eos> I really won't.
We'll be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jamal, why you gotta be so dramatic?<eos> Look, I'll leave the keys on the table for you; you'll probably need 'em in the morning.<eos> I really won't.<eos> (quietly): Yeah, you will.
Yeah.<eos> You don't know one end of a turnip from another,<eos> Will Thornhill. Nah.<eos> I won't do it - not out there in that terrible wildness.<eos> I won't.
What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Hmm. Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.
Yes.<eos> In my dream, we were right there, right against these walls.<eos> You don't believe dreams come true.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> But in my hands, this one will.
We'll have the French fries, the jumbo shrimp cocktail, and... ?<eos> Um, do they have Mac and cheese?<eos> Well, the Mac and cheese is truffle Mac and cheese, buddy.<eos> You might not like it.<eos> I will.
Since Peyton invited me to go skiing with her family.<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Because she just asked me.<eos> All right, well, we'll talk about it later.<eos> No, we won't.
But, sweetheart, i could really use your support.<eos> No.<eos> Valentina --<eos> You do not have my blessing.<eos> And you never will.
I'm here to prove that miracles exist, because I'm a miracle of God. That's all.<eos> People have been impacted and touched today.<eos> People who today are going through the same reality as you have once.<eos> But I'm sure that you passed.<eos> They will too.
Of course you can.<eos> And anyway... no one except Jamaal Uncle cares what I do.<eos> Everyone just wants me to have a baby.<eos> Ya, so that will happen too.<eos> It won't...
Now, go upstairs, the pair of you!<eos> 'The war had ended long ago 'but our father still did not return to live with us.'<eos> Are you going to play that for your dad?<eos> If he likes.<eos> Course he will.
Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?<eos> Mm-hmm. That's why.<eos> All right.<eos> This boat..., you got the keys to it?<eos> No. Not yet, but I will.
What are you going to do after with these blood samples?<eos> Once we find the killer, we will destroy all the samples.<eos> Who's to say, in a few years, DNA fingerprinting won't be rubbished?<eos> Dr Jeffreys...<eos> Alec, will you...?
I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
- Yes, an accident I blame you for.<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> You want to be in this hospital alone?<eos> - Because they will kill you.<eos> - Either they will or you will.
America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.<eos> You name me one Republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every American who wants one and I will eat my hat.<eos> This isn't about dismantling government.<eos> It is about-- Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?<eos> Yeah, I will.
We love you, Angelique!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Now zip it.<eos> So, tonight, I'd like to do a reading of a new novel I'm working on.<eos> A sneak peek, if you will.
He knew about the 12 Monkeys.<eos> They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
I'm kidding.<eos> And that's a good instinct, actually.<eos> I mean, you saw a nice piece of business, you took advantage of it-- not bad.<eos> But you're gonna give it a rest, right?<eos> I will.
I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
We took them to a lab in the back of the van<eos> - before they turned.<eos> - Well then, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> If they don't know where they are,<eos> - neither will the Master.
They take blue paint and paint it.<eos> Okay, I got practice.<eos> I'm gonna park here in what was just my spot yesterday.<eos> Yes, sir, no problem, but do you have the handicapped placard?<eos> Uh, no, not yet, but I will.
Aw, I love you guys so much.<eos> I love you almost as much as I love heroin.<eos> Hey, will you folks be dining with us family style?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
He's free to take as many wives as he wants.<eos> Don't pretend it doesn't hurt, Mother.<eos> I know it does.<eos> He needs me, Ryder.<eos> And he always will.
I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
I've learned from a great Jedi too.<eos> Kanan.<eos> Mmm.<eos> You know, I don't think he likes me.<eos> Or ever will.
Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
Will somebody fight the pansy?<eos> Don't make me come down there.<eos> I know, I know, I'll calm down.<eos> You're right. I need some potassium.<eos> I will!
This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.<eos> If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.<eos> When we have a home again, I'm going to keep a picture of us.<eos> I'll be right with you, Max, you won't need pictures.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna fight your asses until I'm dead!<eos> You all right?<eos> You look...<eos> Don't ask.<eos> I won't either.
It's the answer.<eos> Do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Well done.<eos> Good job.<eos> I'm sorry, Nick.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
I just got a new car, and if you go to the dealer for...<eos> My Uncle worries you're not taking us seriously.<eos> No!<eos> You'll get the money!<eos> He will!
I thought you were calling a service.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> You should see how they've cleaned up the place.<eos> Well...<eos> You will.
They wanted me to put in a good word, you know?<eos> Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
"Life will out."<eos> The origins and lessons of life and evolution are long and complex, but what they basically boil down to is, life will out.<eos> Life will always find a way to continue.<eos> Always.<eos> Life... will... out.
Shake his hand!<eos> Shake his hand.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi.<eos> I'll sha... ke his hand...
– Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
Caroline Elizabeth Dawson.<eos> I call upon these persons here present to witness that I,<eos> Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, do take you, Katherine Abike Mackenzie, to be my lawfully wedded wife.<eos> Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, will you have this woman to be your wedded wife, to love her, to comfort her, to honour and keep her and forsaking all others, for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.

Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid.<eos> Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
This is a monastery in the Himalayas.<eos> I stayed there years ago... when I was lost, troubled.<eos> And the monks helped me in ways that proved to be very...<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> But maybe I will later on.
Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
Shivy!<eos> It Will fly!<eos> VVhich means I chose 'It won't fly'.<eos> Our airplane will never fly.<eos> It Will.
For we _BAR_ndians...you will have to fly.<eos> How, Khan Sir?<eos> This is all I have.<eos> Will the airplane fly with this?<eos> - It will.
We'll consider our Haj done.<eos> And if that's not enough, then take this too.<eos> We poor people have a big heart<eos> Will you fly your airplane now?<eos> - Of course he will.
- But it's not silver.<eos> It flows.. - But not water.<eos> The mixture of metal and chemical, mercury.<eos> Will our airplane fly now?<eos> No it won't.
All right, here you go.<eos> It's all the cash we got.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> You stay safe out there, you hear?<eos> I will.
The second it happened, I knew it, but I didn't know they were gonna do it.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will I ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
Probably not.<eos> You love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I love you too.<eos> I always will.
Dinner, tonight.<eos> Chez Moi. 8:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You will.
You'll be dead for everyone, including Blanca, your wife.<eos> You must be very powerful.<eos> These people love their executions.<eos> - it surprises me they'll cancel this one.<eos> - They won't.
Can you do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That won't be a problem.<eos> Have a good night, congresswoman.<eos> Oh, I will.
- We have to go. We can't wait.<eos> The planes are in position, the soldiers ready.<eos> How long can we hold our own against Russia?<eos> - Until we get help.<eos> - We won't!
Speaking of which, can we take a little walk?<eos> Got something to discuss.<eos> Sure.<eos> Remember, we don't know who to trust, so be careful.<eos> I will!
- Nothing.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Like we said, Lope de Vega is safe.<eos> But with his personality, I don't know if he'll make it to an old age.<eos> He will.
Yes.<eos> Statues of you across the empire, from Gaul to Egypt.<eos> Yes.<eos> We shall have one in this very room.<eos> We will.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Finishing what we started.<eos> Does that hurt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So will this.
That was a clear case for the Medal for Valor. Eh.<eos> Now, every time you put on the uniform and I see a space where a medal should be, or a commendation bar, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have regrets.<eos> I don't have regrets, Pop.<eos> Neither will Danny.
I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
Helen, what changed your mind?<eos> Your inspiring words and two vodkas.<eos> Poor Mamie Sue.<eos> She'll never know how freeing this is.<eos> Yes, she will.
Someone slipping in the shower is an accident.<eos> Felicia was thrown out a 20-story window.<eos> She fought back tough, didn't she?<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, the medical examiner will.
Nick was actually really nice to me.<eos> Surprisingly decent.<eos> Well, that seems like a story worth telling.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You will.
Well, you did everything you could.<eos> Did I?<eos> Due respect, this isn't horseshoes, ma'am.<eos> Izad Ahmadi is going to suffer, unimaginably.<eos> Yes, he will.
I want to be with Elena.<eos> And what did Stefan say?<eos> Do you honestly want to spend your last night as a single man debating my existential crisis?<eos> Damon, tell me you told your brother of 166 years that you're planning on becoming human.<eos> I will.
If they're alive, it won't be for long.<eos> The kinship still thinks that I'm a part of them, so why don't I head down to town hall, and see what I can find out.<eos> Okay, I'll go check out the other places the Resistance could be hiding.<eos> What if... somehow they know you're not one of them anymore?<eos> Hey, they won't.
Not long at all, providing you stop hovering and let me extract the DNA from this hair.<eos> That too tight for you?<eos> Wait, scratch that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You will later.
I, um...<eos> I went by the house.<eos> They told me.<eos> We don't know who did it.<eos> You probably never will.
Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too.
You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.<eos> It's almost funny, really, given the service I once performed for you.<eos> You know, Mr Bates and I have always wanted children?<eos> And you'll have some now, I'm sure.<eos> No, I won't.
Ok. What to drive, what to drive.<eos> Ah, my chariot awaits.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> What if she doesn't let me back there?<eos> She will, okay?
Which means...?<eos> Well, it means that like the Enterprise at the end of Voyage Home, I was able to reconstruct one of the bullets just enough to analyze it.<eos> But it doesn't matter, 'cause they're never gonna get a match in NIBIN anyway. You want to know why?<eos> As long as the answer doesn't include a Star Trek reference.<eos> Well, it won't now.
I will help you.'<eos> Shh, Ali, it's okay.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I love you, Charlie.<eos> And I always will.
Let's go. Come on.<eos> Mona?<eos> I have to know how the story ends.<eos> Hanna, be careful.<eos> We will.
You split with your husband.<eos> So, you can imagine something of what I'm feeling.<eos> I've known for a while.<eos> They have no idea.<eos> Well, they will now.
You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
Wait. You came back from Jewish camp?<eos> It'll feel so good to have Jeff back ... the real Jeff.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> I'll never forget you, alien Jeff!<eos> Actually, you will.
It's already gotten 10,000 views.<eos> I didn't put your name in it, but I did put your cell phone number.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
Say cheese.<eos> I posted it at 3:00am this morning.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
-I have my ride-along.<eos> -Tonight? You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
You should go.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> - Go!<eos> - I will!
Because they're fairy tales.<eos> So, good luck to you.<eos> 'Cause if you're coming after me, son, you're gonna need it.<eos> Well, may the best man win.<eos> Oh, I will.
- Like a flight attendant.<eos> - Oh, this is not over.<eos> Said the man walking away.<eos> You will not get the last word.<eos> Yes, I will.
I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
- Let's take it.<eos> - Peter, I'm 27 years old and I have a baby.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I understand but come on, let's party.<eos> Okay, okay, we will.
Uh, nothing.<eos> You should probably order something.<eos> - I'd recommend this...<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll...
Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
May I have a better look?<eos> Like an angel.<eos> No.<eos> Although I will have wings someday.<eos> Of course you will...
Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
This is all meant to be.<eos> And the fact that you followed me here, that we're in this together, that just confirms the fact that I am part of a grand plan.<eos> I see that now.<eos> I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You will.
Pretty. What is it?<eos> Oh, it's, uh... a diner where we had our first date.<eos> I had a painter friend of ours make it for Dana.<eos> I hope she likes it.<eos> She will.
Stop.<eos> You have too much of me.<eos> Now we'll both die.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Should I tell him about your situation?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?<eos> And you-- you be careful.<eos> I will.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> On one condition.<eos> Name it.<eos> None of the hacked documents see the light of day ever again.<eos> They won't.
I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...<eos> But I died with Lily's blood in my system...<eos> And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am... About everything.<eos> Maybe you never will.
The human whose name is written in this note shall die.<eos> If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. Once the victim's name, cause, or situation of death have been written in the Death Note, this death will still take place even if that Death Note or the part of the Note in which it has been written is destroyed, for example, burned into ashes, before the stated time of death.<eos> will still
Used to work for Tamir.<eos> He moved Kate out of Paris.<eos> If she was moved again, he probably helped.<eos> What if we never find her?<eos> We will.
Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, man.<eos> Please, man.<eos> I love you, Johnny.<eos> Always will, man.
I know.<eos> Check again there.<eos> Dimas...<eos> Boss, we did not find anything yet.<eos> But we will.
Brock...<eos> Brock...<eos> So, if she's doubling down on Brock, then I might as well be somewhere else.<eos> But, hey, you know, at least you and Roxie will have each other.<eos> Nah, no we won't.
I mean, I don't like it, but I support you.<eos> It's your decision.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I really hope you remember how awesome I've been today.<eos> I will.
- Good.<eos> Hauser, time's up.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> You will, hotshot.
Hauser, time's up.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> You will, hotshot.<eos> You will.
-What?<eos> He must've lacerated another vessel.<eos> So we find... We find the vessel,<eos> He's got 100,000 miles of vessels.<eos> We'll never
I love her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
- No problem.<eos> Dave, you do that again, and you're gonna get a punch.<eos> Hit it, Walter. ♪ Mr. Boombastic ♪ ♪ What you want is some boombastic ♪<eos> No girl is gonna want to dance with you if you're doing that.<eos> Yeah, they will.
I mean, if you're lucky, he'll, uh, he'll drop the murder charge down to manslaughter since you're, you know, following the orders of a guy who's mentally unstable.<eos> You interfered with an operation sanctioned by the CIA.<eos> If you're CIA... how come nobody's come here to get you out?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> They will.
Do you really mean it?<eos> OK.<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> Won't you come in?<eos> No, I won't.
A supervisor signed off on false reports.<eos> Child Services is responsible for Keisha's death.<eos> The city has a Department of Investigation.<eos> If they decide something criminal has transpired...<eos> - Which they won't.
Hmm. Ever think... That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> But one day you won't.
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
Oops.<eos> I almost forgot ...<eos> I need to get the kids' lunch money.<eos> Mom's got to stop wearing her old Halloween costume.<eos> She won't.
Hey!<eos> Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
Mr. Coach.<eos> How could you gain 1.8 kilograms in one day?<eos> I drank too much water yesterday.<eos> People told me that if I lost more weight, I'd die.<eos> No, you won't.
Yes. I mean, sorry, Chief.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I apologize.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Wanna work or not?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Now!<eos> I'll work!<eos> Of course you will!
Heard from Sun-woo?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Always when we're busy...<eos> - Tell him to come now.<eos> - He won't.
-As to why?<eos> Minori and Tatsuya's relationship is making steady progress.<eos> And they made plans to see each other at their favorite places.<eos> -That's right, and we'll get to see that.<eos> -We will.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but if you're ever in the mood, I know a place that has great burritos.<eos> You just ruined my sister's wedding and you're asking me out on a date?<eos> Yes, I am. Can I call you?<eos> - Yeah, you better.<eos> - I will.
And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will. It will.
It's me, Raphaëlle.<eos> You must eat.<eos> No, sister. The journey would worsen your condition<eos> - and you might... - I'll die in the end.<eos> As will we all.
I think I'm going to be sick.<eos> Oh.<eos> If he wants money...<eos> why hasn't he contacted us?<eos> He will.
Do you know what happened to me?<eos> You were possessed by a berserker ghoul.<eos> Right, I said I owe you one. That doesn't mean I have to believe your stories about ghosts and magic.<eos> You know I don't believe that stuff.<eos> Well, maybe someday you will.
Stand up.<eos> Face to the wall.<eos> There is a bridge half an hour away.<eos> But if it goes wrong ...<eos> - It won't.
Why did he have to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - It just doesn't make sense.<eos> - I know.<eos> It never will.
I've got her, mate.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just wanted to see my son.<eos> You will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> But eventually you'll wanna, you know...<eos> Get your own place or something, right?<eos> I will?
You talking about Carl?<eos> Yeah,<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's not responding, to treatment.<eos> But he... he will, right?
But at our house we are the best.<eos> You know this.<eos> For me it's enough that you just consider it.<eos> Would you consider it?<eos> Yes, I will.
Kate, you're gonna have a wedding.<eos> And it's gonna be beautiful.<eos> Yeah, but I don't even have...<eos> I don't know if I'll ever...<eos> You will.
Don't let this goyishe punim fool you.<eos> I've got shpilkes in the finitin.<eos> Oy vey.<eos> This is not going to end well.<eos> Yes, it will.
You're not fine.<eos> You need some tea.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I still feel the pain.<eos> And you will.
So...<eos> I'm selling the house.<eos> I'm done with the house.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> - No, you won't.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll keep the details to myself, but it definitely reaffirmed his feelings for Elena, I.E. me. Heh.<eos> So, uh, it's only a matter of time.<eos> Sounds like you're going to get everything you want.<eos> Of course I will.
Are you as musical as your brother, Miss Gray?<eos> I'd be totally happy to sing, totally!<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen:<eos> Young Miss Gray desires to sing something for us!<eos> – You will not! - Why not?
Is everybody dead?<eos> They're gonna hear her.<eos> We shouldn't be out here.<eos> We'll find a safe place soon.<eos> We will.
He's so cute, right?<eos> When he's sleeping, he's perfect.<eos> I loved playing house with you today.<eos> I don't know if I'm ever gonna have that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
How long will we be blind?<eos> A day.<eos> We'll have no communications.<eos> We'll have no access to surveillance systems.<eos> But neither will our enemies.
I was trying to stay in shape in case I go back to dancing.<eos> Chorus like we talked about.<eos> I blew 50 bucks not going.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll try to make soccer tomorrow.<eos> I will, Molly.
You look lovely...<eos> Captain, I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> Even though I'm desperate to remain free. I shouldn't have manipulated your crewman.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No it won't.
He screamed, and he fell off of me, and... and that's when I ran.<eos> You have been amazing.<eos> He didn't break me.<eos> I want him to know that.<eos> He will.
I love you.<eos> Wait, are you moving to Hong Hong?<eos> I love you.<eos> - Will you get out of here?<eos> - Yes, yes, I will. (Laughs)
I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it.<eos> You can't keep me out of it, Dash.<eos> I helped you.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> And no one ever will.
I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it.<eos> You can't keep me out of it, Dash.<eos> I helped you.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> And no one ever will.
I'm talking about you latching on to people that got problems so you can feel better about yourself!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> You can leave now.<eos> You're right. I can.<eos> I will.
His people will care.<eos> How long until they figure out where he is?<eos> And what happens when they do?<eos> I mean, when they come looking for him?<eos> They will, Bellamy.
She'd have a much easier time trying to escape whilst out and about, no?<eos> The bottom line is that she has cashed in some big chips to be an active participant.<eos> Her preference is to work with you.<eos> If you don't take her...<eos> FBI will.
Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.
I fear you less than the people I work for.<eos> I know all about Ilaria.<eos> When they find you, they will force you to watch as they kill everyone you love.<eos> Not if I find them first.<eos> You will not.
Complete sense the whole time, And they want my child.<eos> Nobody is going to touch your baby.<eos> No, they're not gonna have my baby.<eos> No, I promise you.<eos> - They will not.
I don't know.<eos> Hanging out.<eos> Sounds fun.<eos> Wear your helmets.<eos> We will.
How you feeling?<eos> Uh... like crap.<eos> But you're going to be okay.<eos> Do they know who I am?<eos> They will.
Beechcraft, please identify.<eos> Guys.<eos> Really? I've totally, relatively cleaned up my act.<eos> So maybe keep that in mind when you're choosing godparents?<eos> I will, Archer.
The past is the past, Wallace.<eos> Yeah, 10, 20 years ago, I'd have told myself that too, but I've seen the pain I've caused.<eos> Two marriages, a stepson who barely wants anything to do with me.<eos> I got a lot of baggage, Donna, and I can't put you through that.<eos> I won't.
He knows.<eos> He can endure anything except betrayal, Charlie.<eos> If he knew, we'd be already dead.<eos> So he does not know.<eos> He never will.
They're really putting you through the wringer, aren't they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you seen Tim about that eye?<eos> He's home.<eos> Oh, yeah, I... I will.
Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.
Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.<eos> We will.
Do you understand?<eos> You understand, Mr. Tate?<eos> Yeah, got it.<eos> Be careful, Channing.<eos> Of course I will, sweetie.
So I've applied for a loan in the bank.<eos> What?<eos> Banks give loan for paying bribe.<eos> If we bribe the bank then why won't they give us a loan for paying bribe?<eos> Of course they will.
Yeah.<eos> Mimi.<eos> The good news is your head C.T. and all your other tests have come back clear.<eos> And the bad news is you still don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> We will.
Mary, the feast will be held there.<eos> Choose your place of honor.<eos> You are going to die.<eos> What they write about your execution won't matter.<eos> It will to my children.
Since then, I thought a lot about how I might die.<eos> Not one time did I ever consider killer fish.<eos> We're gonna make it through this.<eos> Kerri didn't, the old man on the boat didn't.<eos> But we will.
...with me...<eos> Boyd.<eos> ...right now.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, okay?
- Let's have a drink, man, toast our goodbye.<eos> - Well, I only drink with people that I like or I pretend to like, but I will indulge in one of these cigarettes.<eos> - Shit, I didn't even know you smoked.<eos> - Well, there's a lot of things you don't know about me, Darryl Crowe Jr.<eos> - And you never will.
I haven't been much fun to hang out with over the last year or so on account of all the asking you out and staring at you from point-blank range.<eos> Yeah, you were a real weirdo.<eos> Mm-hmm. But you're pretty cool now that you're in love with someone else.<eos> Have a nice dinner.<eos> Oh, we will.
We won't be able to have another.<eos> - Get rid of it! - What? What?<eos> - Get rid of it!<eos> Get rid of it now!<eos> - Okay, I'll...
Oh, my God.<eos> Look, it's crazy, it's ridiculous, it's, you know.<eos> I think we're both completely exhausted and I think we're both in need of some sleep and I think we should just forget tonight ever happened.<eos> All right.<eos> OK. We will.
Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.
Thanks for walking me home.<eos> I would have walked you home but I didn't want to.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> So, I'll meet you at the dance tonight?<eos> Yeah, you will.
You'd hang.<eos> Go to Lancaster.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> And I never will.
You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like.<eos> Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee.<eos> I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here.<eos> And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?<eos> You will not, no.
Then what?<eos> If the girl slaps you...<eos> Slap me.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - It won't?
Well, let me go for you.<eos> No, I want to go by myself.<eos> But just give me your list...<eos> No, mom!<eos> Will you...
Hey, guys, for a penis name, what do you think of Duncan?<eos> It's Scottish for "brown warrior."<eos> Listen, if you had any guts at all, you would try to fix this thing with Sabrina.<eos> But guess what?<eos> You won't.
He went to the boxing gym the second we got home.<eos> I think he needed some time for himself.<eos> Well, he and I are still gonna have a little talk about that stunt he pulled today.<eos> Feel free to tell him I said so.<eos> Okay, I will.
I know, but it's dangerous and Barbie is more experienced.<eos> Jim, the town's looking to you right now, okay?<eos> They need a leader, not a martyr.<eos> - If anything happens up there, then...<eos> - It won't.
It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut.<eos> So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.<eos> Will I lose my leg?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Victoria was more than a friend to me.<eos> She was a sister.<eos> Loyal and generous and wiser than she ever got credit for.<eos> I'll miss you forever, my darling.<eos> We all will.
And, elka, you could win an election!<eos> - You know what, Melanie is right.<eos> - She's beautiful too.<eos> Somebody else talk.<eos> - Okay, I will.
You chose to stay.<eos> So your priorities, they seem pretty clear to me.<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> - Hey, wait a minute if they charge you with something, they're gonna go through your records, and they are going to realize that you're not a member of the bar.<eos> No, they won't.
Catherine.<eos> He's low-life.<eos> He's scum.<eos> He'll get what's coming to him one day.<eos> He just will.
And Johnny's a fighter.<eos> Bobby may walk on self-defense.<eos> AL: Which is why we need to get him for the trainer.<eos> Carrie have enough?<eos> She will.
- Who?<eos> - Gabi!<eos> At least when Josh fires you, you can add pimp to your resume.<eos> - Why isn't she coming over here?<eos> - Oh, she will.
What's this?<eos> Should I know?<eos> Should I start talking to IA?<eos> I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service...<eos> We will after this.
But also, I think Collins was his creature and does his bidding without qualm or query.<eos> He can't be sure of that in the next one.<eos> Well, never having had a lady's maid, it's not a challenge I've had to tussle with.<eos> But you'll come on Thursday?<eos> I will.
You may also prove useful.<eos> Bring her.<eos> Your days are numbered, you cur!<eos> You shall live to regret that.<eos> Actually, no... ..you won't.
You can get me off from that?<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> You cooperate, Witness Protection is one phone call away.<eos> If I talk, everybody's gonna know it's coming from me.<eos> No, they won't.
Wandering.<eos> Can anybody verify that?<eos> You said I could see my father.<eos> That you, honey?<eos> And you will.
That way she'll always be a red.<eos> Scarlet.<eos> I like Scarlet.<eos> I'd love for your kids to meet her one day.<eos> They will, one day.
That's not necessary.<eos> But will the foreman please remain standing?<eos> Do you have an update for the court on this fine Saturday?<eos> Yes, Your Honor, I'm afraid we still haven't reached a verdict.<eos> And will you?
I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just didn't have the time.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
Nice?<eos> Johnny ... You live in the richest countries.<eos> - You can allow yourself to have feelings.<eos> What happens if you meet one ... you really fall for?<eos> Sorry, I'll just ...
- Oh, lord ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> It seems like these girls are doing a kind of blackmail.<eos> They filmed you while you were doing things that may be illegal in Norway.<eos> Wha will they?
I think you trade in black market fables.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> You have a much more genteel personality than your friend.<eos> It takes time... but he will soften... eventually.<eos> I will not.
Well, what do you want to do?<eos> Well, we're in Vegas.<eos> I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.<eos> What if we don't want to vomit?<eos> Oh, you will.
We have to alert the police...<eos> - Molly: He'll die if you wait.<eos> - EMT: Before we admit him to the hospital.<eos> Then he'll die.<eos> No, he won't.
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please.<eos> I will.
He's only fifteen.<eos> What are we going to do with him?<eos> We're going to help him.<eos> What if he doesn't want our help?<eos> He will.
You understand that Ray can't know that I'm connected to anything that might happen.<eos> He won't.<eos> And I look forward to having a very powerful friend in Washington.<eos> Of course, Ezra.<eos> You will.
-Thanks.<eos> -Don't forget my plants.<eos> -No.<eos> -Promise?<eos> -l won't.
Uh, yes.<eos> We're holding a Chinese spy that Beijing very much wants back.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Run it by the White House,<eos> - will you?
Put your faith in me.<eos> Give me a chance to guide you.<eos> The only way we can end this war and bring father back is through your markings.<eos> It's never gonna happen.<eos> Yes, it will.
Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
Put your faith in me.<eos> Give me a chance to guide you.<eos> The only way we can end this war and bring Father back is through your markings.<eos> It's never gonna happen.<eos> Yes, it will.
As you wish.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> Why?<eos> You'll need them.<eos> We both will.
You wouldn't do that, would you?<eos> Frank wouldn't do that.<eos> Stay there!<eos> Be seeing you, Frank.<eos> Yes, you will.
I wanted you to have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll need it for my new office.<eos> You got a job?<eos> - Not yet, but I will. - Oh.
- How long have you been out here?<eos> - We landed last week.<eos> - You seen any Germans yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - You will.
Then this is it?<eos> That whatever happens here, it'll be the end of it?<eos> ~ Seen any Germans yet?<eos> ~ Not yet.<eos> ~ You will.
I'm not conquering anything, marching into towns with flags.<eos> So what if... ~ What if it never ends?<eos> ~ Wars end. Yeah, but there's never been a war like this, has there?<eos> If there's never been a war like this, how do we know it will end?<eos> It will.
The last time I was here, it was with Mona.<eos> What'd you wish for?<eos> You're my first friend, Hanna.<eos> I wished for us to always stay close.<eos> We will.
Mr. Caze.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> You are my true love.<eos> - If your man comes in...<eos> - He won't.
Elena Williams...<eos> Ohh! Stefan Cooper, what are you doing?<eos> We've known each other for a very long time now, and you've always been my best friend.<eos> I have always loved you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> - Will you...
I'm not being funny, Rach, but this one's on you.<eos> All right.<eos> I just feel a bit of a dick.<eos> They'll love this down the pub.<eos> No, they won't.
Except without Amjad taking his cut.<eos> ~ And you never mentioned this.<eos> ~ I didn't want to worry you.<eos> ~ What if he finds out?<eos> ~ He won't.
Do you understand?<eos> I'm here and she's in the bath.<eos> I understand.<eos> - Good.<eos> - But will your wife?
You're the one who got me that shrimp salad burger.<eos> We were just talking about movies.<eos> About The Blair Witch Project!<eos> They'll figure it out!<eos> No, they won't.
How do you define nature?<eos> Definitions change, but numbers are perfect.<eos> Numbers don't lie.<eos> You really don't know anything, do you?<eos> We will.
Put my foot in my mouth big time.<eos> Just got a call from the commissioner.<eos> He wants to see me and my box down at One PP.<eos> Well, how about I'll talk to him.<eos> The hell you will.
Take a look.<eos> Closer.<eos> I saw them!<eos> Don't you want to catch the motherfuckers?<eos> Those I will.
I'm getting impatient, Nolan.<eos> We have a deadline.<eos> Were you able to get into her records?<eos> I was, but...<eos> You won't.
Keep coming after my father, and I will make things very uncomfortable for you in this city.<eos> And second:<eos> You don't know that that injunction is me.<eos> I don't have to know.<eos> Judge will.
Nothing.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Emma, we're not gonna break up when we get out of here.<eos> I mean, it could happen.<eos> No, it won't.
This is gonna be a great wedding.<eos> As you ready her for...<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't do this!<eos> I won't!
You still have time to be Ella's father.<eos> I was gone half her life.<eos> She's never gonna speak to me again.<eos> We know why you wrote "6 A.M."<eos> Now she will, too.
You live your life, and then it's gone.<eos> Nowt to be done about it, love.<eos> And after...<eos> Who will remember me?<eos> I will.
Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
None of my business?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But I have nothing to hide so I can tell you I've proposed again. And I wasn't turned down.<eos> Sorry, but the marriage won't happen.<eos> - It won't? - No.
Henry.<eos> I think it's time that you lived your life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If only I knew what that meant.<eos> You will.
It was... holy moly.<eos> Amazing.<eos> But with Kati, we know each other.<eos> Do not tell Paul about this.<eos> Okay, I won't. Why?
- Now run really fast!<eos> - Run , okay. Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> - Promise me not to use your right of withdrawal .<eos> - Okay, I won't.
You have any money here in the States?<eos> Of course!<eos> My offshore stuff is just a rainy day fund, margarita money.<eos> You should meet my accountant, he's a friggin' miracle man.<eos> Maybe I will.
She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.<eos> Choose another to go.<eos> No other.<eos> Sell her.<eos> I will not.
A funeral?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I mean, it would be good to have a drink with him, but... A funeral? After so long...<eos> You miss that train next time and I won't be waiting.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Ended up being what took her from us.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But today I remember the girl. Who wanted to take in as much life as she could.<eos> I love you to the moon and back, Vivian.<eos> I always will.
Give me that penfield. ♪ As we sit alone, I know someday we must go ♪<eos> ♪ Uh-huh ♪ well, what's her story?<eos> Schoolteacher. 25, no prior history.<eos> Have you found the aneurysm?<eos> I will.
- Yeah.<eos> Hey, is there, like, a village or pueblo soon?<eos> Why?<eos> You need a toilet?<eos> Not right this minute, but I probably will.
Mr. James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquis of Winchester.<eos> I'm reading it here.<eos> Well, that will render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.<eos> Don't you dare say a word.<eos> I won't.
- What do I want?<eos> I want you to get down.<eos> Right here. Trousers down.<eos> What?<eos> So you won't then?
- Yes.<eos> - After 10 years?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You can't do that!<eos> - I will.
Should be, they had a reason they just wanted to prevent You complete the circle of blood.<eos> Who said that they wanted to prevent this?<eos> When the blood circle is completed,<eos> The man in whose hands will be finds chronograph<eos> The authorities will indescribable.
Is Dean Martin going to be there?<eos> - It's... never mind.<eos> It was...<eos> - Sure.<eos> You will?
- You would make it 1000 times better.<eos> - You know it. - No.<eos> - The only question is when to take it.<eos> - the question is when to stop nagging.<eos> - I will of course not.
- Calm down?<eos> You're not the one facing the possibility of arrest and chemical treatments!<eos> Neither are you.<eos> No one else knows.<eos> No one else will.
This is good.<eos> This is really good.<eos> We just gotta find the mode of transport, the timing.<eos> - He doesn't have the business yet.<eos> - He will.
Well, if you must know, Jeff and Audrey don't want their baby to share a name with any of the, uh, delightful ladies I've jackhammered. Mm.<eos> - Ladies, indeed. - Yeah.<eos> And I'm thinking it shouldn't just be a list.<eos> We should take this opportunity to create a rich, detailed account of all my conquests.<eos> A sexual tapestry, if you will.
- Ladies, indeed. - Yeah.<eos> And I'm thinking it shouldn't just be a list.<eos> We should take this opportunity to create a rich, detailed account of all my conquests.<eos> A sexual tapestry, if you will.<eos> - I will not.
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
APARTMENT TO LET<eos> I'll leave the rental contract here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We'll need a kitchen cupboard.<eos> No, we won't
Selena, you need to get in your uniform right now.<eos> Well, out of all the spas in all the world, you guys got to walk into mine.<eos> And for good reason.<eos> The money from the stolen wire still hasn't turned up.<eos> Maybe it never will.
For those eight minutes, the footage was rock-steady.<eos> You put your camera on a tripod and you walked away.<eos> You left it running, knowing that that would give you an alibi.<eos> I mean, yeah, I used a tripod, but that doesn't prove I killed him.<eos> No, but the DNA on the murder weapon will.
Rumi writes, "there's a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled.<eos> There's a void in your soul, ready to be filled.<eos> You feel it, don't you?"<eos> Richie.<eos> You will.
Your contribution won't go unnoticed.<eos> You will be reinstated as deputy.<eos> You're going to make a career change. Do I make myself clear?<eos> What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
She deserves a bit of fun, but you're so off your face you don't care.<eos> Toni, you're off your nut, aren't you?<eos> You've got to help me. You supplied her?<eos> What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
And now the perfect tool for my vengeance is in front of us.<eos> I never planned on killing you, but I will make you share my pain, Kenobi.<eos> Satine...<eos> Remember, my dear Obi-Wan, I've loved you always.<eos> I always will.
And I'm betting that President Grant... he's gonna throw the switch on you himself.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna fry at the hands of President Grant.<eos> - Now... you talk to me...<eos> - I'll...
He'll figure it out.<eos> You won't have much time.<eos> Be careful, Peter.<eos> He can hurt you.<eos> I will.
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?<eos> I never would've done it.<eos> How could I have known?<eos> - I just want all this to go away.<eos> - It will.
About speaking to Lorraine. I overheard you on the phone.<eos> I'm paving a path.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Does your wife know she's getting a divorce?<eos> She will very soon.
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
She certainly can't expect me to live in a place with so many memories.<eos> Who co-signs on a house with a guy they know it's not gonna work out with?<eos> Well, she didn't know that.<eos> It never works out.<eos> It will with Rufus.
It's my work. What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
I'm not gonna need you to testify, Terry.<eos> No?<eos> They may be smug now, but they'll be banging down my door to make a deal time we're done.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - We will.
Mmm. It's nice.<eos> I ain't got no change.<eos> Laura! Laura!<eos> You are never gonna guess what I've just been doing.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> You gonna tell 'em?<eos> I mean, there's not much to tell.<eos> It's not like I'll be shooting up in an alley or anything.<eos> You won't?
People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic...<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.
Well, not always in har...<eos> - In harmony for all eternity.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Well, I wonder if I'd like it being that easy.<eos> The whole drama of dating, the "will-they-won't-they?"
It's a letter of recommendation.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I feel awful even asking.<eos> It's like I'm cheating on you, but the best Doctor Young could do is put me back in the temp pool until I get a new boss.<eos> And you will... someone great, all right?
- Um, she's fine.<eos> Why did you even ask me to see her?<eos> It's clear there's nothing wrong neurologically.<eos> With Dr. Cole gone, I-I guess I didn't wanna make any mistakes.<eos> You won't.
What do you expect me to say?<eos> That we'll keep this going while I'm gone.<eos> - I know it's not fair to ask you to wait for me-- - No, it isn't.<eos> I can't get involved with another soldier.<eos> I won't.
She's just trying to reassure herself...<eos> And that's what she's got me for.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be more careful.<eos> No, you won't.
They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
This expresses how loudly I love you!<eos> It's too loud.<eos> This is a ring taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the Gangster Patriarch of the Coors Dynasty, melted in a foundry run by mennonites.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. Yes, I will!
I'll make sure she does.<eos> So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own, Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think, You will know.<eos> We all will.
I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
Don't take it.<eos> - We'll be in federal lockup by Friday. - Well, nobody asked you, cracker.<eos> You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now. - it's empty. - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
What happened to my son?<eos> Cameron.<eos> Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> Are you gonna be the one to tell me what the hell's going on here?<eos> 'Cause no one else will.
Trick question.<eos> He doesn't have any allergies.<eos> If I eat peanuts, I'll die!<eos> That's right.<eos> He will.
Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right?<eos> - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
Oh my god, there's just too many of them!<eos> We're gonna need a bigger chopper.<eos> - I hope this bomb idea of yours works.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> It will.
I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me.<eos> I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
Don't suppose what?<eos> I could do with some help. I know you suspect me of trying to get you back into harness.<eos> But, well, it would leave a nurse free for other duties.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> I will.
Go on.<eos> - Daniel.<eos> - Tom!<eos> We know what you are.<eos> And after next week's full moon, so will the world.
I'm not talking about Scully!<eos> Now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.<eos> The study of sex is the study of the beginning of all life, and science holds the key.<eos> Yet we sit huddled in the dark like prudish cavemen, filled with shame and... and...guilt... when the truth is, nobody understands sex.<eos> And now nobody will.
I don't want to.<eos> Jeff!<eos> Can you please try to be helpful?<eos> All right.<eos> I will, okay?
It is too late.<eos> The seas are rising.<eos> No, you've already done that one.<eos> The people in the lowlands will drown.<eos> No, they won't.
You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now.<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
But you will have another.<eos> I know you will.<eos> We'll have another.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because you will.
- Why you looking at me?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I will not do that.<eos> You're going to do it.<eos> You will.
No.<eos> Tell me how I get out or Sookie dies.<eos> - Sookie, use your light.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> It will!
What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
I would not trust her unless she earns it.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Let's be careful out there.<eos> McGee.<eos> We will.
And you can come visit me if you want.<eos> Might even need you to do some of my homework.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Axl.<eos> I know, Brick.<eos> Everyone will.
In exchange, Manuel tells me everything I want to know about his mother's drug operation.<eos> Or we can give your client a little going-away fiesta.<eos> I'll even bring the piñata.<eos> He'll never talk about his mother.<eos> Oh, yes he will.
Their purpose is to delay the passing of the Ten Hour Bill, a bill that merely seeks to ensure that no child works more than ten hours a day.<eos> Our children know nothing but work and suffering from Monday morning to Saturday night.<eos> The cruelties inflicted upon them, the long hours they work, would disgrace a West Indian plantation!<eos> We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> Yes, we will...
The tassels are made out of their hair.<eos> The harness, their sinews.<eos> The very oil with which the wheels are greased is made of infants' blood!<eos> 'We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> ' 'Yes, we will, yes, we will! '
- Why not?<eos> I can't, that's all.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> - Hamza reckons you'll go to pieces.<eos> - I won't.
But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
Otto, please.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Go home.<eos> I don't want Kathleen to come to hospital.<eos> Then she won't.
You have a son.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have a son.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It will.
Yes.<eos> We have a son.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It will.<eos> One day it will.
Do as she says.<eos> You be a good boy.<eos> You're the man of the house now.<eos> Remember, your dad loves you.<eos> He always will.
I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
Regina: It's the type of job most high school kids get.<eos> Plus she got this one herself.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in<eos> - with Regina for good?<eos> - She won't.
That means a lot.<eos> You got a date in mind?<eos> How about August 8th?<eos> I know it sounds silly, but ever since I was a kid, I... always imagined something wonderful would happen on that day.<eos> Hmm. And now something will.
Th... then you'd be together.<eos> We missed you growing up, Emma, and it haunts us every day.<eos> And that's why we're here now.<eos> We don't want you to have to go through the same thing, too.<eos> And you won't.
You burned me back home.<eos> - How?<eos> - I'm here with you.<eos> - They don't know that.<eos> - Oh, they will.
I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
I'm cool.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Cool!<eos> With Tony busy unzapping employees, he probably wouldn't mind if I borrowed his lab for a few minutes and gave my spider tracers an tune-up.<eos> Of course he won't!
And I was around Patrick.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Thanks, but I need you to stay here.<eos> I will.
I'm in Ravenswood.<eos> But I'll call you later, okay?<eos> Aria?<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> Yeah, I will.
No need to call anyone.<eos> Maite what are you doing here?<eos> Cisneros, where have you been?<eos> To be opened in the disk before it explodes.<eos> Of course, sir, I will.
My club has been cut in half.<eos> I lose another body, my charter folds.<eos> Ain't my problem.<eos> Haven't heard anything about Clay.<eos> And you won't.
Okay, you know what,<eos> I'm not gonna let you shatter the glass that I spent years blowing.<eos> And I'm certainly not gonna let the likes of you tell me who I can and cannot blow.<eos> He's not gonna come.<eos> He will.
A little late.<eos> I believe I'm right on time, Michael.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
We don't need that much.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> It's actually good-- we don't need hardly as much.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> I will.
I want to go first!<eos> Me!<eos> Yes.<eos> Father Christmas will come and see Freddie.<eos> Yes, he will.
No!<eos> It's like I'm not really here.<eos> I can't even feel things with my hands properly.<eos> None of it makes sense, Andrew.<eos> Never will, will it?
I wanted you to know.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> Guess it don't make much difference now.<eos> It does to me.<eos> It will to this unborn.
My big brother, so you doubt my intentions.<eos> Well, I can't say I'm surprised.<eos> Standing beside the noble Elijah, how can I be anything but the lesser brother... a liar, a manipulator, a bastard?<eos> That's all I am to you, isn't it, and to Rebekah, and judging by the way Hayley hangs on your every word, it's clear she feels the same way.<eos> No doubt, my child will, as well.
- See you tomorrow, Luke.<eos> - Not if I see you first.<eos> There it is.<eos> There's that smile.<eos> but they will.
If I wanted to kill Benjamin Marx, I would have done it the first time.<eos> He was a sociopath that stole from widows and orphans, and he got what he deserved.<eos> But I didn't do it.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
And maybe, just maybe,<eos> I'll leave a way open for you.<eos> But you've only got one shot, so you better have a good plan.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
There will always be a part of me that is defined by this character, defined by this show,<eos> - and nothing can make me more proud.<eos> - Oh, look, they're starting.<eos> I'll never have a relationship with another actor the way I do with John Krasinski.<eos> - I just won't.
After all these years. Y-you--<eos> You really think you've got him?<eos> I do.<eos> I'll know the second you have something concrete.<eos> You will, sir.
Yeah.<eos> Which reminds me... a cabin on Lake Carroll, two days pulling large-mouth out of crystal clear water.<eos> Oh, man, they're going to love that.<eos> So will you.<eos> Yes, I will.
♪ No, no, no it's still catching.<eos> It still feels tight. - It can happen with scar tissue.<eos> - I feel like...<eos> - I feel like I'm never gonna heal.<eos> - Hopefully, you will.
I hope I never have to take you up on it.<eos> Natalia.<eos> Did anyone see you come in here? No.<eos> They never do.<eos> They never will.
But if you go trying to look for him, you both become targets again.<eos> You once told me to follow my heart.<eos> That's what I'm gonna go do.<eos> Just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
Oh, my God!<eos> People are gonna be so mad at me.<eos> I'm gonna have to find a therapist.<eos> Oh, geez, I hope I like my therapist.<eos> You definitely won't.
I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
-Father, I only have helped her hide.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Okay, yeah, she's pretty, but... nothing happened.<eos> But someday it will happen.<eos> It will.
You want to be recognized... for your gift.<eos> And who is more recognizable than them?<eos> I was given this power for a reason.<eos> - I just want people to see what I can do.<eos> - They will.
Or every time we got on the subway.<eos> Actually, Pop invented it.<eos> He used to do the same thing to me.<eos> But we actually never had to use it.<eos> And please God, we never will again.
Sean.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What's the point?<eos> I'll never need to know this in real life.<eos> Yes, you will.
Right, the city's huge, the buildings are huge.<eos> And everywhere you look, it's, like, there's all these beautiful people who seem to have just come from some secret meeting where they teach you how to make it in the big city.<eos> What if I don't get in?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You will.
- You suck!<eos> Could you... do you have a mic I could take?<eos> No, you need to turn around.<eos> If you don't get back on the stage now,<eos> - you never will again.
It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> So what now?<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No.<eos> He never will.
Why don't you wait a year, okay?<eos> Move into the dorms.<eos> I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.<eos> And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won't say a word.<eos> Yes, you will.
Have you sold it?<eos> -No... -Have you hidden it?<eos> Where is it? Where!<eos> -I don't know...<eos> You will.
Mr Dudley, sir, with your permission, sir,<eos> I would like to be taken off the watch counter.<eos> But the watches are our best-selling item.<eos> You're working wonders.<eos> But still, if you will, sir.
I'm good at what I do.<eos> The best at my own job.<eos> But something like this takes an entrepreneur.<eos> I just want to see the look on John's face when I tell him we have a way out.<eos> And you will, Denise.
The best at my own job.<eos> But something like this takes an entrepreneur.<eos> I just want to see the look on John's face when I tell him we have a way out.<eos> And you will, Denise.<eos> You will.
Previously on "Betrayal"...<eos> - I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> - It won't.
Yes or no, Mrs. Campbell?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did your husband know that you gave these orders?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> But he will now.
When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
No, I killed them.<eos> Now let's start carrying the sun towards earth.<eos> Go go!<eos> - We're not gonna make it in time.<eos> - Yes we will.
The pain just disappeared.<eos> - I guess I'm all good now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, come back if it returns.<eos> I will.
You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
- I don't care how much money it is.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> - Will you at least watch our movie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
Going to camo-mode.<eos> Automated male voice: Cloaking device activated.<eos> Hulk: Ugh, you and your big ideas.<eos> (hulk sighs) this ain't gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
I think that's probably true, but you're still left with an invalid will.<eos> Anything further, Counselor?<eos> Actually, Your Honor, uh, just one brief thought.<eos> If you'll indulge me.<eos> I will.
Oh, of course! Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am very pleased you decided to help us.<eos> Don't hesitate to call when you find something.<eos> I won't.
Stay and take care of my daughter<eos> Master Liu, I will marry Xu and take care of her for the rest of her life But I must also go to Washicheng, I don't want any regrets<eos> You don't have any combat experience<eos> Once we arrive at Washicheng stay close behind me<eos> I will, Master Liu
OK.<eos> - Hey, El?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Have a good first day.<eos> I Will.
Absolutely not.<eos> Please let me do this. Why?<eos> - Because I need to.<eos> - We're gonna pay you back.<eos> No, you won't.
Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you. They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until... Until the hearing.<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
150 redoubts.<eos> 600 pieces of artillery.<eos> There's not even the eye of a needle for the French to get through.<eos> What if they do?<eos> They won't.
I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
Ending Johnny Ducks.<eos> Frank...<eos> I get it.<eos> Johnny's your brother, you don't want to give up where he's hiding.<eos> But you will.
Or you go to war with the Russians... and me.<eos> Coffee.<eos> It didn't work. I'm an alternate.<eos> Didn't get on the jury.<eos> You will tomorrow.
Andrew said Martin Moxon was married, that he and his wife were having troubles.<eos> I thought that maybe I would call her, and try to connect.<eos> If her husband was upset enough to kill himself, she must have some idea why.<eos> Okay, just be careful.<eos> I will.
But what will I do in the lifetime he isn't there?<eos> If that's so, then he will come to you in every lifetime.<eos> I pray too Lord for boon that from today Rajdutt and you will be inseparable.<eos> Without him, you won't exist.<eos> And without you, he won't.
Yes. 100% sure.<eos> All right, well, based on your hunch, we have to question Tina again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> I will.
Sir, all across this city, workers are being denied their rights.<eos> Even now, honest working men and women are being locked out on a whim.<eos> Denied the basic sustenance of life, because they demand the right to representation.<eos> And you fear the same may happen here?<eos> Will it?
No, YOU said we'd think about it.<eos> I said we'd get on with our lives.<eos> But you're the woman I want to be my wife.<eos> But I don't want that!<eos> But you will.
Well, you do.<eos> And that's what you said the last time and the time before that.<eos> You know, Jane, you've been doing this a lot lately.<eos> You come and go and stay out late and I never really know who you're with or where you are.<eos> Uh-huh. I will.
He's the first completely successful human implant.<eos> It won't do you any good to cut him up.<eos> Then I'll just cut off the whole hand.<eos> That certainly won't work.<eos> (Mr. Pike) What will?
I don't wanna sleep.<eos> I wanna fuck.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Hey, please.<eos> Please, will you just...?
So Jesus became the sacrifice.<eos> Yes, he was ushering in the new covenant that his death would symbolize.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Not really.<eos> In time, you will.
You care so much for me.<eos> All right, you see...<eos> Normally, you wouldn't stand this close to me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I won't.
I wanted to give you guys something.<eos> Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So then, why won't you testify?<eos> It's not that I don't want to.<eos> It's that what I remember won't matter once they're through with me.<eos> But it will.
Who do we have?<eos> See the AK-47 on the wall?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The's are there in each house.<eos> This guard will here exact same weapon.
It's tuesday.<eos> [Bleep]<eos> Oh, Chris, look.<eos> These cakes show everything that's happened to us.<eos> And everything that ever will.
Listen, Ray, not only am I interested, but I have a vested interest in how you're dealing with Charlie's death, specifically as it pertains to how effective a leader you'll be.<eos> Not, you not moving into Charlie's empty office may be construed less as a show of respect and more as a sign that you don't feel like you deserve this promotion, and maybe you're struggling...<eos> I wanted you to talk to the cons, not me.<eos> I tried, per your directive;<eos> They won't.
Hiring Iris to...<eos> pleasure my plumbing.<eos> You know you care about me.<eos> Shut your yap!<eos> I will not!
So stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it.<eos> Because I haven't.<eos> Well, if I had the dream, I'm sorry to say it wasn't worth it.<eos> Then sitting here drinking won't end this pain.<eos> What will?
Listen, I got a lead on the money trail from Mark Gabriel's company to his hit squad via the Swiss bank account.<eos> So, you need to call me back so I can fill you in, all right?<eos> - Hey, Sara. - You seen Catherine?<eos> No.<eos> You probably won't for a few days.
Grandpa.<eos> See that Billy, that's an emerald on 14 carat gold.<eos> Think your sister would like that?<eos> She doesn't like jewelry, grandpa.<eos> She will one day.
Yeah, that's a fast ball right there.<eos> That's a real stroke of philosophic genius.<eos> War little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football and I don't know what else to say but so long sarcastaball, it was nice knowing you.<eos> Let's just hope nothing like this ever happens again.<eos> Probably won't.
A blight upon flesh.<eos> Forever mocking more noble intentions.<eos> Prove them.<eos> And live to see if you are of further use.<eos> Your will.
{RAME! }<eos> I will!<eos> {IKU IKU ICCHAU!<eos> }<eos> I will! {IKU! }
Are we gonna live here in secret forever?<eos> Not like we have a choice if our parents don't show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Your mom will definitely show up.<eos> She won't.
I don't want her losing you, too.<eos> I think that's why she's going so overboard on this nursery thing.<eos> She hopes it'll get Julie excited about the baby, maybe bring her back.<eos> You know, you're taking all my anger away, and that's not gonna leave me anything.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Nobody's going anywhere!<eos> Everyone is staying exactly as they are right here, right now, forever.<eos> The point is, she was a nice lady who looked good and died in her sleep and lived a long life and is in a pretty place and met Patton and made a hell of a cheesecake.<eos> And we'll miss her.<eos> We really will.
But you'll never do that, because you like feeling better than me... you always have.<eos> Or maybe you're just mad and resentful because somehow, some way, you always do mess things up, and I'm left to clean up the mess.<eos> And I am tired of always cleaning up after you.<eos> - Then don't!<eos> - I won't!
Stop why? !<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm ready to hang a sign-- "Bitch can see."<eos> She doesn't know that we know.<eos> She will in a minute.
Would you make sure he looks it over?<eos> - M-mo... - There they are!<eos> Bye, grandma Bonnie.<eos> Have a safe flight.<eos> Thanks, honey. I will.
I deleted the call from our records.<eos> And I'm leaving the only copy with you.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Reinsdorf.<eos> I trust your friend at the Times won't be running the story.<eos> No, he won't.
Uh, that's just a movie.<eos> Well, good luck over there.<eos> Keep your heads down.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We will.
Okay?<eos> We're gonna make it.<eos> We always do.<eos> But, Hal, what if we don't?<eos> We will.
Don't mention Tolstoy or math, it will just make you sad.<eos> Oh, and it really helps if you have a car and an income,<eos> - 'cause that guy's got nothin'.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And he never will.
Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.<eos> Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.<eos> Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.<eos> I had every educational advantage, Jack.<eos> Just like my children will.
- Just for today please<eos> Am I not looking good?<eos> You look beautiful<eos> Did you tell them about Sameer?<eos> I will
So the murder has nothing to do with Malthus?<eos> But the killer has Maggie.<eos> Probably.<eos> Please be careful here.<eos> I will.
Oh, the hell you were.<eos> We'll settle all of this tonight at dinner.<eos> He'll be here at 8:00.<eos> - Well, I won't be.<eos> - Of course you will.
I just slammed my door a little bit too hard, okay?<eos> - Okay. - Yeah.<eos> - She wants a guy.<eos> - She doesn't want a guy.<eos> She will.
God bless you.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> We could have brought your wife here.<eos> - You stay a while, Seher ?<eos> - Yes, I will .
Hey, you guys want to gamble?<eos> We were back on the ride.<eos> Great job, Maria!<eos> I could kiss you!<eos> But I won't.
I just have never understood the obsession with marriage as an end game.<eos> - It's a piece of paper. - I order Mr. Sorrento returned to Italy.<eos> I just thought that we had some kind of future together.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - Will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I... I will.
Put the pin back in the grenade, angry girl.<eos> I'm just answering your piece.<eos> The law say that I have to accommodate you to the best of my ability, so if you want to stay, go wash dishes.<eos> Will you, Regina Teresa Vasquez, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> - I will.
Why didn't you call me?<eos> I would've, but then he wouldn't be driving around with a GPS tracker in his backseat.<eos> You put your cell phone in his car?<eos> I trust your stay on our little island has allowed for reflection, that past mistakes won't be repeated.<eos> They won't, warden.
You'll need this.<eos> A girl has to take steps to protect herself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> I will.
So pause after the second line for applause from the live audience, which will tee up the at-home viewers for the follow-up on crime.<eos> Great. Love it.<eos> There'll be plenty of time to sell her fiscal platform afterwards.<eos> What if all this doesn't work?<eos> It will.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I wondered about getting a takeaway.<eos> Your mum says she's not started cooking, so -<eos> - I'll pay for it.<eos> - No, you won't.
I've been hearing that.<eos> Ralph: Name's Samantha Meade.<eos> She was found dead next to some motorcycle tracks.<eos> I got a man out there right now checking to see if those tracks match your tires.<eos> Which they will.
If they are on the outside of you, it's pulling you around, if they're in front of you, you just don't have the grip.<eos> That's when the entertainment value... goes up tremendously, because you're averaging over 190 miles an hour, with that many cars inches away from one another, and we'll be three or four wide through these corners.<eos> You go to Silverstone, you sit in a... stand on and you go, "meooooo."<eos> You wait one half minutes. See if the order has changed. Yes.<eos> But, most likely, it won't.
See.<eos> Venus is passing through your 11th House just now turning on your love light.<eos> You need to get your affairs in order.<eos> I'm not having an affairs.<eos> Well, you will soon.
Okay.<eos> Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.<eos> I don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.<eos> But it's important you know, no matter what, I always loved you.<eos> I always will.
I gotta say that's about the best Christmas present<eos> - I could have imagined.<eos> - You and me both.<eos> Have a good Christmas with your boy.<eos> We will.
Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Have a safe trip.<eos> I will.
Come on kid.<eos> Leave that, come inside.<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> I knew it that you'll come.<eos> - Of course I will.
You... have friends, and, you know, sometimes...<eos> Well, I-I can get in the way of... of all that.<eos> Of course, now if you need anything, just pick up the phone, and I'll stop everything, and I'll come right over.<eos> I love you, Adele.<eos> And I always will.
Wither wilt thou lead me?<eos> Speak.<eos> I'll go no further.<eos> Mark me.<eos> I will.
They're not nice.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> They're still my friends.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- Okay. Aylin is not the Aylin that just had spunk for days that I saw in callbacks.<eos> - Your family's very devout Muslim, aren't they?<eos> - Yeah. I'm not even allowed to use tampons, because my mom thinks, "oh, it takes away your virginity."<eos> - She doesn't know that I've kissed a guy before.<eos> She will now.
What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Hey, can you do me a favor? Yeah.<eos> If...<eos> Oh, I'll go to yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you...
No, I won't say it.<eos> Say it!<eos> Come on.<eos> - No. - I'm going to kill you.<eos> - I won't.
If this is it, then I want it all.<eos> Charlotte Mayfield, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. (Laughs)<eos> Yes, I will.
No, it's not.<eos> Well, then it's drizzling really hard, and it's only gonna get worse.<eos> We need to watch every penny.<eos> If anything else happens--<eos> It won't.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny.<eos> But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
I don't like it, Eric; I just don't.<eos> I got it covered.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> Okay, be careful.<eos> I will.
The guy who tried to sell me the tapes.<eos> I need to be certain.<eos> Positive. 100%.<eos> Your pal know you're on to him?<eos> No...but he will.
- They're looking at them now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We should know any minute.<eos> God, I hope they like them.<eos> They will.
This Massimo!<eos> I don't see you together.<eos> Actually, I've never seen you together.<eos> - When can I meet him?<eos> - You will.
You understand this has to be the last time.<eos> New York and I are done.<eos> I get it.<eos> Please watch out for Collins.<eos> I will.
Well, then, what are you doing here?<eos> My job.<eos> You can't just walk in like this.<eos> Does agent Hughes know about this?<eos> He will.
That could actually increase feelings of disappointment.<eos> Look... all right, you got to strap 'em on, take this like a cop, okay?<eos> Frankie, come on.<eos> You'll get your turn.<eos> No, I won't.
But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
What is that?<eos> The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...
The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...<eos> You will.
But to Berdyev it is nothing.<eos> He is a loader and a drunkard.<eos> Right, Berdyev?<eos> - Do you think he will come?<eos> - He will.
Let's have a drink.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> What a pity.<eos> I will.
You're untouched.<eos> Great, it's so nice to be able to give a patience good news for once.<eos> That lying bastard!<eos> I hope the dirty pig dies a slow painful death!<eos> He will.
But she had a future.<eos> She has been taken away from us by hatred.<eos> And that does make you want to hate.<eos> I don't know why she died.<eos> I probably never will.
Follow me to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety.<eos> This isn't, like, some creepy place under an off-ramp?<eos> Okay, we'll go to my second choice.<eos> Now you be careful with Bart's undies.<eos> We will, Mrs. Simpson.
Just take a minute to download.<eos> I haven't heard anything from the adoption agency.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Listen, it'll all work out.<eos> It will.
Door. - Oh, uh... - Wow.<eos> Just making sure that her tubes were connected right.<eos> I can assure you that they were.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> Oh, yes, it will.
We're no help to the family here, and if we leave, there will be 2 less mouths to feed.<eos> But ma will... Will thank us once we find El Dara.<eos> We'll bring back enough riches for all of us.<eos> But we don't even know where it is.<eos> Someone in thundera will.
All you have is the word of a few whacked out zombies.<eos> That's not even close to probable cause.<eos> Yeah, well, it's all I need to keep you here for 24 hours.<eos> And by then, I will have my proof.<eos> No, you won't.
Whatever you say... Boss.<eos> Why'd you have to make it so quick?<eos> It's better when they suffer.<eos> I don't get off on it like you do.<eos> You will.
I mean, of course you wouldn't know how to handle this.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I need to have the "talk" with him.<eos> You will have the talk with him.<eos> - Yes, I will.
- Turns out he has nothing prepared.<eos> Like, Adam, zero.<eos> He didn't write down a stinkin' thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will...
And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
you can't.<eos> I'll get us some food.<eos> They'll be looking for us, and someone might recognize you.<eos> I promised your mother that you would call her.<eos> I will.
What newlywed couple wouldn't appreciate the gift of a scan that says 'I love you.'<eos> I'll see you.<eos> You will indeed.<eos> It'll be OK, Larry.<eos> Really it will.
The stories we heard as kids, they were about lands plucked from the bottom of the ocean by a giant fish hook or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.<eos> Telling an islander they're going to die violently is just reminding us we're home.<eos> Shower's $10.<eos> Didn't ask.<eos> You will.
Why kill Gus?<eos> He had nothing to do with keeping that old guy locked up.<eos> I get the feeling that killing ain't too much of a stretch for this bunch.<eos> What if no help comes?<eos> It will.
Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family... I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
Love him by all means, but believe in me.<eos> There. Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
You're so stupid.<eos> Why do you hurt me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
San Luis Obispo.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> If your stuff fits in the back.<eos> It will.
It's supposed to speed up labor.<eos> Well, it's not working.<eos> Give it time, Roxy.<eos> You've never had twins before.<eos> And I never will again.

Chinatown is really a movie about justice not winning.<eos> Is that what you had come to believe?<eos> (Polanski) No, not at all.

It's just that I never actually thought about the reality of that, you know?<eos> Because I've been so happy.<eos> We have not been so happy.<eos> Look, the longer that we do this the harder it's gonna be when the inevitable eventually does come.<eos> Which it will.

She's prime rib.<eos> We show her the clothes, she hands us a check.<eos> It's just too...<eos> - It just has to go right.<eos> - It will.

It runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<eos> It's never been shut down.<eos> So how do they do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who will?

What I meant earlier was, it's possible that you're in the throes of a depression...<eos> What you said was dangerously offensive to a man of my constitution. Depressed?<eos> For fuck's sake?<eos> I think what I meant was, a depression by proxy.<eos> A pretend depression, if you will.
He's great and so's Ted.<eos> Oh, I think he popped it back into joint.<eos> You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.<eos> I can't miss this.<eos> I just... I won't.

The reason for my contacting you.<eos> I require your help.<eos> We worked together once before.<eos> - Doesn't mean I want to do it again.<eos> - You will.
We took you into our home.<eos> We loved you like our own son.<eos> I'll never know how much I broke your heart.<eos> -Yes, that's right.<eos> You never will.
One of Péidin's people buried in the Fifteen Shilling Plot!<eos> Clear out of here, you slovenly bitch or I'll tell you in front of the graveyard who you are.<eos> I raised your father since all he could get at home was potatoes and salted milk.<eos> You still haven't a cross as fine as Néra Sheéinin's!<eos> But I will, you slovenly bitch, a cross of island limestone.

Last Thanksgiving?<eos> It meant nothing.<eos> Believe me-- meaningless.<eos> Walker will have sex with anyone.<eos> I will.
I thought elkins and others had wiped them out.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> John: most vampire lore is crap. A cross won't repel them.<eos> Sunlight won't kill them<eos> And neither will a stake to the heart. But the bloodlust
I don't see a lot of 'cudas except on "Nash Bridges" reruns.<eos> Now let's see exactly how many are registered in Neptune.<eos> Exactly none.<eos> But you'll keep looking?<eos> I will.

Anything the moisture isn't sticking to.<eos> Footprints, handprints.<eos> When you see something, just circle it with the chalk.<eos> So if someone walked in here while it was humid, their footprints would appear under new moisture.<eos> The outlines will.
I was the one who could only manage 3 weeks a year.<eos> I'm afraid that I...<eos> I'm just afraid that I don't have a generous heart.<eos> I'm afraid that I won't have the chance that I had with Kirk ever again.<eos> You will.
I miss you too, sweetheart.<eos> Why did you have to leave me?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> And soon, neither will a lot of other innocent people.

I am not sure.<eos> Again, that gets into the kind of first lady you intend to be.<eos> Please, go on.<eos> Well, there's the activist model, with your own policy agenda and objectives in concert with the president's wishes but not dependent upon his staff for pursuit or implementation.<eos> - A separate power base, if you will.
Come on!<eos> Just for my sake!<eos> The world is too big for you to understand me.<eos> I can't give up what I want for others.<eos> I won't

Well, not...nots a secret.<eos> It's not.<eos> I have to be, uh...honest...about myself.<eos> I-I-I have to be able tell someone.<eos> You will in time, Booth.

Well, we're better when we're not vying for dominance in the same arena.<eos> I can't help it if I'm usually right.<eos> Does that mean you've closed the case on that girl in the fridge?<eos> I found some stress fractures on the wrist.<eos> Not much else. But I will.
Look, I know my rights. How long are you going to keep me here without charging me?<eos> Horatio, did we get a confession?<eos> To an altercation with Jojo, but not to murder.<eos> Yeah, a search of his possessions hasn't turned up any gun so far.<eos> And it probably won't.
Now, who are you gonna believe, a felon, or someone who catches them?<eos> I will believe the evidence.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> 'Cause last I checked, you didn't have any.<eos> But I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.

Gwen, he's crossing over.<eos> Wait until after I go, and when she thinks of all the things we did, it'll remind her that love is possible.<eos> Conor, don't...<eos> She'll find it again.<eos> I will.
Good, O'Malley.<eos> Really good.<eos> Now check for injuries and do a pericardiotomy.<eos> I'll need some lap pads, forceps, metzenbaums and satinsky clamps.<eos> Yes, you will.

We should look for him, McGee. Look for who?<eos> We've been calling you for the last hour, boss.<eos> Well, yeah, my ringer thing got turned off.<eos> You're never going to believe who's back in town.<eos> Ari. Maybe you will.

Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Black Water until the 24th.<eos> So it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?<eos> Tell that girl to quit worrying.<eos> I'm sure her brother's just fine.<eos> We will.

Gunn, I want you to sit tight for now.<eos> Never hurts to have muscle on deck.<eos> In the meantime, has to be a reason why the Beastmaster wanted Angelus.<eos> I'll piece together what I know. Things he said when he was in my head, everything.<eos> - Maybe something will...
- Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...<eos> - was good for one and a guest.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I knew society would never accept this.<eos> And they never will.
Well, you know what happens sometimes, trauma can affect our perception of the situation, and the bad guys come to count on that.<eos> That means he's going to get away?<eos> What it means, Ricky, is that he doesn't understand how evidence works.<eos> But you know what?<eos> He will.
Why Samson, what a lovely surprise!<eos> Good morning, Miss Jolene.<eos> I thought these might brighten your day.<eos> Why you sweet, darlin' man!<eos> They most surely will!
Don't tell them anything.<eos> Just stick to your cover story.<eos> The less they know about the future, the better.<eos> - What if they find out who I really am?<eos> - They won't.
I was dreaming about you.<eos> About us.<eos> The way we used to be.<eos> And I don't want that to change just because we're married and having a baby.<eos> It won't.
Okay, let's get you ready for the fair, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.<eos> Nothing fits anymore.<eos> If he keeps growing at this rate, we're gonna have to send him to college by next week.<eos> Well, he will in these.
Things will never be the same between Dawson and me.<eos> Or any of us, for that matter.<eos> You're gonna have to accept that.<eos> I don't.<eos> And I never will.
Then again, I could have been turned on by your vulgar display of authority.<eos> It's been lovely.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Oh, and just so you know, there will be other actresses. But I was the first, and don't you forget it.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Look, Mr. Martin, I know this is a very difficult time and you're angry but she's going to die and you need to think about what's best in the long run.<eos> She wants him to see her like that?<eos> She wants to say goodbye.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
- Did you tell him anything else?<eos> - No.<eos> Just Grover.<eos> - Look does Colin know that you...?<eos> - No. No and he won't.
I cut those myself so they could be adjusted either way.<eos> I mean, they could be adjusted smaller.<eos> Taller would be tougher once they're cut, but, if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.<eos> - I assume you'll have servers.<eos> - Yes, we will.
He should be in jail.<eos> Mrs. Baxter, does your son know that you're sick?<eos> I haven't told him.<eos> You understand that if he contacts you, you need to report it? I know.<eos> I will.
Because I promised!<eos> Who did you promise?<eos> It's okay, Robert.<eos> You had to tell. Christina will understand.<eos> No, she won't.
What are you talking about?<eos> This case was the ultimate test.<eos> And you passed with flying colors.<eos> But I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Open the damn things.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're to my family.<eos> Would you like to... search my apartment while you're at it?<eos> / I will.
Dr. Troy, don't worry.<eos> I'm not here to rekindle any of that ugly lawsuit business.<eos> I just came to schedule some light bottom lipo.<eos> I didn't approve that operation.<eos> Oh, but you will.
- Just give me the chance.<eos> The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.<eos> - Your own team, wow.<eos> - I just can't blow it.<eos> - You won't.
A lot of people won't work with him.<eos> It's a crucial slot. We can do better.<eos> I need this experiment to be successful. - So do you.<eos> - Then we need someone who can deliver.<eos> He will.
- Hard work.<eos> Intelligence.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - You'll catch whoever's doing this.<eos> - Or Mackey will.
And you ain't that gorilla from the zoo.<eos> Okay, you filthy booze-bags, it's 2 a.m. So, uh, who's the designated driver?<eos> It was Andy.<eos> No one's ever won Moe's drink-a-gallon-of-gin challenge.<eos> And no one ever will.
- Could be a disaster for us.<eos> - Or he's telling the truth.<eos> Offering his services to a country with which he has fallen in love.<eos> That's what we want to believe.<eos> Then, we will.
What are you doing here?<eos> Cindy's teaching me to surf. She says I'm a natural.<eos> 'Cause she's got the upper body strength for it.<eos> Nothing like yours.<eos> You will.
My first instinct was to kill you but that was letting you off too easy.<eos> I needed it to last...<eos> His confession.<eos> That'll never stand up in court.<eos> It will, Geoffrey.
Actually, it looked pretty good.<eos> Yay!<eos> You know what?<eos> We need a little bit bigger firewood.<eos> Bigger firewood? We will pretty soon.
There haven't been sexy nighties since 1974.<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, one survived and I own it. It's probably worth a fortune.<eos> I love you.<eos> Not as much as you will in a minute.
"Who will cry for the little boy?<eos> "A good boy he tried to be.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy? Who cries inside of me?"<eos> Who will cry for the little boy, Antwone?<eos> I will.
- Then let's hope that what everyone is waiting for will finally happen.<eos> - And what do you mean by that?<eos> - You know very well.<eos> People are surprised you haven't born him a child. - Oh.<eos> But I will, soon.
Nobody could get near her.<eos> Look, Bob, she's your girl.<eos> Do what you want with her.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> I will.
- But it hurts.<eos> - I know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You never will.
- He's committing suicide.<eos> - Oniy two ways he can go:<eos> Upriver or on the road through Mompós.<eos> If we know he's here, the guerrillas know.<eos> Or they will soon.
What are you saying?<eos> Ciaudio went to Washington to plant a bomb.<eos> I can't be a part of it anymore.<eos> They'll protect us, won't they?<eos> If they won't, I will.
It's, like, you finish high school, and then what?<eos> I'm supposed to be in New York City, selling out CBGB's.<eos> What the fuck are we still doing here?<eos> I just wanna make something happen with my music, you know?<eos> You will.
Can you hear him crying?<eos> You don't know what's like to be a mother!<eos> I'm the mother of two children that should be fed! Understand? !<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> And you never will.
But, dear Fairy!<eos> Dear Fairy, do you see what a nose I have?<eos> It's become so long, so very long!<eos> Everyone will laugh at me!<eos> They will!
Stay calm.<eos> You're making me nervous.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What if I keep dropping?<eos> You won't.
First, I'm going to write a book.<eos> It is going to sell a gazillion copies.<eos> I once heard you say that the only certainty when dealing with the paranormal is that nothing is certain.<eos> What if you spend three days in Rose Red and nothing happens?<eos> But it will.
- genetic lab. - Is Max there?<eos> Yeah,we were heading off to lunch .<eos> - Just you and him? - Yeah<eos> You sound awfully familiar.Do I know you?<eos> You will, Bitch!
Direct your first film.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not until we've kicked them out.<eos> And I haven't signed a contract.<eos> I never will.
Yeah.<eos> Trying to call your dad?<eos> .<eos> I can't.<eos> I will in a minute.
If you were in the attic with me you can corroborate that she was at the Tomb.<eos> - If I'm wrong and Diana's fine, then there's no harm done.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - What if the Skulls find out we went to the police?<eos> - They won't.
It'll be like the old days, knockin' off Angie's big shop for a bag of lollies.<eos> And we won't have to share it with Frank anymore.<eos> Will we, mate?<eos> Have you got my table six?<eos> No, we won't. Will we?
You went for it!<eos> If I talk, I'm dead.<eos> I'll never get to court.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The rocks won't either.
It's acting funny.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got to bring your times down.<eos> I'm not seeing Olympic swimming.<eos> And neither will Stanford.
It's immediately clear to me that the water's powers have been wasted on... unimaginative people like you.<eos> I intend to make this fountain of youth, as the simpletons would call it available to those who deserve it... for a price, of course.<eos> You'll die of old age before I'll take you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Then, perhaps Winifred will!
You can save your money for college.<eos> That is, if you want to go to college... because neither one of you have got the brains to win a scholarship.<eos> - Not even a football scholarship.<eos> - I'll get a football scholarship.<eos> Yeah, he will.
I'm tired of... Tired of pretending.<eos> Everything is...<eos> Everything is under control.<eos> Until the next atrocity comes along.<eos> And it will.
If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive... I need to know.<eos> You understand, don't you?<eos> Yes. I'll try to find out.<eos> See you Saturday.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Want the drumstick?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm full.<eos> - No, really, I can't.<eos> - No takers? Then I will.
Yeah.<eos> Um... I would, uh, like to dedicate this song, like I dedicated my book, to hip-hop.<eos> I used to love you.<eos> I still do.<eos> And always will.
Something was happening to her.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Please.<eos> I need to know.<eos> And you will.
He stood over him like his shadow.<eos> Then he accompanied him to Goat Place where the headquarters of the lottery were.<eos> I'll be damned!<eos> I've never seen the like!<eos> and you never will again!
Of course they're signals. They're subtle, that's all.<eos> Sure, like buying a place together.<eos> You can't fool me.<eos> -You won't leave her.<eos> -Yes I will.
And I don't think we should abandon the higher-ground idea, 'cause it was a good idea.<eos> And that was a rolling hills scout-about. And if we go on a mountain, like, crow's-nesting, like that mountain over there...<eos> Yeah, but... We know where the water is now. We could just go there, and then get water and then go on our mountain, the mountaintop scout-about, after we've gotten water.<eos> I think the mountain's a better idea because what if we go to the mating grounds and they see us and they get self-conscious, and then they don't mate?<eos> Then we'll just...
The secret of your ability to conceive life.<eos> My secret ?<eos> You really want to know ?<eos> Shall I show it to you right now ?<eos> You really will ?
A mother.<eos> Okay, then where is she?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take care of your family.<eos> I will.
So put on these shoes look good, and maybe you'll get adopted.<eos> Go on.<eos> All right, Murph.<eos> Guard these with your life, all right?<eos> I will.
- Mom! You can say, what you want, I do not hear back at all.<eos> You said yourself, that it come then.<eos> Do not you come out!<eos> You stay in there until you're feeling better.<eos> - I will not!
What?<eos> Have you....<eos> Did anybody....<eos> Has nothing been heard... about me?<eos> Not a word, and never will we.
What?<eos> Crispina?<eos> Crispina, what are you doing?<eos> - You'll never find St. Christopher.<eos> - I will!
Hinty's gonna drop a hot stack when he sees this.<eos> I should have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
Bon appetit mum, bon appetit dad.<eos> I have to see him, you can't stop me...<eos> Mum, don't, I'll do it myself<eos> Why don't you understand, it's my poor son...<eos> Sure, you will...
And I wonder why the kid doesn't want my Daniel.<eos> Of course she doesn't, when she licks her roommate's cunt!<eos> You know what, no normal woman would ever touch your Daniel!<eos> You, whore, you won't talk like that about my son!<eos> Yes I will, about our impotent moronic so.
Slow down.<eos> -Girl, don`t hit the gas like that!<eos> -You don`t understand.<eos> You really need to see this.<eos> I will.
He likes hearing gossip about the bank.<eos> I heard he's coming to Madrid next week for a lecture.<eos> Yeah, he mentioned that.<eos> -Will he call you?<eos> -I'm sure he will.
We're stuck here and it's cold... and to be honest<eos> I don't know how much longer I can keep my arm up<eos> I knew you wouldn't kill me<eos> It's not that I can't.<eos> I won't
No.<eos> First to get a kiss off Mom.<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> I won't!
Yes, but there's been a change of plan.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Bauer showed up here like I said he would.<eos> You have him.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I am your wife.<eos> Ex-wife, and you will tell me because the safety and security of this country is more important than your power plays.<eos> You know, despite everything that's happened, I love you.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - No, I always will.
You're still angry.<eos> Pain doesn't decompose when you bury it.<eos> And that is a Claire Otom-ism.<eos> Dr. Liston said I can come and visit whenever I want.<eos> -And will you?
We've got fleas.<eos> Let's give Andromeda a bath.<eos> You're taking us into their atmosphere?<eos> I'm guessing these parasites won't like it.<eos> Yeah, neither will we.
Record secure. Never takes me more than twice.<eos> Me?<eos> Maybe you should come over here and find out.<eos> Of course, if it takes you too long...<eos> - It won't.
What's wrong?<eos> I know I haven't been everything I should be.<eos> Everything Mom was.<eos> But I love you.<eos> I always will.
The underworld's in chaos.<eos> The Source is presumed dead, and Kurzon will attempt to fill that void.<eos> We must stop him, or you'll never reclaim the throne.<eos> - I don't want the throne.<eos> - You will.
Heavy.<eos> Focus.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - We don't even have the Grimoire.<eos> - We will.
I know Mr. Mellon. I wouldn't worry about it, okay?<eos> - You know Hugh?<eos> - I know Hugh and it's no problem.<eos> - I'll get in trouble.<eos> - You won't.
Why don't we call the terrorists and ask them could they pick another weekend more suited for you?<eos> Postpone the benefit, let's get out of here.<eos> I thought I'd never say this, but Larry's right.<eos> If we don't show up at the benefit,<eos> - what will people... - lf?
This much effort's beneath you. You said so yourself, didn't you?<eos> Oh, you can't hold the ultimatums of party Jen against me.<eos> I was wearing a wig. Feeling crazy. All right.<eos> Hey, tell you what. Bring Grams too.<eos> -Maybe I will.
I'm sorry, Rachel.<eos> - I'm so tired.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Don't cry for me.<eos> I won't.
It's gonna take me hours.<eos> I want to start a college fund.<eos> Well, you'll drop Rachel off in St. Louis in July. We can talk then.<eos> - I don't know if I'll be able to make that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
- Then what?<eos> - An organisation.<eos> The Federation.<eos> It doesn't exist for you, not yet.<eos> But it will?
I was just thinking about something.<eos> It's funny actually.<eos> Well it's not so much funny "ha ha" as...<eos> You see the thing is... I don't know whether or not you've ever had sex.<eos> And you never will.
Wish I could.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> That Aeryn links, right?<eos> Take care.<eos> I will.
- Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But it better not happen again.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
I will not be strong-armed by threats against my laundry.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I'm off to do a load of your pinks.<eos> - I don't have any pinks.<eos> - You will.
You got here just in time.<eos> I really have to go, buddy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> -Promise to call me when you land?<eos> -Of course I will.
Good.<eos> Pick out your favorites, and I'll try to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper.<eos> You're cute.<eos> - I can't possibly use all of those.<eos> - You won't.
You asked when you would receive your kingdom, my son.<eos> Before the clock strikes 12, before this All Hallows Eve ends the world will be yours.<eos> A castle, Mother.<eos> I must have my own castle.<eos> And so you will.
The same rush you get when a beautiful woman comes on to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's kind of the same, you know?<eos> It's like a game.<eos> "Will she?
He has limited financial means, no criminal record, and given the non-violent crime he's been charged with, I see no threat to the community.<eos> Your honor, Mr. Dilbert is the number-one suspect in the rape of a comatose patient.<eos> We believe this heightens the flight risk considerably.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't see an indictment on that charge.<eos> You will.
You've got to stop it, James.<eos> Everyone knows that Ginny Sharp likes to sunbathe in the nude and people are beginning to talk about your rambles along the bridle path.<eos> Yes, well she's such a gorgeous creature.<eos> Not the sort of woman I'd ever stand a chance with.<eos> And never will.
Go!<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I don't wanna die, please.<eos> - Please, I don't wanna die.<eos> JESSE: You won't.
I'm proud of her commitment to medicine.<eos> What about the women you've slept with?<eos> Your ex-wife, that med student, your ex-wife, the radiology nurse, your ex-wife...<eos> - Would you get off my ex-wife?<eos> - I will if you will.
- Lf they won't, the authorities will.<eos> You'll be sent to a foster home, to school.<eos> Someone will look after you.<eos> - Sun-Lee come back.<eos> I will.
You do?<eos> Yeah, you run the coffee place in town.<eos> Yeah, yeah, the Talon.<eos> I don't think I've seen you there.<eos> And you never will.
Stolen, wandered off, no one knows.<eos> And that was five years ago.<eos> Jack stayed close with this guy?<eos> We all have our Chet Collinses.<eos> You will, too.
It's a tough bargain because either way... their personal tragedy becomes film at 11.<eos> They're just doing their job.<eos> Yeah, after some ambitious reporter goes behind your back... with an exclusive that blows your case, you might feel a little differently.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, you will.
The guy was killed, right?<eos> A man survives a fall like this, on fire?<eos> It's not very likely.<eos> You got a body?<eos> We will, Agent Doggett.
Then why do it?<eos> I mean, why meet me?<eos> You can reach Mulder.<eos> He needs to know what I know, or he may have no future.<eos> Perhaps no one will.
Any problems, blow your whistles.<eos> Keep blowing until the rest of us can get to where you are.<eos> Sam's offered to help us look.<eos> One more thing... Someone has to stay here, just in case Daryl comes back while we're out looking for him.<eos> I will.
If he reads from it, it'll send him back.<eos> My vision showed what happened to that girl Fred.<eos> The portal works both ways.<eos> - And if it sends something here?<eos> - It won't.
No one knows how Darla got pregnant.<eos> There's a prophecy involving a vampire birth but the scroll it' s recorded on is missing.<eos> Do you have any idea how many groups and cults would kill to get their hands on this baby?<eos> - We gotta get it before anybody knows.<eos> - And we will.
The darkness was coming out of me.<eos> I didn't want you near it.<eos> The thing that comes out here is 10 times worse.<eos> I do this, you know I won't come back from it.<eos> Yes, you will.
including Dawn.<eos> Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> You'll die.<eos> We all will.
We found some of Paige's hair in your car.<eos> That's impossible, because she's never been in my car.<eos> Are you sure it was hers?<eos> Do you mean will it stand up in court?<eos> Yes, it will.
It doesn't matter what I know.<eos> My family died because I wasn't there to protect them.<eos> You tried to save your family but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire.<eos> Are you lying about that, too?<eos> I will.
I know her Achilles' heel.<eos> In her deepest heart, she never wanted to be a witch.<eos> Yet she feels an obligation to her powers.<eos> Yes, but you said her powers won't work in our illusion.<eos> They won't.
Three.<eos> - Anybody else want a piece of this?<eos> - It looks really bad.<eos> - I don't know if we'll make it to Leo.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Just meet me at 8:00 in front of the Mercer Hotel for dinner, okay?<eos> You were paying attention to my schedule.<eos> -Be careful out there.<eos> -l feel like I won't see you again.<eos> You will.
You were paying attention to my schedule.<eos> -Be careful out there.<eos> -l feel like I won't see you again.<eos> You will.<eos> -Yeah, I will.
- No, you're not.<eos> In fact, you're not on for the rest of the week.<eos> - Wait. Says who? - Says me.<eos> - Does Weaver know about this?<eos> - She will.
What he...<eos> What I saw in those final moments?<eos> Well don't be in such a hurry.<eos> You'll find out one day<eos> We all will.
You don't have to listen to that bozo.<eos> You know that I have a zillion other jobs waiting to be lined up.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, I will.
- You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, I will.<eos> So, you don't!<eos> - l will.
Well, I will.<eos> So, you don't!<eos> - l will.<eos> - God.<eos> I will.
- lsn't he?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You should come.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. I will.
Actually, I think I'll go and prep the detonator.<eos> Fry, why don't you take the helm.<eos> She's so great.<eos> I almost remember the thing I did to make her love me.<eos> But I never will.
- Put that down.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Otherwise you're going under it.<eos> - I won't fit.<eos> - Yes, you will.
That I know.<eos> But if you ever do want to talk about...<eos> I will, if I want to.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But I probably won't.
What can I do?<eos> The kid's a freak.<eos> I'm so sorry she's got you doing chores already.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You will.
Mob attack isn't unheard of. CABOT:<eos> Did the uniforms follow up on the suspect's complaint?<eos> They asked a few questions, and then they dropped it.<eos> Because they didn't buy it and neither do I.<eos> And more importantly, neither will a jury.
What else are you good?<eos> Many things<eos> Why do not you say something?<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> "Maybe I'll like "Maybe you like
All right. Look at that compact little body.<eos> All right.<eos> Bet she's a firecracker in the sack.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Yeah well, you will soon.
Ok. Maybe we should think about compromising a little.<eos> I mean, do you really need to have every single piece of memorabilia in the collage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do, and I will--we will-<eos> - Liz and I will.
- Don't worry.<eos> We're fine here.<eos> It's a universal feeling to want to be there for a good friend.<eos> So from now on, I'm going to stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.<eos> Dr Turk, if you will?
I just don't understand Francine's motivation.<eos> Why does she only go after the smart ones?<eos> That's like asking the square root of a million.<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> Someone will.
You're not going to be like this every day, though, right?<eos> This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one.<eos> Give it to one of his friends.<eos> I love you, David.<eos> I always will.
And then, after we did that... and I still wanted to talk to you?<eos> I knew that I never wanted to be without you.<eos> So... will you accept my ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Michael, I will.
I know what name you want to give him. It's okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother, who I miss every day.<eos> I love you, Philip.<eos> And I always will.
We should ask Tatyana.<eos> It's her name day, after all.<eos> Tanya?<eos> I don't think he'd want to come.<eos> No, he won't.
Oh, my, yes.<eos> His uniqueness is a perfect fit for the Little family.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Little, we try to discourage couples from adopting children outside their own species.<eos> It rarely works out.<eos> Well, it will in this case.
About being here with the bodyguards and everything.<eos> I don't suppose you've ever had anything like enemies.<eos> Well, I never went out for the cheerleading squad, and I never stole anyone's boyfriend that I know of.<eos> So no. I'd like to think not.<eos> You never will.
They are the ways of one world, Lady Bradley.<eos> One I am ashamed to call my own.<eos> You forget yourself, madam.<eos> Now ifyou'll excuse us.<eos> No, I will not.
It was odd to think that during the war we could be so totally at peace.<eos> There were nights when I wished those sirens would never end.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
It will, Parkis.<eos> It certainly will.<eos> Here, here, drink this.<eos> I dreamt we had a child.<eos> We will.
What'd you need the sheriff for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Maybe she doesn't want to be a part of this either.<eos> I told you, nothing's changed.<eos> - It will.
I can be if you want me to.<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I'm trying to tell you something important here.<eos> I'm not going to live forever.<eos> Yes, you will.
It cannot be.<eos> We have lived here for years.<eos> They are our friends...<eos> They won't allow this to happen.<eos> They won't.
Have you heard about the ruckus here?<eos> And now... I'm leaving, going home.<eos> Can you do me a favor?<eos> Will you say hello to your teacher?<eos> - Yes, I will.
2,000 wholesale?<eos> So make it 3,000.<eos> Fork it over!<eos> - Okay, I'll pay.<eos> - Damn right, you will!
I'm sorry, please, forgive me, Mr Twat.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a problem, could you come into my room?<eos> - No...<eos> - You won't?
Yes, of course, you must stop.<eos> I will enjoy my retirement.<eos> If any animal deserves to rest, it's you, Boxer.<eos> Here, try to drink some water.<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
Yes brother?<eos> "The keys, please."<eos> - Strip.<eos> - No!<eos> I won't!
I can't stand to see you get hurt.<eos> If you don't want to see me get hurt, take a deep breath, relax, and shut up.<eos> You're not helping anyone like this.<eos> I'll get over this, Eva.<eos> Of course you will.
Well, there are female narcs.<eos> Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those. No, I don 't mean a female.<eos> I mean just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.<eos> Sure. So you could positively know.<eos> And you will.
- I was terrible in that meeting.<eos> - We'll see what we can do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You'll call?<eos> - We will.
No.<eos> - No, it's not enough time.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> How am I supposed to go on with my life knowing what we had, what we could've had?<eos> You won't.
Yeah.<eos> Who's ever gonna want me like this?<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Who's ever gonna want me like this?<eos> Nobody will.
We'll do it.<eos> Now have a seat.<eos> Or not.<eos> - I don't have much time.<eos> - As you will.
How about our children?<eos> And you think I'm just gonna let you take them away from me?<eos> There's nothing you can do about it and you know it.<eos> We'll see what a lawyer has to say about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
I won't say that.<eos> - Won't?<eos> - No.<eos> I'll tell her your have a mole on your left ass cheek.<eos> - I will.
Good.<eos> Enough.<eos> I've had enough of this machine.<eos> You hold?<eos> You will.
It's all deserted.<eos> We're just confirming that.<eos> But say we do encounter activity.<eos> Miners, refugees of some sort?<eos> Well, we won't.
I found that it you.<eos> Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on.<eos> - It'll create more. - No.<eos> I've thought about all that.<eos> Yes, it will!
Because I would never want to share you.<eos> Regardless, I can't be a part of this. Or you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Me and you.<eos> Can Tommy join?<eos> No.<eos> Good. Because there's a part of me that feels like if anybody else found out about it, it'll stop being our thing, and I don't ever want it to stop being that.<eos> It never will.
Why?<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> Because I could.<eos> You know something went wrong but you don't know what.<eos> And you never will.
A hundred long years will pass here. On Earth, it's just a day.<eos> So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> You see, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went.<eos> Not that anyone will.
At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.<eos> None of them know a thing.<eos> They all get an F in Willow.<eos> But I want Oz to get an A. And oh, one of those gold stars.<eos> - He will.
I think I do.<eos> If I'd listened to my father instead of my... ..instead of him... ..my father would still be alive.<eos> The guilt for what has happened... ..is not yours.<eos> I have it, though.<eos> I always will.
She's the strongest.<eos> You must separate them.<eos> Together they're charmed, impenetrable.<eos> - But what if they don't want me?<eos> - Phoebe will.
- But why?<eos> Why do I have to?<eos> - Because no matter how big our house is, right now it's far too small for the two of us.<eos> - Well, just remember, Mitch. The door to this house is always open.<eos> - I will.
Kerry, maybe I don't want my fellowship to continue.<eos> Got a kid in Exam 4 with a pencil up his nose.<eos> - We need to discuss this.<eos> - All right.<eos> We will.
Haldol, to calm you down.<eos> I can't take that.<eos> It's not good for my baby.<eos> Coco, you don't have a baby.<eos> But I will, really.
Two hundred dollars!<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> -l don't want to lose $200.<eos> -We won't.
Listen, do you think<eos> Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.<eos> Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
Semicircle.<eos> I know we're doing this for all the right reasons, but deep down I can't help but feel like I'm betraying them.<eos> They'll never know I'm here.<eos> I know, but I do.<eos> And I always will.
I don't think you can call what I do deatomizing.<eos> Okay?<eos> I jump into a vortex, a wormhole that takes me through a tunnel that leads to another dimension, another world.<eos> Well, I'm sure we'd all like to see that, too, wouldn't we?<eos> Maybe you will, wise guy.

- How about the police?<eos> - We billed them for last night's dinner.<eos> Municipal sanitation.<eos> Do you have their account code?<eos> I will...in a minute.
-So you're handling the whole city yourself?<eos> During a crime spree?<eos> Not again.<eos> It gets worse every time he doesn't show.<eos> Then, this time, he will.
You see what this means?<eos> Resistance is possible.<eos> We have the weapons and the magic in hand.<eos> - We don't know the vaccine works.<eos> - It will.
I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
How'd you like a trip to Mount Olympus, courtesy of my fist?<eos> -Hello, Xena.<eos> -Hello, Meg.<eos> Oh, very well, I will play the part of the wetched lush Meg..., ...but I hardly think anyone will be fooled.<eos> Yes, they will.
You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> If the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
The 2nd classroom on the 2nd floor, you see?<eos> Just stay here.<eos> Your mother will be here any minute.<eos> And what if she doesn't come?<eos> She will.
My island.<eos> The smell of wet grass and the sea and the wind... always around me.<eos> Never leaves me... my friend, the wind.<eos> Father found out that Saulo comes to see me on the beach... But he never saw us.<eos> He never will.
I don't need it anymore<eos> My fingers are paralyzed<eos> And I've no daughter to pass it on to<eos> Please take it if you will<eos> Oh, I will
When she saw that well, she didn't hear the "Wedding March" anymore.<eos> She only heard their music that I could never learn to play.<eos> Dearly beloved, we have gathered together here in the sight of God and in the presence of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.<eos> Wilt thou, Noel, have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as ye both shall live?<eos> I will.
We leave in the morning.<eos> I'll be there for two months inseminating indigenous iguanas.<eos> I called all my friends.<eos> They couldn't believe it.<eos> Nor will mine.
- Thank you, brother.<eos> Will you kill him, Duncan?<eos> Can you kill him?<eos> If I have to.<eos> You will.
God, I hope so.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have to cut back my time at the magazine.<eos> I'll need to find someone.<eos> Yes, you will.
Did you ever have any qualms about raising children after you started trying? I mean, did you...<eos> Did you ever think that you might not be able to handle the responsibility?<eos> No, not once I decided I was ready.<eos> And I'll know that I'm ready for this how, exactly?<eos> You just will.
I am not your employee anymore.<eos> - I'm your partner.<eos> - Really?<eos> We may know you're really Lex Jr., but no one else does.<eos> And they won't.
You can love.<eos> - And you love her.<eos> - I do.<eos> I love her enough to know that she could never exist like this.<eos> But she will.
Why send me to a small town where something might happen?<eos> If this is more than rumors, it's a horrible crime.<eos> I can't imagine what I'd do if it happened to Jordan.<eos> But child abuse has always happened.<eos> Unfortunately, probably always will.
Broad Street Bill?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.<eos> And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?<eos> And you never will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.<eos> And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?<eos> And you never will.<eos> No one will.
Once a week.<eos> Brant's rule.<eos> You know I'm beginning to wonder about this place.<eos> Money, movie stars, so far I've not even seen one single starlet.<eos> For now you won't.
Towels.<eos> Okay let's talk about something else.<eos> The collapse of the economy on the Isle of Mann.<eos> Hilda, would you help me clear the table?<eos> - I will too.
But you people remember baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet but they grow up.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> Those gears down there really hurt.<eos> You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron, and I'll find you.<eos> No, you won't.
Let's go, boys.<eos> Those gears down there really hurt.<eos> You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron, and I'll find you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will. - Won't.
Any luck?<eos> They won't help.<eos> What? They warned me not to dig here.<eos> Look, if she's not down too far, we can find her.<eos> Oh, we will.
Yes... a high price, to be sure.<eos> But look what we're getting in return.<eos> The Alpha Quadrant itself.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Well, like I said, you're an idiot.<eos> On screen, Captain.<eos> General Martok, take a defensive position near the Defiant.<eos> They have to finish deploying those mines no matter the cost.<eos> And they will.
She'll get over it.<eos> Please, let's sit down.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
There's no choice.<eos> He's your father.<eos> I cannot change past mistakes but from this day forward I promise I will stand with you.<eos> - We'll see if you mean it.<eos> - Yes, we will.
I don't know.<eos> I was kinda lookin' forward to a little shuffleboard with the fellas.<eos> Then you are leaving?<eos> You will not be staying with me, then?<eos> No, I won't.
There's a weapon pointed at you right now.<eos> I'm sure at this range it wouldn't just hit you in the leg.<eos> If you so much as raise your arms off your armrest, I'II test that theory.<eos> What if you miss?<eos> I won't.
Or it's a clever story being proffered as a cover-up... ..for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.<eos> There is that possibility too.<eos> Let Markham take the polygraph.<eos> - And what if he passes?<eos> - He won't.
I... I thought you were dead.<eos> That's what they told us.<eos> That's what they wanted you to believe.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
Fifteen volunteers are standing by.<eos> They're ready when you are.<eos> At dawn, then.<eos> This had better work, Xena, or I'm going to lose a lot of my best people.<eos> It will.
- Good.<eos> Because if so much as one hair is missing from their heads--<eos> They don't have any heads.<eos> I can't believe these don't come in a lower heel.<eos> Oh, they will.
- But?<eos> - But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't want a repeat of the last test.<eos> We won't.
They're not kicking me out.<eos> You don't have the votes.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
I trusted you, and you failed me.<eos> My nephew and I have too much invested in this to allow these kinds of mistakes.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's right.<eos> It won't.
We need to find out who he is.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You don't care that somebody's been killed?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Of course not. Why would you?
Not just the people in our section, but the whole stadium, booing.<eos> He just ruined it for all of them.<eos> They just wanted to hit the ball.<eos> Why would he wanna do that job?<eos> Why would anyone?
- I want it without old Milt here creeping around in my head.<eos> I said every word.<eos> - Nom?<eos> - Should I use his private number?<eos> I would.
- I want it without old Milt here creeping around in my head.<eos> I said every word.<eos> - Nom?<eos> - Should I use his private number?<eos> I would.
I like it.<eos> - 10-4!<eos> - Play nice!<eos> My son would've loved this.<eos> Yes, he would.
First date or affair?<eos> - Definitely affair.<eos> - Hmm. Too much passion for a first date.<eos> Do you think I'd know if you were having an affair?<eos> Well, I would never.
But, um...<eos> Okay, um, let's say that there is someone who somehow managed to know when and where they were going to die.<eos> Would you want to know?<eos> That is a weird question.<eos> But would you?
If you will not help for my sake, would you do it for sweet Amelia?<eos> Quigley intends some foulness against her.<eos> Help me, Mrs. Wells.<eos> I see virtue in you and... if I have claimed otherwise in the past, it was a lie.<eos> On any other day I would.
No, I'm driving.<eos> Oh, shame.<eos> I'll just get mine then.<eos> Give us a shout if anyone wants one.<eos> I would.
- So we need to go find something.<eos> - You want a banana.<eos> Hypothetically, if we found a fish, could I...<eos> You could eat it.<eos> I wouldn't.
_ Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like some supper?<eos> Yeah, we would love some.<eos> I would!
This is a terrible idea.<eos> Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
Dr. Hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
It was good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for coming, man.<eos> Sure.<eos> I would...
The Canadians are considering prosecution.<eos> He's ready to make a statement implicating Birch.<eos> At Quantico, they call a case this straightforward...<eos> Nobody cares.<eos> Of course not. Why would they?
- Mm. - Really?<eos> - Don't be shy! - Mr. Jarvis, I really wouldn't do that if I...<eos> I shan't hurt you too badly.<eos> I really don't think you want to do that, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, would you...
You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> I bet she still has it.<eos> Ha ha. Yeah, she would.
Let's get her!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, you coming?<eos> Oh, I would.
Yeah.<eos> So if it all goes right... And you do it...<eos> How do you get away?<eos> It wouldn't matter.<eos> It would to me.
Life is so tough you can't make it into your own bunk?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> I heard that Alex told you how our garden grows.<eos> If you say a word, I'll end you.<eos> I would... never.
Except for fundamental behavioral change, but you can't buy that at the supermarket.<eos> They do smell nice.<eos> Hey, Dad, want to hear my solo?<eos> I added a few variations today.<eos> Of course I would.
Thanks.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why are we clapping?<eos> Who else would like to share?<eos> I would.
The Witness...<eos> He lied to you.<eos> No.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He wouldn't.
I wanted to hear your joke.<eos> You look good in your dress uniform.<eos> I don't think it's proper for me to say that... to a person who just received disciplinary measures in it, though.<eos> How did you know this was... a dress uniform?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
Well, my name's Marguerite Honeywell.<eos> I suffer from Marfan Syndrome.<eos> Wow. That name is really kind of a mouthful.<eos> Do you mind if I called you "Marfan"?<eos> Um... yes, actually, I would.
No, no, she hasn't decided yet.<eos> As soon as she does, I'll... I'll call you, okay?<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Helping Natalie with the baptism. Uh-huh. She wants you to do that?<eos> Course. Why wouldn't she?
What happened next?<eos> Where's the letter now then?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Why would I?
I get fucked...<eos> I'd consider it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, then...<eos> I would, too.
We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
I know what you're gonna say.<eos> You don't use paper or books or office supplies, but this is how I work.<eos> I can't change everything overnight.<eos> I was just heading to the break room, and I was gonna ask if you wanted me to pick you up a cup of coffee.<eos> Yes, I would.
Two years.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> 'Cause I'm going to an Al-Anon meeting.<eos> You want to come?<eos> - No, I would not.
Boys and their boy antics.<eos> What a tragic ending.<eos> But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder.<eos> I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him.<eos> Or why anyone would at all, for that matter.
I suffered an unfortunate series of embarrassing incidents.<eos> I just want a wine bath and to go to sleep.<eos> Listen up, Manny.<eos> Of course you want to run away from whatever happened back that party.<eos> Anybody would.
When Heikkinen came by, it felt like we were back in Helsinki.<eos> Dad said you're applying for a job here, so you don't really want to go back.<eos> Since you're so smart, can you tell me where your dad was last night?<eos> -Do you really want to know?<eos> -Of course, why wouldn't I?
That was a knife injury though, right?<eos> Spinal cord was cleanly severed.<eos> This is different.<eos> I mean, we won't know for sure how Billy's injury would respond.<eos> - Or if it would at all.
I do, because I haven't been able to stop thinking about what you said and how it applied to my own life.<eos> You spoke so beautifully and from your heart to someone who didn't come to listen.<eos> Words aren't usually my strong suit.<eos> Would you like to grab a bite?<eos> Hell, yes, he would.
If she's not into it, then I'm...<eos> Well, I don't know, but if she's not interested, she would say so.<eos> -She would?<eos> That's true.<eos> -She would.
I am so sorry.<eos> I was an idiot to trust Alice.<eos> No, no, I get it.<eos> You wanted to walk again.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
Uh, I like a lot about what she has to say.<eos> Would you vote for her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I might.<eos> Yeah. Probably would.
What is it?<eos> Maintenance records showing<eos> They replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains Within six weeks after the derailment.<eos> Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
I was approached only yesterday by a man named Cole, with a good offer.<eos> One that could clear all your debts.<eos> For all my shares?<eos> I got the impression he'd go even higher.<eos> Oh, he would.
I'm confused.<eos> Are you happy to hang out, or do you want to go on a date?<eos> (Laughs):<eos> No! I don't want to go on a date.<eos> No. I wouldn't... yes.
I made this for you, Charlie.<eos> For me? (Laughs) Wow, wow. That makes me know you love me like I love you.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - I'd love to help you.<eos> - Yes, you would.
I made a deal for Dodd.<eos> With what?<eos> The Gerhardts?<eos> No.<eos> They-- they-- they wouldn't.
Look, Tom knew what he was doing.<eos> So it stands to reason the equipment wasn't right.<eos> He'd watched me do it since he was a kid.<eos> Then why did the company say that the check had been done?<eos> (Sighs) They would, wouldn't they?
There's always a scam, Frank.<eos> All right, yes, I'm very good at sticking it to the man.<eos> But this woman, I don't wanna stick anything to her, except myself.<eos> She won't let me. Why would anybody wanna be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
Or... to provide an alibi!<eos> The car keys, did we find them?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> ~ It was important, you would've told me.<eos> ~ Of course I would.
- Hey.<eos> I still feel pretty bad about messing up.<eos> You know, that guy getting taken?<eos> Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.<eos> I would too.
That's... it was...<eos> Uh, uh, no, no, no.<eos> Wait. Did you just say "engaged"?<eos> Well, I mean... [laughing] Come on.<eos> I wouldn't...
Property manager said she was late on her rent and she was gonna sell her car, so, Vega, you check into her financials,<eos> I'll look into her phone records.<eos> Nothing for me?<eos> Do you have time?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
You and Francis, you've....<eos> We've what?<eos> He's shared a lot.<eos> Does that bother you?<eos> Why would it?
You're Backflip Microphone Guy.<eos> We've been watching your video all day.<eos> You showed her that?<eos> Well, I mean, it's a good video.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
People don't expect you to text back.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I would expect a text back.<eos> - I would also.
We don't need a big do, we don't know that many people!<eos> I thought you wanted a hog roast up at Sportsman's.<eos> Only cos we don't have silly money to chuck around!<eos> If we did, I'd splash out a bit more.<eos> ~ Would you?
I'm not.<eos> Why would you plant a bomb that would put your wife and child at risk?<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> So you either had a partner or-- you had nothing to do with the blast at the school.<eos> You wouldn't.
With drugs?<eos> Carlo's the one who put Ava up to stealing the Caddy.<eos> I know it.<eos> He's the one who wanted to sell it.<eos> I wouldn't...
This?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The "up" button.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Would you...
The "up" button.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Would you...<eos> Oh, in a heartbeat.<eos> Oh, yeah. You would?
Technically, it was me.<eos> Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great. - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
He'll be back.<eos> We don't need you to reassure us about our son, Inspector.<eos> Would you like to see the photograph of the girl, Mrs Birling?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
I guess not...<eos> Doesn't matter anymore.<eos> I'm going to meet my dad now, and everything will be fine.<eos> Aren't you overdoing it?<eos> Why would I?
Hey. There you are.<eos> Isn't this a cute baby?<eos> You know who'd love to pinch this little guy's cheeks?<eos> Pearl.<eos> Yes, she would. Yes, she would. Oh...
I know that you want this to be science-fiction, but we are not in space.<eos> No, but wouldn't you like it to be?<eos> Come on, you're a Sci-Fi geek.<eos> - Wouldn't you just love to go to Mars?<eos> - Of course I would.
All right.<eos> Ah. Ow. ~ Ah.<eos> How could I go to Paris?<eos> You wouldn't survive a week.<eos> No, I very probably wouldn't.
I couldn't kill anyone.<eos> And Disco Biscuit.<eos> I'd prefer it if you call me Duncan.<eos> ~ Why would you want to kill Stevie?<eos> ~ I wouldn't.
Inviting him for a chat with one of your most wanted criminals would be ludicrous.<eos> You'll need to abduct him.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Why on earth would...
I was afraid that something will happen.<eos> You must leave the resistance movement adults.<eos> It is dangerous.<eos> - Thomas would not like it.<eos> - Yes, it would ...
God, yeah.<eos> I'd forgotten that.<eos> Right, Liv, let's see if we can find some choccy biccies.<eos> Anyone want another cuppa?<eos> Grandpa would!
When the feds shuttered hasty's place I ran away.<eos> From paradise?<eos> From you.<eos> You miss me?<eos> No more than I would my eyes.
What do you want?<eos> Merely to help you be you.<eos> I know you find it hard to believe, but I hold no malice against you.<eos> And yet you would kill me 100 ways.<eos> As I would a savage untrained dog.
Sorry?<eos> He had a family.<eos> He's not a piece of meat.<eos> Ah, yes, of course... Would anyone like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, I would.
I believe I have the support of my whole team.<eos> But you had a personal relationship with Detective Flynn, correct?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> So, you wouldn't say she enjoys special consideration, even, uh, unintentionally?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I hate lying.<eos> You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> True.<eos> And Bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.
I'd value your advice.<eos> I've had a letter from the Royal Yorkshire Hospital, asking if I'd head the new Board of Charitable Donors.<eos> We'd be working alongside.<eos> Well, that's if I stay the almoner, once we've amalgamated.<eos> Of course you would.
I trust you'll be professional.<eos> Did you like the leftover venison I put in your omelet?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Would you go so far as to say it was deer-licious?<eos> No, I-I wouldn't.
If you died, would anyone care?<eos> Would they really care?<eos> Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day, but let's be honest.<eos> No one would give a shit.<eos> They wouldn't.
I should tell you, I've withdrawn from pre-selection.<eos> Please mother, spare me the lecture, to queen and country.<eos> George, what possible reason..?<eos> Has this to do with Sarah?<eos> Why on earth would it?
Just kiddin'.<eos> Hey, I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool.<eos> Summer.<eos> He knows my name!<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
- Just a bit.<eos> - Have you ever eaten cattle feed?<eos> - No!<eos> - Want to see me do it?<eos> - You would?
I will open the gate.<eos> What is happening, Elias?<eos> Open the gate.<eos> Heitor, I'm glad you came!<eos> Of course I would.
Mr. Elias asked to get a document, but left his drawer locked.<eos> Sir, because you are my friend, and found me on the booze, I will help you.<eos> This is the best drawer opener ever manufactured... by myself.<eos> Who would ever think, an ex robber would be working in a bank one day.<eos> Who would...
General Silva had a son.<eos> Born in February 1998.<eos> Nine months after the Posta massacre.<eos> That would make him roughly the same age as Gabriel.<eos> It would.
She looks familiar.<eos> Oh, no. I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her.<eos> Not that I wouldn't.
Wait.<eos> If I'm analyzing the black box and the CAN-Bus, what are you guys gonna do?<eos> We're going to Disneyland.<eos> You don't think they're really gonna go, do you?<eos> I would.
I mean, that's a military-grade weapon.<eos> We don't have time to requisition one.<eos> What if we had one?<eos> You guys are in the country, gathering intelligence.<eos> Why would...
I know.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He's the one you're protecting, right?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I wouldn't either.
I will go tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I don't trust Dave.<eos> His own father doesn't want to sleep there.<eos> Why would you?
That would be unfortunate.<eos> Has the president seen the battle plan report from Doroshevich?<eos> The president?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, why would he?
-She really wants to go to Blue Note.<eos> -She does.<eos> But in that situation, guys would think, "She wants to go with me."<eos> We would.<eos> -They would.
Someone I can rely on.<eos> Oh, if the two of you were on a deserted island?<eos> Yes, even if the environment changes...<eos> -Someone you can rely on.<eos> -...that person wouldn't.
I caught a case.<eos> You want me to come with?<eos> Do you want to come?<eos> On a hunt?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
How should I know?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> He told you, didn't he? - No.<eos> No.<eos> Why would he?
And my district patient numbers are spiralling wildly.<eos> I don't know how we're going to get through the next month.<eos> Unless we start home visits an hour earlier.<eos> No, he really wouldn't want me to do that.<eos> Who wouldn't?
She's fine company.<eos> Perhaps you could join us.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> Wouldn't we?<eos> We would.
The senator didn't bring it to Cybercom.<eos> He didn't bring it to anyone.<eos> The senator and his wife watched the video together, and afterwards, he went to the Capitol building as if nothing had happened.<eos> They don't know that you have the video. Mnh-mnh. Would you care to explain why it is that you're in possession of it?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Hey, Threepeat, how you doing?<eos> I know you wanted that Hong Kong office pretty bad.<eos> You know, it's okay.<eos> I mean, would I really wanna leave my friends and family, move to a strange country, work seven days a week, and have absolutely no social life?<eos> Of course I would.
She's not like that.<eos> - Frankie, looks are often deceiving.<eos> - Yeah, no kidding.<eos> - [Whispering] You have time for lunch?<eos> - I absolutely would.
- You told Emma about Hayley? - You're welcome.<eos> - What, you think you were doing me a favor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Emma's really upset. Why would you want to hurt her like that?<eos> Why would you?
Oh, thanks.<eos> Yeah, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna stop by your room when I checked in, but um...<eos> I didn't know if you'd want me to do that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
"How strong is your daughter?<eos> Strong enough to fight for her soul?"<eos> Did you say those words to Captain Frank Irving?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
Why? !<eos> - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
It's not waxy, you see?<eos> Right.<eos> Would it hold up in court?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> But it would in my sewing circle.
[man] My Français is a bit shit.<eos> What do you define yourself as?<eos> [John] Some people would say I'm a mercenary.<eos> [Gouby] You're a mercenary?<eos> [John] Some people would... some people wouldn't.
What?<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> I completely agree.<eos> So you don't know where it is?<eos> Why would I?
I'm just sorry I won't be able to stay.<eos> Why not?<eos> My visa application was denied.<eos> I see. Do you want to stay?<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
Yes, if we could get a copy of Thea's criminal record... Yes.<eos> Oh, sir!<eos> No harm done.<eos> Would you like me to start interviewing?<eos> If you would, Fidel.
No, I'm saying that you and I both agree that the file room minus one file is still the file room.<eos> Now, say you took another one out and then another.<eos> If the file room minus one file is still a file room, and you keep subtracting one at a time, you could end up with zero files--<eos> I'm saying, logically-- or even negative files,<eos> - and it would still--
Because none of this seems normal to me.<eos> You know, I have the best of both worlds, uh, being a father and an Agent.<eos> But why couldn't you tell me?<eos> Because you would have wanted to meet him.<eos> Hells yeah I would.
I'll say nothing. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... Did you see the baby's foot?<eos> It's a mark that pagans sometimes put on their newborns, to distinguish the baby in the eyes of their gods.<eos> Isabel must have put it there.<eos> Who knows of this tradition?<eos> Any pagan would.
Man, shut the fuck up, Doug!<eos> Hey, man, cut that part out, man.<eos> Since the idea of coming to Compton got your ass all shook up, man...<eos> No, no, no, Lukas, we would love to see what you are up to in the neighborhood.<eos> We-We would?
Hey, man, cut that part out, man.<eos> Since the idea of coming to Compton got your ass all shook up, man...<eos> No, no, no, Lukas, we would love to see what you are up to in the neighborhood.<eos> We-We would?<eos> Yes, we would.
- Outside your house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I like this plan.<eos> - Okay, what's going on?<eos> - Would you...
And I'm here to help you bring it back.<eos> But look at me.<eos> Would you wanna know how this happened to you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Heard how they found him yesterday too.<eos> The man's son shot himself in the head.<eos> If he had a few bad days, I think he gets a pass.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Any man would.
To trust each other when, really, we can't.<eos> We've fallen into something together.<eos> Okay, I pushed us into that, but I have no interest in anyone getting hurt.<eos> Not you, me, her, some grandmother of hers.<eos> Why would I?
- Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it.<eos> Hmm. Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
In my thigh.<eos> Thigh?<eos> That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
And again, on behalf of myself and the harbor inn and everybody at Pacific Coast Properties LLC, thank you so much for your understanding.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> Sure we're getting the most out of this?<eos> I feel like the kids might enjoy a dessert cart.<eos> Ooh, yes, they would.
That is an armor-piercing bullet.<eos> I mean, even I couldn't get my hands<eos> - on one of those if I wanted to. - Well, ballistics guys say that there's not a gun store within a thousand miles that would carry anything for this.<eos> Why does a prostitute need heavy ammo?<eos> She wouldn't.
I can't believe I wasn't at Kirsten's funeral.<eos> Catherine, you were poorly.<eos> You couldn't stand up.<eos> She'd be wondering why I wasn't there.<eos> Who would?
So why not moral character, too, despite allegedly having none myself, as you so chivalrously put it?<eos> No further questions.<eos> She's put us back in this!<eos> And yet, despite a clear financial gain to your own business, you would still prefer Upton not to have a zoo?<eos> I would.
As I understand it, you're our last best hope for the network to stay on the air.<eos> If I was a man with no choices, I'd kill myself.<eos> Well, I guess that means I have a choice, so...<eos> Would you like to talk about my intentions for the network?<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
Right.<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> This is the stuff that drove Charlie out of his mind.<eos> He'd appreciate that we're still doing it at his funeral.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
I wipe my feet, I move over to the desk, I lean in and attempt to take that tabard off.<eos> You pull back, twist round, and continue with admin.<eos> What?<eos> So, even...<eos> Even in your dream, I still would...
Oh, good Lord God.<eos> Anyway, you'd be more than welcome.<eos> Why would you invite me to your home?<eos> You want me to be honest?<eos> I would, yes.
- Botched display of his prowess.<eos> - Does he honestly think that Francis and I would agree to have our marriage annulled?<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> No.<eos> Even he wouldn't.
But why aren't we giving a proper dinner here?<eos> I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.<eos> Mrs Hughes would say we must move with the times.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
Mm. You beat us to it.<eos> We were, uh, just gonna come see you.<eos> Would you mind following us?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Yeah, well, why would Salter and Wilkerson
Emptied the pantry and filled it with bottles.<eos> The Nazi flag is flying over Paris and the thing she fears most is running out of perfume.<eos> How's that sweetheart of yours?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> Pretty thing like her, I wouldn't either.
- So you killed the bus?<eos> If I don't cure the disease, if I don't save the world, I have no value.<eos> - That's not how it works.<eos> - If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.<eos> Of course we would.
If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
He was paranoid about his work.<eos> And what was the project that he was involved in?<eos> He never told me, but he did let me know we were almost broke because of it.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, if anything should happen to him, that I wouldn't get the life-insurance money.<eos> The project would.
What we have to consider here is the matter of intent.<eos> Thank you, Mr Jarvis.<eos> Doctors and vicars, the only professions where you're at everyone's beck and call, even when you're attempting to have a night off.<eos> You wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> Neither would you.
Maybe it's a hologram or a big painting.<eos> Or a special effect.<eos> Maybe it's a completely different moon.<eos> But you would know.<eos> I would?
I'm not having that conversation over the phone.<eos> I just really think he wouldn't want you to go to his home.<eos> Why?<eos> Just trust me, okay?<eos> He wouldn't.
- Am I?<eos> I'd like to know you better.<eos> Is that strange to say?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I would.
I was calling to tell you I'm not going.<eos> Yeah? What's your excuse?<eos> I got a breakfast date.<eos> And you want to guess with who?<eos> - I really wouldn't.
Sir Henry Coverly... All I'll say is, he gets a large number of letters, written in a particular female hand.<eos> A Wainsbury postmark. I see.<eos> Some of them are scented.<eos> Now, I know Lady Jane must see those letters and she must know what they are.<eos> Any woman would.
This is a big none of your business.<eos> Stop snooping.<eos> Except, I mean, this is probably a present for me, so future Dana technically already owns this, and she wouldn't mind if I take a peek.<eos> Would you, future Dana?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Are you a cop, kitty cat?<eos> Is that what you are?<eos> Wouldn't tell you if I was, would I?<eos> No...<eos> You sure as fuck wouldn't.
Look, I got to bounce.<eos> Quick question, though.<eos> Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun?<eos> Why are you wasting my time with this?<eos> - Of course I would. Who wouldn't?
But you go through it...<eos> Because you have to.<eos> The house in Toronto, if there's anything you'd like to change...<eos> No.<eos> Why would I?
Well, now that we know Wu is A.R.G.U.S., maybe Lyla can get us a lead?<eos> If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing, Lyla's going to want it to stay that way.<eos> Then tell her to stop letting people get killed in my city.<eos> You really don't care about my marriage, do you?<eos> Well, I would...
You let them turn you into an honorary mobster.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> RYAN: Come on, man. How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
No.<eos> It's completely unconscious.<eos> In fact, the sufferer typically has no memory of the episode.<eos> So this would explain why Mary Thompson has no memory of the night her husband was murdered?<eos> - Yes, it would.
- ... Who was too drugged to know what was happening.<eos> - He brought Mrs. Thompson home, clasped her hand around the murder weapon, and then placed her in the room next door to her dead husband.<eos> Knowing she would still be there when he summoned a Constable the next day.<eos> It's a good theory, I would just like to hear what Mr. Wainwright has to say.<eos> Mm-hmm, as would I.
Well, look, either he is or he isn't.<eos> And if he isn't, he'll just laugh, surely.<eos> And if he is, well... it's not going to come as a surprise to him, is it?<eos> He knows whether or not he had a fling.<eos> Yeah, but he just wouldn't.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Baby Derek.<eos> We hope he turns out as brilliant as you.<eos> He'd better.
Really?<eos> What do you say then?<eos> I convince them the breakup was absolutely right.<eos> And if Kati had called?<eos> Yeah , then I probably wouldn't.
It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
Well, I, for one, love this lesson.<eos> I've got a song I want to sing to somebody.<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> Kurt, he's still sleeping. ♪ Would you like some tea?<eos> ♪ Yes, I would, but shh.
- What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Tatyana said that two other girls with the same mark have gone missing in the last two weeks.<eos> - They haven't turned up here.<eos> - No, they wouldn't.
SHUNSUKE OZAKI + WATO UNIVERSITY<eos> SHUNSUKE OZAKI:<eos> OUTSTANDING PLAYER<eos> To put it bluntly, did you have a sexual relationship?<eos> Why would we?
Or perhaps there's more to it.<eos> Such as?<eos> £1,000 in cash!<eos> They were having an affair.<eos> Why would they?
[squeaks] [laughs] Now, ain't this just perfection?<eos> I don't want to make you mad or anything, Murdoch, but that ain't the dog.<eos> I know, you idiot.<eos> It ain't even a little boy.<eos> - [muffled scream] - Would you-
What's that?<eos> I remember that case.<eos> That's the pregnancy pact.<eos> You looked good in that.<eos> I still would.
Oh. I have seen your names on the program.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> Well... who would like a piece of pie? - Thank you.<eos> Oh, I would.
Here take my credit card.<eos> Cash only.<eos> Mona mi.<eos> We don't have that kinda cash.<eos> Who would?
Mom who was wanted.<eos> Because it grew larger house drunk Finnskogen.<eos> Is ridiculous obsessed with my modeling career.<eos> - But you're very pretty.<eos> - But I would not.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off.<eos> Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I?
So, they adapt some fucking weapons-grade flu virus so it can be hidden in food, and Corvadt make a vaccine that's only effective on certain races.<eos> After Fetlar, people are terrified.<eos> One more outbreak like that and they'll be rioting to get it in their arms. Fuck testing!<eos> But you'd need it in so much food.<eos> Yeah, you would.
What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
Damn!<eos> Didn't the murderous intent arise inside you at that time?<eos> But I didn't kill him.<eos> Because he is my father.<eos> Would you?
And the tango Just think what you'll miss!<eos> - We miss most everything, don't we?<eos> - Tomorrow at 4:00, Barnum.<eos> - But no one wants to dance with me!<eos> - Why wouldn't they?
A 12-step program usually doesn't traumatize the participant.<eos> But conversion therapy might.<eos> Several conversion camps have been shut down recently 'cause their methods border on torture.<eos> Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children?<eos> None of them would.
All I can think of is Lucy.<eos> Every second of the day.<eos> Then think about her.<eos> She wouldn't want you to do this.<eos> Yes, she would.
You be safe, Bullet.<eos> Like the music?<eos> You know what that is, Ray?<eos> You still got a job?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Even clients like Sun Coast and the $2.5 million in sales?<eos> Don't tell me that wouldn't hit your bottom line.<eos> Not to mention your lifestyle, like that boat, the catered parties, all those eager shot-girl hopefuls.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, it would.
You do know the Americans have a correct uniform for practically every activity known to man?<eos> Thomas was your valet the whole time Bates was in prison.<eos> He knows how you like things done.<eos> Suppose he doesn't want to go?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
We're calling him Andrew.<eos> Stan's brother.<eos> Have you held him yet?<eos> I told him, I says, "You're gonna drop him."<eos> I wouldn't.
- Spoilers.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> For once, I would like to know where I'm going.<eos> No, you really wouldn't.
Sergeant Drake.<eos> He seem his self to you?<eos> Happy?<eos> Bella meets a need.<eos> A need you would not.
I don't know, I want things.<eos> I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.<eos> What's my move with Jess?<eos> What would you do?<eos> Of course you would, you dirty dog.
Is that about the time that you ran away?<eos> I couldn't stay.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
We... Your Honor, um...<eos> Would you like to change your motion?<eos> Yes, we-- actually, we are going to withdraw the motion out of respect for the voting process.<eos> We'd like to make a motion, Your Honor.<eos> Of course you would.
- You saw how he tried?<eos> Okay, Gherman!<eos> It is more than visible.<eos> The man wants to go to space!<eos> - Of course, Grisha, and who would not?
I mean, um, what would you call bacon and eggs if you only got one egg?<eos> - I would call it bacon and egg.<eos> - No, you would not.<eos> You would call it bacon and eggs.<eos> Anybody would.
Come on in.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - You bet.<eos> You want to talk to Kristina?<eos> I would.
I mean, y-you seemed to... know what you were doing at the warehouse this morning.<eos> Which means, by definition, you must've stored and processed something in your memory banks.<eos> Look, you seem like a nice guy.<eos> But, honestly, if you keep asking me questions, I'm gonna have to break your neck, so, you know...<eos> I wouldn't.
So, you're a ranger?<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Is that cool if we, if we mentioned that or...?<eos> Oh, I don't think it's important.<eos> - I, I wouldn't.
Oh. Chicken Parmesan.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> That changes everything.<eos> Really?<eos> No. Why would it?
- That chick can write.<eos> I'll tell her you said so.<eos> She knows who I am?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Really?<eos> Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.
It'll be too much pressure for me if I knew you would be waiting.<eos> Why don't we stop talking about it like it'll really happen?<eos> Please promise me that you won't wait.<eos> too... that you would never disappear from my sight.<eos> Of course I wouldn't.
Went to the music scene in Detroit, were the MC5 and The Stooges.<eos> In Shep develop my character to Alice.<eos> Said: "We have to invent something no one has seen before."<eos> I had a teacher who said "You can achieve a great cultural impact one of three things:<eos> - Violence, sex or rebellion" Alice would of the three.
Yes, and I am afraid it could be dangerous.<eos> Mrs Piggott, you were at work in the Kings Arms the evening Mr and Mrs Wickham and Captain Denny set off in a coach for Pemberley, is that correct?<eos> It is.<eos> And would you say they were a happy party?<eos> I would not, Sir!
The way you jumped out of that barn, went down in that basement...<eos> I guess I'm just having a hard time believing that you were scared.<eos> I think you knew that my curse would kick in and save me. I really...<eos> I don't know the first thing about it.<eos> But Audrey Parker would.
Look here.<eos> Neal stopped counting.<eos> 'Cause he got off the island.<eos> He was here longer.<eos> Then why would he...
Oh.<eos> And you came here?<eos> See?<eos> I wanted to go to the waterfall pools.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't.
No!<eos> I...<eos> I promised Amy.<eos> And I am telling you that Amy would want you to tell.<eos> No, she really wouldn't.
No, you didn't.<eos> You just tried to help.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> My father would've wanted it this way.<eos> No, he would not.
What?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I was just feeling around for your shin.<eos> My shin?<eos> Why would you...?
Poor thing went through a lot of trouble to make that.<eos> She should get that back.<eos> You really think she wants to eat her dead sister's birthday cake?<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Damn post office.<eos> Oh, and another thing.<eos> There was an odd little man in a child's police costume at my house earlier asking strange questions.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> I would not.
Cipri... when you can, take these clothes to the parish.<eos> You and Sátur can keep the bedroom.<eos> Gonzalo...<eos> I understand you not wanting to go to that wedding.<eos> I wouldn't, either.
Oh, let's see, there's plaxitril for my depression, zaxaprin for my anxiety, dilapamin for my insomnia, and clodex for my occasional bouts of rage.<eos> No one likes an angry Hore.<eos> Why didn't you tell me we were going to a gay bar?<eos> 'Cause if I told you, you wouldn't have come.<eos> Yes, I would.
I'm fine.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Does dad know?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not. Why would he?
Well, you should stop.<eos> Prefer to spend the rest of my life, below The blankets on the couch, with my head on your shoulder.<eos> If...<eos> I wish. Can you blame me?<eos> Yes, of course I would.
Here's my question.<eos> Detective...<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> No, I have no idea who he is.<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you.
Hey.<eos> I'll grab my coat.<eos> OK.<eos> Are you ignoring me?<eos> No more than I would any random receptionist.
I know things are shit right now, and I know you're angry but...<eos> But if you don't get to the cause of this then you're going to end up exploding...<eos> I could I could talk to that counsellor you keep banging on about.<eos> If you like.<eos> Yeah, I would.
But if you don't get to the cause of this then you're going to end up exploding...<eos> I could I could talk to that counsellor you keep banging on about.<eos> If you like.<eos> Yeah, I would.<eos> I really would.
Where the truckers go and masturbate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what you're talking about.<eos> Well?<eos> Would you? Um...
I know what you're talking about.<eos> Well?<eos> Would you? Um...<eos> No.<eos> I would not.
Who else knew why Tyler was really here?<eos> Malcolm maybe?<eos> No. He never accessed personnel files.<eos> Tyler Barrett's name wouldn't mean anything to him.<eos> But it would to Siobhan.
Yeah.<eos> She's responsible for all the kids at the youth center.<eos> Now you think she'd let you play with them if it wasn't safe?<eos> I guess not.<eos> No, she wouldn't, just like we wouldn't.
No, the only F word was fun.<eos> Thank you, Mr Cullen.<eos> Mr Cullen.<eos> Would you say there's a culture of leaking in the government?<eos> Yes, I would.
Is this what you want, mum?<eos> Please don't ask me to go against your father's wishes.<eos> If it is the only way that we can have any contact, then wouldn't that end justify the means?<eos> No.<eos> It wouldn't.
- A change of heart?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - So you want her back now?<eos> - No, that's not it.<eos> - Why the hell would I?
I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How much is taken off?<eos> I feel so violated.<eos> I would, too.
The problem is, who do we sue?<eos> I mean, the police?<eos> That's not gonna get her job back.<eos> We'd get damages.<eos> Not much, we wouldn't.
Yeah.<eos> It's a different world now, isn't it?<eos> As different as it may be, Ms. Blake, a boy still has his best chance in life by going to college, and you don't get there by dropping out of high school to invent Twitter apps.<eos> It's certainly normal for a loving parent to have dreams for her child.<eos> What parent wouldn't?
You'll find somebody new.<eos> Once you get out of this hospital and your leg gets rehabilitated...<eos> Oh, hey, you wanna be my new girlfriend?<eos> Of course!<eos> Who wouldn't?
Sorry about that.<eos> My practice is based on perfection.<eos> Wouldn't do to have imperfections<eos> - in the waiting room, now, would it?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
He was infected too but didn't know.<eos> - Almost transformed days later.<eos> - We should find him.<eos> Yeah, I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it.<eos> Olivia would, though.
My family wanted to make me stronger so they gave me a fierce name to live up to.<eos> And actually, I do want to turn into a wolf.<eos> But I have a really hard time imagining how that would be.<eos> Would he get hair on his face? Long hair?<eos> And would his eyes...
It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
The other way is by using Nick's key fob to open the metal grille to the car park.<eos> Who would know that?<eos> Well, from where I'm sitting, you would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course I would.
Going down?<eos> Actually, I was hoping to take you out for lunch.<eos> I can't.<eos> I want to kiss you.<eos> Oh? I wouldn't.
I want a star on top of this, not somebody's eyeball.<eos> Season's greetings to you too!<eos> Do I have to undress him?<eos> It's on the nippy side in 'ere.<eos> Down to his napkin, if you would, Mrs Duncan.
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!<eos> In God's name,<eos> I'll ascend the regal throne.<eos> Marry. God forbid!<eos> Would God that any in this noble presence
Because you two need to learn to play a husband and wife believably.<eos> What does that have to do with Sushi?<eos> ! Listen, I once did a show where I had to play a man in great pain, so to prepare, I threw myself down a flight of stairs.<eos> You wouldn't believe how many times I hit my head.<eos> - Yeah, we would.
Winter and summer sorted.<eos> All for the joy of golf.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yet something tells me if you won, you'd still stay on the job.<eos> Oh, but you wouldn't?
But as you are only half fae, your magic is finite.<eos> You will run out if you aren't careful how and how much you use it.<eos> What happens if I do run out?<eos> Would I die?<eos> - You wouldn't, but-
All right.<eos> I love you.<eos> Go play back there.<eos> Of course Will thought Matthew was a hostage.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I want to talk to your mom about this.<eos> Now, mom, we are looking at dogs.<eos> We're thinking about getting a dog.<eos> We're not necessarily getting a dog.<eos> Why wouldn't we?
No, I guess on dry land the shark would probably dry out.<eos> I can't believe I'm even playing this game.<eos> Look, there are plenty of animals that could kill Stephen Hawking.<eos> - Like a badger?<eos> - Yes, a badger probably would.
Had a bit of a toothache a while back, like, but it cleared up all by itself.<eos> Hospital visitor standards are really slipping.<eos> I wouldn't want my real husband here if I was going through this, let alone my ex.<eos> Do you think Anna would want you by her bedside?<eos> Of course she would.
Now you just have to sign the contract.<eos> Why a house?<eos> I prefer the hotel.<eos> --Hotels get controlled... I don't wanna end up in jail.<eos> Why would you?
There's no excuse for murdering innocent people.<eos> He didn't kill you.<eos> You're alive.<eos> - He saved your life.<eos> - Why? Why would he?
Hello? back, and I'm prepared to pay for it.<eos> Why don't I fly you and your friends to Cowboys training camp, watch a little practice, meet some players, we'll talk a little business.<eos> I can't imagine that my friends would want to... what?<eos> !<eos> Yes, we would!
- Yeah. I... Fish?<eos> Says fish.<eos> Could be something else. That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
We sue the DA's Office for slander, defamation of character, and we also go after Odom personally.<eos> He's the handling DA.<eos> He'd have qualified immunity.<eos> We can't.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
I got some vodka.<eos> You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually... I would.
I wanna make new memories with you, baby.<eos> It'll take some time, but you don't have to stay.<eos> Mint! There's a Killer tourney on at the pub.<eos> D'you ever do any work?<eos> Why would I?
You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.<eos> Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh?<eos> Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes?<eos> Oh, you mean foot prisons?<eos> Yes, I would.
You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's a mystery.<eos> How will people know what they're buying?<eos> Well, they wouldn't, John.
It's late, Kalinda.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because a compressed file drops frames. And I need to see every frame.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - Why wouldn't I?
They're beautiful.<eos> They're going to look even more beautiful slow-roasted and served up with a side of Becker's mash.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Uh, and how exactly would you cook 'em?<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted us to be closer.<eos> Look, Meg, I do care for you, but I care for you like I...<eos> I would a niece or a good friend's daughter.
Remember the guy's name?<eos> Kevin, Melvin-- something, I don't know.<eos> Car's here.<eos> Did this guy tell you why he wanted to use these pigs?<eos> He wouldn't.
So you're saying Ann was the target, not Debbie.<eos> Why?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> It would violateprivilegepriviledge.
Well. How did you respond?<eos> I beat him soundly.<eos> Cuffed him good and proper right in the street.<eos> But you continued to harbour resentment toward him?<eos> Any man would, Detective.
We're gonna go after.<eos> I'm headed to the barn in the meantime.<eos> Shane wants a watch duty down there.<eos> Does Rick?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
- Doctor Lewandowski?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Mr and Mrs Santorski?<eos> Your son had an acting-out when the police came...<eos> - Wouldn't you?
Does he look like a guy that will easily let it go?<eos> Also, he knows too much.<eos> If we just leave this as is, this might backfire to snag us.<eos> No matter what, you must find him and get rid of him.<eos> Why would Grandpa to Choi Ryu...
- but I just thought she was being a wife.<eos> - Bailey...<eos> Are you drinking again?<eos> Ooh, that would explain a lot.<eos> Yes, it would.
Why do I have to do it?<eos> Why can't we get a grown-up to do it or something?<eos> This is your sister, and it's because you and Talia have the same blood.<eos> So?<eos> Why would that...
She does favors for a price.<eos> She's a fixer.<eos> Assuming then that she's the victim.<eos> Any ideas who'd want to take her out?<eos> Who wouldn't?
I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now don't lose hope.<eos> Molly wouldn't want that, now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
I was talking to,um,jim,and i don't think jim's fond of getting rid of ozzy.<eos> Who is closest to ode?<eos> Elyse?<eos> I think she's in ozzy's back pocket.<eos> would***
Merlin took some from here earlier.<eos> He was really angry when he realised Arthur wasn't going to eat it.<eos> He has been behaving very strangely.<eos> Why would Merlin want to kill Arthur?<eos> He wouldn't.
Yeah, I mean, because there's nothing more soothing than the sound of somebody trying to sell you gold coins, right?<eos> You know, I need something to block out the sound of the ocean 'cause the waves keep crashing over and over and over again, Steven.<eos> Some would say it's a relaxing sound, Danny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Some people would.
Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
There's 40,000 cops in this city... Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just trying' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> Yes, I would.
Forty thousand dollars a ton.<eos> That's the best price you can give me?<eos> I could charge you double and you'd pay.<eos> You could.<eos> And I would
Have you seen him in Boulder?<eos> Yes, we happen to work togeer.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Everywhere you go there's somebody that wants to be with you, which is a lot of fun for me.<eos> Of course, why wouldn't they?
Kitty, I mean, mom would have a breakdown.<eos> And dad?<eos> Dad would kill me.<eos> I wouldn't care.<eos> You wouldn't?
No, 3:30.<eos> Enjoy the town, everyone.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now who would like to join me on a morale-boosting tour of Boston's historic freedom trail?<eos> Ooh, I would...
I am troubled, Minnie, because I sense something is sorely wrong in the life of a dear friend of mine.<eos> Now, is that enough to send you back to your bed?<eos> It is, Ma'am.<eos> Unless you would like two slices of bacon and a crust of bread.<eos> I would.
They think i saved them. I didn't.<eos> I got rid of cirie while i had the chance.<eos> And i swear,i will never,never turn on you guys,nerve. - Really?<eos> - I swear,i swear.<eos> Man,i would never.
Okay.<eos> We thought that Samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth, and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.<eos> Is this a substance much like bullshit?<eos> I thought we could drop one off the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown, like the moon shot and show how it doesn't break.<eos> -But it would, wouldn't it?
Oh, you exaggerate.<eos> You're American, you don't understand these things.<eos> Have you mentioned this to Granny?<eos> Did she laugh?<eos> Why would she?
I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
But if... Actually, I'm here to see you.<eos> To see me?<eos> I need to speak further with you for my article.<eos> Yes, well, I wouldn't want to impede your writing.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
They put their finger up--<eos> That's what I mean, though. - Why?<eos> Why are they still using the index finger? -<eos> What, you'd prefer the forefinger or the thumb,<eos> - Would you? - Karl:
Well, that's disappointing.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.<eos> Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?<eos> Who wouldn't?
I'm eight for 26 this month.<eos> Yeah, I think I'll pass.<eos> But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.<eos> Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.<eos> Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't. Uh-huh.
Are there any lasting side effects?<eos> No.<eos> When it's over, it's over.<eos> Someone coming out of a fugue state Wouldn't have any diminished physical or mental capacity?<eos> No, he wouldn't.
No... Sir!<eos> I am real!<eos> Would an imaginary me know that you have a mole on your list of pets to get?<eos> Or that your favorite color is rainbow?<eos> Of course it would.
What are you doing to grizz?<eos> Whoa, you watch your mouth, Before I show you the back of my hand.<eos> Look, you gotta grow up about this best man thing.<eos> Liz lemon, I don't even want to be best man.<eos> Why would I?
Fuck!<eos> What am I supposed to do with that information?<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> You want me to tell you.<eos> Yes, I would.
You know, that funky smell.<eos> It's kind of hard to describe.<eos> It was like canned soup or something.<eos> Buddy, you want to live in a place that smells like broccoli soup?<eos> Yeah, who would?
You think it's okay to hit women, staff sergeant?<eos> No, sir!<eos> 'cause it sure looks like it to me.<eos> Mrs. Evans never came back to see me, sir.<eos> Why would she?
So, can I just ask?<eos> I mean, you took Toby to the dance, but then you took that picture with Maya.<eos> I think I know what I want, but if I say yes to Maya, everything would change.<eos> - You know it would.<eos> - Yeah, it would.
Either you modify your diet and start to exercise, or I put you on cholesterol medication.<eos> - Can I think about it?<eos> - Wrong answer.<eos> Also, Hank, would it help if he avoided stressful situations from now on?<eos> Yeah, sure, it would.
Mr. and Mrs. Leplante, why now?<eos> - Ray's always wanted a son...<eos> - Scalpel!<eos> But I've always wanted a girl.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
I'm using it in my thesis.<eos> He has another: "Murder does not have a language yet it will speak."<eos> But when?<eos> Would you want to read a crime novel if the crime is not resolved in the end?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Yeah, a delivery truck was hijacked from Big Foods At 1:00 in the morning.<eos> It was discovered at 5:40 a.m. minus its contents.<eos> You gonna tell me you don't know<eos> - anything about that?<eos> - Why would I?
I'm leaving early.<eos> This dance only happens once a year, you know?<eos> Thank God.<eos> You know, I still can't believe we're actually going.<eos> Well, why wouldn't we?
I'm down with other people being down with that.<eos> But that's nohow I get down.<eos> Wait, I don't get it.<eos> How could you not know?<eos> Well, why would I?
May I?<eos> I mean...you tried to give the money back, didn't you?<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> But they wouldn't let you.<eos> They wouldn't...
The figures suggest that Schumacher and Fangio were better, but the people who know, they tell a different story.<eos> I think, Senna, I would put him in number one.<eos> For me, Senna is number one.<eos> For me, he was number one.<eos> I would Ayrton Senna as number one.
Does it sound like something that she would say?<eos> Does she sound like herself?<eos> We never--we never told her to not be afraid.<eos> Why would she say that?<eos> She wouldn't.
Proper driving requires that you regularly glance away from the road ahead to your instrument panel, your mirrors.<eos> Or over your shoulder to change lanes.<eos> Yes, good.<eos> So if my client were to say to 911 that she just looked up and she was there, that wouldn't necessarily suggest any lack of due care on her part or negligence.<eos> It would not, no.
I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
You know what?<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Just as I have found what I'm looking for here maybe it's time you found what you're looking for.<eos> Steven, if you would like to take a Mexican wife -<eos> Yes, I would.
I did.<eos> I'm just pitching' in, aiding' the cause, Helpin' the angels of spirit Make the world a cheerier place.<eos> Savannah, does he talk that much during sex?<eos> I wouldn't know. Right.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
Fixing what we can at camp, that's the meant I attitude you have to have.<eos> Dan, you sat out of the challenge... yet again.<eos> I told everybody on the tribe that I do not feel comfortable because of my knee sloshing around in mud. If you put me on level ground I'll go up against anybody.<eos> But why would I want to do something that I know I'm not good at and possibly hurt the tribe?<eos> No, I wouldn't either.
Well, he's making me feel guilty.<eos> You see, people DO things with their lives.<eos> I mean, what will people say at my funeral?<eos> Seriously, would I have a good eulogy?<eos> Of course you would.
Hiya, sweetheart, come here, give us a cuddle!<eos> It's a bit early for that.<eos> No, don't! If your lawyer was here, he'd tell you that's the most stupid thing you could do...<eos> My lawyer would tell me that, would he?<eos> Yes, he would.
Yes.<eos> I've been awake since dawn.<eos> I came down in search of a glass of milk.<eos> There's milk in the refrigerator, Sir, unless you'd like a cup of tea.<eos> Actually, I would.
The inability to constrain impulsive outbursts.<eos> You can't help yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you say that brain damage stems from his playing football?<eos> I would. Yes.
And I really hate the word "Sassy."<eos> It's stupid.<eos> - Uh, go in tight on Dale.<eos> - I mean, yes, I have an attitude,<eos> But wouldn't you,
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Who wouldn't?
I'm sorry, I don't know that.<eos> I don't know where exactly it was.<eos> We met at the White Horse on Wheatley Road. You know it?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> You would.
- Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
I'm wasting my time.<eos> We're done talking.<eos> Suppose I can prove he was innocent? Wouldn't you want that?<eos> Wouldn't you want that blot on your name expunged?<eos> - Of course he would.
Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> Mr. Brooks.<eos> I'm glad I caught you. Did you want a classroom phone directory?<eos> Yes, I would.
Really?<eos> What are, uh-What are the stakes?<eos> The buy-in is half a million U.S.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to join us tonight.<eos> Perhaps you would too.
Going to shoot me?<eos> And risk bringing down the wrath of Prince John on Nottingham?<eos> Well, I don't think you want that, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Do you ever start a conversation at the beginning?<eos> What if Gideon's conscious?<eos> - You mean faking? - Hiding.<eos> It would explain his lack of progress.<eos> Well, so would severe brain trauma.
(Joanne) It's in Alaska.<eos> The university has a high altitude array.<eos> (Eric) It's a smaller facility but it's similar to H.A.R.T.<eos> I just need to know if something like that would work.<eos> Well, would it?
I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
First ultrasound.<eos> So big question: Do we want to know the sex of the baby?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> I would.
I'm okay.<eos> - You shot yourself.<eos> - What?<eos> No, it didn't hurt. I mean, , it would hurt, right?<eos> Of course it would, man.
And I just didn't wanna say anything until I knew it was gonna go somewhere, and...<eos> Well, we hit a little speed bump when I first found out that Sam was your baby.<eos> Yeah, he got drunk and asked me to sell him on the black market.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She wouldn't, but...
- Dan.<eos> - Dan.<eos> Can I meet him?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
Not that I'm aware of.<eos> Oh, we...found this.<eos> I wouldn't read too much into that, Inspector. It's a family heirloom.<eos> Tom's father was a priest in some godforsaken parish up near Carlisle.<eos> Well, why would he...?
In the parking lot at Paramount.<eos> I said, "You gotta be in it." He said, "I'm not gonna be in it."<eos> I said, "Leonard," I grabbed him by the shoulder,<eos> "You gotta be in it." "I'm not gonna be in it."<eos> -He would not...
And we would finish what we started growing up together.<eos> Sátur, you never change, you do not change; you still have the same birdbrained dreams in your head.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Estuarda, in recent years a single night has not passed that I do not think of you.<eos> If you would, I...
I did what I had to do.<eos> You killed him.<eos> If I hadn't, you'd be having this conversation with him.<eos> But maybe that's the way you'd prefer it.<eos> Perhaps I would!
I could meet your kid. We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
Good idea.<eos> Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.<eos> I'll tell her right away.<eos> To form a coalition government without you is something the Party will never agree to.<eos> Neither would the rest of the country.
Whoa, okay there, buddy.<eos> no no no? You'reot getting anywhere near her.<eos> I didn't say I was going to.<eos> I just- - I wanted to.<eos> but Who wouldn't?
(LAUGHTER) It's all right for you, Taff.<eos> At least you got invalided out with a proper injury.<eos> It really softens the blow, like(!<eos> ) So, if you lot were still serving, would any of you go out there again?<eos> Course I would.
- What do you think?<eos> - I'm calling him.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Betts, don't worry about my job.<eos> Why would I?
Take a walk.<eos> Take a walk!<eos> I would love that.<eos> I would-- Sit down.<eos> I really would.
Perry and I thought it might be fun to, you know, make a whole night of it.<eos> Like, we'd rent a limo and go to breakfast in the morning and...<eos> The whole night?<eos> Where would you sleep?<eos> We wouldn't.
Check it out.<eos> What?<eos> He knew exactly where to stand so that surveillance camera wouldn't pick him up.<eos> Why would someone so intelligent carelessly drop their motel room key?<eos> They wouldn't...
I was gonna buy scalper's tickets. - Oh.<eos> - Maybe i'll run into you.<eos> - I'm sure you will.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> - Why wouldn't i? Yeah.
You trained him well.<eos> Exactly!<eos> You can't send him away!<eos> What if you need him here?<eos> Why would I?
It doesn't make a difference to me.<eos> I can sit here all day.<eos> I can't.<eos> Would it help you if I told you that you weren't running from me but from yourself?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
- I think that's heartbreaking.<eos> - You know, when I say "heartbreaking," you say that the heart is a muscle, so it can't break, it can only get crushed.<eos> Isn't it heart-crushing?<eos> - You want to go to his funeral?<eos> I would.
That's why you're dumb.<eos> Shh. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I hate that thing.<eos> I hate it with all my heart.<eos> I would too.
What do we do?<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> We just gotta wait him out.<eos> You think he'll ever come back?<eos> Would you?
She's fine, thank you.<eos> Is she still with that fucked-up guy?<eos> Do you really want to talk about my daughter or are you just trying to make me uncomfortable?<eos> I don't wanna talk about her if you don't.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
I am. I'm shocked.<eos> I am.<eos> We were with him last night!<eos> Who'd want to do Gunter?<eos> Naebody. Why would they?
Nothing, I can assure you.<eos> How dare you treat my daughter like a common criminal?<eos> Your daughter has been stealing from your home like a common criminal.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> She would never...
A ghost... Sent me the case.<eos> At first, i thought it was michael.<eos> Lots of other ghosts have tried to stop me.<eos> Does this make any sense to you?<eos> Why on earth would it?
Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and god knows where it ends.<eos> I'm not gonna let it go too far.<eos> It's already gone too far,sam.<eos> If I didn't know you i would want to hunt you.<eos> And so would other hunters.
It didn't go great.<eos> Do you know Tracy Jordan?<eos> I took a pill earlier, but I didn't get my september issue of O Magazine.<eos> Do you have the number for subscriptions?<eos> Why would you? Blagh!
Another round, boys?<eos> Halpert?<eos> What's up, Roy?<eos> Relax, man. I'm not gonna hit you or anything.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't...
You a football fan,Jimmy?<eos> Beause I can get great Chargers seats.<eos> We should go.<eos> I would love that. Yeah.<eos> You would?
Okay.<eos> That's cool. Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again.<eos> Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we?<eos> No!<eos> We wouldn't.
Atrial fibrillation throwing emboli.<eos> Crohn's causing an abscess.<eos> It could be a million things.<eos> There's no way to know unless we get him in for an MRI on his head, or exploratory surgery so we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.<eos> Wouldn't.
Really. You know, if you weren't so freakin' adorable, I wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.<eos> Can we start over?<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> So you want to go out this weekend?<eos> Yes, I would.
Only if you want to.<eos> yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh,why wouldn't I?
This is it.<eos> we're gonna be okay.<eos> How?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would have an answer for that one.<eos> Normally would.
Well, George wants to pull out of the film.<eos> And I want to persuade him not.<eos> But I also want to find out why he's suddenly doing this.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want to be on TV.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
If you despise me because I'm a dancer, then why did you put me in the way of being one?<eos> It was your doing.<eos> You're the one who chivvied me into taking lessons.<eos> And now... the ground before this Mrs Merdle.<eos> I wouldn't, Fanny.
- I was talking about his member...<eos> - Oh, that!<eos> You want to know why he had it out.<eos> - He'd just finished a sexual act.<eos> - So his killer, she'd just...
And probably ... second, and now found it funny ... but all dream of a miracle.<eos> And no matter if it will come from above or below, but it will come.<eos> Maybe because ... before all these people ... who were rescued by aircraft at the North Pole ...<eos> Butthatwasimpossible,were atwar,noplaneswerecoming.<eos> There would no planes of the Red Army ... or fleet.
I'm just a guy with a belief system.<eos> Mary's a nice girl. We save lives together.<eos> That's a good time.<eos> If she wanted to marry my brother, I'd have a problem with that.<eos> But so would a lot of people.
What?<eos> What--What-- What's With The Face?<eos> You Don't Wanna Go?<eos> No, No, Of Course I Do.<eos> Who Wouldn't?
But you're either going to talk to me or not.<eos> Where's Kelly Stevens?<eos> She's the missing schoolgirl, right?<eos> Well, I have no idea where she is.<eos> Why would I?
-And you're planning on staying here, are you?<eos> -Where else am I going to go?<eos> Mum!<eos> The Colonel won't believe us.<eos> But who would?
You're not done for abortion.<eos> They get you for murder!<eos> Five to ten years!<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, why would you?
You want your line to represent the waldorf lifestyle.<eos> Who better to represent you than one of your own family?<eos> She was my first dress form.<eos> She'd love to!<eos> I would?
A plea?<eos> You think i'm guilty?<eos> Dad,it's just a question.<eos> How would that work exactly?<eos> It wouldn't.
Because... I miss your dad.<eos> I miss having that solid citizen by my side to tell me which way is up.<eos> And I trust ya.<eos> I'd have to do it my own way.<eos> Hey,what man wouldn't?
Wait.<eos> You actually rang that?<eos> Did someone tell you?<eos> No.<eos> Who would?
HOLY COW.<eos> SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY TO EARL THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM?<eos> "GET THE HELL OUT OF MY DREAM."<eos> DON'T YOU WANT TO GET A LIST OF QUESTIONS TOGETHER?<eos> - I WOULD.
The satellite also found another problem.<eos> One of their flaps is damaged.<eos> They could lose control on re-entry.<eos> Not could, sir.<eos> Would.
Just leave him.<eos> But you can see what I'm saying.<eos> Would he let me do that?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Yes, he would.
Maybe they would look a little bit like us, but that would be very, very coincidental.<eos> I mean, I just saw a ground squirrel running behind a bush over here, and he inhabits the same planet I do, probably 70% of his DNA is the same as mine.<eos> He doesn't look like me.<eos> So why would the aliens look like me?<eos> They probably wouldn't.
our families spend A lot of time together.<eos> he likes his cousin.<eos> Does that Make you jealous?<eos> What?<eos> Why would it?
he likes his cousin.<eos> Does that Make you jealous?<eos> What?<eos> Why would it?<eos> Why would it?
- We'd like to know now.<eos> - if this is an interrogation...<eos> - Just some clarifying questions.<eos> He's welcome to a solicitor if he needs one.<eos> Why would I?
Yeah, I said it.<eos> Now, Ruckus, that's crazy.<eos> If they're so innocent, why won't they talk to the police?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
AII of a sudden she couldn't care less about me.<eos> Or you either. Right?<eos> Sometimes we can't predict the future.<eos> I tried to explain to her that we could forget all about it.<eos> But she wouldn't.
over there.<eos> you.<eos> you're the pretty young thing... is what i meant.<eos> champagne?<eos> would you?
He carries it around with him in case she phones.<eos> Let's have one of those beers quick before his grandparents get here.<eos> I'd better go, actually.<eos> But you've only just got here.<eos> No, I'd better.
Going, "scrape, scrape, scrapey,"<eos> I cried, and she cried too, and she fell asleep on the floor.<eos> And the next time you woke up, she was gone, wasn't she?<eos> If I played the game with her like she wanted me to, would she still be here?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
You can get the escape when you do get high, but never like the first few times.<eos> I wanna escape.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanna know what it feels like to escape.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I wanna escape.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanna know what it feels like to escape.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I would.
It's all gassed up, Dad.<eos> It's ready to go.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> You sure you want this?<eos> He would.
"Alex Fletcher, you are a horrible songwriter"?<eos> How would you react?<eos> I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice a gentleman ever to say such a thing.<eos> Dylan might.<eos> Dylan would, actually.
One month.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> -That's not fair. -Who says life's fair?<eos> It wouldn't kill you to stay inside.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it would actually.
Mum?<eos> Mother?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Well, if you'd like me to spell it out to you, David.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I kissed the children.<eos> I picked up my briefcase.<eos> You were going to the office?<eos> Of course.<eos> Where else would I...
Her name's Clytia.<eos> - They say you're not indifferent to her.<eos> - For her, I'd give my life my eyes, my blood. - I am a woman, too.<eos> - Do you want to see my face?<eos> - Any man would.
Are we really gonna leave them?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're being such an asshole.<eos> They would do the exact same thing to us.<eos> Okay, maybe they would, but I wouldn't.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> Hey, Dean.<eos> I'm surprised the cops didn't show<eos> -Place like this you'd think would have an alarm.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Michelle's does crazy bacon, egg and sausage sandwiches.<eos> They're mad. There! Great!<eos> I'm going... for a shower.<eos> Do you want me to... feed Reuben?<eos> Oh, would you, sweetie?
Did you have drinks, exchange confidences?<eos> - Yes, that's what I asked.<eos> - Yeah, sure, of course.<eos> At times. - You'd know if his marriage was in trouble.<eos> - Yes, sir, I would.
Well, where else would we put my TV?<eos> We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.<eos> But wouldn't we miss my TV?<eos> - Would we?<eos> - Yes, we would.
I don't have... access to that part of the system.<eos> To the root directory?<eos> You don't have access to the root directory?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Who would?
I did not put him down.<eos> My nephew did, yeah, sure. But it wasn't any kind of move on you.<eos> You don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> I don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> Michael caffee would, yeah, sure.
Let's break it down.<eos> I.<eos> - I.<eos> - I.<eos> - Would.
I.<eos> - I.<eos> - I.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.
- I.<eos> - I.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.
- I.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.<eos> - Would.
We roam the country like Bonnie and Clyde... and Clyde? No.<eos> First, we take the cop's car and crash it into a tree up the road.<eos> We put him and the reverend's wife in her car and push it over the cliff at Grouse Point.<eos> - They'd find the car in a couple of days.<eos> - And what would the forensic figure?
Stand and face me, Jeff.<eos> - Stay with me, please.<eos> - Right now.<eos> Would you like to get your life back?<eos> Would you, Jeff?
In the Tap Room in the Steelworks' with his old man, I'll bet.<eos> No, Dave's come over all responsible since she was born.<eos> You wouldn't believe it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm not so sure I've changed that much.<eos> The chances are slim, you know that.<eos> Crossing the street is a risk.<eos> If you let it get to you, you'd never have children.<eos> Nobody would.
Or is this just an ordinary, everyday relationship tune-up?<eos> Uh, no, it's not a tune-up.<eos> Um, we've been going at each other pretty good for a while now and we probably should have come months ago.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Oh, she wouldn't...
Me.<eos> Me.<eos> You want me to reach in here and take out 3 pennies?<eos> - Would you mind?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Dad's in prison, my mom... couldn't make it work.<eos> I just knew there was something about you that didn't quite fit in.<eos> In a good way.<eos> I wonder if your dad knows my Uncle Jack.<eos> Why would he?
Let me have her more often.<eos> Weekends.<eos> I want to.<eos> You don't.<eos> You wouldn't.
Pays $300,000 a year to start, and two months vacation time.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They can all opt out of the Unit tomorrow if they want- well, except for Bob- and come work with us.<eos> Mack wouldn't know what to do with a hundred-dollar bill if you gave him a slide show on it.<eos> But we would, wouldn't we?
But... ehm... but to avoid any hassle, I pay it.<eos> If there was none law and I wasn't afraid of them coming and taking me to jail, absolutely I wouldn't pay taxes.<eos> OK then no, I wouldn't pay income taxes.<eos> - Ahmm... - It's a no brainer, you wouldn't pay it. I wouldn't pay it.<eos> Why would anybody?
A Marine from First Sergeant Downing's Company.<eos> - We couldn't prove it.<eos> - Downing was on a revenge mission.<eos> First Sergeants don't go on revenge missions, Officer David.<eos> I would. Why not a Marine First Sergeant?
Mr Tennison assumed the pain was his ulcer and let it go on<eos> Now the tumour's at a stage<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> Well, obviously I'll want a second opinion.<eos> I would, too.
She had... an aura about her.<eos> - An aura.<eos> - She glowed, with a radiance, like...<eos> You wouldn't know anything about it, would you, Larry?<eos> Would you?
Well, then why haven't I heard that from Barney?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought he would have called you.<eos> He told you we were here?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
At first, I didn't know what he was doing, but then he pulled a gun.<eos> And he shouted at us to all lie down and not look at him.<eos> And, uh... the husband and wife that owned the store, koreans, they were behind the counter.<eos> And the robber guy yelled at them to open the register.<eos> But the husband wouldn't.
He will handle the murder investigation.<eos> I will take care of the robbery.<eos> And you will get the rat.<eos> We'd love to believe you, Brad.<eos> We really would.
Eh?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Why did you take my picture in the pedestrian crossing?<eos> You noticed?<eos> Usually people would.
He's only called up a zillion times tonight, trying to convince me.<eos> And, uh... I guess...<eos> you want me to go too?<eos> I just told you I did.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Look at Out of the Past, which is also a private eye story, but Robert Mitchum's character in that isn't Philip Marlowe.<eos> He doesn't stay out.<eos> Yeah, he succumbs to the temptation and gets involved with Jane Greer...<eos> - Did you miss me?<eos> - No more than I would my eyes.
Frank and Toofer?<eos> That's where you're getting your information?<eos> They're messing with you.<eos> No, they wouldn't do that to me.<eos> Yeah, they would.
This could escalate into something horrific.<eos> We live in a horrific world.<eos> You think this is what Rachel would want?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
It didn't take long for the story to get told.<eos> Around midnight, Vincent had shown up at his favourite brothel, handed one of the girls, Rachel, a small package.<eos> Inside was a large piece of ear.<eos> The girl fainted.<eos> Well, we all would, wouldn't we?
I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
Huh, Mr. Sloane? I work for some very powerful people.<eos> My benefactors may be able to help sway the committee's decision tomorrow.<eos> I see.<eos> And I suppose that these benefactors of yours want something in return for their help.<eos> They would at that.
Someone called my attorney saying i've made harassing phone calls, including one to a detective and that the police were looking for me and since i didn't want to end up, you know, dead,<eos> I thought i'd save you the trouble and turn myself in.<eos> What makes you think you'd end up dead?<eos> Flynn framed me for murder 3 years ago with deputy D.A. Powell and Dr. Easton, so clearly, i'd say, they'd feel better if i ceased to exist.<eos> Maybe i would, too.
Now, both gangs are similar.<eos> The both deal coke, rock, and H.<eos> Most recently, they both branched out into firearms.<eos> So they'd have no trouble getting a gun?<eos> No, no one would.
And then, i think it might be appropriate, well, chief Pope tells me that sometimes, at the conclusion of a successful case, y'all gather at O'Malley's to celebrate.<eos> And i thought, under the circumstances, I'd...<eos> I'd like to buy y'all drinks.<eos> If... you're available.<eos> And would like.
And he's alive.<eos> Yeah, I wonder if I... If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
Yes, you do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> But there's only one thing.<eos> - I don't want you to take Charlie away.<eos> - I would never.
If you have any more questions or you need to talk to me, I'm here, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> I told my mother about you.<eos> She remembers you very well.<eos> Of course she would.
Anyone can talk whenever they want to.<eos> It just... it isn't polite to talk when someone is reading.<eos> I want to walk home from school.<eos> Well, why would you want to do that?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
HORN<eos> Looks like you'll be needing this.<eos> Mal.<eos> I knew you'd be here.<eos> Oh, yes. Of course. You would.
Yeah.<eos> I love Goth.<eos> Thieves are just like gamblers.<eos> They never quit when they're ahead.<eos> Why would Petty Officer Lambert?
- I know her, ´cause she came into my office.<eos> - Eight years ago.<eos> - You can remember a face after eight years?<eos> Look at it.<eos> You would, wouldn´t you? Eh?
You know, I've got a script that I've been working on<eos> You think there's any way, maybe, you could pass it along to him?<eos> I mean, you know, only if you like it, of course<eos> - You want me to read it?<eos> - Yeah, if you would
No, whatever it is, it ain, t for the benefit of mankind.<eos> - It, s for the benefit of Charlie.<eos> - How? How does it benefit him?<eos> - I don, t know.<eos> - Who would?
Yes, except the big 'n' tasty comes with mayonnaise.<eos> Oh, then, you know what?<eos> I need the McDonald's Texas homestyle burger meal, please.<eos> Would you like to super-size it today?<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
- You're about to say the ratio of 1.618-1 has been proven to be the key to everything in nature that we find beautiful and that my face is the most perfect example you've ever seen of that ratio.<eos> How could you possibly know that?<eos> Because every geek I've ever met has tried to hand me that line.<eos> I'd love for you to join us in the cabin, see the sunrise over the Amazon.<eos> Of course you would.
How could you possibly know that?<eos> Because every geek I've ever met has tried to hand me that line.<eos> I'd love for you to join us in the cabin, see the sunrise over the Amazon.<eos> Of course you would.<eos> I would....
Because every geek I've ever met has tried to hand me that line.<eos> I'd love for you to join us in the cabin, see the sunrise over the Amazon.<eos> Of course you would.<eos> I would....<eos> "Of course you would."
I believe your words.<eos> But Brahmin Sati is hunting you high and low.<eos> He wants to save his wife.<eos> He wants me back?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Come with me.<eos> Bring your people.<eos> They can stay on theAndromeda.<eos> No.<eos> Would theAndromedahave room for all the citizens of the Arkology?
Darryl, now is not really a good time again.<eos> Let me call you back?<eos> All right.<eos> Not that I'm okay with you stealing my stuff, but those earrings really do look amazing on you.<eos> Then again, what wouldn't?
I didn't want to be found.<eos> Here I come! Ever.<eos> Got you.<eos> They'll never find me.<eos> And they never would.
Oh. That's okay.<eos> However, we were wondering if maybe you'd like to come.<eos> Me?<eos> The alumni like to meet the new generation of Elis... and, plus, we'd love to be able to show you off... to all our friends, wouldn't we, Emily?<eos> - Yes, we would.
What about you?<eos> What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?<eos> - You don't know who I am?<eos> - Should I?<eos> Every other person in here would.
Can I watch?<eos> It seems that Deakin had a point.<eos> Sir? Well, there's no record of any chapel being sold to the Manor.<eos> Clifford said the transaction took place before records began.<eos> Well, he would, wouldn't he?
My own mother flashed me at the gym... and then she insisted she had a better body than me.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> If she bothers you so much... let's have Christian do her lift and send her packing.<eos> She says there's a conflict of interest now, because she screwed him. She's insisting again that you do it.<eos> Would you?
Goodnight, mom.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I never thought this many people would actually show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Because why would they?
Milk chocolate.<eos> Or perhaps you like dark?<eos> I've got it right here.<eos> You don't have a mousetrap in there, do you?<eos> No. Why would I?
Dr Weir.<eos> Is it true you've discovered land on this world?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - My people wish to explore it.<eos> - You would?
How exactly would they accomplish this sort of thing?<eos> Someone took all her dreams away.<eos> What was is no more.<eos> I mean, it's not like she wanted to end up sleeping in a barrel.<eos> Who would?
- Bring me our position.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - You don't want to do this.<eos> - I know I don't.<eos> Because any sane man wouldn't.
Bring me our position.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> I know I don't.<eos> Because any sane man wouldn't.
Yes, he told me.<eos> And you didn't say anything because you were afraid that I might think that father Martin killed the archdeacon.<eos> Do you think father Martin killed the archdeacon?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Then why would I?
Who do you have to know... to get a little Grey Poupon around here?<eos> Ray!<eos> It's you, in my apartment, making a sandwich.<eos> It wouldn't kill you to keep lettuce in the crisper.<eos> No, it wouldn't, Ray.
- Do you know, I would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.<eos> Do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?<eos> You want to go get some coffee with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really would.
I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you.<eos> This may surprise you, but some women consider me quite the guy.<eos> I've never been married. I'm a doctor.<eos> You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women.<eos> Yes, I would.
I'm sure you'll feel unconditional love for me one day.<eos> Are you? - You're sure.<eos> - I'm certain of it.<eos> But I might be gone already.<eos> Why would you?
Uhh!<eos> Uhh...<eos> I've had my share of Prisoners aboard this ship,<eos> So if you wish to die a martyr...<eos> I would.
I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive. People slip, Buffy.<eos> Your mom did. She invited in the mas...<eos> Dracula in for coffee.<eos> Well, that was different. I mean, she...<eos> He would...
This is the same, except people pay for the things they never return. It'll give me focus, help increase my resources.<eos> Boy, you've really thought this through.<eos> Don't break anything.<eos> Just don't touch anything. Not that Buffy's really changed at all.<eos> Like she ever would.
Deal with what, though?<eos> It's not Shakespeare. I'm not writing Schindler's List.<eos> Why do I care? I'm no Spielberg.<eos> The guy won't even meet with me.<eos> -Why would he?
I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her.<eos> - I do!<eos> - Then you should've come!<eos> - I couldn't!<eos> - You wouldn't!
It was a boring, rubber chicken dinner.<eos> I went to the bar for a drink.<eos> Try again. We checked.<eos> The bartender doesn't remember you.<eos> Well, why would he?
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.<eos> THANKS.<eos> BYE.<eos> BYE.<eos> OOH, UH, WOULD YOU, UH...
I'm just looking to see why you... Seem like you staring daggers at me all of a sudden.<eos> I wasn't staring daggers at you.<eos> I was looking at you 'cause you were talking.<eos> I don't think Jones would go with you, anyway.<eos> He would.
I'm afraid that information is confidential.<eos> These are some nice looking papers on your desk.<eos> It would be a shame if somebody shuffled them.<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, wouldn't I?
(Danny) Durand and Hastings are on the move.<eos> (Ruth) 'They're selling to the Chinese.<eos> Keep Jean-Luc distracted.'<eos> - He knows we're on to them.<eos> - 'How? ' Because I would.
You may want to check your teeth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, what about alcohol?<eos> How does it react with Avlocardyl?<eos> It wouldn't.
Heh, talk about your runaway government.<eos> For dumping that waste, you could go to jail.<eos> A handsome man like you, I'd hate to think what would happen.<eos> Ha, ha, I wouldn't go to jail.<eos> The legal owner of this plant would, Canary M. Burns.
There's nothing.<eos> But, uh, this should cheer you up.<eos> It's in her correspondence.<eos> I'm not going to ask if this is the original.<eos> I wouldn't.
