Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone contact the President's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.
I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Pumpkin!<eos> You surprised me.<eos> She likes you.
She was fearless!<eos> And Wild.<eos> You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?
I know the feeling.<eos> Running from your problems never works out.<eos> You need a new plan.<eos> I need a new map.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
Gibbons! Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.
Just happened to know I spoke English.<eos> Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but...
Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but...<eos> I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.
They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.
Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.<eos> The Triple-X program needs you.
Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.
who would you target?<eos> Shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.<eos> I came looking for you, remember?
Hands! Hands!<eos> On your knees, now.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Watch out, Cage.<eos> Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.
It's just me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you come down to get some Fruit Loops?<eos> Okay, okay. Shh!<eos> Here you go.
- I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?<eos> Have you seen my face?<eos> I called you, remember?
There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.<eos> No! I don't want the bag! I want the tape!<eos> We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit.
She's just my tablemate today.<eos> Can I ask what her name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.<eos> There it is.<eos> I may come to you one day asking for Megan-Ann's hand in marriage.
Maybe I should have a word with her actual father?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Same with mine.<eos> Okay, I think this conversation is over, right?<eos> Because it started with you asking for a dance and then the answer to that was no.
This... ...is my nephew.<eos> My name is Walter and I'm a successful businessman.<eos> Nice.<eos> What line of work are you in?<eos> I could ask you the same question.
- He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.<eos> Like a dickhead.<eos> I'm Donny Haczyk.<eos> Good to see you again, Donny.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, I know it's too early to know, but... I know.<eos> Well, I have a request.<eos> Don't call her Jo.<eos> I met you today and you think I'm gonna name my daughter after you?
She died. There was an illness.<eos> My son has not spoken since.<eos> Seven months...<eos> And sixteen days.<eos> Alessio will see you to your room.
Good night, Jakob.<eos> He is very obedient. Hmm.<eos> This is part of it.<eos> To disobey is to say something, so... So he obeys.<eos> He isn't trying to hurt you.
This is part of it.<eos> To disobey is to say something, so... So he obeys.<eos> He isn't trying to hurt you.<eos> That's my son, signorina, not me.<eos> Jakob doesn't want you here.
Jakob?<eos> I didn't... verena.<eos> The nurse, of course.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Let Lilia see you.
She allowed it to flood at the beginning of the war.<eos> And she had her career.<eos> No more need for the stone.<eos> Jakob swims there.<eos> He'll take you there if you wish.
She was the worst and also the best.<eos> And this one?<eos> I have not worked in many months.<eos> You cannot finish it, so you abandoned it.<eos> Perhaps to see you work, it would help Jakob.
He saw terrible things.<eos> He heard...<eos> When she died, I washed her...<eos> A-and tidied her hair.<eos> The room upsets you.
Please. I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you...<eos> I-I think you know what it is I ask.
And yet he has still said nothing.<eos> It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here...<eos> To take care of Jakob and...<eos> And to take care of you.
I want you to stay. Forgive me.<eos> We've been under her spell too long...<eos> Not only Jakob, all of us.<eos> I can't.<eos> No, Jakob needs you.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me just grab a pager for you here, and we'll get you to sit with a banking professional as soon as one becomes available.
You won't be able to miss it.<eos> Where do I wait?<eos> The guest lounge.<eos> (PAGER BUZZING)<eos> We're ready for you now.
MAN:<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.<eos> We've come to make a withdrawal.<eos> (INDISTINCT MURMURING)<eos> Aside from the tellers, we invite you to lie down on the floor, face up, and hold your arms and legs in the air like a pussycat.
I've watched this TV show called Law and Order, and they solve crimes much quicker than you do.<eos> You should tune in.<eos> Well, you know, in the real world, solving crimes takes a little longer than a one-hour television show.<eos> Well, I guess this wraps it up for us, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we need any additional information, then we'll get in contact with you.
Well, I guess this wraps it up for us, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we need any additional information, then we'll get in contact with you.<eos> Oh. You'll need my address and phone number.<eos> Uh, not necessary.<eos> We'll find you.
Well, I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> You can.<eos> I won't mind.<eos> The dialysis is working marginally.<eos> You know, a kidney is all that's going to get you well.
Hey! Halt!<eos> - Halt!<eos> - What are you chasing me for?<eos> Halt!<eos> I heard you the first time.
- Halt!<eos> - What are you chasing me for?<eos> Halt!<eos> I heard you the first time.<eos> Don't make me tase you!
JOE:<eos> What's the plan now?<eos> I'm working on one.<eos> Put your hands up and drop the money.<eos> Okay, in three seconds, I'm going to shoot you.
Welcome to Moscow.<eos> Please enjoy your stay.<eos> - The boss is expecting you.
It would pain him greatly to know what I have done.<eos> He was a proud man.<eos> He would never stoop to begging, as I have.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Your father would be very proud of you.
I mean the 2.5 billion isn't blood money.<eos> It's going for aid to people in need.<eos> Now don't start growing a conscience, Arnie.<eos> You haven't had the experience.<eos> He asked you about your ring, didn't he?
Look... if they'll exchange her for the money, just do it.<eos> They'll just kill me.<eos> They'll kill my daughter.<eos> She doesn't deserve that.<eos> That's why I need you. To handle the exchange. To help us get away safely.
Well, the gas is very cheap here at the moment.<eos> Do you have a name?<eos> Patricia holm.<eos> Simon templar.<eos> Can I offer you a lift somewhere, Ms. holm?
Time we don't have.<eos> Kidnappers didn't happen to leave their phone numbers, did they?<eos> Keep him talking as long as you can.<eos> Templar.<eos> Shame I missed you in San Diego.
Templar!<eos> I could... I couldn't stop him.<eos> He took her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I told you I was going to catch you, didn't I?
You do know we're riding into a trap, don't you?<eos> I think that's the one thing we can count on.<eos> There are six guards on deck.<eos> Once I've taken care of them, get in, take the girl, get out.<eos> When all this is over... I'm taking you in.
How predictable.<eos> The ring, if you please.<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> Send her up.<eos> Finish the job, or I finish you.
You can try, but you better hurry.<eos> You are not leaving me to take the fall for this.<eos> I'm sorry but the brotherhood has decided.<eos> My compliments.<eos> It's taken me an unusually long time to find you.
We too have a holy cause.<eos> To wipe every last templar from the face of the earth.<eos> It's only me you're after.<eos> Leave my family, my wife, out of this.<eos> My father asked you for mercy, not for himself, for his family. And you gave him none.
My father asked you for mercy, not for himself, for his family. And you gave him none.<eos> I'm glad it's you, Simon.<eos> It ought to be you.<eos> But there's more than just me out there.<eos> The brotherhood will be coming after you.
I'm no assassin.<eos> I'm a templar.<eos> You're weak. Like your father.<eos> He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.
Hands up.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Special agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Pleasure to see you again.
Which authorizes the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects.<eos> You see, we don't like to rush into anything without the facts.<eos> Facts that could take a long time to unearth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And as for you, Mr. temp...
Uh, Charlie team three's medevaccing him right now.<eos> Ocre and I blew up a building.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> All right, good job. Good job, private ocre.<eos> Yeah, he can't hear you.
Ocre, cut him loose. Let's go, cut him loose.<eos> Look, this is, uh... This is for your trouble and your little girl there, okay?<eos> We're sorry for the trouble.<eos> Okay, but hey, hey, hey. You can't drive this road anymore, okay?<eos> I don't wanna see you on this road. Machmoud, tell him.
Okay, guys, you got tonight. You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.<eos> And tomorrow we're punching back in.<eos> We're going back to work.<eos> Ocre!<eos> Someone here for you.
- They know.<eos> - Yeah, but they won't help.<eos> Working with the Americans is very dangerous.<eos> How can you guarantee their safety?<eos> Well, they won't be seen collaborating with us. Everything goes through you.
Roger, sir.<eos> Private ocre.<eos> What do you say we get you back on level ground?<eos> There's a convoy leaving at 1400.<eos> It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.
- Uh don't you mean pigeon hole?<eos> - Where the hell is everyone?<eos> (cheering)<eos> - Hey Mackenzie, look at that.<eos> You like that?
And then you went back on the heroin.<eos> My best friend.<eos> Actually, only friend who's never left us.<eos> What is this?<eos> - This is for you.
- I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.<eos> It's not in my interest to squeeze you too hard, and it's not in your interest to provoke me.
The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway.
And so are you.<eos> Don't hurt him!<eos> I'll come back!<eos> I promise!<eos> Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.
Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But of course!<eos> Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
Are there any other tasteless demands... you wish to make upon my artistry?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> There you are, dear.<eos> Ma chere mademoiselle.<eos> It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight. Here!
Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.
I told you.<eos> MacKenzie Allen Phillips.<eos> Well well well.<eos> Look at you.<eos> I know you?
How was it?<eos> Terrible.<eos> It is wonderful.<eos> I'm proud of you, my friend.<eos> Thank you for letting me see you.
Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.<eos> You.<eos> Mr. Wentworth, Mr. Styvesan wants to see you.
'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Styvesan, how's tricks?<eos> The same.<eos> Look, I got a business proposition for you.
There's good money here for you.<eos> Here's an advance.<eos> I'll pay you triple freelance rate.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I know I said a lot of nasty things about you.
No, I do not.<eos> Optimistic Owl.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> "Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."
Taft is dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> He was killed. To death.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?
What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?<eos> - You think that I...?<eos> - He was your competition, right?<eos> You got somebody watching over you.
I'm afraid I wasn't the greatest prize.<eos> Well, he talked about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I pushed him around. I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.
It'll last longer.<eos> I'm not Jewish.<eos> We wouldn't care if you was, mister.<eos> We's former racists.<eos> Good for you.
Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Detective Miller. He works for me on the side.<eos> I thought Styvesan worked for you.
- A little communication would be nice.<eos> Video signal unavailable.<eos> - Sorry, sir, we had to momentarily divert power.<eos> - Audio is working, but outgoing visual signal will be a bit longer.<eos> - I don't need to see you, Linden. I already know what you all look like.
Where was I?<eos> - Atmosphere appearing compound.<eos> -Right.<eos> Recover the cargo. This mission is vital.<eos> We're counting on you.
-Yeah, but why have me memorize it?<eos> What was the point with these mind acrobatics?<eos> -What's wrong?<eos> Tell me what it is.<eos> You're obviously having some issues.
- I don't know, I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> - You have never behaved this irrationally before.<eos> Stop crying, Emma.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Act like what you are. Stop crying.
-Clever girl.<eos> - Warning.<eos> Fire detected in section 7.<eos> Main sprinkler activated.<eos> I'd kill you with my own hands but it wastes too much blood.
That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her. But she is your child.<eos> Please. I beg you... take her to safety.
Please. I beg you... take her to safety.<eos> Is this where we're hiding out?<eos> We're not hiding out.<eos> We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep... clean up, get some new clothes, get a new ride and get outta here.<eos> Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City.
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.<eos> Sometimes it gets itself shut off.<eos> - By assholes. - Hey!<eos> No.<eos> My son is happy to go with you.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl - been like that? - Huh?<eos> Mute.<eos> Uh, since the beginning.<eos> Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property. Huh.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> "Previous" being the operative word.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
What in high...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> We need to intervene.<eos> Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.
And then you hit "brew."<eos> And it's done.<eos> Thank God.<eos> And one Americano.<eos> For you.
Uh, let me explain.<eos> He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching. I caught you.<eos> Just get out of here before I report you.
Yeah.<eos> Well, you know what? Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.<eos> A free period?<eos> What good would that do?<eos> Oh, you know, it's the last day of school and I'm sure they'd like you for it, and this isn't working, so...
Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?
They're out of control this year, sir.<eos> I've never seen anything like it, really.<eos> You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.<eos> And maybe just, you know... Don't fire him.<eos> I am so sorry he fired you.
Hashtag teacher fight?<eos> What is this?<eos> You guys are tweeting about this now?<eos> Why would you agree to fight Strickland?<eos> He could kill you.
MacBook Pro.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.<eos> Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?
Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...<eos> You're a grown man. Now go on and take that ass-whoopin'.<eos> I'm asking you for help and...
You can sit back down.<eos> You wanna fight me, bitch?<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He doesn't wanna fight you anymore.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Who are you? I...<eos> Holly.<eos> We've been flirting, like, all fucking year.<eos> I've been, like, ignoring you all year.
I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that I don't want you here. But why are you here?<eos> Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.<eos> Yeah, how about that, huh?<eos> So, the board wants both of you back at Roosevelt because of this PR mess.
It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there<eos> - moving.<eos> - Because you make me nervous.<eos> Because I feel love when I see you.
You're funny, Seth.<eos> Not aces. We're mere servants.<eos> My tiger's not in the mood.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Seth, I've been working for years under you I want to set up my own business now.
I'm fine.<eos> It's an awesome party!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hey, gymnast!<eos> Excuse me. Who invited you here?
- Excuse me...<eos> - Beat the drum!<eos> Whose guest are you?<eos> Mr Serpent?<eos> Whose guest are you?
Else, he'd have thrashed me.<eos> You say it was foolish but I did it out of Miss Ratna's fear. Fear?<eos> She was a terror!<eos> - Don't mention it to her now. - We're here to give her the invite.<eos> She won't hit you for that.
Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Perhaps that's all there is to it.<eos> Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy. Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.<eos> I swear I will.'<eos> Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.
Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.
There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> Maybe I can still surprise you.
'You've been having dreams.<eos> A recurring dream? '<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.
You can't replace Marty.<eos> I've been going over your file.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you too, sir.
Who is watching?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Again, who is watching?<eos> I didn't say anyone!<eos> I would never betray you. Gregor, please!
A nautical theme your mum picked out, blue and ivory.<eos> Cute little sailing boats and the like. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, pardon me while I fart La Vie En Rose.<eos> He likes you.
- You know, no photo op.<eos> - Mr Miller?<eos> Mr Thomas Miller?<eos> Indianapolis, Indiana?<eos> We'll get you cleaned up back at the embassy.
I was on the seas for months.<eos> When I returned, nothing was the same.<eos> My son was a young lad and my wife was not the woman I had left.<eos> I sat in my own home and did not belong.<eos> She left you?
Right?<eos> I don't believe I'm saying this, but that almost made sense.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - (WILLIS SIGHS)<eos> So, I will get the piggyback for you. I will.
ls everything okay?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)<eos> Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.
That may be our only safe departure window for an unknown period of time.<eos> So, tip for everybody, don't miss it, please.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.
PACKARD:<eos> Griffin Co.!<eos> Thank God you guys are okay!<eos> COLE:<eos> Good to see you, Sir. MILLS:
So, good news.<eos> They say you can shack up here.<eos> I didn't hear them say anything.<eos> Oh, they don't speak too much.<eos> When you've been here as long as I have, you start to understand. You'll see. Wait a minute.
Okay.<eos> Look, I just made that name up.<eos> I'm trying to scare you.<eos> I'm fine calling them that.<eos> - Are you cool with that?
- I'm talking?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Your mouth is moving.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna stab you by the end of the night.
I'd be fine either way.<eos> I just want one last chance to see them.<eos> That'd be good enough for me.<eos> WEAVER:<eos> We're gonna get you home.
MILLS:<eos> Slivko!<eos> Thought you were taking a dirt nap by now, Slivko.<eos> Never thought I'd see you guys again.<eos> - I thought you were crazy.
Whose side are you on, Captain?<eos> Okay, Colonel.<eos> You'll find your Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat.<eos> And we'll wait for you there.
You keep glancing to my left.<eos> I suppose I was just looking away.<eos> There is a difference between looking away and looking to.<eos> - I tend to notice these things.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?<eos> I haven't seen him. No one's seen him. He's locked himself away in his flat.<eos> God knows what he's up to. Do you blame him?<eos> I don't blame him... I don't think about him.<eos> Has he attempted to make contact with you?
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded.<eos> Top to bottom, but no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith. So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.<eos> Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?<eos> The room's small.<eos> - Big brother is watching you.
- Are we gonna walk all night? - Possibly.<eos> It's a long word.<eos> - What is?<eos> Culverton Smith, all this charity work.<eos> What's in it for you?
For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you?<eos> Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John. You need to help him!<eos> -Nope.<eos> He needs you!
Sherlock.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, we're everywhere.<eos> Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?
A walking stick.<eos> Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.<eos> Hello? Ward 73.<eos> Dr Watson...<eos> It's for you.
This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.<eos> Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally, they do not have a single spark of human decency.<eos> Get out of my house. You reptile.<eos> You've been ages waking' up.<eos> I watched you.
I can slip in and out. Whenever I like, you know.<eos> When I get the urge.<eos> H.H. Holmes.<eos> Murder castle, but done right.<eos> I have a question for you.
Go and solve a crime together, make him wear the hat.<eos> - You'll be okay for 20 minutes? - Yes, yes.<eos> Sorry, I wasn't thinking of Rosie.<eos> - No problem. Listen...<eos> - We should... I'll come and see you, soon.
But then...<eos> You have such nice eyes.<eos> Amazing, the times a man doesn't really look at your face.<eos> You can hide behind a sexy smile or a walking cane.<eos> Or just be a therapist, talking about you. All the time.
Oh, them. And that turned out okay.<eos> You think so?<eos> I thought it was supposed to be the beginning of all human misery.<eos> Now, what was all that about arresting me?<eos> Well, maybe not arresting you. - I could just keep you under close watch.
Probably me.<eos> So that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> There's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified, the ones with nowhere else to run.
The pirate.<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, this is a restricted area.<eos> You are off course. Are you receiving?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course. Are you receiving?<eos> Yeah, receiving you.
Go straight to the special unit, deploy green and yellow shift on my authority.<eos> I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side, and frankly, this is embarrassing.<eos> Oh. Doing a cavity search?<eos> The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.<eos> But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?
Smiling is advertising.<eos> Enslaved them.<eos> She's been capable of that since she was five.<eos> She's an adult now.<eos> I warned you.
- He?<eos> - She?<eos> Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment. And afterwards... Well!<eos> Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly.
Do you trust your wife? One question.<eos> That's your voice, isn't it?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> You've got to stop saying these things.<eos> If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prisoner?
- It's okay, he's dead.<eos> - He doesn't sound dead.<eos> This is a recorded announcement.<eos> Please say hello to some very old friends of mine.<eos> Hello? I can hear you talking.
I know that you are scared, but you should also be very proud.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Be quick.<eos> This is very good, Dr Watson.<eos> I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.
One job, to protect Gardner!<eos> To keep him from making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You're hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.
To keep him from making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You're hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> And you wanna know what? We've been shouldering East Texas for you.
Stop being a dick!<eos> Okay. Look, he risked his life to leave the one place he's ever known, all alone, didn't know anybody, never set foot on this planet.<eos> I mean, how scary is that?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I could never do that. Look... Just to meet you.
Animal Liberation Front?<eos> We are good people.<eos> On your side.<eos> Guys!<eos> I'm so sorry we hurt you. It wasn't our intention, okay?
Whereas I am loved... all over the world.<eos> Could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining?<eos> You know...<eos> You are forcing me...<eos> I'm forcing you to do what?
You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> Good day, all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
Yeah, but she really frightens people.<eos> She reminds them of Daddy.<eos> This is mine.<eos> This is my project.<eos> She just wants to support you on your special day.
You look amazing!<eos> Oh, Johnny.<eos> You're skating on thin ice.<eos> Watch out you don't fall in and drown.<eos> Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.
Yeah.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> I see.<eos> Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I'm a little concerned.<eos> I've seen you go through similar phases in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005 and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989 and that weird one in 1966.
Yes!<eos> My name's Richard Grayson, but all the kids at the orphanage call me Dick.<eos> - Well, children can be cruel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great to see you, Bruce.
- Well, children can be cruel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great to see you, Bruce.<eos> - Nice to see you, sir.<eos> - So, I had a question for you, sir.
She's making a lot of sense.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We love you, Barbara!
- En garde.<eos> Hello, family photos.<eos> He lost his parents at a very young age.<eos> I've always wanted one of those.<eos> Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
- Yes!<eos> - And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
So, what do you say, Commish?<eos> Will you work with me?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?<eos> Yeah. please. - Okay.<eos> I used to ride my skateboard around in here.<eos> Someone will be right out to see you. thanks.
So we're saints.<eos> if that's what you think.<eos> Oh! - We're gonna be okay!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Did I wake you?
put him on.<eos> Joy Meachum?<eos> This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?
Joy Meachum?<eos> This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.
Okay. I understand.<eos> just one last favor.<eos> What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.
I'm gonna suggest that you have an anxiety disorder with psychotic features. because now it means we can make a plan for treatment.<eos> I don't want to make any false predictions.<eos> This... this will take time.<eos> you need to let me out of here.<eos> I can't release you now.
It will go directly to your nephew.<eos> Tonight.<eos> How the hell did you manage this?<eos> Rand has many friends.<eos> We'd like to add you to that list.
She'll set something up.<eos> Megan.<eos> set up a meeting with Joy.<eos> I'll check her schedule.<eos> We should be able to squeeze you in sometime in the next two or three days.
- What happened to you?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> uh...<eos> Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?<eos> Wasn't he stalking you?
Joy Meachum broke that deal.<eos> We wanted words with her.<eos> No.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.
Radovan, the chemist.<eos> I'm Danny.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> No.<eos> Leave me, I beg of you. I got you.
I'm Danny.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> No.<eos> Leave me, I beg of you. I got you.<eos> Come on, I got you.
I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan...<eos> - I... I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> we need to take care of you.
Looks like it.<eos> Car door.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> We'll be with you as soon as we can.
And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.<eos> History says that the Iron Fist and the Hand are mortal enemies.<eos> But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.
We should brighten up this office, yes?<eos> I'll put in an order for some lamps.<eos> Come.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.
I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.
You've been ousted from Rand.<eos> Sabina... Sabina's fine.<eos> She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.
Did you have a number in mind?<eos> Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now. You never have to see my face again.<eos> I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.<eos> So... I would be willing to compensate you for that.
By who?<eos> When?<eos> She called less than an hour ago.<eos> Joy didn't consult me... and she certainly doesn't speak for me.<eos> I'm asking you, as a favor.
I just...<eos> - I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.
You deny it?<eos> Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.
You are looking for who you want to be. Searching for your destiny.<eos> But it's selfish of you to involve Danny in your quest.<eos> He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.<eos> The only thing that can come out of this for you is sorrow, heartbreak, and pain.
I really like my job, Mr. Rand.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in this position, but it's really important.<eos> There's no one else I can turn to.<eos> If you get caught, you never saw me.
I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.
- Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.
You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.
But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.
A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.<eos> take it.<eos> J-Money.<eos> I can take you to him.
I don't know.<eos> There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?
- What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go. Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
Mom, are you okay?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine.<eos> I still have one last wish granted to me.<eos> And I'm willing to make a deal.<eos> I'll agree to wish for you to have unlimited wishes, giving you complete control over the box.
$11 million!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Murdock.<eos> - Oh, my pleasure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
I'm sorry. We weren't sure if we were in the right place.<eos> Not today.<eos> Probably not tomorrow, either.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> - I read about what you did.
- He's been different?<eos> Secretive?<eos> - Maybe even a little nervous?<eos> - And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?
Is there anything that you can do?<eos> You know, I think it's my grandfather and he's senile and he might be trying to get a hold of me.<eos> Actually, I have a missing person's report.<eos> I have the number right in front of me.<eos> I can read it to you if you want.
I've stitched up enough knife wounds at the shelter to know if you're looking for the current criminal hotspot, the place to go is on 188th Street.<eos> Rathole called Trouble and a Pair of Dice.<eos> I'm told your donation to the Philharmonic should just about cover the remodeling.<eos> A small price to pay in the larger scheme of things.<eos> You know, with the kind of support you've provided, we would love to host you at our next gala.
Are you always this rude to people trying to help you?<eos> You know what? I'm gonna find my own lawyer, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, in reality, you don't need one.<eos> After talking to the lead detective outside, it appears that despite the mess you got yourself into, the NYPD doesn't actually have anything to hold you on, so...
No, he's... not. Not at the moment.<eos> And who were the clients?<eos> That's privileged information.<eos> I'm sure you understand.<eos> Uh, but I do have another structure that you might be interested in.
You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
- Let's talk about it never.<eos> Unless you wanna tell me how a blind man moves the way you do.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I have pictures, asshole.<eos> Rand Enterprises has put together a case to take you down.
And you can't hide anymore.<eos> - Does it look like we're hiding?<eos> - Behind Midland Circle Financial.<eos> Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.
- In the penthouse.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time... I won't kill you.
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> - Good to see you again.
- Hey, I said we're closed! We need to stay off the streets.<eos> Well, stay off them somewhere else.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> You can't do that. You'd be putting the cops in danger.<eos> - I'll put you in danger.
- I'm done explaining this.<eos> What are you doing? Whoa! She is very strong.<eos> Sir, this is for your protection. We need this place to look closed.<eos> It is closed!<eos> We have no intention of hurting you.
I gotta go.<eos> - Where? I can't be a part of this.<eos> If you ask me, you already are.<eos> We need to put it all on the table.<eos> - I don't know you.
- I don't know you.<eos> I don't owe you any...<eos> You wanna take your hand off my shoulder?<eos> Take off the mask.<eos> You're not gonna like where this is heading.
Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.<eos> My organization has always had a great deal of respect for the protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> Your respect means nothing to me.<eos> My only purpose is to take you down.
For all your talk of life, you sure kill a lot of people.<eos> I don't think we've been properly introduced.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> I can see you've formed a kind of bond here.<eos> And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.
I don't think we've been properly introduced.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> I can see you've formed a kind of bond here.<eos> And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.<eos> They will disappoint you.
I can see you've formed a kind of bond here.<eos> And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.<eos> They will disappoint you.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will not make you stronger.
If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.<eos> Now, to protect you, I need your cooperation.
Are you sure about that?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The more I tell you, the more danger I put you in.
An interesting metaphor.<eos> But if you knew me at all... you'd know... I hunt the wolf.<eos> If you knew me at all, you'd know I always win.<eos> In the boardroom...<eos> Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.
Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.<eos> The same one that came after John Raymond.<eos> What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?
What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."<eos> Now I hear they took Danny Rand.<eos> A person with that high of a profile?<eos> If this falls back on you... it's gonna make your life miserable.
Suit yourself.<eos> We've had no luck identifying the bodies we found in the warehouse with you.<eos> And though you two have colorful histories, I have reminded the NYPD - we have no evidence...<eos> ...to suggest that you were responsible.<eos> Now, I trust Detective Knight, and she says that, although you're being tight-lipped, the best way to proceed is to treat you as witnesses and not suspects.
Oh, you can do that... after I book them for obstruction. And you.<eos> Just a word. In private.<eos> I would like to explain to them how best to cooperate in building your case.<eos> Well, I hope they like what you have to say.<eos> Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you in a room with two super-powered people.
And you think you're going to right that wrong?<eos> It's what this journey has all been for.<eos> Then you are as naive as when I first laid eyes on you.<eos> Just a child... walking with your mother.<eos> She made you hold her hand as you crossed the street.
- Oh. - I gotta get home.<eos> Okay, folks, you need to go back inside immediately.<eos> Um, Officer, sorry, uh,<eos> I don't live here, so could I just go to my car and I'll just get out of here.<eos> One less person you have to worry about.
I am entitled to be in a relationship with Mickey.<eos> I mean, that's what I want.<eos> I can't fuck this up again. Okay.<eos> Well, that's your time.<eos> - And I'm gonna see you next week, okay? - Okay.
Come on, boy.<eos> Night, John.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'd like to see the manager.<eos> How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.
59, 0, 3.5.<eos> Jonathan!<eos> Julius.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Nice to see you.
He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.<eos> He did warn you.
Mr. Wick doesn't remember, but we met many years ago, before my ascension.<eos> When I was just a pawn in the game.<eos> We met and you gave me a gift, the gift that would make me a king.<eos> You don't remember, but there I was, standing in an alleyway.<eos> I didn't even hear you coming.
That's a million dollars a round, baby.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your descent into Hell begins here, Mr. Wick.<eos> He's at the museum.<eos> Earl will guide you.
Oh, and remember... you owe me.<eos> You don't want me owing you.<eos> Welcome everyone.<eos> Let us toast to the future of the High Table, and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.<eos> Nice to see you.
All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.<eos> I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.<eos> He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.
High Table?<eos> And the Continental?<eos> You killed a man on company grounds, Jonathan.<eos> You leave me no choice but to declare you excommunicado.<eos> The doors to any service or provider in connection with the Continental are now closed to you.
That's what your father wanted and that's why he signed the estate over to him.<eos> Plain and simple, you owe the bank just north of, $6 million.<eos> $6 million!<eos> All money borrowed against the ranch to keep it afloat.<eos> But in 90 days, the probate process is going to catch up with you and the bank's gonna want this house to cover the debt.
I'll pay for it, just make it happen.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, Stella, this is Patrick, my new coach.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
I told you, ma'am, I've no interest in breaking any laws.<eos> You know what, that's enough with the ma'am stuff, my name is Stella, okay?<eos> And I, Stella, would love your help.<eos> Please, okay?<eos> I won't turn you in, okay?
Well, look, I'm covered in hay and dirt and horse shit, just tell me!<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> There is a program that could help us with the horses, but it involves doing something I'm not comfortable with, going back to prison.<eos> So, that's the situation, Mr. bussey.<eos> Look, if you can get the department of corrections to approve you for the prep program, you got my blessing.
You gotta cover every inch of the place. Twenty-four hour recorded feed. - Got it.<eos> - Twenty-four hours?<eos> The prison rehabilitation equine program works mostly with inmates incarcerated for non-violent reasons. Drugs, theft, fraud.<eos> They're more likely to hack into your computer, than hack you to pieces.<eos> Still, we gotta cover ourselves for liability to protect you and us both.
Well, I don't have six weeks.<eos> Look, animal assisted programs lower recidivism rates, they teach the inmates nurturing and compassion and give them some valuable work skills.<eos> That's our objective, miss Davis, not saving your ass.<eos> All right, well, the good news, miss Davis, is you've got a prep graduate right here running the show and he cared enough to call in a big favor for ya, so...<eos> You implement all these security measures and I will see what i can do about freeing up the state funds for you as fast as I can, okay?
Scottish.<eos> It's Irish if I say it's Irish and if you can't listen to me, you can't hear what these horses have to say and that makes you no damn good to me.<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Got it.<eos> But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.
That's it.<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I want so much for you to feel better.<eos> Hey, Ms. Stella.<eos> Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Because we're a team.<eos> Listen, her offer's only good if I discredit the program, the guys and you.
Mrs. Meredith parish.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Charlotte.<eos> And it is my pleasure to serve.<eos> I just hope that i can inspire you all to give of yourselves.
Plus, they're the trainers, these horses will only come to them.<eos> Hey, folks!<eos> Welcome to usa qha regionals.<eos> If you're participating in tomorrow's auction, please register over at tent number four.<eos> Looking forward to seeing you there.
Mr. jt told me a story once.<eos> About how your great-grandmother named the double diamond, not 'cause diamonds are pretty but 'cause they're unbreakable.<eos> I was the one who told him that story.<eos> And I get it, toughen up, but I'm not in the mood for a lesson right now.<eos> I wasn't trying to give you a lesson, just tell you that whatever happens tomorrow, great-grandmother would be proud to call you her blood.
400 then.<eos> May I?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, I'm Stella Davis, I'm the owner of the double diamond ranch.<eos> I just felt I needed to come up here and remind you that these noble creatures helped build our country.
Yeah!<eos> Good luck with your continued work.<eos> - Congratulations. - Thanks.<eos> You've got a great horse here in old buster.<eos> He'll do it for you.
Oh, I'll be okay until Monday.<eos> You know, maybe I'll just check and see if the hens...<eos> Oh, everything's fine, no, go see your son.<eos> You're a good man, bratt.<eos> Your son's gonna love you.
I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ana, I've been hearing a lot of good things about you.
So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.<eos> He was lost without you. Oh.
Christian has a date.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Elena.<eos> I wanted to meet you.
Sorry?<eos> New York. Book expo. This Friday.<eos> It's in the diary.<eos> No, yeah, I know. Yeah, i booked your room. Of course.<eos> And you.
We're aware that you have other bidders and some of them may offer what look like better terms, but...<eos> Hello?<eos> Christian?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Oh, excuse me, miss Steele, i didn't mean to startle you.
You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you. Uh, about New York.<eos> There a problem? Um...<eos> I'm so grateful for the opportunity, Jack, but with such short notice, i made plans that I can't change. Huh.<eos> But I will have my phone on me all weekend. So if you need anything, I'm available.
Liz, hi!<eos> Ana, don't know if you heard, but Jack resigned last night.<eos> Sip isn't recruiting right now, so we're screwed.<eos> So you don't need me anymore then?<eos> I'm gonna try to find you something temporary.
Thank you.<eos> Ana, let me introduce to you, my good friend, Elena Lincoln.<eos> We met at the masquerade.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nice to see you again.
You, however, are certifiably insane.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt. Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, well, coming right up.<eos> I see you heeded our little talk.<eos> What makes you think i would ever listen to you?
What makes you think i would ever listen to you?<eos> You don't care about Christian.<eos> He'll see that.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> He'll see right through you.
Excuse me, did you Mr, Lernik?<eos> I Major Larina, Now I responsible for Patriot Program,<eos> You want to use me for your advantage, yeah?<eos> Now I live here alone with as a shepherd, Being a Hermit,<eos> Lernik, I'm here to offer you chance of revenge,
I killed him,<eos> Jealousy caused my brother's death,<eos> How can I be better to kill him?<eos> I mourn the loss of your brother,<eos> But we need you,
- You need a hand?<eos> Yeah, I think I do<eos> Sounds like you're not getting any fuel Yeah<eos> See if we can get some power into it<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel Yeah<eos> See if we can get some power into it<eos> What brings you to Cuba?<eos> The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
So, what is it? Black, no sugar?<eos> I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today<eos> Now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me<eos> Work for you?
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind<eos> Number one, I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet<eos> And number two, You go out there, you do your job. And you take 'em down
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin<eos> - Shit - This thing can wipe out..<eos> An entire electrical grid in a major city<eos> No lights, no power, instant stone age.<eos> Chloe, Maya... You can't let her run by you like that
I need to be clear here<eos> US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway<eos> You're on your own<eos> This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out
What boyband bus did she fallen off?<eos> My new junior associate<eos> He's working with me on this.<eos> All yours<eos> Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this
Oh come on. Give him a break<eos> Get a break<eos> Luke?<eos> I appreciate that<eos> - It's good to see you, Nobody
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom<eos> You're a genuine outlaw<eos> I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules<eos> Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you.. let him keep his car?
- With your sister<eos> - Toretto?<eos> - That's interesting you ask<eos> This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere<eos> Nice little stair for you
You stressed out?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Jimothy, could you just, um... Just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> Is he giving you a stressy vibe?
So great to finally meet you.<eos> - Jack, right?<eos> - That would be Ginnie's stepfather. Right.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> She's talked a lot about you, too.
What are you, Dora the Explorer?<eos> Fuck that. You're coming with.<eos> I would love to.<eos> Just apparently I have a show coming up, - and I really need to rehearse.<eos> - I'll pay you, okay?
- Sweet.<eos> You like Bob Seger? Yeah.<eos> I love Bob Seger.<eos> "Beautiful Loser," "Stranger in Town," those are some of my favorite albums ever.<eos> Might be hope for you yet.
Well, want to grab a bite? - Here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Gotta refuel, right? I mean, you must be starving.<eos> Let me buy you dinner.
I'm tooling around with her dad. She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.<eos> So she's dating someone else.<eos> So what?<eos> I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?<eos> Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to know where she is?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.<eos> Hey, you know that other girl at the club?<eos> - What do you mean, "what girl?"<eos> The one I saw you talking to.<eos> She's into you. What, Lois?
How...<eos> How did you even...<eos> - You weren't even there. - Jesus, Martin, wake up.<eos> 90% of that shit is body language, okay?<eos> - She's into you.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.<eos> When you and Ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?<eos> Where?<eos> Um, that's not really, um... That's kind of private.<eos> Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
It's okay. I'm her father.<eos> Whoa, whoa, Mr. Gallo, you are not...<eos> Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.<eos> Okay, this is a very bad idea. You know what, Martin?<eos> I'm starting to see why Ginnie kicked you to the curb.
And you have pledged to give us the names of the Americans who conspired with you, and others unnamed, to commit acts of treason within the confines of the City of London.<eos> Mr Delaney...<eos> Mr Delaney, unless you give up the names of your co-conspirators Every single stitch they have just put into your flesh I will pull out myself with my fingernails.<eos> Give us the names, or you will be racked!<eos> I will squash your balls myself and make you eat the paste.
You're mad to have even come here.<eos> We are an angry nation. Yeah.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.<eos> Post for you, madam.
Something for your book.<eos> The lioness will fiercely protect her cubs, regardless of the consequences.<eos> Even if that means her certain death.<eos> Helga.<eos> Is that who you mean?
His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.<eos> After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq, Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.<eos> A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.<eos> General.<eos> We're all very excited to have you here.
Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - No, finish your phone call.<eos> The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.<eos> General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.<eos> - Glen.<eos> - Pat.<eos> Great to see you.
But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.<eos> I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
I can handle that for you, sir.<eos> Sorry. No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.<eos> And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.<eos> - I thought I was being fair.<eos> - It's not a question of fair, Glen.<eos> It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?<eos> Why am I seeing you on the television?
You're gonna get on the phone to Bob Gates and...<eos> Hang on, Dick.<eos> You're cutting out.<eos> I can't hear you. Can you hear me?<eos> Yeah, I can hear you.
- Hi. Hi, honey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, I've been delayed.<eos> The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two be. I'll be...
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?<eos> Just move the needle a little bit.<eos> Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.<eos> That's all you gotta do.<eos> That's how this ends best for you anyway.
It's good to talk.<eos> Everybody.<eos> How are you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you again.
Everybody.<eos> How are you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you again.<eos> - How you doing?
- Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> How's it going?<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Nice to see you again. - All right.
How's it going?<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Nice to see you again. - All right.<eos> Take care now.<eos> It's good to see you, Mr. President.
Take care now.<eos> It's good to see you, Mr. President.<eos> All right, see you soon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - It's great to see you, General.
You both look beautiful.<eos> Really.<eos> Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there, I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.<eos> Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.<eos> He's been doing that profile piece on you.
- Yes?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.<eos> Oh, hey, there.<eos> I'm sorry. Pleased to meet you.
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.<eos> General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.<eos> I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.<eos> But there were some very interesting people there today.<eos> If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
I appreciate that.<eos> My schedule's very tight.<eos> Of course.<eos> Totally understood.<eos> General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, sir.<eos> I've been trying to contact you. Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
Your people.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.<eos> But I am behaving like a leader.<eos> I'm unavailable.<eos> I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
It was glib.<eos> I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.<eos> There's gonna be thousands of parades.<eos> Thousands of 'em all over America.<eos> Only none of them will be for you.
- You think this is me being crazy?<eos> - Peter! Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
- Sir.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Dick.<eos> Glen.<eos> The president wants to see you in DC.
The store is definitely my baby.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Uh, Norman Bates.<eos> I'm Madeleine Loomis.<eos> Well, it's sure been nice meeting you.
Luminol, yes.<eos> No, w-well, I-I... I don't know what that is.<eos> I have no idea. I didn't order that, okay?<eos> So... no, no, no. No.<eos> I'm gonna get them to call you, and then we can figure this out, because it's ridiculous.
David Davidson.<eos> Uh, that's my name.<eos> You don't need any other information.<eos> There's the money. May I have a key?<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you,
Someone's gonna hear it.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Norman, hurry.<eos> Just chuck it in the water! Make it shut up.<eos> An inmate at the Bend Correctional Facility is attempting to contact you.
Mr. Murray, Jack Ferguson, San Antonio Daily Journal.<eos> I don't give quotes on my mother, Mr. Ferguson.<eos> - I assume that's what you're after.<eos> - Uh, sort of. I'm looking into your family's disappearance.<eos> Roy Collier call you?
First off, there isn't any.<eos> And second off, your God manifests itself through organized churches, your organized movement.<eos> And every single one of them, including you, is always interested in money.<eos> You show me once where Jesus Christ passed out a collection plate.<eos> Now, Madalyn, I... I see you here... and I hear you talking.
All this religious nonsense...<eos> Because where you're going, there's gonna be a lake of fire.<eos> There's gonna be a weeping' and a wailin' and a gnashing of teeth.<eos> You gotta be kiddin' me!<eos> What the hell do you care where I go, what I believe?
Mr. Waters.<eos> Thank you, Roy.<eos> Ms. O'Hair, it is a pleasure.<eos> Oh, well, have a seat.<eos> I saw you on Carson last week.
She would've appreciated that.<eos> Also charged with the murder of a third kidnapper.<eos> Please, no prayers.<eos> She wouldn't have wanted that.<eos> Does it worry you that, uh, when you die, that there's not going to be nirvana or whatever you care to call it?
As a result of this lunacy, the character of Lady Larken will no longer be pregnant out of wedlock.<eos> We have a state-mandated teen-mothers program at our school, but the board thinks an unwed storybook mom is too scandalous?<eos> Lady Larken and I aren't both perfectly pretty, and I don't have her perfect soprano voice.<eos> But the truth is... the Lady and I have a lot more in common than you'd ever guess.<eos> So, Mr. Healy... this hot flow is for you.
I'm sorry, but it's hypocritical...<eos> If you won't print my stories, then maybe I'll write a new one about freedom of speech in high schools.<eos> The Oregonian might be interested.<eos> Are you recording me?<eos> Just so I don't misquote you.
By its very definition, oppression is cruel and unjust.<eos> The question becomes, how much weight should we give to this pain?<eos> Justice also maintains credibility as a central value, because the concept which regulates the terms of all social contracts as well as being an unlimited good...<eos> People talk down to us because they're looking down at us.<eos> Being short in America today means that we're facing a variety of prejudices, and I am here to convince you that those challenges and prejudices that height-challenged Americans face today are not only real, but pervasive, and they should be dealt with.
I screwed up a lot of stuff, and now...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.
They all just disappeared?<eos> I didn't say they disappeared. I said they left.<eos> Did they leave in a cloud of green smoke?<eos> They just left!<eos> We didn't mean to upset you.
Which tells me...<eos> Nothing.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Then I have no use for you.
World War II.<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> He wants the Hunt for himself.<eos> He wants his own supernatural army.<eos> We're not letting you through that rift.
Now what do we do?<eos> Try and talk to him.<eos> Mr. Ghost Rider?<eos> Mr. Rider?<eos> We'll let you out if you tell us how to get our friends back.
- That was so hot.<eos> I'd almost say you enjoy this, Scott.<eos> The pursuit of utterly futile endeavors.<eos> Step back from the diverter.<eos> Or I'll make you step back.
- Yeah.<eos> Well, you can ride a motorcycle. I'll give you that.<eos> Yes, ma'am, like a motherfucker.<eos> Okay. I'mma level with you, Jon.<eos> - I like you.
You remind me of my husband.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Today's your lucky day.<eos> I'm gonna graduate you on a probationary clause, which means if you are not in the top 10% of your department for conduct, safety, and citations, you're a fucking goner.
Eventually, I did.<eos> That's why I said, "At the time".<eos> That's the defendant's wife!<eos> The defendant in your case!<eos> I hear you loud and clear, sir.
What are we gonna do, go and change it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Your name is Officer Francis Llewellyn Poncherello and you're transferring from CHP in Redding.<eos> Captain Lindel will be the only person that knows you're FBI.<eos> She put you with a rookie named Jon Baker.
All right, take care, man.<eos> Do you have a favorite artist?<eos> I have a favorite size.<eos> Backpack.<eos> We've just the piece for you.
We dig.<eos> Where's the workbench?<eos> - Is there a garage?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll show you.
That's standard, boss.<eos> - That's standard?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Wow, things have changed!<eos> - Hey, it was great meeting you.
Yeah.<eos> Not sure.<eos> It always takes me until Thanksgiving to start putting names to faces.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause he was supposed to do some sort of extra credit thing for you.
Ma'am, where's the church?<eos> Well, it's not a church anymore.<eos> That's when I hit rock bottom.<eos> I guess the worst part of it for me was that I let down my kids, I let down my husband.<eos> Raise your hand if life ever let you down.
Please.<eos> Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Served three and were due to be released on Friday.<eos> Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.
He takes care of everything, all the bills.<eos> I've just got to get back for his christening, and everything will be all right.<eos> You know what?<eos> He... He'll take care of me.<eos> We're gonna get you in First. Get...
A man gets out of prison, he should concentrate above all on not going back. Don't worry about me.<eos> I got an eye for these things.<eos> Just the one, but I can see that you're not used to the fresh air, but I don't see the joy of being out.<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> What should I call you if I were so inclined?
Hippie parent.<eos> Mama had a big afro?<eos> "Dancing Queen,."<eos> Yeah. She had the whole kit.<eos> And if I was inclined, what might I call you?
I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.<eos> How many miles is it from here?<eos> I've only been on three other dates from the computer.<eos> I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you... I'm glad my kids forced me into getting on that stupid thing.
We are the flow.<eos> What you offer is existential crisis aversion.<eos> Don't look over there, look over here.<eos> Don't listen to that, listen to this.<eos> You provide a product, an innovative distraction and you keep innovating it and you keep providing it.
I'm good. How are you?<eos> We're huggers.<eos> Yes. This is my mom. This is Chris.<eos> Hi, welcome.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. She's right, I'm wrong.<eos> See?<eos> Does he have an off button?<eos> This is exhausting.<eos> I know. I wanna give you a tour.
Right.<eos> Sorry about last night.<eos> What?<eos> My exercise.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.
- He's much better.<eos> I imagine that I owe you all an apology. No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> Hmm. And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.<eos> Your wife... she died in the early hours of this morning.<eos> An automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?
You already dead, asshole.<eos> At least die a sacrifice for something worthwhile.<eos> Let the motherfucker burn!<eos> Let it all burn!<eos> - Were you shot at?
That's all the file has.<eos> - It'll have been shredded long ago.<eos> We waste no time, disclose no information.<eos> We know your unit operated in East Kachekistan in the late 70s.<eos> The photo shows you with KGB agents.
I'm aware that experience is not a factor for you, Mr Schell.<eos> Luckily it's not your call.<eos> Let me take our task force down there.<eos> We've got contacts, data, all we need to work there.<eos> You know that if anyone discovers our captured agent is your father, both he and you will be vulnerable.
Boys, am I glad to see you.<eos> Hey, girly...<eos> Over here. Take a seat.<eos> When someone comes in, offer them a drink and say:<eos> "Mr von Falkenberg will be right with you." You can manage that, huh?
You're kidding, right, Falk?<eos> Because of that old story...<eos> Yes.<eos> - You're still not changed.<eos> I want to see you pedalling in five.
Jaecki!<eos> Well?<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Did you want something else?<eos> Can I do anything else for you?
Your face looks very European.<eos> You have such pretty, pale skin.<eos> We go back six generations...<eos> Do you have Kachek blood in your veins?<eos> Excuse me. An old friend is here to see you.
I don't know to this day whose daughter she is.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - First you have Martha betray me, then you steal my child?<eos> - She didn't betray you, asshole.<eos> We discovered you with our bugs.
Dr. Harber, before we're live,<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.<eos> Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.<eos> The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.<eos> And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.<eos> Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Uh...<eos> Ah. Don't worry about it.<eos> That's all right. Next time.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> There's always a place at my tables for you, Mr. Mukherjee.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Vince: So, Karolina. - Huh.<eos> - Downtown. Oh, yeah?<eos> Can I give you a ride?
In one version, you convince your son to have us bond his additional bail, and your story goes on as before.<eos> You're the Employer Of the Year, loved by her community.<eos> In the other version, you fuck us over, we sue you and your son in civil for what happened the other night.<eos> And at trial, everyone in the tri-state area finds out that you told your son to shoot my granddaughter, and that will be just the beginning.<eos> We will drag you through a hellscape of public humiliation until you either decide to try to start over somewhere else or you make the smart decision... and sit in your garage listening to some soothing light jazz on the car radio

Oh, look.<eos> Oh!<eos> My first two years I was under contract with a company called Metro Home Video.<eos> And being under contract was an ideal situation for me because I wanted to feature dance.<eos> Back then, when you were the contract star, they made these glamorous posters and fliers for you, and they gave you as many as you wanted to go out on the road and use as marketing materials.
"we want to shoot a movie about Sarah Palin, and we want to call it "Nailin' Paylin."<eos> "Who's Nailin' Paylin?" which I thought was a great name.<eos> We want to use you, you're perfect for it.<eos> This is gonna kind of be a big deal.<eos> We hate to trouble you, but I'm afraid we have a flat tire.
Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming.<eos> I just want you to have an ally.<eos> Two allies.<eos> Count me in as well.<eos> So, just to be clear, we should smile at you in the hallway too?
Attendance.<eos> So, I guess this has to do with your attendance.<eos> What is it?<eos> Daily report.<eos> You're on attendance alert starting this week.
Thank you for making the time.<eos> I-I, uh...<eos> I know how busy you are.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> What can I do for you?
She didn't say much.<eos> This lawsuit could cost the district tens of thousands, hundreds, and that's if we win.<eos> We're already getting calls from the media. Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> And she never came to you, for help?
Yeah, we just got his medicine.<eos> Everything all right at home?<eos> Yes, sir, I've just been sick.<eos> I'll be there tomorrow.<eos> I won't let you down.
In our experience, relative to many other schools, we do not have a problem with bullying.<eos> Then why did that girl do it?<eos> That girl's name is Hannah.<eos> Mrs. Baker.<eos> It's so good to see you.
Genius is so often misunderstood.<eos> Mud divers!<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You kept listening, didn't you?
Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> But you knew that already.<eos> I what?<eos> I knew you looked familiar.
Sorry.<eos> Um, can I... I need to go to the office.<eos> Hello, Courtney.<eos> Hi, Miss Douglas, how are you?<eos> It's so good to see you.
Understand what I'm saying?<eos> No, what are you saying?<eos> People start asking questions.<eos> Those tapes get out, it...<eos> I thought you said you didn't listen to the tapes.
I will get coffee.<eos> - Um, what's your drink?<eos> Double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles, please.<eos> Nice.<eos> How may I help you, sir?
And you took him to task for it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You paid a price.<eos> That's what we gotta do sometimes.<eos> Look, Alex, I know fighting isn't your thing, and you should avoid fighting when you can, but sometimes you can't.
Okay, Mr. Porter.<eos> Clay, we can continue this discussion at another time.<eos> I have to say, I'm a little surprised.<eos> What? Why?<eos> I know it's been a few weeks, but you seem like the type of kid to follow through on a promise.
Don't worry, Clay. I almost forgot too.<eos> Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.
Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.<eos> They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.
-I'm sorry.<eos> -No, that's okay.<eos> You're hurting.<eos> And I want to help.<eos> I want to be there for you, Clay.
I mean, I like her poem, I think, but I'm not sure I'd want to hang out with her.<eos> Well... duty calls.<eos> Hi, Clay.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you at work.
Let's go.<eos> Mind your own fucking business, you got it?<eos> - Come on. I know. - What the fuck is his problem?<eos> Mr. Baker.<eos> Okay, uh... what can I do for you?
Are you serious?<eos> She talks about drowning with stones tied to her feet.<eos> She talks about being lost for good.<eos> Mr. Baker... a lot of teens talk about being lost.<eos> Well, God help them if they come to you.
Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?<eos> Start with them.<eos> Your classmates are concerned about you, and so are we.
About everything, all right?<eos> Can I go now?<eos> Please.<eos> You can have a seat over there.<eos> Your mom will pick you up shortly.
Not what happens... but what you decide to do about it.<eos> Please, my wife.<eos> I was on the phone with my wife.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Sir, stay calm. We're gonna take care of you.
Was it a girl who called?<eos> I can't give you that information, ma'am.<eos> We have units responding to the scene now.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
What if we lose this lawsuit?<eos> Then the school walks away without having to acknowledge they're wrong, without changing the way they do things.<eos> We owe it to Hannah... to Hannah, to fight this.<eos> And we owe it to the next kid to make sure... this doesn't happen again.<eos> How can I help you?
Shoulders back.<eos> Breathe in.<eos> Breathe out.<eos> Then you shoot.<eos> Clay, we're just so glad to finally meet you.
Breathe in.<eos> Breathe out.<eos> Then you shoot.<eos> Clay, we're just so glad to finally meet you.<eos> Jeff was so fond of you.
I just, um... helped him with punctuation and word choice and stuff like that.<eos> You know, research techniques and...<eos> Well, we sure are grateful.<eos> You were a good friend to him.<eos> How come we haven't met you before if you're such a good friend?
Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.<eos> Destroying evidence.<eos> I'm not gonna let the school go down at the hands of whatever disturbed sophomore latched onto the term "Cum Dumpster."<eos> Okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let them pin this on our staff or on you and Jane and me.
Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> $7.79.<eos> Whoops, sorry.<eos> Do I know you?
It's just... I know I'm still on suspension, but I... I needed to talk.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> I was glad to see you on my calendar.
Listen, what about your friends?<eos> Do you care about them?<eos> Friends? What friends?<eos> Now, I know you have friends.<eos> I see you in the halls.
I see you in the halls.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Jessica Davis.<eos> Alex Standall.<eos> And I've seen you around with Courtney Crimsen.
Why did she make that choice?<eos> We can't know that for sure.<eos> What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
I know.<eos> I... I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean... that, I guess.<eos> So what happened, Hannah?<eos> How did you get here?
Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?
But I need to know exactly what happened, and who did it.<eos> If I tell you... will you promise me that he'll go to jail?<eos> And I won't ever have to see his face again, that I won't have to face him?<eos> I can't promise you that, Hannah.<eos> But I will promise you this: I will do everything in my power to keep you safe and protect you in this process.
We have time.<eos> Uh...<eos> Okay. I have these vegetables they told me to bring over, uh, and the basket's pretty heavy.<eos> For me, I mean.<eos> Probably not you.
- the last time you were here.<eos> - Yes, you did. But we're not here to take more of that.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You're moving up in the world.<eos> Negan wants you where he is.
Enjoy it, Emma... while you can.<eos> You can't steal water from your neighbor, Ana Sofia.<eos> The city is behind on refilling your tank, you're just gonna...<eos> Have to go to town to get water, like everybody else.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna arrest you this time... But please, don't let there be a next.
I'm crash Murphy. We weren't properly introduced.<eos> Hi, I'm Emma.<eos> You're very young to be doing this.<eos> I studied agriculture at uc Berkeley... And then I invested in this farm. Perfect timing, right?<eos> Your dad, he talked about you a lot.
Hi, I'm Adam Campbell. Hi.<eos> I'm...<eos> Emma Gardner, yes, who donates to Greenpeace... The world wildlife fund, and the Sierra club... But for some reason, not us.<eos> How do you know so much...<eos> I looked you up on Facebook.
Patrick never gave up on her.<eos> And your dad, well, he was not afraid of waking sleeping dogs.<eos> Sons of bitches... wait here.<eos> Hola.<eos> What can I do for you?
Yeah, that's his car right there.<eos> If you could read, the letters on the side spell sheriff.<eos> I can read, f-o-o-l. "Fool".<eos> Just like you.<eos> I told you to keep your stupid mouth shut.
What about Reynoso?<eos> Like I said, all done.<eos> You need anything else?<eos> Disappear.<eos> I don't want to see you within 100 miles of this town.
Disappear.<eos> I don't want to see you within 100 miles of this town.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I live here.<eos> The Gardner girl knows you.
Your success rate is 11 percent.<eos> Water is scarce, or hadn't you noticed.<eos> Well, it's not that scarce, really.<eos> Drillers hit water 48 percent of the time.<eos> So, I'm asking you, who's paying you to make sure... That farmers are digging dry holes?
Ron Skinner's signature is all over the paperwork.<eos> Nico he hired thugs to intimidate farmers... Into selling their land.<eos> What about Reynosa?<eos> And your money... of attorney to purchase the land.<eos> And he's been using all of you to depreciate land values... By creating environmental roadblocks. All so he could purchase it for pennies on the dollar.
Is there any way I can make this right?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, today is a good day to be a farmer.<eos> We have found a friend in Mrs. Stephanie Windemere.<eos> I have longed for a legacy that I can be proud of.<eos> And supporting you all, who are such good stewards... Of the land, just feels right.
You know, it came out of the blue.<eos> It...<eos> I'm done, you know? I've been done 10 years.<eos> Even then, I...<eos> I fought too long. What makes you say that?
Dude, I just spent 45 minutes trying to convince him not to file a police report.<eos> Police report?<eos> Yeah. He provoked me.<eos> - Wait.<eos> He provoked you?
Look, the guy... he's an asshole, okay?<eos> I'd like to shoot him in the fucking face, but I don't because I have a lot to lose.<eos> Oh, man, you're... Look, you're a nice guy, okay?<eos> But you're acting crazy, and I just... I can't...<eos> I can't get sued. Maybe this isn't for you, man.
- Listen to me. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> I can.<eos> But I cannot lose this job.<eos> So, I'm asking you.
I have a daughter.<eos> I can.<eos> But I cannot lose this job.<eos> So, I'm asking you.<eos> I'm begging you.
I have two kids.<eos> This is my business, man.<eos> All right, go home.<eos> You're done for the day.<eos> I'm taking you off the Culver house.
Oh, I think you do.<eos> Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum...<eos> Shoney's. or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.<eos> Relaxed enough?<eos> I admire you, Rick.
Way worse.<eos> Now imagine trying to shoo them out, - and discovering that. - The only reason they're there.<eos> Clear-cell sarcoma of the trachea is so rare that it makes me one in three and a half billion.<eos> - I'm glad you brought.<eos> It's important for you to have your support system with you through the good times and the bad times.
Chief...<eos> As much as I want to hear about this future you've come from, I got a potential witness to interview who may have seen our perp gas up on his way out of town. - So I'm gonna...<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and pretend you didn't just mouth off to me like my teenage daughter.<eos> And I'm gonna go ahead and let you brace your witness.
And I just wanna say, I'm proud of you, and you don't owe me anything.<eos> Well, I gotta say, it's a huge relief.<eos> With the week I'm having, and after all these years.<eos> Irving.<eos> Do I know you?
Look what that animal did to my car!<eos> Madeline, call my wife, will ya?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Mr. Stussy... - It's okay, Madeline,<eos> What can we do for you, friend?
I just... I thought I would be here maybe a week or two, you know.<eos> And the motel's getting pretty expensive.<eos> Relax, kid. I got you covered, totally.<eos> Just make sure you keep all your receipts.<eos> Mr. Beatty for you, sir.
Any valuables in the bag? Not really.<eos> Mostly flannel.<eos> Think I'll get it back?<eos> I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> Hey, while I got you, I got some info I need run.
Think I'll just have a diet pop.<eos> "Diet pop."<eos> You're... You're too much.<eos> Hey, so after we talked, I tried, uh...<eos> I tried to friend you on Facebook.
- His name is Gloria... - No. Sorry.<eos> That's my name.<eos> He was Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Howard, there's someone here to see you.
_<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975.<eos> Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?
Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?<eos> And, well, he was the victim of some malfeasance recently, and I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> I know he was writing a movie for you, and then, I don't know, something happened. _
Now, hold on just a...<eos> Consequences, Mr. Stussy.<eos> That's the way the cookie crumbles.<eos> Maybe a few months at Stillwater will straighten her out.<eos> These rules aren't just for you, Ray.
Consequences, Mr. Stussy.<eos> That's the way the cookie crumbles.<eos> Maybe a few months at Stillwater will straighten her out.<eos> These rules aren't just for you, Ray.<eos> What if she's manipulating you, using her poontang to hoodwink and bamboozle?
Emmit.<eos> It's just down the hall on your right-hand side.<eos> Right.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not making you a partner in my company.
What?<eos> I'm not making you a partner in my company.<eos> You just blew in on the wind Thursday.<eos> I'm calling Sy.<eos> Ah. And here's me thinking you were the boss.
So I run the plate number on the Hummer, and it's registered to a corporation in Saint Cloud, a company car.<eos> Seems like you're crossing all the T's.<eos> Not sure how it's...<eos> Well, okay, then.<eos> So, after I see you in the commode, I go see this fellow that works there, and something strikes me odd.
Catch cheats.<eos> Middle managers and movie stars, people who park their money in a Denver Wells Fargo under their mother-in-law's maiden name.<eos> But I assure you, the IRS could not unravel an intricate web of shell companies and loan-outs with secret accounts in Monaco, Luxembourg, and the Cook Islands, if you gave them the account numbers.<eos> What?<eos> I'm beginning to think that finance is more of a hobby with you.
- Easy, baby.<eos> You'll get your chance.<eos> But first, we gotta know the play.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Stussy, these ladies are here to see you.
There's been an accident.<eos> Things of consequence rarely happen by accident.<eos> Can you come? Give me the address and I'll leave immediately.<eos> I'm at Ray's.<eos> Did anyone see you?
Look at me.<eos> - Are you listening?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your brother was killed by his ex-convict girlfriend.<eos> He'd been abusing her, you see?
You don't have to be a mathematician to add two plus two.<eos> No. Your best bet?<eos> Tearjerker.<eos> What a monster he was.<eos> How he beat you every night where it wouldn't show.
Traffic enforcement.<eos> - Traffic enforcement. - Yes, sir.<eos> Gloria Burgle, Chief of the Eden Valley police.<eos> For about another week.<eos> Eight days, yes, sir, including Christmas, which, you might be surprised to hear, is a pretty busy day for misdemeanor infractions in Eden Valley, mostly surrounding too much eggnog and a Class C motor vehicle.
Well, sirs, as you'll see if you try working the angles, the alternatives make even less sense.<eos> Especially given the new victim...<eos> Get back to traffic enforcement.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And you, I got no jurisdiction over you, but this is St. Cloud Metro's case now.
Especially given the new victim...<eos> Get back to traffic enforcement.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And you, I got no jurisdiction over you, but this is St. Cloud Metro's case now.<eos> So, if we need you or your grid, we'll give you a holler. - Sir...
- He was my brother.<eos> - I'm gonna take my friend home now.<eos> - Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> - Hold on. Officer Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.<eos> I'm wondering if you might have a minute to answer a few questions.
We gotta do an autopsy by law.<eos> Who was that fella, the one with the syringe?<eos> Nikki.<eos> What?<eos> We both know he came here to kill you for something you saw or something you know.
Protective custody.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know, forensics is doing a test on the syringe.<eos> You ask me to place a bet?<eos> I think it takes a jury 10 minutes to convict you, nutbag with a syringe or no nutbag with a syringe.
No women on the bus, I can tell you that.<eos> Anything I can...<eos> That patch on your coat, does it say "us marshal"?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well then, we'll call you when we find out, either way.
- Make sure he's...<eos> - No, he's resting now.<eos> Little bit of the old snore and drool.<eos> He took a pill, I think, maybe two.<eos> Or three. As soon as he's wakeys, I'll have him give you a ring-a-ding.
I won?<eos> What did I win?<eos> Life.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> Meemo will be over presently to take you home.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.<eos> Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.<eos> There's... _<eos> A lot, actually.<eos> And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
Or a conference room, if that's easier.<eos> Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> I know just where to put you. Oh, good.
That's another saying.<eos> Are you covering for him?<eos> I'm gonna go. If you have any more questions, let my lawyer know.<eos> They're letting him out.<eos> Doyle'll drive you to meet the Swango, I'm moving to stage five.
Are you covering for him?<eos> I'm gonna go. If you have any more questions, let my lawyer know.<eos> They're letting him out.<eos> Doyle'll drive you to meet the Swango, I'm moving to stage five.<eos> Loved you in death of a salesman.
Very good.<eos> You just added a zero to your salary.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I already got a job.<eos> Blackmailing you.
I'm a citizen of the air, Madam.<eos> Moving, always moving.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> Surmise.<eos> Because I haven't greeted you, I don't remember you.
They got phones in Belgium, yeah? E-mail?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to Rikers.
Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to Rikers.<eos> And then we're gonna charge you with felony money laundering and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder.
I am of Death.<eos> You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.
Who taught you the ways of Egypt old, of when the Nile was full and flooding.<eos> She told you stories of the Wolf and the Jackal, the Red Wind, and of the Child of Bast.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - You do.<eos> For that, I bring you to the Scales.
I was unkind to the first boy who loved me.<eos> I stole a doll once from my cousin.<eos> I tried... my best.<eos> Your best is good.<eos> Each will take you to the Du'at.
Who?<eos> I don't have a name.<eos> Well, they can't say they got a witness without giving the name.<eos> We'll get a name soon enough, but, Pernell,<eos> I need to know, could someone have seen you do it?
The guy who killed Alex is on death row because of him, so yeah, I am.<eos> You guys got nothing better to do, Toby?<eos> A cop killer walks into a police station, he's going to draw a crowd.<eos> But don't worry, I won't let them hurt you.<eos> I need you in one piece for this trial.
Have him call me when he gets back. No, look.<eos> You're just going to tell Judge Harris the name, he's going to tell me.<eos> So what's the difference?<eos> I know him, I don't know you, okay?<eos> No, no, I can't let you go unless you tell me that name.
I watched that manifesto of his.<eos> But P.J. was never willing to take time to hear me out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You know what? I'm in.<eos> I'll hear you out.
What else is hidden in there?<eos> Isn't that at least worth a look?<eos> Portland, Oregon massively reduced its carbon footprint by using data to time its traffic lights better.<eos> Tracking cell phones helped contain Ebola in Africa.<eos> Tracking Ebola didn't make you a billionaire.
You could name a figure.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> I have absolutely no idea where it is.<eos> And even if I found it, I would never sell it to you.
There's a guy over at UCSF.<eos> His name is Dr. Olonari.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ought to let me get rid of these curls, man.<eos> I think people would take you a lot more serious if you wasn't rockin' the Michael Bolton circa 1986.
Can you just tell me what it says?<eos> "Mr. Alcala was returning home late from work one night" "when he saw you pull something large and wrapped in plastic" "out of a church van, and drag it into"<eos> Shit.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If this witness takes the stand, he draws a straight line through everything, and that line leads to you.
Shit.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If this witness takes the stand, he draws a straight line through everything, and that line leads to you.<eos> It's time to be straight up with me, Pernell.<eos> What do I need to know about you and Shane Caldwell, and Julio Farcas?
Wisdom tooth.<eos> Who has wisdom teeth anymore?<eos> Talk to Stanton.<eos> Her honor was very clear when she let you go to Stockton. It was a one time thing.<eos> Now, we have more important things to focus on, like the witness statement on your desk that will put you in prison for life.
Asa.<eos> Look at you. All grown up.<eos> How you doin', Izzy?<eos> - Great.<eos> - Did he call you?
Sir.<eos> Citizen filed a complaint this morning.<eos> Pretty serious.<eos> It says a cop confiscated her phone unlawfully, and never returned it.<eos> She describes a Mexican male with a mustache, and you were the only officer on the scene that fits that description.
That was a long time ago.<eos> She lost her phone, buy her a new one like we usually do.<eos> Usually, we don't give a shit, but not this time.<eos> I know you got a thing for the judge, but I want that fuckin' phone.<eos> And if the video got erased somehow, I'm gonna feel personally responsible. And I'm gonna personally take it out on you.
Take care.<eos> I'm sorry, what was your name again?<eos> Pernell Harris.<eos> Pernell Harris, right.<eos> I have a question for you, Mr. Harris.
Do you think that your problems are more important than all my patients?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Or just little Mason, who's struggling with early-onset Huntington's?<eos> I apologize for interrupting.<eos> I had to see you.
Price check in plumbing, register four.<eos> Hope I didn't step on your game over there.<eos> - What?<eos> - You didn't catch it?<eos> Girl, she was into you.
And that he's not the only one.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> They're afraid I may dig out what's fucked in your department.<eos> But not if I'm in jail.<eos> Well, I can't let you go, Judge.
Fresh fish, ladies. Fresh fish.<eos> Tap your brakes, judge.<eos> Eating for two.<eos> Mr. Harris, you're being charged with violating Penal Code section 1210.7 for electronic monitoring.<eos> That's why your parole officer had you arrested.
How about Melnick?<eos> How about Johnnie Cochran, so long as we're talking dead guys?<eos> How about Schulz?<eos> How about digging the shit out of your ears?<eos> Rieder's the only decent lawyer in town willing to defend you.
He's made a lot of enemies over the years.<eos> And he's helped a lot of people, too.<eos> Some forget too soon.<eos> Look, Randy,<eos> I don't mean to rush you, but I have a guest coming for lunch, and I would really like to be ready.
His bail revocation hearing was set for Monday, so he's at least in custody till then.<eos> And his lawyer quit.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Good to see you.
Yes. I'm proud to be standing in front of my alma mater to announce the launch of the Real Initiative.<eos> This is a fully funded program that will start next fall with five of our most challenged schools, beginning with Eli Harris High School.<eos> That's right. That's right.<eos> Today you're going to be hearing a speech, but it won't be from me because the Real Initiative isn't for me or any of my boring friends and fellow colleagues up here.<eos> It's for you.
He does.<eos> You blasphemous doubting Thomas.<eos> Do you believe in the power and the glory of the Almighty?<eos> Here's my fucking answer.<eos> - You want God to save you?
- You want God to save you?<eos> - Go to hell!<eos> You poor stupid soul.<eos> You don't believe in God?<eos> Who's going to save you?
The voice of the Almighty.<eos> Please leave me alone.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Please, please spare me.<eos> Only God can save you from scratching and clawing on the hem of existence cold and alone, locked in this... cage, while other men are free to hold and fondle your beautiful wife.
Do you love Him?<eos> I love Him!<eos> I love God!<eos> May the Lord be with you, Pernell.<eos> Mike, we warned you, but you wanted to keep working.
No!<eos> My God, what the fuck have you done!<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> You here to gloat? No.<eos> I'm here to defend you.
I already did.<eos> How do you think your case got called first?<eos> And I can get your bail reinstated.<eos> You want out of here or not?<eos> Who called you?
When did this start?<eos> About a week ago.<eos> Anything happen recently that might have triggered all this?<eos> You're aware I can read, right?<eos> I already know that you're on trial for murder. I know about your son, too.
Yeah, well, maybe I should.<eos> Even though I didn't kill Shane Caldwell, it doesn't mean I'm not guilty.<eos> No, Shane is the guilty one.<eos> Mike Alcala isn't.<eos> No, but he's being used by the devil to bring you down.
Why not?<eos> Look at me. I'm not fancy.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I'm sure you clean up very well.<eos> We don't talk the same. I don't know much about you.
No, I'm sorry.<eos> That's not...<eos> You know what?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm not mad, not at you.
Deep breath in.<eos> Long breath out.<eos> Deep breath in. Long breath out.<eos> And now for our host, Dave Rumio!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, everyone, thank you for joining us for another episode of...
Saves time.<eos> You're very photogenic.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You wanna grab dinner?<eos> I can help get you up to speed.
- Please.<eos> - I'm here. - My God.<eos> This is not happening.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I wanna do this for you.
Hey, um, it's me.<eos> You promised me.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Then why?<eos> Because I promised him that I would protect you no matter what.
The encryption key is like a password.<eos> The source code is like gibberish without it. With it, it's Bathwater.<eos> Did Anne have the key?<eos> If she does, it's probably at Brooks Innovations.<eos> I'll pay you to help me get the key back.
So you talked to one guy, and now you have all the answers?<eos> It's that easy?<eos> Is that the problem?<eos> If it's too easy, it's gonna fuck up the chapter you want to write about me?<eos> No. I'm not going to write a chapter on you.
No.<eos> There's too much goodness in you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Son, I don't know anybody that would have stepped up like that for me.<eos> I love you... for trying to make that sacrifice.
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> I called ahead.<eos> The hospital's ready for you.
Is he serious?<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. Harris?<eos> Like I've been kicked in the face.<eos> Me getting out today?<eos> I'm afraid we can't release you.
How are you feeling, Mr. Harris?<eos> Like I've been kicked in the face.<eos> Me getting out today?<eos> I'm afraid we can't release you.<eos> God will never release you, Pernell.
I'm afraid we can't release you.<eos> God will never release you, Pernell.<eos> More drugs.<eos> That help last time?<eos> God sees you, whether you want Him to or not.
This is Gilbert McCauley. He's prosecuting the Harris case. I asked him to join us.<eos> Mr. McCauley, as we already told Chief Clay, you have the wrong idea.<eos> Paul is not going to testify, so you need to take him off the witness list.<eos> I'm afraid that's not how it works. I don't need your cooperation.<eos> I can compel you to testify.
Finished what?<eos> This.<eos> This is what Anne wanted, and her greed and her spite and her jealousy destroyed my family.<eos> This is all I have left.<eos> And I am begging you.
- Thank you.<eos> You fucking hustler!<eos> You ruined my life. Now you want to sell me out?<eos> I ruined your life?<eos> I brought you to the Lord.
No.<eos> You just kept pushing till a few more bucks fell out of my pocket and then another push and another!<eos> You think this guy is a preacher?<eos> He's a fucking vampire.<eos> He'll suck out your soul, and then he'll sell it back to you for 50 grand a pop.
He's a fucking vampire.<eos> He'll suck out your soul, and then he'll sell it back to you for 50 grand a pop.<eos> Sir, you can turn your back on God, but He will never turn His back on you.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because you've been found.
YouTube videos?<eos> Whatever it takes to reach people.<eos> Well, you hooked me.<eos> I saw your other one on Worldstar... The one where you took a beating.<eos> And it made you want to come to church.
He said that our friend was in a blue van with a bird on it.<eos> Now, I have to say that I'm ashamed to admit that we couldn't figure it out.<eos> And then I saw the video.<eos> Connecting you to the van that Pernell was driving throws preacher confidentiality out the window.<eos> So now, when we put you on the stand, it'll be as an accomplice.
Excuse me.<eos> Hey, Keith, what are you doing here?<eos> I was... I wondered if I could talk with Reverend Paul.<eos> He's working on his sermon right now, and now is not really a good time.<eos> Okay, Well, maybe I could just ask you. Okay.
He has also called. And these whom He has called. He has also justified.<eos> And these whom He has justified. He has also glorified.<eos> Don't.<eos> Keith!<eos> I'm not going to let you do this.
God is an evil, sadistic son of a bitch.<eos> He promised to give me PJ back.<eos> I did everything...<eos> I did everything He asked.<eos> I made you do horrible things. Don't you remember?
God didn't give PJ back to me, but he did give me a son.<eos> He answered me.<eos> Just... not in the way that I expected.<eos> I'm glad you believe again.<eos> I truly hope you can walk your path with Jesus by your side, but this is not the church for you.
A little tap.<eos> That's how I feel, Keith.<eos> Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.<eos> That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.<eos> When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.
Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.<eos> That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.<eos> When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.<eos> You've been right all along.<eos> I'm so sorry I made you wait.
You think that's possible?<eos> I mean, it's plausible, right?<eos> So this thing that's been bugging me,<eos> I kept having these visions of your teeth falling out, and I couldn't figure it out.<eos> And then I saw you yesterday, and it hit me.
I want to know who he came running to about it.<eos> We have a fucking problem.<eos> Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?<eos> I'm not mocking your being bald.<eos> You're always so fucking amused.
Here you go.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> That work?<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Always good to see you.
Try the chair.<eos> It's engineered to stimulate thought and creativity.<eos> Nah, yeah.<eos> No, I'm more of a think the shower type.<eos> This morning I was in the shower thinkin' about you.
No, I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> How about a "How are you?"<eos> "I know this has been tough on you as well."
Let's go.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Your honor, given the bias of this jury pool, I'd like to ask for additional...<eos> I think we're done, Mr. Tramble.<eos> You're out of challenges.
Your honor, given the bias of this jury pool, I'd like to ask for additional...<eos> I think we're done, Mr. Tramble.<eos> You're out of challenges.<eos> If all the jurors currently seated would remain in their seats.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you to not discuss this case with anyone.
If all the jurors currently seated would remain in their seats.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you to not discuss this case with anyone.<eos> This is a big case.<eos> Maybe the biggest in San Vicente's history.<eos> I instruct you to not form an opinion until all of the evidence has been presented.
Yeah.<eos> We've got a problem. Stalemate.<eos> You're gonna make sure my murder trial goes away.<eos> 'Cause if I go to prison, I can't see any reason why that video doesn't make the light of day.<eos> If anything happens to me... after I do this for you, your confession goes straight to McCauley.
Jocelyn.<eos> - How've you been?<eos> - Good.<eos> Better.<eos> What can I do for you Nathan?
- Good.<eos> Better.<eos> What can I do for you Nathan?<eos> Well, I just came by to congratulate you and Pernell. Thank you.<eos> Good to see you, Jocelyn.
Frankenstein's bride?<eos> - What he fuck happened? - He was ready for me.<eos> What do you mean, he was ready for you?<eos> He knew I was coming!<eos> Fuck! He shot you?
His name was Lucky.<eos> When I pulled his strings, I felt no fear.<eos> In here, preacher boy.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I'm the one who brought you here.
Come on! Shit!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I turn up in they're morgue, and you go down, you dumb shit!<eos> Relax, Toby.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you die like this?
Okay, okay!<eos> We knew he was a risk. He knew the cops were part of it.<eos> Please.<eos> Please call.<eos> Did my daughter-in-law say please while you were having her raped?
Buy thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Thank you for loving my son.<eos> I'll take 40 on...<eos> I'm really proud of you.
You found it, didn't you?<eos> Here.<eos> All right. All right, all right.<eos> I know. I know. It's difficult.<eos> It's tough. It's tough. I considered killing you quick, so you could die thinking you'd won.
I know. I know. It's difficult.<eos> It's tough. It's tough. I considered killing you quick, so you could die thinking you'd won.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - Fuck you. Fuck you.<eos> Who's paying you?
Well, before you canonize me, be aware that I want Crystal back on the job by yesterday.<eos> I'm... I'm not talking about the kindness of it. I'm talking about the logo.<eos> What's it called? Hexagram?<eos> - Hexagon.<eos> - I'm curious. What inspired you to go with that shape?
What you should see is our desire to be an efficient community working as one for a fruitful result.<eos> Like a beehive.<eos> I know who you are, Lucifer.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I am calling you by your name...
ARAGON FRONT SPANISH CIVIL WAR, JUNE 1937<eos> I'm Lieutenant Sales.<eos> - Forgive me, lieutenant.<eos> I'm to report to Captain Picó.<eos> He's been expecting you.
He took out 20 fascists with a machine gun, then he just buggered off and left, in the middle of the battle.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> We should've shot him for it.<eos> This is it.<eos> You'll be all right here.
You'll need to get closer to the other side.<eos> So where can I find one?<eos> The locals only have donkeys.<eos> You can use the Carlán's mare.<eos> His widow has kindly offered to let you ride her.
She's getting old, she thinks nobody loves her.<eos> Get on.<eos> Easy.<eos> Good, Bellota.<eos> I think she likes you.
What do you mean?<eos> You know the law.<eos> You could get a judge to write something...<eos> Are you asking me to forge a document?<eos> I'm asking you to help us.
I'm sorry.<eos> I understand your situation, but what you're asking is against the law.<eos> Don't tell me about the law.<eos> It's never helped me.<eos> That's why I'm asking you to help me get justice.
The Carlana. The Lady of the Manor.<eos> Go inside the chapel.<eos> - My condolences.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's nice to see you with your family.
To our wives!<eos> I don't know how we've survived without them.<eos> But don't think the women here have forgotten us.<eos> Cigars from the Lady of the Manor. For the officers.<eos> And this is especially for you.
A sack of spuds.<eos> What nice boots.<eos> First the horse, and now the boots.<eos> She must think our lieutenant has delicate feet.<eos> And I have a gift for you.
- You're not taking him home.<eos> - No?<eos> Then you take him!<eos> Sorry, I don't feel well.<eos> What have you done now?
And we ask you to protect these children, who are our future.<eos> I hope you like the dinner.<eos> Fascist crockery and a Republican menu.<eos> Very appropriate, My Lady.<eos> I'm glad you could be with us on such a special night.
I want to be an eagle.<eos> You've got one chance.<eos> You meet me in my office today at 2:00 p.m. not 2:01, not 2:03 but 2:00 p.m.<eos> Now say it back to me.<eos> - 2 p.m. - Or I will violate you.
Hi. This is Pete Murphy.<eos> I'm calling for Sandy Loomis.<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> Hi, Miss Loomis. This is Pete Murphy calling.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry to... to bother you...
You're on speaker.<eos> Mr. Murphy, can you hear me? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can...<eos> Yeah. That's it. Yeah, I can...<eos> Yeah, I can hear you.
I'm sorry to be late. No, I get it.<eos> You got all your friends here.<eos> You want to make an entrance.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> That's not why I wanted to meet you here. No?
The Israelis are gonna pick him up.<eos> Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?
Half your country will wake up tomorrow convinced that we're cheating, and half of mine will wake up chanting, "Death to America."<eos> I still need the truth.<eos> That is the truth.<eos> Only you would call it succeeding.<eos> I forced you into this. You're right about that.
Only you would call it succeeding.<eos> I forced you into this. You're right about that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I think you take more pride in what we accomplished than you let on.<eos> So I'm asking you one last thing.
I called a cab.<eos> - Please, I insist.<eos> Etai.<eos> Dorit.<eos> Nice to see you again.
- Please, I insist.<eos> Etai.<eos> Dorit.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> And what a treat, Saul coming to visit you at long last.
-That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
I've been trying to reach you.<eos> Did you get the photos I sent?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's great seeing you.
Mercedes.<eos> Good morning, Saul. You know Nate Joseph?<eos> -I don't believe I do.<eos> -It's an honor, Mr. Berenson.<eos> -Nice to meet you. -Can I get you anything?
-If I have to.<eos> I'll get right on it then.<eos> Again, my apologies.<eos> Mercedes.<eos> Nice meeting you.
You got a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you... do you want sit up there and read your book?<eos> Okay?<eos> I never expected to see you at my door.
Not yet. Mommy, it's cold!<eos> Yeah, I'm coming, sweetie.<eos> I called in a favor with NYPD.<eos> A guy on the task force named Danny Jones.<eos> He can get you into the prison ward at Bellevue tomorrow to see Quinn.
A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.<eos> The guards will escort you out.
It's obvious you're on the outside looking in.<eos> Maybe you're not much use to me after all.<eos> Mr. Emmons, sorry for the confusion.<eos> Yeah, well, someone better streamline that shit before we get to the White House.<eos> Absolutely, sir. I'll take you to the president-elect.
Yeah, well, someone better streamline that shit before we get to the White House.<eos> Absolutely, sir. I'll take you to the president-elect.<eos> She's been working all afternoon.<eos> -If she's busy, I can wait.<eos> -No. Trust me... She wants to see you.
And I'm good with faces.<eos> You look so familiar.<eos> You didn't volunteer for the Hudson Valley Committee back in 2000?<eos> I can tell you for sure that I didn't.<eos> I've never voted for you.
I'm just curious why you agreed to do this.<eos> Because you're the president-elect, you asked me, and I know it's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I hope I can win you over.
-Agent Thoms?<eos> -Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.<eos> I'm not going back. Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.<eos> I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.
Ma'am, I understand your impatience, but it's still possible that you were the target -of an assassination attempt.<eos> -No. Agent Thoms, I don't believe that anymore.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I don't believe anybody else believes it, either.<eos> See you in New York.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.<eos> Well, I'd rather wait for the results of the investigation before commenting on that.<eos> The president is urging you and Congress to reauthorize certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act.
But I'm grateful to her.<eos> We had a very interesting talk. -About what?<eos> -Our sons.<eos> Madam President, can you speak up?<eos> We can't hear you back here.
Answer me! Where did it come from?<eos> I told you, I can't say!<eos> Imagine that hundreds of people are dead in Manhattan right now.<eos> And then ask yourself why you're still wasting time fucking with me.<eos> I'm not fucking with you.
I'm so important I have no phone.<eos> It's to safeguard your physical location, ma'am.<eos> I'll let you know the second a secure line is available.<eos> Oh, this is Marjorie Diehl.<eos> - She'll be assisting you.
Sir. Thank you. We're looking for comment on--<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> You don't want to talk.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Just let me go, I'll leave you in peace.
It connects via SIPRNet.<eos> You can speak with specific people in the White House, including the president. Thank you.<eos> It's a start.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd like to bring you up to speed on the attack and a few unfortunate facts you should be aware of.
But this was a man who hated the US government.<eos> You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.<eos> And with the possibility of accomplices out there, I'm asking that we err on the side of caution.<eos> So.<eos> That's all, then. Is there anything I can get for you?
Army?<eos> Marines?<eos> I served.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Good for you.
Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Mr. Alibadi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Kasem.<eos> That's for you.
Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Falhadi.<eos> - Right here.<eos> And, finally, Mr. Mohada.<eos> My colleague will escort you to your cars.
What deal?<eos> The deal Dar Adal made.<eos> Right now, you're an important national-security asset.<eos> Break the terms, and you're a national-security risk.<eos> Do I like a f-fucking risk to you?
Who are you?<eos> Amir.<eos> You and I have a friend in common.<eos> Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.
Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.<eos> Why didn't he come?<eos> He'll explain when you see him.<eos> Come, I'll take you to him.
But only one other person knew for sure.<eos> Dar Adal... I told him about it myself.<eos> The same Dar Adal who's been trying to undermine the nuclear deal every step of the way?<eos> That was over three years ago.<eos> If he was gonna burn you... time was then, not now.
Your friend the banker, Farhad Nafisi.<eos> He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess... He's working for Mossad.<eos> For the past eight years.<eos> Including the little show they put on for you in Abu Dhabi.
Plus, I want 'round-the-clock protection and access to my $45 million.<eos> That's gonna be a little trickier.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I can put you in front of someone who can make it happen.
Come on. Help me put him in the trunk.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Down by the lake.<eos> He hasn't said a word...<eos> not since I called you.
For the record, though, I...<eos> I never forced myself on anyone.<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Astrid will look after you till you can look after yourself. No.
What's so important you have to get back to New York?<eos> Astrid mentioned on the phone you were talking about the attack.<eos> The bomb that went off...<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> What's it to you?
It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?<eos> No.<eos> The sway she holds over you... and Saul, I'll never understand...
That I... flatlined and was dead for three minutes.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were in a coma, Peter, a deep coma.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
Hello? It's Christine Lonas from ACS.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> She'll stay there for the foreseeable future.<eos> I don't enjoy taking a child from her mother, but in this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> That's why I contacted you.
Maybe I was afraid she would remind me of that.<eos> And did she?<eos> Well, her father had red hair, and-- and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.
Ma'am, if I may, I feel I owe you an apology.<eos> We got off on the wrong foot at our very first meeting, and I blame myself entirely.<eos> It's not that, not at all.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> The fact is, I asked you here to pick your brain.
Order of the President-Elect her fucking self.<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Just listen.<eos> - Listen to what? - Shh!<eos> If it makes any difference, some said ship you back to Tehran.
- For the Agency?<eos> - Meaning not a direct hire.<eos> Can't stand the politics.<eos> Especially now.<eos> Oh, I hear you.
- Meaning not a direct hire.<eos> Can't stand the politics.<eos> Especially now.<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> God, I hear you.
Oh, I hear you.<eos> God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?<eos> She didn't say there was an issue. There is.<eos> She didn't ask you about this missing year?
No such thing as private anymore, is there?<eos> M and M?<eos> That year, from here to here,<eos> I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin?
You said you had some names for me.<eos> Oh, that's him, isn't it?<eos> Your son, Andrew.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't help but think how proud he'd be of you right now.
Fine.<eos> Not too hot.<eos> No.<eos> Long day, sir?<eos> Let me ask you something. - Shoot.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter. You know that.<eos> I don't.<eos> I got you out of lockup.
I don't.<eos> I got you out of lockup.<eos> So you knew where I was.<eos> In a safe place. That was the point.<eos> My God, I flew Astrid in all the way from Berlin to take care of you.
- You are my child.<eos> More than that.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> Never.<eos> I love you.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider-- advise you to.
Do I come around to your point of view?<eos> Do I give up, roll over?<eos> Do you see me resigning?<eos> I am the next president of the United States. Sixty million people voted for me.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
- It was another girl at the home.<eos> - I see.<eos> My supervisor took the call early this morning.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I see. Anyway, the good news is we can keep our appointmet as scheduled if that's still good for you.
- Carrie!<eos> I can't.<eos> Mrs. Berenson?<eos> That's right.<eos> A man left this message for you.
Oh, the traffic was impossible.<eos> Finally had to get out of the cab and walk.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Your guest is waiting for you.
I'm not doing a thing.<eos> Oh, is that right?<eos> It fucking better be.<eos> I'm not denying it was discussed.<eos> I'm just asking you to consider your source.
On your toes. She's about to hit the garage.<eos> What about the rest of my staff?<eos> They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle. Now get in.
- Tell them they won't be.<eos> Tell them to stop listening to Brett O'Keefe.<eos> Look, most of you know me.<eos> We've all worked together.<eos> I won't lie to you.
- Really?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Great.<eos> Well, I guess that's it.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll show you out. Thanks.
I will.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> So don't be upset.<eos> - Don't be upset?<eos> I've been trying to reach you all afternoon.
- To see the President.<eos> Ronald, I need to see the President.<eos> - She's not available.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building. - Ordered?
What?<eos> She's been taken, placed in a state-registered youth home.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> In this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> It's why I contacted you.
'Cause they were coming for me.<eos> Who is?<eos> The people who built the bomb.<eos> You were in a coma, Peter.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Welcome to New York.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want political asylum.<eos> I can put you in front of someone who can make it happen.
And he didn't give a shit what he had to do to get them.<eos> - Rudy.<eos> - He must have taken... Rudy.<eos> Rudy.<eos> You're late. Brett had to start without you.
Madam President-elect.<eos> This way.<eos> Ma'am, this is Major General Majid Javadi.<eos> Madam President-- That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.
This financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent.<eos> The whole thing is a charade.<eos> The only charade was the deal itself.<eos> It never had a chance.<eos> I'm sorry to disappoint, Madam, but if I were you,
_<eos> What's this?<eos> A work in progress. It's not ready yet.<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
And it's not just the mission.<eos> It never has been.<eos> You got to let me go.<eos> You talk to him yet?<eos> I've been waiting for you.
Each one of them crazy as he is.<eos> So, we just let them keep screaming at us without a response?<eos> Here's a response-- the man is insane.<eos> Saul.<eos> We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.
Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.
Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.<eos> You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.<eos> People hate you, Madam President-Elect.
- Now we are talking slander. - I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.
Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, you will have no place."
We've known each other a long time.<eos> You were a legendary influence in the modern age of industrial piping.<eos> You're welcome here at McMillan.<eos> We're honored to have you here at McMillan.<eos> But, Leslie, I'm afraid there'll be a ceiling for you, for good, Leslie, at McMillan.
You were a legendary influence in the modern age of industrial piping.<eos> You're welcome here at McMillan.<eos> We're honored to have you here at McMillan.<eos> But, Leslie, I'm afraid there'll be a ceiling for you, for good, Leslie, at McMillan.<eos> My mother-in-law holds you in the highest regard, but she has a responsibility to our shareholders.
I got all dressed up thinking Winston was taking me to a fancy Italian restaurant. But then he was gone, gone forever!<eos> Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.
Opening unlocked doors and going outside and then showering alone and not having a toilet next to my bed.<eos> Are you listening to yourself?<eos> You know I'm in prison.<eos> Everything that you just said is fun stuff I can't do now.<eos> Tell you what- - I'll take you to that go-kart place.
- Is there a supermarket nearby?<eos> Oh... no.<eos> But there is a local open-air market and gin distillery.<eos> Thanks again for taking us.<eos> I don't know what we would have done without you.
Trouble sleeping?<eos> I've been sleeping great, thanks for asking.<eos> Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.<eos> - I underestimated you.
- What are you gonna do?<eos> Lose him.<eos> [crowd chanting] One truth!<eos> Neets!<eos> - I know you!
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.
- Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.
Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I?<eos> We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.
Don't do this!<eos> We have to get you out of here!<eos> Wait!<eos> What about my family?<eos> Your family is safer without you.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.<eos> Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.<eos> Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.<eos> A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.<eos> My husband and I want to protect you.
If you don't mind...<eos> - Of course.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I'll be right along.<eos> It's a busy day for you today, sir.
No disagreement from here.<eos> Well, you know how the Republicans are.<eos> Anything but a decision.<eos> They mistake complaint for leadership.<eos> Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.<eos> There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there. This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.<eos> I want to go.<eos> No one's keeping you.
If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.<eos> And I think you know it.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out here. Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Great to see you.
"Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst...<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.
Family emergency, I'm afraid.<eos> Sorry to hear.<eos> - Hope you'll give him my best.<eos> - Of course I will.<eos> We'll get you sorted out with chips. And of course...
We'll get you sorted out with chips. And of course...<eos> Pappy Van Winkle.<eos> A lovely gesture... but I'm afraid my trainer has made me promise to abstain.<eos> You see, if I let myself get fat, then the girls will only want me for my money.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to your game then, huh?
Call on every street-chasin' bullshit, suck out by hitting the nuts on the river.<eos> If you want me to fold, my friend, you'll have to bet more.<eos> Ain't your friend.<eos> And yet you've given me so much money.<eos> You keep him around so you can run your mouth, not have to worry about getting stomped?
Hi, it's me again.<eos> I need you to call me back.<eos> Now, I completely understand... the delay is not... that it's due to circumstances beyond your... beyond anyone's control, but there's just so long I can stay on this... this hamster wheel robbing Peter to Pay Paul.<eos> - [beep] Female voice: Sorry.<eos> My grandson says this will be child's play for you. He says you could crack this in your sleep.
I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.<eos> Oh, I don't want someone else.<eos> I just want you.
Have you been in the cellar?<eos> Have you seen the black room?<eos> Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.
Representatives from the textbook publishers are in your office.<eos> Who?<eos> - Good morning, Alan.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> We are very excited to talk to you.
I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.<eos> They're asking you to make a choice, Alan.
- Alan Snyder? - Uh, yes.<eos> One of our Proxies.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I'm Helena Goldwyn, the Governor-General's chief-of-staff.<eos> - Nice to meet you. - Yes.
Flores?<eos> You out there?<eos> Where's a fucking hammer when you need one?<eos> You hear that?<eos> She said she's ready to gut you like a shark that's eaten a toddler.
In 30 years, over 100 people have lived here, thanks to generous countries like Russia, the USA, and China.<eos> We call this Tranquility Node.<eos> Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days in space.<eos> Four hundred and seventy-three, straight.<eos> Your mommy must miss you.
Get him in.<eos> Adams!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - David, I need you here.<eos> Rory, I can't let you out.
Um, hold on.<eos> One more idea.<eos> Allora. I have a reservation for one... Dev.<eos> Si. Can we sit together?<eos> It's not a problem for me if it's not a problem for you.
Dr. Klintsen.<eos> This is a great honor, sir.<eos> You know, I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory. That was the find of the decade.<eos> You're a rock star down there.<eos> We are very excited you're here, Will.
This is a great honor, sir.<eos> You know, I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory. That was the find of the decade.<eos> You're a rock star down there.<eos> We are very excited you're here, Will.<eos> Mr. Reynard apologizes that he couldn't be meeting you in person.
Sure.<eos> I have a lot of questions. Your people were very good at keeping me in the dark.<eos> Well, these people are in the dark too.<eos> So a physicist who can fly.<eos> It's no wonder NASA poached you from the Air Force.
We are aware of your sister and nephew.<eos> And your new surrogate-father role.<eos> And the surrounding circumstances.<eos> It's very noble of you, Will.<eos> Mr. Reynard respects your position which is why our generous relocation package includes all three of you.
Positive identification.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> Remain where you are.<eos> A transport is on its way.<eos> It will escort you to Alterplex command in a few seconds.
Since the dawn of humankind we have reached for dreams beyond our grasp.<eos> We gazed at the birds and built planes to fly.<eos> We gazed at the moon and built rockets to reach it.<eos> Throughout history, we have transcended our evolution with technology pushing through to new frontiers.<eos> Now Alterplex's visionary CEO, August Reynard asks you to gaze at the energy challenge we face and, once again, push through to a new frontier.
Well... a little up and down, to tell you the truth.<eos> You know, new city and everything.<eos> They have a lot of questions.<eos> And frankly I still don't fully understand what I'm doing here myself.<eos> Before we go any further this is for you.
- Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.<eos> This is the gate.<eos> It sends you into the echo a safe distance from the tower.
This is your last warning!<eos> Alright!<eos> Abby, let's go! Come on!<eos> Drive! Come on!<eos> Fuck you!
Shit.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You alright?<eos> We have to bring you to Reynard. He'll know what to do.
All of us.<eos> I promise, I can fix this.<eos> I can't let you do it, Will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let you touch the box.
Miss Sayre.<eos> Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?
Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> I'm looking for you.
No matter how many times I'd call, somehow I can't seem to find you in.<eos> Sounds like the problem's not the phone line.<eos> What were you calling about anyway?<eos> I know that you're, uh, quite sought after.<eos> But I'm not going to be stationed here forever, and I need to get to know you better.
Most boys are too scared to talk to old Dick.<eos> And yet, knowing that, you threw me right in there anyway.<eos> Well, after the professors of Princeton, your father is a whoop and a holler.<eos> I like him.<eos> If I were the judge, I would lock you in a tower - like a princess.
Come on.<eos> Evening, Zelda.<eos> Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.<eos> I went to school with her granddaughter Delia.<eos> Does everyone in town know you?
Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.<eos> I went to school with her granddaughter Delia.<eos> Does everyone in town know you?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> So tell me something that I should know about you, Zelda Sayre. Hmm.
That's not exactly a virtue in this town.<eos> Everybody knows everybody else's business.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You want to know what I think?<eos> I think that these people that supposedly know you don't know you at all.
I'm not gonna arm you up so you can go and do something stupid.<eos> I'll never love anyone else but you.<eos> You screwed me there, Emma Decody.<eos> Yes?<eos> Uh, did my brother Norman check you in here?
What are you talking about?<eos> My br... my brother has some mental issues, and he shouldn't be checking people in the motel.<eos> - Mental issues?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He... Look, it... He made a mistake checking you in.
I need a room for a few hours.<eos> - Your name?<eos> - David...<eos> Davidson.<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you,
It was you.<eos> It was your way of trying to get rid of me.<eos> And I'm still alive.<eos> For now.<eos> Great seeing you, Sheriff.
I know an art dealer in Portland who specializes in the un-commonalities.<eos> She's showcased some of my work.<eos> Well, it would be nice for others to appreciate these beautiful animals, and I could sure use the space.<eos> So we'll... we'll do a 50/50 split. 50/50?<eos> Look, I... normally, an art dealer gets 50 just for showing the piece. I'm getting 50 by bringing you the specimens, by repping you, plus providing you the art dealer.
So we'll give this a go, then?<eos> Partner?<eos> We'll give it a go.<eos> Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?
I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.<eos> All I can tell you is... stay out of it.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> I barely know you or your wife.
Talk about a classroom from hell.<eos> These are your clothes, Bones.<eos> The victim is meant to be you.<eos> As I said on the phone, I'm happy to do whatever I can do to be of assistance. But that said, I can't breach doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> I'd like you to return to your dreams.
A symbol for what?<eos> For someone who used to work at the lab.<eos> Zack?<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> It is good to see you again.
I mean, we-we know this killer is manipulative.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Zack is guilty, end of story.<eos> Dr. Brennan, oh, wow, it's so good to see you.
Dr. Brennan, Hodgins, Angela, and Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Zack, you've been spying on all of their e-mail accounts?<eos> I do not care for the word "spy."<eos> But, yes, I've been keeping myself abreast of what they've been doing on a day-to-day basis.<eos> Let me ask you, you mentioned everyone at the Jeffersonian.
Yes,<eos> I was transferred. But then I left, and now I'm back.<eos> As is self-evident.<eos> So... anything new going on?<eos> Dr. Brennan, I wanted to let you know that I've identified the bone shards we found in the puppeteer's basement.
Zack, I've brought you some visitors.<eos> Hodgins.<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> And Miss Delfs.<eos> It is a pleasure to see you again.
Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Hodgins here has got some questions for you.
Hmm? I don't think he's here. You think?<eos> Aubrey, it's Booth.<eos> I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.
Aubrey, it's Booth.<eos> I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.
No.<eos> We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.
All right, Aubrey, do me a favor-- get on this right away and see if you can track them down.<eos> Got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.
Got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> We tried to get you over the intercom, and then when you didn't come, I might have kind of panicked.
You're safe, it's over.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.
I'm okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Thank you for coming to visit.<eos> It is nice to see you both in a non-adversarial climate.
Okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Thank you for coming to visit.<eos> It is nice to see you both in a non-adversarial climate.<eos> Zack, given what's happened, I've been looking into having you transferred, if that's what you'd like.
We've got dentists.<eos> So, we have to get people to buy Chesterfields because dentists recommend them.<eos> Makes your food taste even better. The brandy's never been smoother. Helps settle the stomach.<eos> Doesn't sound very "dentisty."<eos> And what does sound "dentisty" to you, Mr. Fitzgerald?
Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.<eos> Mr. Perkins will see you now.
- Stop lying!<eos> We know Mark Kovac is your biological sibling.<eos> That's sick.<eos> You're accusing me of incest?<eos> No, we're accusing you of murder, and that's just for starters.
Also, the right ribs three through six, the right radius, and the ulnae.<eos> And don't get me started on the tissue.<eos> Whatever the dogs didn't eat was bruised, scraped or punctured.<eos> The location of the trauma suggests the body was dragged on both anterior and posterior planes.<eos> Dr. Brennan, I've been meaning to ask, would it be okay if I put you down as a reference?
Yes and no.<eos> There's also evidence of perimortem blunt force trauma on the frontal bone at the coronal suture.<eos> It must have been obscured by all the postmortem damage.<eos> I'll have Hodgins swab, see if we can identify the murder weapon.<eos> Oh, and, Daisy... if... the NFL doesn't hire you... you'll always have a job here.
Anytime.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just because I blogged about the military smart drone program doesn't make me guilty of treason.<eos> I had no idea those files were classified.<eos> We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.
Mr. Coburn, where were you last Friday night?<eos> In my RV, writing a very important post about why people should take action to stop men like Ian Goldberg before it's too late!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna take action, all right.<eos> By holding you right here.
By holding you right here.<eos> Dr. Brennan...<eos> No, Daisy.<eos> I still have not heard from the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will inform you the minute I do.
No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes. Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."
Well, I did do a rather remarkable acting job, didn't I?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled. I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits.<eos> That's a good job. That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.
I can't say with any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death,
Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death,<eos> I will sue you for slander.
So sorry about that.<eos> Agnes, hands to yourself.<eos> You must be Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan.<eos> I'm Francis.<eos> Very pleased to meet you.
I don't want you to excite them, or say something that's gonna, like, freak 'em out.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I have no intention of causing this poor woman a myocardial infarction.<eos> Hi, ladies.<eos> Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?
Uh, did you know him?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?<eos> He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.
That's what they called us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.
We were just going for a walk, and he fell.<eos> You were exerting him, weren't you? No, I didn't.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hudmore. I'm here.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
I'm glad to see that they're not being wasted.<eos> Okay. So you want to know what I think happened?<eos> Might as well. I'm paying for it.<eos> I think you stole his medication to sell online, replaced it with some kind of placebo.<eos> Felbeck found out and he confronted you.
It was an impact fracture, they said.<eos> From me impacting the ground.<eos> Look, I was there, Red.<eos> I saw what happened, you landed on your right side.<eos> All right? The fracture came when Felbeck hit you with his cane.
Just call him Gordon Gordon.<eos> Agent Booth, um, while I'm absolutely delighted to be freed from the, uh, sweltering confines of a kitchen, you do know that I-I haven't really practiced any psychiatry for some time.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's just like riding a bike.<eos> All right? Plus, I need you, all right?
Dr. Brennan, just to be clear, you know that I'm not talking about your father here, right?<eos> I never said that you were. Oh, don't let me interrupt.<eos> But I could hardly pass this gorgeous creature without saying hello.<eos> Dr. Wyatt.<eos> Mmm. So good to see you again.
A gift.<eos> Um, you may or may not know, but we have a tradition here at the Jeffersonian.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Oh... I heard you finished your doctorate, making you the first ever forensic anthropologist to be certified in both the United States and Cuba.<eos> We are so fortunate to have you, Dr. Fuentes.
Aubrey. FBI.<eos> Charlene was our brave teller who was held up.<eos> I'm sorry, I already spoke to an agent about the robbery.<eos> Yeah, this is about a homicide.<eos> The man who robbed you was murdered.
If it was, he certainly acted like he knew what he was doing.<eos> No, Dr. Hodgins, don't get up.<eos> Good Lord, don't tell me that you've gone and joined the Freemasons. Well, if I did,<eos> I wouldn't reveal it, now, would I?<eos> It's good to see you again.
As I'm sure you're aware, there are very few jobs in the D.C. area for a forensic anthropologist.<eos> A fact that Arastoo reminds me of on a daily basis.<eos> Getting my doctorate means that it's time to move on.<eos> And wearing the jacket just makes it a little too real for me.<eos> And the fact that I'll soon have to leave all of you.
No. Dustin isn't saying anything, Ray.<eos> Dustin's dead.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I think you're trying to trick me.<eos> Ray, I could trick you by pretend throwing a ball and palming it in my hand.
Whoo-hoo! I'm fantastic!<eos> How's your back?<eos> Couldn't be better, Wanda.<eos> Hey there... Big Belly!<eos> My wife and I have a few questions for you.
You can never find parking.<eos> Well, at least on our side, we have Pier 1, which I love.<eos> Over there at the Grove, all you have is Cost Plus World Market.<eos> I mean, all that is just junk.<eos> You too? Was it hard getting an appointment?
Hey. I missed dinner.<eos> I found your barf stash.<eos> Keep this to yourself and I'll get you some laxatives.<eos> - I don't... I don't use...<eos> - Come on, I know you want them.
She'll have the number 12, too, with the egg roll.<eos> - And to drink?<eos> - We'll have two Tsingtao.<eos> Your ID?<eos> I... I don't wanna put you on the spot or anything, um... but we're from the hospice.
But, even more shocking, on their Eat Healthy page, they actually encouraged eating Group One carcinogenic foods like processed turkey and canned meats.<eos> This is after the World Health Organization reviewed over 800 studies definitively linking processed meat to cancer.<eos> Thanks for calling your American Cancer Society. My name is Sam,<eos> I'm a cancer information specialist.<eos> How may I help you today?
So, this is not a product even in its most pure state you wanna be consuming because it does come with risk.<eos> I found out that dairy can increase a man's chance of getting prostate cancer by 34%.<eos> And for women who've had breast cancer, just one serving of whole dairy a day can increase their chance of dying from the disease 49% and dying from anything 64%.<eos> Why weren't breast cancer sites like Susan G. Komen warning everyone about this?<eos> Thanks for calling Susan G. Komen, this is Jocelyn, how may I help you?
That's why we do peer review, okay?<eos> The European Association of Study of Diabetes has been peer-reviewed or, the...<eos> I don't know what study you're referring to, and in the absence of being able to see that study,<eos> I'm not gonna comment.<eos> I could show it to you.
'Cause it's not just heart disease.<eos> It's hypertension, it's diabetes, it's strokes, it's heart attacks, it's several of the autoimmune diseases, lupus, asthma, GERD, osteoporosis, there's a multitude of diseases.<eos> Even rheumatoid arthritis, it can be so dramatic when you see these poor souls just absolutely crippled with rheumatoid arthritis go plant-based, and then they come off their medication.<eos> I wanted to follow up with Jane Chapman who had been suffering from severe osteoarthritis, and I could not believe what I saw after only a few weeks of fasting and changing her diet.<eos> Those are so amazing to see you like this only a few weeks later.
I cut.<eos> To you.<eos> Mm, call.<eos> Here's 5,000.<eos> 45 to you.
Not flush!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Flush takes it.<eos> I... I thought that was a high pair.<eos> Sorry to disappoint you.
Call.<eos> Nobody touches the cards.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, with my apologies...<eos> I need to ask you to leave at this time.
Uh, thank you for waiting so patiently.<eos> Who do we have next?<eos> That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.
Who do we have next?<eos> That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.
That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.
- B-29.<eos> - Huh?<eos> B-29.<eos> FIFI's a B-29.<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?
And if you play that ad one more time,<eos> I'm gonna go to the Judge Advocate, and we will take you down... trespassing, false representation, stolen valor... the whole nine yards.<eos> Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial?<eos> You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay.<eos> That clear enough for you?
Keating.<eos> Keating.<eos> You're getting out of here.<eos> I'm being released?<eos> No, we're transferring you to county till your bail hearing.
Someone's framing her.<eos> And this is not the place to talk about it.<eos> Go home.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> I will call you once I know anything.
Ahh.<eos> See, it's easy.<eos> It's no different than you alone in what I'm guessing is some big ol', fancy crib...<eos> Bitch, will you just leave her be?<eos> Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?
So, you admit going to talk to Ms. Keating in her holding cell, and this is just an hour after you talked to the Medical Examiner?<eos> Due to our prior relationship,<eos> I felt she might disclose key evidence for us.<eos> To be clear, you did this on your own.<eos> No one in this office cleared you to do that?
- No.<eos> You told Bonnie you thought she did it.<eos> Yeah, I was wrong.<eos> She's being framed.<eos> Or maybe you're lying to me the same way you lied about the night of the bonfire.
No, because the minute you tell me...<eos> I'm guilty, too, right?<eos> Of conspiracy to commit murder, obstruction of justice?<eos> You could go to the police right now.<eos> Nobody would blame you.
Frank.<eos> I don't want him anywhere near this.<eos> He's not.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.
You always hated my black ass living in your mommy and daddy's house.<eos> So take it, Hannah.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> Not like anything good happened to me since the minute I moved in here.<eos> That's not enough to incriminate you.
No matter how high or how far we climb, they gonna find a way to pull us back down.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> If I compel them to disclose Hannah as their source,<eos> I can undermine her testimony completely.<eos> She accused you of killing Sam.
I have a plan.<eos> If I compel them to disclose Hannah as their source,<eos> I can undermine her testimony completely.<eos> She accused you of killing Sam.<eos> It all speaks to her bias against you.
You still want to protect me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Oli.<eos> You just slept with him to hurt me.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna continue to hurt you.
On behalf of the District Attorney's Office, we're pleased with the judge's decision to keep Annalise Keating in state custody for the duration of her prosecution.<eos> A young man has been murdered, and it is of the upmost importance to A.D.A. Atwood and myself that Ms. Keating be brought to justice for this heinous crime.<eos> You're right.<eos> I acted like a Neanderthal, and... clearly, that's something I have to work on, and I will, but... to have to spend another night in that dorm, alone...<eos> Promise me I'll never see you act that way again.
It should have been you.<eos> He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> I don't blame Annalise for that.<eos> I blame you, 'cause it's always you.
I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.<eos> I mean, what has coming here done for you?
I've been busy.<eos> Busy ratting us out to the fuzz?<eos> Would I be here if I did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they put a wire on you.
'Cause this case has been damaged enough by my A.D.A. tampering with the victim's body.<eos> - I had nothing to do with that.<eos> - I know that now.<eos> But this whole department is under a microscope.<eos> So I need you to look me in the eye and tell me that you are not in contact with Keating.
The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...<eos> Police records, interviews.<eos> Chances are Atwood doctored some of those, too.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> That's not for you.
You know what?<eos> You're the problem with the gay community.<eos> You know, we all just treat each other like a piece of meat.<eos> We're all the problem with the gay community.<eos> It was nice meeting you.
Could I borrow yours?<eos> Wow.<eos> You're on a roll.<eos> Connor, it's Annalise.<eos> I need all of you to come to the house.
- You need to go and kill yourself.<eos> - Laurel, stop.<eos> That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.<eos> You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.
You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're offering you a plea deal.<eos> Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.
Look me in the eye.<eos> Right here.<eos> You said you didn't hurt Wes.<eos> So I believe you.<eos> But I need you to believe me, too.
Is there really no vodka in the house?<eos> No.<eos> There's the yolk sac.<eos> That thicker area there is the fetal pole.<eos> And... there you are.
Hey.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I just, uh...<eos> I came to a doctor's appointment.<eos> Being back here made me think of you.
Really?<eos> Because I thought that we weren't friends.<eos> Meggy...<eos> Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?<eos> That wasn't about you.
We will reveal the identity as we get closer to the trial.<eos> Either way, this case deserves to go before a jury.<eos> At the very least, we owe that to Mr. Gibbins.<eos> There's no need to delay my decision.<eos> Your Honor, I urge you to take more time with the facts of this hearing.
Three million dollars?<eos> The first of three payments, as per the partnership agreement.<eos> The firm can't afford this.<eos> Are you...?<eos> - You're not shutting down, are you?
- But first, could you give me a ride?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Where to?<eos> Ms. Wexler sends her apologies, Mr. Gatwood.<eos> And she feels terrible about this, but with her accident and the recovery... she's just not gonna be able to finish her work for you in time.
Where to?<eos> Ms. Wexler sends her apologies, Mr. Gatwood.<eos> And she feels terrible about this, but with her accident and the recovery... she's just not gonna be able to finish her work for you in time.<eos> Oh, of course, I'll tell her.<eos> And again, she is very sorry... and I know she'll be giving you a call herself soon.
I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong and I stirred the pot.<eos> So....<eos> Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.
- I signed them from her.<eos> - Nice.<eos> They saw right through it.<eos> "Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.<eos> Jimmy, she doesn't deserve you."
I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You got the address?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Okay, meet you guys there in an hour. We'll unload.
But, you know, I'm worried.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> She works all the time, and she does not date.<eos> And soon she's gonna be old, and then what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Our goal in this room is to focus on you.
Diane?<eos> Who's Diane?<eos> What?<eos> Must have picked up someone else's.<eos> Jean, can I ask you something, friend to friend?
Jean, can I ask you something, friend to friend?<eos> I'm not your friend.<eos> I'm your therapist, Claire.<eos> Well, just about this, I mean, you are.<eos> I just want you to know that I really like to please you. But I have a hard time letting go.
They need you to go down there.<eos> It's nothing serious, but something happened with a girl in her class.<eos> Is Michael there? Can I talk to him?<eos> He just stepped into a meeting.<eos> They tried calling you, but said your phone was off.
'Cause I'm not.<eos> I prefer open-minded.<eos> We can't all be so pure like you.<eos> You think I'm so straight-laced.<eos> No, I could shock you, trust me.
Even her weekly blow-out every Monday.<eos> That she has time for.<eos> And I've been to that salon.<eos> It's really not very nice.<eos> Rebecca loves you, Claire.
Oh, can you just put him on?<eos> I really need to speak to him.<eos> I understand, I think if we just concentrate more on...<eos> Jean, Belize.<eos> Um, I'm gonna have to call you right back, okay?
I understand, I think if we just concentrate more on...<eos> Jean, Belize.<eos> Um, I'm gonna have to call you right back, okay?<eos> Sorry, thank you.<eos> Putting you through.
Jesus Christ.<eos> Just take that and call it even.<eos> You have to order something.<eos> Fine, I'll just do it myself.<eos> If I break the rules for you, I have to break the rules for everybody.
Inside one of these memories is the key to get you out.<eos> Look what I found!<eos> You're quite the fighter.<eos> It's kept you alive all these years.<eos> Here, it'll just make you tired.
Like I said, your friend isn't the only one on a quest.<eos> Enough of the mystical bullshit.<eos> How do you have this?<eos> How do you even know about Karma?<eos> I know everything about you.
Heart Enterprises.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Whom did you say they were going to replace?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Skuttle, they're ready for you.
We at Heart found incredible resources in The Scar... unstable minerals, morally questionable fuel alternatives, unnatural gases, and deep wells of unidentifiable glowing goo with properties far beyond the realm of modern science.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - The world's ecological disaster was our economic windfall.<eos> And now we share with you, the newest member of Heart, the fruits of our labor.<eos> We "Heart" you.
Please hold.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Try replacing me now!<eos> He was the new head of maintenance.<eos> We're ready for you now.
That's impossible.<eos> The government would shut us down.<eos> Besides, this is... this is art, not fodder for the masses.<eos> We think the world might be ready to embrace such a violent concept in the near future, which means the race could be seen around the entire planet.<eos> It would be quite a spotlight for you.
Well, that's... that's wonderful.<eos> A spotlight that, quite frankly, we're not sure you're ready for.<eos> - Now, hold on...<eos> - I won't lie.<eos> We were gonna have you killed today, but after that show you put on in the lobby, we have reconsidered.
- What's your name?<eos> - Arthur.<eos> Glad you speak English. That's...<eos> Oh, the jargon.<eos> It may sound like nonsense to you, but it's been a long time since they've seen anyone from the outside world.
Oh, come on, seriously?<eos> Are you real?<eos> Of course I'm real.<eos> - Thank the baby Jesus!<eos> - A cop! They didn't attack you dressed like this?
- Okay, no, no.<eos> - Stay with me.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> It's much safer with me, okay?<eos> Yeah, until they kill you.
Think she's kind of into me.<eos> Catch that Heart logo back in Steel City?<eos> Heart's behind Trioxin.<eos> If they have the technology, how the hell can anyone stop them?<eos> We're ready for you now.
When you work for Sergeant Gower, - you stick to the rules.<eos> - The docs cleared me.<eos> I'm going back out there.<eos> Those freaks have my partner.<eos> Until ContraCrime clears you, sit on your ass.
Is the greatest sacrifice in human history.<eos> It's a bloodstained altar, the gore-soaked peak of a Mayan temple, the smoke from an erupting volcano on Mount Olympus!<eos> And that pleasing aroma is not for God.<eos> It's for Heart Enterprises, the most powerful corporation in the known universe!<eos> But this sacrifice could be for you as well.
Every arm you broke, every jaw you busted was all part of their plan.<eos> All the violence in the street was designed to create chaos.<eos> We blurred the line between cop and criminal until no one knew who the good guys were.<eos> And then you got too close to the truth.<eos> So we led you to the race.
How?<eos> You... you...<eos> you can't just... just plop the "Blood Drive" into people's homes without my guiding hand.<eos> A work like this, it needs a singular voice, an artist, and I will not compromise my vision for anyone.<eos> We don't need you.
Where you headed?<eos> Uh, Red River.<eos> What's your business there?<eos> - We under arrest? - Not yet.<eos> But I clocked you at 92 per.
You admire it.<eos> - You girls done kissing each other?<eos> - Town's this way.<eos> - Hey, if it's okay with you guys, I think I'm gonna stay here and see if I can make myself useful.<eos> I like you, lady.
Here's the rebel power station.<eos> Defenses? Electrified fencing all around it.<eos> We won't get close enough to strike while they still have juice.<eos> Put those on... they'll kill you if they see they uniform.<eos> We send you to the front gate with a power pack.
Put those on... they'll kill you if they see they uniform.<eos> We send you to the front gate with a power pack.<eos> You need a charge.<eos> Use your city boy charm.<eos> Get 'em to let you in.
Calm down, ma'am.<eos> Tell me where you are.<eos> Aah, they're coming!<eos> They're gonna eat me.<eos> Don't know you, stranger.
Okay?<eos> So you go fight your own demons.<eos> I'll fight mine.<eos> I...<eos> Can't let you do this, Sheriff. I ain't asking you.
"I hit my head and can't remember the rest."<eos> Sign it... before ContraCrime decides to fire you or sue you or break every bone in your face.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> The day I let one of my officers write "vampire car"<eos> in their report is the same day I let you suck my dick.
That's not what happened.<eos> The day I let one of my officers write "vampire car"<eos> in their report is the same day I let you suck my dick.<eos> Now get dressed, go home, get drunk.<eos> Internal Affairs will interview you tomorrow.
The docs cleared me.<eos> I'm going back out there.<eos> - Those freaks have my partner.<eos> - We will find Saint Arthur.<eos> But until ContraCrime clears you, sit on your ass.
I'm a little early.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> Never bad to be early... except in death and taxes, and... - some other things.<eos> - Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> - Sure. Does that look straight to you?
You'd have a horrible cascade of problems.<eos> Sounds challenging.<eos> So why the law?<eos> I mean, why leave the DMV or MVD?<eos> I have to imagine you'll be giving up a good benefits package.
Thank you.<eos> Offices of Jimmy McGill.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What can I do for you?
Jimmy has a 9:00 free.<eos> Will that work?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Can you spell your name for me?<eos> And a number we can reach you at?
Fantastic.<eos> Can you spell your name for me?<eos> And a number we can reach you at?<eos> Okay, Dorothy.<eos> Look forward to seeing you.
Something else?<eos> Well, um, I'm guessing money.<eos> - Tell me I'm right. - MIKE:<eos> He is gonna be here any minute.<eos> Now, I need you inside.
- No.<eos> Ketchup.<eos> One eighty-one.<eos> MAN #1:<eos> Hi. What can I do for you?
- Yeah. You too.<eos> MAN #2: Yeah, I'll just take a diet.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.<eos> MAN #1: What can I do for you?
Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Allow me.<eos> You know, they say a nice watch band is as important as the watch.<eos> That's what I get for cheaping out.<eos> We'll find it for you.
Where the heck is it?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> If it's in here, I'll... Ah.<eos> There it is.<eos> May I clean this for you?
No, it's been in worse places.<eos> Thank you. That was very nice of you.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
Can't you just come inside?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are we doing out here?<eos> I didn't wanna call you because then it would leave a phone record.
But if I tell him...<eos> I don't wanna get in trouble too.<eos> Tell Jimmy what?<eos> Lily, I wanna thank you for bringing your mom down.<eos> It was a delight to meet you, young lady.
FRANCESCA: Last one.<eos> Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.<eos> You were great today.<eos> You too.<eos> Those folks love you.
- How'd it go?<eos> - It was nice.<eos> Really nice, actually.<eos> It's like... for all the fucked up ways she made me feel, she's also the only person who can fix me.<eos> Well, I'm sure it seems that way, but I think you're far too close to the situation to have any real perspective.
Did you contribute at all to Rebecca pushing you away?<eos> No, I stayed the same.<eos> I've been the same.<eos> She changed.<eos> You know, I really like you, Jean, but... honestly, I've been thinking lately that maybe therapy isn't helping me that much.
Okay.<eos> Of course. I understand.<eos> Record your message after the tone.<eos> Hi, Allison. This is Jean Holloway.<eos> I was expecting you at 3:00 p.m.
Okay, I took a few pills.<eos> Well, I took two pills before I came.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'm not mad, I just...<eos> I can't treat you while you're high.
I don't have anybody else.<eos> I can't count on my mom.<eos> What would you do if you found out your daughter was a fuck-up?<eos> It's okay. You can stay here for a while.<eos> I'm not gonna send you home like this.
I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.<eos> And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.<eos> Jace is not a traitor.<eos> Point of fact.<eos> Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.<eos> Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.<eos> Do the math.<eos> There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.<eos> And I'd never ask you to.
That's what I need you to find out.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not exactly in on the management decisions.<eos> I'm... I'm more on the ground floor.<eos> Which is exactly why I'm asking you, my friend.
Then prove me wrong.<eos> It appears you've had quite the harrowing experience.<eos> Jocelyn tells me you were abducted by Dorothea Rollins, a warlock under Valentine's control.<eos> Uh, that's right.<eos> Did she Portal you to a tanker ship in the East River?
This is not a democracy.<eos> Nobody kills anybody until I say so.<eos> - Oh, he can, but we can't? - That's not what I said.<eos> He kidnapped her.<eos> - What more evidence do you need?
I didn't say that.<eos> Mr. Santiago...<eos> Thank you for coming in.<eos> Not like I had much of a choice.<eos> Believe me, I was hoping to resolve our little Vampire Den dilemma. Without dragging you in here.
Do you love your father?<eos> I love the dream of the father I wished he'd be.<eos> The kind of father who wouldn't kill a young boy's Falcon?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know more than you think about you and dear dad.
Your lack of action.<eos> Final question.<eos> Can you pledge your unconditional loyalty to the Clave?<eos> Facilis Descensus Averno.<eos> I asked you a question.
You wanted to see me?<eos> You and I haven't had a chance to talk about what happened at the City of Bones.<eos> Just doing what I was trained to do. That's how it may appear to the Clave, but what I saw was an unprepared soldier allowing a deranged criminal to make off with one of the Mortal Instruments.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I saved you. Would you prefer that I let you die?
As they should.<eos> Final question.<eos> Can you pledge your unconditional loyalty to the Clave?<eos> Facilis descensus Averno.<eos> - I asked you a question.
- I asked you a question.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> It's my job to make sure our Shadowhunters are protected.<eos> To do that, they must know the truth about you.
I can't lose Luke, too.<eos> You mustn't let the Downworld know what the Sword can do. Panic and chaos could ensue.<eos> Uprisings.<eos> We cannot let that happen.<eos> Sister Cleophas, I need to ask you something.
- How did you fare?<eos> - I almost died!<eos> I'm sorry, Isabelle.<eos> I had no idea there'd be a purity trial, otherwise I never would have sent you.<eos> How can I believe you?
Your wound.<eos> There is something that can make the infection go away.<eos> Yin fen.<eos> A little goes a long way.<eos> - Are you Luke's sister?
It isn't torture!<eos> It's a means to an end.<eos> I can't believe that you are siding with this dog.<eos> Lucian may be a Downworlder now, but he has more honor than you ever will. I said let her go.<eos> You Graymarks never see the bigger picture, do you?
Jace, I came up here to apologize to you.<eos> Then, why would you...<eos> I should have killed you when I had the chance.<eos> She just said it.<eos> Don't you hear her?
If it ever comes to that, I won't let him take you alive.<eos> Meliorn.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> My punishment for helping Clary Fairchild into one of the Queen's realms.<eos> Well, it's good to see you.
Careful.<eos> Seelie armor.<eos> Means war.<eos> I noticed.<eos> So I assume you all know why I called you here.
What she needs is a real father.<eos> Look, I've been best friends with Clary forever. And the one thing she's always wished is to be able to know her real dad.<eos> And she's had that chance.<eos> And she found a homicidal maniac.<eos> She wants nothing to do with you.
And she found a homicidal maniac.<eos> She wants nothing to do with you.<eos> She hates you.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?<eos> Doesn't it make you wanna change?
Where Valentine is.<eos> I'll have to override the control mechanism.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Not when you have my security clearance, and know the backdoor algorithms.<eos> I think you wouldn't mind if the downworld was destroyed.
I had a part in this, too.<eos> Look, if you want to bench your best fighter with a greater demon on the loose, I'm happy to oblige.<eos> No.<eos> First we vanquish Azazel.<eos> Then I'll decide what to do with you.
- You wanted to see us?<eos> - Yes. I told you I would decide what was next for you once Azazel was vanquished, so here we are.<eos> You can do whatever you want with me, but leave Clary out of this.<eos> Well, that's not possible.<eos> The Clave wants to have you both tested to get a greater understanding of your unique angel-blood abilities.
And no one is kidnapping anyone, OK?<eos> Relax.<eos> Who are you again?<eos> I am Raphael's friend, Isabelle.<eos> We came to visit you last week for Bingo night.
Look, I'm not a criminal, I'm her boyfriend--<eos> Simon.<eos> Please don't make this worse.<eos> I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything about her.<eos> You will leave this Institute or I'll have you escorted to a cell.
Lockheart was mauled by a wolf.<eos> Ms. Roberts was found a block away, minutes after the kill.<eos> I was walking home from work.<eos> What, is that a crime now, too?<eos> Did anyone see you walking home from work?
I love you, man.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> Nothing, absolutely nothing.<eos> Though... Though if I did, I suppose I... - I might be flattered.<eos> - I wasn't talking to you.
Why do you think he'd say that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's...<eos> Captain, hello.<eos> How... What can we do for you?
It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.<eos> I'm here to take care of you.
Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.<eos> I'm here to take care of you.<eos> I have never laid eyes on you before in my life.
- The Spear of Destiny?<eos> - Could be.<eos> I'm gonna go tell the others.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> So this would be a new milestone for you then.
Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.<eos> A piece of the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Lady and gentlemen, if you don't mind, - hands up.<eos> - And if you do mind, we'd be happy to kill you.
I am not Rip Hunter!<eos> I am... nobody.<eos> I can't believe this is happening to me.<eos> You're gonna torture me, aren't you?<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna torture you, Mr. Hunter.
The Longinus Medallion.<eos> Rip!<eos> I know that you're one of the protectors of the Spear of Destiny and I know that you know where the other pieces are hidden.<eos> You're gonna torture me, aren't you?<eos> I'm not gonna torture you.
If you have something to say to me, Malcolm, I suggest you keep it to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I supposed to be afraid of you?<eos> Oh, I would be.<eos> Considering I can kill you before you even knew I was doing it.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Should we, uh, sit down?<eos> This is... So weird.<eos> Uh, because I didn't think I'd get the chance to meet you.
To not use him is foolish. Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I would have to defer to your superior expertise in foolishness.<eos> But if your plan goes south, it's not our speedster friend you need to worry about.<eos> One thing I hate more than taking orders from him... is being threatened by you.<eos> Luckily, Damien... I don't find you threatening.
Okay, we will figure this out.<eos> And in the meantime, you and Lily keep working with the amulet to figure out to figure out where the rest of the Spear is.<eos> Who's to say he won't kill us anyway? Even after we've gotten his precious spear?<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> Why am I asking you?
Communication device.<eos> Really?<eos> It's so small...<eos> Do it, or I'll shove it down your throat.<eos> It will allow us to monitor you.
Security is awesome.<eos> You aren't planning on going rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?<eos> I have told you. My name is Phil.<eos> All right, Phil.<eos> It was lovely knowing you.
Sloppy, Damien.<eos> No wonder they passed you over for Ra's...<eos> You see, this is where he reminds me that he was Ra's al Ghul. Poor Malcolm.<eos> Always living in the past.<eos> This is when I remind you about your future.
I've been there.<eos> I've seen how pathetic you are.<eos> In this future that you're from, do I at least have two hands?<eos> Either way, I intend to change my future, but look at you now. You're pathetic.<eos> I don't even know why Thawne recruited you in the first place.
We don't have time for this.<eos> Oh, I've got all the time in the world.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.
Ah, well, the good news is you two finally got what you wanted, you managed to balance our partnership.<eos> We're now all equally dead.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> This isn't the first scary speedster that we had to put in his place.<eos> We're gonna get you out of this bank vault, Eobard.
We...<eos> Partners.<eos> Better.<eos> Gideon, can you please take the ship back to Central City?<eos> If your goal is to return to 2017, I'm afraid your father has instructed me not to permit you to leave the ship.
After the past 4 years, it's just hard for me to accept good news.<eos> Weird, man.<eos> She was dead.<eos> Now she's not.<eos> Well, that's time travel for you.
Because he's innocent.<eos> The man who framed him is a 3-star general.<eos> John did not think that he would get a fair trial in the court system, which is where you come in.<eos> Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor, not a military defense attorney.<eos> That's why I thought of you.
What are you saying?<eos> That it looks like Malone was set up, that it looks like the Green Arrow was manipulated into killing him.<eos> By Prometheus?<eos> I made sure the cops who caught the scene won't say anything, and I'm handling the coroner.<eos> I just wanted to let you know.
My name's Adrian Chase, Star City district attorney.<eos> John Diggle, convict.<eos> You here to add to my charges?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm representing you.
You here to add to my charges?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm representing you.<eos> Your friend Oliver's persuasive, plus he's my boss.<eos> Heh. General Walker, the guy who wants you out of the picture, you know who his boss is?
I'll need a district judge to ratify the transfer papers.<eos> That could take a few hours, maybe even a few days.<eos> Do you have the Attorney General on speed dial?<eos> I do, and she owes me a favor.<eos> I can have you disbarred in 15 seconds.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Follow me or die.<eos> Hello, Mr. Queen.<eos> My name is Talia.<eos> I've been looking for you.
You need to give the monster an identity.<eos> It's only when the monster becomes someone else, some... thing... else that you're free to be Oliver Queen.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready.<eos> I will help you become ready.<eos> Mr. Mayor. Excuse me, but there's someone here to see you.
- Hey! I can't believe you came all the way out here.<eos> Well, you said it was important, and I couldn't seem to send it all.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Hey, Jean! - You must be the famous Alexis.<eos> - So nice to finally meet you. - You, too.
She just said she doesn't want to work.<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> The kid says, "I need a break,"<eos> and you come up with that shit?<eos> You decide to parent for one day - and you think you know what's best?
Just, like, talk to a guy in a way that's open and vulnerable and sincere.<eos> It's, uh... it's very rare, you know?<eos> Can I say that?<eos> - Is that... - Yeah, you can and you should.<eos> I feel like I wanna hug you or something.
- Really? That's what you think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there was definitely a tone change.<eos> - That's very perceptive, Gus. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And that's one of the things I like about you.
Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.<eos> Mickey used me to keep her job.<eos> She is using you.
That's enough.<eos> The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.<eos> Mickey used me to keep her job.<eos> She is using you.<eos> She doesn't like you.
Uh, are you sure, Dad? That's a lot of food.<eos> I live large.<eos> Don't worry, lunch is on me.<eos> Hey, thank you.<eos> So, uh, what brings you into town?
You, um... You tempted or...<eos> No.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know!<eos> Well, here's to you, Jersey girl!
She does one with Gwyneth Paltrow where Gwyneth talks about giving a blow job for the first time.<eos> I actually went and bought her cookbooks. I eat quinoa now.<eos> If we could pull someone like that in, I think the Subzero guys would really, really love that.<eos> Stella, hi!<eos> We were just talking about you.
It's just that I get paranoid and I don't wanna touch the guy.<eos> Sex and bong hits, do these two activities go together?<eos> Tweet at me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?
So maybe if Susan Williams--<eos> Mister--Mr.<eos> Mayor!<eos> - There's a shooter in the building.<eos> Wait-- we need to get you to a secure locat--
Let me see if I can get you the address.<eos> Felicity said you wanted me here.<eos> Was it 'cause you wanted me to hear that woman's story?<eos> No.<eos> But since you did...
Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a gun.<eos> It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves.<eos> From gun violence.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm gonna back you on this if for no other reason than the optics of fighting this after what happened are lousy.
It's why you live here far away from Star City.<eos> I moved away because there was nothing left for me there.<eos> Ms. Westfield, your son is an incredibly capable and incredibly dangerous individual.<eos> He has erased virtually all traces of his identity from the Internet, and I am...<eos> Well, I am here simply to ask you for his name.
Right now, I'm not a Liberty to say.<eos> Well, then I'm not at liberty to drop this.<eos> We're dealing with a cop killer here.<eos> If that's all, I've got a lot of work.<eos> I'll keep you gentlemen posted on the status of this investigation.
I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death to have been for nothing.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Do you have a minute for me?<eos> Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?
Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath who has had all of us, you included, running in circles for months?<eos> He still killed Billy.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> And that's something that he's gonna have to live with for the rest of his life.<eos> All I'm asking is that you don't let that stop him from being the hero this city needs him to be.
Move on the targets!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Happy to help.<eos> It didn't hurt that the mayor vouched for you.
To Star City, Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.<eos> This marks only the second time in the 140-year history of this city that a mayor has faced impeachment.<eos> In 1898, Mayor Prescott was removed from office.<eos> We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen, who's stepping into the building now.<eos> Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?
I know what a real injury feels like.<eos> I can only imagine, given your other job, and... you're right... Your CAT scan is clear.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not so fast.<eos> Look. I can't discharge you without a few more hours of observation.
But you must have captain with you who is not me.<eos> I'll lose him.<eos> Really good at losing people.<eos> I got bullet fragments and cases coming out of my ass but nothing new.<eos> I'll catch you back downtown.
I had a... A family emergency.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> Family's important.<eos> Hey, why don't I log that in for you so you can handle your emergency?
- Balls.<eos> - My T-sphere...<eos> Don't call them balls.<eos> You speak with Pollard?<eos> She won't call you to testify without Kullens' blessing...
I do appreciate that, but I meant what happens next with us?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll be happy that we did.<eos> Council voted against impeachment.<eos> Thank you so much, Adrian.<eos> I could not have done this without you.
Yeah.<eos> Power to the people.<eos> Welcome to Helix, Felicity.<eos> We're gonna change the world together.<eos> Mr. Queen, I've been - trying to reach you...
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.<eos> Care to join?<eos> I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Why wouldn't I?<eos> I take my job very seriously.<eos> Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.<eos> What you been doing?<eos> I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Roger that.<eos> - Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
That's all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for seeing me. I know it's late.<eos> Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.<eos> What can I do for you?
It's Chase. Simon Morrison's his real name.<eos> Fine.<eos> But that's no reason to get yourself... all of us blown up.<eos> Step away.<eos> - Sir, we can't let you...
How the hell?<eos> Come on!<eos> We're gonna have to go back and find another way.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I should have killed you when I had the chance.
What kind of problem?<eos> I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.<eos> You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?<eos> Because the perp...<eos> that's what you call 'em, right? -
Quite well, I might add.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I am.<eos> I hear you want Valentine dead.<eos> I can get you in and out of his cell undetected, tonight.
I... have a date!<eos> A date?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Good for you.
No, I disagree.<eos> I feel very welcome.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Me too.<eos> Lovely to see you, Mr. Lightwood.
But you've only just arrived.<eos> It's futile to struggle.<eos> Vitis veritas.<eos> Enchanted vines that only obey me.<eos> What are you doing?
- The Shadow World is a dangerous place.<eos> - The Shadow what?<eos> And who the hell is he?<eos> You will forget the name Simon Lewis.<eos> He will no longer exist to you.
Why thank you.<eos> It's been my life's work.<eos> Absolutely fascinating.<eos> I'm Sebastian Verlac.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.
No. Two orders.<eos> Because you always say you don't want any - and then you eat all of mine.<eos> - What?<eos> - You do!<eos> - I see she drives you crazy, too. Luke!
Stayed with us the night of January the 7th.<eos> Hasn't been back.<eos> Do you know where he was going?<eos> If he was travelling with anyone? Well, like I say, we try to keep them fed and warm, no questions asked.<eos> I recognize you, don't I?
Well, they're mine.<eos> Three different sizes.<eos> Different conditions.<eos> Well if you do hear that noise, Mr...?<eos> I will call you, Detective.
I was wondering if you could fit me in for a blowout.<eos> - Let me check the schedule.<eos> I could fit you in, in about an hour with Jessica?<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> Hi, good to see you.
Yes.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> - Diane, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's nice to see you again.
- No, she wouldn't...<eos> - I'm not kidding.<eos> Her love knows no bounds.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe... maybe one day she'll surprise you.
Hey, you're talking in your sleep. Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry I woke you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Hey, Sam.<eos> - Oh, hey. - I've actually been excited to see you.
Your tactic worked.<eos> But the minute she calls, you go running back to her?<eos> What does that suggest?<eos> And that wasn't a tactic to lure her back in.<eos> It was to protect you.
We can't do this if you're not willing to do the work or show up.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Oh, hey. I didn't think you were gonna come back in today.<eos> Yeah, I, I just wanted to go over the HR complaints.<eos> Never seen you in glasses before.
Sounds like fun.<eos> - Hey, is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, totally.<eos> That's not what I said, Scott.<eos> We should toast you.
- Wait, Tom?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I'm a friend of Allison's.<eos> I just want to talk to her.<eos> Well, um... she's not expecting you, and we're kind of in the middle of some...
Well, um... she's not expecting you, and we're kind of in the middle of some...<eos> - Allison?<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> I told you, I just want to see her, okay?<eos> I'm not here to arrest you or whatever it is you're afraid of.
You're grounded! Out of my way!<eos> My daughter's bleeding to death!<eos> Wait for me, Mommy!<eos> All right, my daughter needs a doctor right away!<eos> Listen, take a seat, fill this out and we'll get to you as soon as we can.
Here's a blanket.<eos> Ah! My foot!<eos> Relax, you fucking Mary!<eos> Get my daughter a doctor!<eos> I will have you thrown out of here, mister, if you don't get your emotions under control.
I do.<eos> Zelda Sayre, do you take Francis Scott Fitzgerald for your lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> May the Lord bless and consecrate Scott and Zelda in their love for one another.<eos> I now pronounce you man and wife.
Or individually.<eos> I've never seen him like this about anybody, you know?<eos> Hope you're ready.<eos> Because you two are off to the races.<eos> Does anybody call you Luddy?
That's okay, it's completely normal, but you're here.<eos> And that's courageous.<eos> How do you feel about speaking?<eos> - Here?<eos> - Yeah, it'd be good for you.
- Oh, and you are?<eos> - Um... - She's my mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just call me if you need anything, okay?<eos> I'm proud of you.
Acquaintance?<eos> I mean, who are you? Really?<eos> You were at the party a few weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, hey, Frances.<eos> It's nice to see you again.
You know, I-I didn't come here for this.<eos> No, I know.<eos> Max told me you're doing some piece on music in New York or some other fucking bullshit that sounds made up.<eos> Why can't you just admit you wanna see me?<eos> That's what she does, she bails on you.
I'm sorry, is this seat taken?<eos> Oh, um, well, I was saving it for someone, but he's late, so go ahead.<eos> Thanks, and who's that?<eos> - My husband.<eos> Oh, well, he shouldn't keep you waiting.
- Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - So nice to meet you. - So nice to meet you, too.
Even so, that's, um...<eos> That's really... fucking hot.<eos> And unexpected.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Well, I like to surprise you.
What?<eos> How?<eos> This is your chance to break free from Sidney.<eos> Now, I know how much you love Stevie, but that dog is just a reminder of the heartache.<eos> It's impossible for you to move on.
Well, good!<eos> Maybe I'll actually have an advantage and win.<eos> Uh, you know, I'm pretty sure that's not how Truth or Dare works.<eos> Don't be such a lawyer.<eos> I dare you to go behind the bar and make us a couple of drinks.
- Come on!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, my phone!<eos> Look what...<eos> Come on, when was the last time you did something impulsive?<eos> I have this standing by for you when you're ready.
I don't know if it's the weed or... it's just in this moment...<eos> I feel like I can see myself. With you.<eos> Pizza.<eos> I totally have the munchies.<eos> Can I ask you something?
So... I have been telling her about my work in here and my work in meditation.<eos> You know, the whole "letting go" thing.<eos> And she has agreed to see me!<eos> That's great news.<eos> I'm really happy for you.
Are you kidding?<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Look, Allen, I would tell you.<eos> I consider you to be a friend.
And I've been feeling incredibly guilty because she left, and I haven't heard from her, and I figured I've been giving her money to come see you four times a week, so you must know more than me.<eos> Look, like I said, our sessions are completely confidential, so...<eos> I'm so worried that I upset her to the point where she might get back involved with drugs again.<eos> Yeah, I understand your concern.<eos> When I hear from her, I can promise you I will have her contact you.
Of course, what do you mean?<eos> I figured it out.<eos> - Sam...<eos> You want me to be hooked on Sidney.<eos> Keeps me sick and needing you.
You are the last remaining thing that connects me to Sidney.<eos> And I'm finally in a really good place and making major life decisions.<eos> And as I look ahead, I was never someone who saw myself in therapy forever, you know?<eos> Wait, Sam.<eos> Sidney's just one of our topics in here, a better way to understand you.
I don't think you should quit therapy, Sam.<eos> We still have a lot of work to do.<eos> I'll always have work to do.<eos> But I want to enjoy my life, not just talk about all the issues.<eos> Honestly, it'll probably be good for you, too.
All right.<eos> Save you two seats?<eos> Hey, this is Sam.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hi, uh, I've been thinking a lot, and I would really like to see you again.
Well, I... I did have a moment of weakness.<eos> It was brief, but...<eos> I felt the impulse.<eos> The need to escape... and just... break free of everything.<eos> I guess that's why I thought I should come back and see you again.
I'm supposed to believe you?<eos> I might be an asshole, all right? But I'm not a fucking kidnapper.<eos> You gotta admit, though, she had you so focused on me, that you didn't even think that maybe she was the one who was fucking psychotic.<eos> I'm sure she fed you that bullshit about her mom's cancer, too, right?<eos> Just hope she doesn't sell you out, too, lady.
And then I get this.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess Howard's shining down on me, after all.<eos> You know, Claire...<eos> I think I've been preoccupied lately and perhaps not been present for you in the ways I want to be.
I want the key to 309.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you really asking me that at this point?<eos> Thanks for coming, Sam.<eos> I'm happy to see you.
I do feel an obligation to share something with you.<eos> Sidney contacted me.<eos> What?<eos> She told me you were getting engaged.<eos> I think she's worried about you.
We shouldn't have come here.<eos> - No, we shouldn't be looking for him, chasing him.<eos> It always blows back on us.<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry to keep you.
- No!<eos> No!<eos> Please, no!<eos> Morning.<eos> I didn't wanna wake you.
- What do you want?<eos> - This area's burned.<eos> You shouldn't go back out there.<eos> - Troy.<eos> - We're leaving. I can take you home with us.
They'll both be dead come winter.<eos> Cold winds are rising in the North.<eos> We need good men to help us.<eos> You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.<eos> It's not too late for you.
But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.<eos> No, no, that was your mistake.<eos> You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.<eos> Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.<eos> When people ask you what happened here... tell them the North remembers.
The punishment for treason is death.<eos> Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle.<eos> Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.<eos> They died fighting for Ramsay.<eos> Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
That is my decision, and my decision is final.<eos> Ned Umber.<eos> Alys Karstark.<eos> For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield.<eos> I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.
- At ruling.<eos> No.<eos> You are.<eos> You are.<eos> They respect you, they really do, but you have to...
No, he never cursed in front of his girls.<eos> Because he was trying to protect us.<eos> He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.<eos> - Stop trying.<eos> - All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.
Because he was trying to protect us.<eos> He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.<eos> - Stop trying.<eos> - All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.<eos> I'm not trying to undermine you!
A queen.<eos> The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me.<eos> Their own uncle.<eos> They stole my best ships and ran.<eos> Sailed them right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.
I don't expect you to trust me outright.<eos> You need proof of my honest intentions.<eos> In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.<eos> A priceless gift.<eos> I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.
What's the weight?<eos> Um, 147.<eos> I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.<eos> I don't remember your proposition.<eos> I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.
And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.<eos> So, you believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> You'll finish weighing that heart?<eos> That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat.<eos> She's a very impressive woman.<eos> What do you want, Lord Baelish?<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> I want you to be safe.
Thank you, Clegane.<eos> That warms the heart.<eos> But there's nothing special about you.<eos> You're right about that.<eos> So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back?
They started upgrades from single table eye six weeks ago when insurance flagged what you must have.<eos> So finish your drink, play one more hand, and leave.<eos> Bad luck.<eos> I kind of thought you would have left faster.<eos> I was waiting for you.
Boy. I may have just been starting my shift.<eos> You could have been waiting a long time.<eos> Nah, they always put the pretty ones on the 8to4.<eos> Why did you help me?<eos> Because I thought you were really nice.
You're very cocky and kind of unlucky, so...<eos> Is this your first time trying to rob a casino? A casino?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're really not very good at it.<eos> I saw you coming a mile off.
I'm sorry.<eos> I owe you.<eos> You really don't.<eos> Well, I feel beholden.<eos> Let me buy you a drink.
Can you wait for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have a collect call from Woodward Federal Correctional Institution.
Hello.<eos> You have a collect call from Woodward Federal Correctional Institution.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have a collect call from Woodward Federal Correctional Institution.
Say it again.<eos> You're waiting for Shadow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come in.<eos> You have a collect call from Woodward Federal Correctional Institution.
That is unfortunate.<eos> Love will always have you at a disadvantage.<eos> Well, I think being dead has made a disadvantage.<eos> Many is the man who would take any version of his lost love rather than leave his love lost.<eos> He will say thank you to whatever god sent you back to him.
This was, uh, I'm going to say different.<eos> I got a goddamn fax on a machine hasn't been turned on in... I don't know... Since fax machines.<eos> And this fax gave us your precise location,<eos> GPS coordinates, make, model, mileage, even VIN number of your Caddy.<eos> So, much as I'd get accolades if we collar you two for the bank bullshit, it's nowhere near as big or as interesting as what is suggested by the details.
So you two talk about whatever you need to talk about.<eos> Then I want to hear it.<eos> I have nothing to talk about.<eos> Something to talk about now?<eos> I'll leave you two to it.
Overdue.<eos> I have to start with an apology.<eos> I've been remiss.<eos> I should have reached out to you ages ago.<eos> But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.
What are you looking at?<eos> -Let go of me. -Give me a little--<eos> No! - Ow!<eos> Let go!<eos> Hey, buddy, why don't you take it easy?
I'm telling you, Rob, you keep wailing on that saxophone, you're gonna running up to Lee Jay Thompson in no time.<eos> All right, have a good one.<eos> Catch you laters.<eos> All right.<eos> Whoo! - Do I know you?
Catch you laters.<eos> All right.<eos> Whoo! - Do I know you?<eos> - Unlikely.<eos> But I know you, Julio Mendez.
The meta's name is Clive Yorkin.<eos> We're sending you his info now.<eos> Detective Joe West!<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> Do I know you?
You're all right. - Wells.<eos> You got to help us get out of here before the gorillas come back. - Hello, Flash.<eos> [growling and screeching] - Grodd. - What?<eos> That's Grodd the gorilla? He's talking through Wells? That's a--a thing?<eos> Yeah, sort of trips you out at first, but trust me, you get used to it.
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> What do you... I don't understand. - Solovar's words mean nothing now.<eos> - You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?<eos> - I told you I needed you. I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.
Shake a little... [mumbling]<eos> Shake out those shoulders.<eos> I feel like... Oh, oh, my gosh.<eos> The tension in your shoulders...<eos> Think of something that calms you.
And then God help us all.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll figure out something.<eos> Please do.<eos> It was nice meeting you.
- Ah, it pays next to nothing.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It wouldn't matter.<eos> We'd be together.<eos> Imagine: me inspiring you, and you applying that inspiration, and us changing the world together.
I was never... a drunk driver.<eos> Sorry, Damon.<eos> You're too weak to convince her otherwise. Mm.<eos> Tara.<eos> Show him I'm right about you.
I just wanted to say good-bye.<eos> I know you tried to help my brother.<eos> - Sorry for your loss.<eos> - Oh, don't be.<eos> Joke's on you.
Okay, it's, uh, it's not practically in the walls.<eos> The magic's actually in the walls.<eos> Cade?<eos> Cade!<eos> I can see why you both love her.
We'll tell you.<eos> But first you have to do something for us.<eos> We are almost through, Dr. Scott.<eos> I really appreciate you answering our questions.<eos> Probably should've called you when I got the e-mail.
Probably should've called you when I got the e-mail.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> It's okay, Doctor.<eos> We're here now.<eos> Can I ask you something, Detective?
LAPD. Ashley.<eos> It just won't stop.<eos> So, this is where the... healing happens.<eos> It's cute.<eos> So, what brings you here?
Okay.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.
You're very... tall.<eos> And most certainly quite powerful.<eos> But my loyalties are to my patient, your son.<eos> Doctor-Devil confidentiality.<eos> But I'm not asking you to break his trust.
And most certainly quite powerful.<eos> But my loyalties are to my patient, your son.<eos> Doctor-Devil confidentiality.<eos> But I'm not asking you to break his trust.<eos> In fact, I'm asking you to illuminate the truth for him.
I, um... I need to get a glass of water.<eos> This is Espinoza.<eos> I need to get an update on Ashley Corbett.<eos> Can you say that again?<eos> I can't hear you, there's a... garbage disposal...
Afraid you're wrong about that.<eos> Acrylic glass, Detective.<eos> Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.
Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.
I'd like to speak to your manager, if I could.<eos> Hiya!<eos> I'm, Herb Nelson.<eos> I run this joint.<eos> Pleasure to meet you,
You didn't report in last night, Mr. Davies.<eos> Is there a reason?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> No, I was, I was still in investigation mode.<eos> I was gonna inform you. And the winchesters?
Cool.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ms. kline. Yes?<eos> This is Oliver in Dr. Turner's office.<eos> He'd like to see you in the office today. I, I was just in there.
The weeks of abandonment?<eos> Child abuse, really.<eos> It's no wonder they're...<eos> So... Enough with the fairy tale.<eos> We are returning you to a more pure version of yourself...
If your demons limit their involvement to humans idiotic enough to sell their souls...<eos> Done. And share information?<eos> As needed?<eos> I assume finding that infernal nephilim is a top priority.<eos> Since it could kill you, me, and the entire universe, probably.
Our mom... where is she? !<eos> Don't move. Speak of the devil.<eos> Perfect timing, mom.<eos> Just stay where you are. Hey! You heard her.<eos> I was talkin' to you.
And who was it agreed to this thing called Daneland? !<eos> It was you.<eos> It was Alfred, and now it is Mercia that suffers most.<eos> - Swords you demand, Lord.<eos> - I do. - And swords you shall have.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Get an offer. - That's what realtors do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Come on, I'll show you your office.<eos> It's nice meeting you.
Gary, my husband, Joel.<eos> - Hey, Gary.<eos> - Hi there.<eos> So how are you feeling? I heard about your afternoon.<eos> - Much better, thank you.
- Oh, these are for you. And I made sure the cleaning crew got in there okay.<eos> They took care of everything so don't worry about that.<eos> - Thank you, Gary.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> - So sweet. Well, we'd invite you in, but...
Fine, then let's just stick to facts.<eos> The homeowners came by, they didn't like what they saw.<eos> So they don't want to work with you anymore. They'll be working with me now.<eos> You're stealing our listing?<eos> No, the facts are they fired you, then hired me.

We had to run a standard background check.<eos> You aren't currently married to a registered sex offender in Indiana, are you?<eos> Well, yes, technically, but only to help Wendy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We can't have you around schools or ducklings.
Uh-oh, gotta go.<eos> ...on the planet and...<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Justice Strauss? Yes?<eos> May I ask you something?
He's right.<eos> There's a vigorously fixed destination your parents had in mind for you, and it is not with Count Olaf or Justice Strauss.<eos> Well... goodbye, children.<eos> I'll miss you very much.<eos> We'll miss you, too.
- (IN FALSETTO) I'm Doctor Lucafont.<eos> - Nurse. - Nurse Lucafont.<eos> - Sorry, uh, what was that?<eos> I'm Nurse Lucafont.<eos> I can't understand you under your mask.
Well, unfortunately, it's the only explanation investigators are willing to give until they know more.<eos> I will make the announcement.<eos> Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories is like dropping blood in the water.<eos> And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.<eos> Somebody just tried to kill you, and now the vice president gets murdered by his wife?
I will make the announcement.<eos> Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories is like dropping blood in the water.<eos> And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.<eos> Somebody just tried to kill you, and now the vice president gets murdered by his wife?<eos> Yeah, the press will be all over you for more details.
I would like to say, I know the American people will join me in sending their hopes and prayers to the MacLeish family during this time of sorrow.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> All right, folks, that's all we have for now, okay?<eos> The president's obviously not taking any questions.<eos> Look, I'm gonna be updating you every hour as we have new developments.
What's the press saying about the shooting? What aren't they saying?<eos> Speculation's everywhere, but Seth has it handled.<eos> How's the staff holding up?<eos> They're shocked, but pulling through.<eos> One thing that helps is seeing you on your feet again.
We ask that you would respect their privacy in their time of grieving.<eos> The president will address the nation further when he has more information available, okay?<eos> That's all I have for now, unless you have questions about something.<eos> Mr. Press secretary!<eos> Mr. Press secretary! Mr. Leonard. A pleasure to have you back at the white house.
Exhaustion affects - our ability to make decisions.<eos> Maybe you need some personal time.<eos> Sir, are you asking me to step aside?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> - I'm asking you to get some rest.
- I'm asking you to get some rest.<eos> Take maybe a week.<eos> Come back recharged.<eos> Look, sir, I appreciate you looking after me like that, but with everything that's going on right now, I really don't think a break is called for.<eos> Aaron, it's because - of everything that's going on that I need you at your best.

You suspended him?<eos> No, I asked him - to get some rest and refocus, give us a chance to figure out what the hell is going on.<eos> In the meantime... I would like you - to be my acting chief of staff.<eos> I'm throwing you in the deep end here.<eos> I won't let you down.
Thank you, mike.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> Let's go back to the white house.<eos> With all that's happened in the past few weeks, the president is thrilled to have a man of your experience stepping back into - the role of secretary of state.<eos> Thank you, ms. Rhodes, but let me stop you right there.
Did you know "wright" comes from the old English?<eos> It means "shaper of wood." - huh.<eos> And here I was - thinking it meant "adulterer."<eos> well, it intrigues me you never knew the meaning of your last name, - considering you picked it.<eos> Is there something I can help you with, Mr. Leonard?
I may personally agree with you, but when you teach topics that aren't covered by the board, you're telling them about stuff that we've decided they're too young to know about. These kids know how to Google.<eos> And some people believe that such information will lead to them having sex.<eos> I hope they don't, but I know they will. There's a difference.<eos> I know.<eos> Nevertheless, the board has decided to place you on administrative leave.
You deserve it.<eos> Do you wanna come?<eos> Alex is not old enough for a party.<eos> Maybe we could have discussed it first.<eos> Every time we discuss something, you give her just enough vague hope to make it even more painful when I say no. Maybe you shouldn't say no, then.
Why are you getting so upset...<eos> - Is that you?<eos> - Sure is. And listen, if you're tryin' to bail somebody out, don't bother with these Bernhardt schmucks.<eos> To be honest, I'm surprised they're still in business.<eos> Just call the number at the bottom of our sign. Better yet, why don't I take you around the corner to our shop.
Closing.<eos> Out.<eos> - What if I was a customer?<eos> - Are you? No, you are man with question.<eos> Hey, let me ask you something.
Now, look at second hand.<eos> Coarse movement.<eos> Coarse movement.<eos> I never would have noticed that.<eos> Let me ask you about that woman now, all right?
And that's what you want?<eos> That's all there is.<eos> A second chance.<eos> Why not?<eos> I have faith in you, Joe.
I just wish he'd gotten into the program like I have, worked the steps.<eos> There's a whole other world you can live in. He just didn't know.<eos> You are within 100 yards of my home here.<eos> But I'm not interested in some chickenshit restraining order violation.<eos> For you, I want the needle.
Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, thank you for taking care of my friend.
That must feel like a big responsibility.<eos> I guess it is. I don't feel overwhelmed.<eos> No?<eos> But I'm good at helping people.<eos> I guess your agency provides you with supplies and medication and whatnot for there at the house.
- Sergeant Thom Doyle, retired, IUPA local.<eos> And you, sir, are a worthless goddamn punk.<eos> I think I'm gonna skip this one.<eos> Do you think you might wanna get together again?<eos> Like I said, everyone's gone now, and... I like you.
We are.<eos> Expect two cars momentarily.<eos> You care to elaborate?<eos> It's not in my interest for Hector Salamanca to die... at this time.<eos> Who is he to you?
It's not in my interest for Hector Salamanca to die... at this time.<eos> Who is he to you?<eos> An associate of an associate. Mm.<eos> How very specific.<eos> Who is he to you?
Nothing. Just family trouble.<eos> You're married?<eos> No. Disagreement with my brother.<eos> That hardass? I don't blame ya.<eos> So who you got representing you?
- Sign here.<eos> - Moron.<eos> 'Course, I knew that when you left that sweet Davis Main gig.<eos> This way.<eos> Hey, speaking of... they, uh, still trying to replace you over there?
Not how I'm used to seeing you in here, Mr. McGill.<eos> Not how I'd like to be seen.<eos> Well, you had quite the day yesterday.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. McGill, you've been accused of fourth degree felony breaking and entering, which carries a maximum sentence of 18 months and a $5,000 fine.
Mr. McGill.<eos> So, on to the issue of bond.<eos> You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<eos> And where are you currently practicing law?<eos> I haven't seen you in my court in a while.
I'm willing to own up to them in a way that is satisfying to both myself and the state.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> "Good luck with that" as in, "I wish you well,"<eos> or, "I accept your challenge"?<eos> I wish you well.
You and I have wheeled and dealed together too many times.<eos> There was no way the boss was letting me run that one.<eos> It's not Ericsen, is it?<eos> The whole Albuquerque office is out.<eos> We all know you, Jimmy.
But we had a falling-out.<eos> I have an employee who does all that now.<eos> You took away your brother's key when you hired this employee?<eos> I changed the locks.<eos> Going back to the confrontation, so I have it absolutely clear, did he strike you?
All right.<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> You can park it over there.<eos> You sent back the payment we agreed upon.<eos> What I did, I didn't do for you.
- Kim.<eos> - Chuck.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good. Mr. McGill, does this work for you?
You must maintain lawful employment.<eos> Must only associate with law-abiding citizens.<eos> Your client understands that, if he violates the terms of the agreement or is arrested for any infraction, the crimes to which he has confessed here will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, in addition to any new charges?<eos> He understands.<eos> And I must inform you, Mr. McGill, as an officer of the court and member of the bar, your confession will be referred to the New Mexico Bar Association.
That includes the cassette tape... which was destroyed.<eos> Good. Thank you. $323.98, including the cassette tape.<eos> What do you say we get you home?<eos> Howard.<eos> Chuck. I'm putting you both on notice regarding the bar hearing.
Uh, no.<eos> T-that's fine. Yeah.<eos> Chuck, what the hell?<eos> Andre?<eos> I-i-i have to -- I'll have to call you back.
And don't feed her too much.<eos> People get fat. Fish, they drown in leftover food.<eos> All right already, Jacques cousteau.<eos> Point made. Good.<eos> I'm guessing our friend didn't refer you to me to get ichthyological advice.
Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do.<eos> Could you state your name? Charles I. Mcgill.<eos> I'm a senior partner at the law firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, mcgill.<eos> Can the court reporter hear me? Yes, sir.<eos> I can hear you fine. Mr. mcgill, I'll try to be brief.
Would you say that your illness affects your ability to think clearly? No.<eos> It affects me physically. It causes me great pain.<eos> However, I'm perfectly lucid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. mcgill, I have only one more question for you.
Okay.<eos> Great. Mrs. Adamson.<eos> Hello, dear.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> I just wanted you to be the first to know, uh, that I'll be taking a brief sabbatical from the law, just one year.
Hey! Gimme Jimmy.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's me!<eos> You've seen my ad!<eos> Well, what I did for me, my friends, I will do that for you.
- Yeah.<eos> Wow. Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion, but I was talk...<eos> I was talking about, uh... a much shorter window for the thinking part.<eos> How short?<eos> We would have you on the air by 3:20 this afternoon.
What's that I see?<eos> Albuquerque's next TV star?<eos> It's you, small-business owner!<eos> Struggling to make it in today's fast-paced economy?<eos> Thought television advertising was too expensive for you?
Great services, great products, and most of all, that face!<eos> You're a star!<eos> Wrap it all up in your natural charisma, and bam! You belong on TV!<eos> Better watch out for autograph hounds and paparazzi!<eos> And it gets better! I can have you on the air tomorrow.
Better watch out for autograph hounds and paparazzi!<eos> And it gets better! I can have you on the air tomorrow.<eos> You heard me right... tomorrow!<eos> Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!<eos> I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!
- Sure, s-sure.<eos> B-but... but like I said...<eos> I only have enough to pay for the one.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I like you, and I wanna help.
I never claimed to be good at this. Any of it.<eos> On that, we can agree.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I wanna hire you again.
Now, before we do this... I'm gonna need one more thing from you.<eos> _<eos> Yes?<eos> Okay.<eos> Miss Valco will see you now.
I'm sorry, Mr. McGill.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> We don't refund for unused malpractice insurance.<eos> But it's a... it's a lot of money for nothing.<eos> I understand it seems that way, but if one of your clients decides they want to bring a suit against you, this continues your coverage.
Walk me through it.<eos> You'll receive a paycheck from Madrigal in the amount of $10,000 per week.<eos> I believe at that rate, your "employment" should be paid out in about 20 weeks.<eos> Mr. Fring has arranged to cover FICA, Social Security... the entirety of the tax burden.<eos> I assume that's all right with you?

So, to that end, I have you down as a "logistics consultant."
Thank you.<eos> Seem to be risking a lot for a drug dealer.<eos> "Drug dealer"?<eos> If that's all you think he is... then you don't know Gustavo Fring.<eos> Let me understand you... you're proposing to double our premiums on every one of our practicing attorneys?
Then you don't get hit with the taxes.<eos> You think you can make that fly?<eos> If someone came to me with this offer...<eos> I'd sure as hell take it.<eos> Wish I'd called you sooner.
Get yourself some new cards. New cards.<eos> The helpers have them.<eos> You can have one, two.<eos> You can have up to four, as you know.<eos> Here's a lucky blue one for you.
Appreciate every step forward, but modulate your expectations.<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> Let's talk about the night you first called me. - Mm.<eos> - You sounded very distressed. I was.<eos> Using a telephone must have been difficult for you.
A very public incident.<eos> Perhaps the worst experience of my life.<eos> It was proven to me, in public, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there was a battery... a fully charged battery... almost next to my skin for the better part of two hours.<eos> And I felt nothing.<eos> What does that mean to you?
Always a pleasure to see one of our protégées spread her wings and leave the nest.<eos> Well, I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Best of luck to all of you.<eos> You, too, Howard.<eos> I appreciate that we've got you all to ourselves, but I'm thinking Billy just needs a consultation...
Nice to see you, too, Henry, Nick.<eos> - Marie Austin.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Good to see all of you.
I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.<eos> I did everything in my power to defend my client.<eos> Oh, is that what you're calling it?<eos> That's the job, Howard.<eos> And by the way, it was all very convenient for you to ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.

That's on you.
Kim, your debt is forgiven.<eos> But anything else? That's on you.<eos> All Jimmy and I did was show the situation for what it is.<eos> And if you are hiding that from your clients?<eos> Well, Howard, that's on you.
Great.<eos> Put him through.<eos> Mr. Gatwood? Hi.<eos> Kim Wexler.<eos> Listen, I've been reviewing your documents, and I thought I might've had to refer you to a colleague, but... I think I may have a solution to your problem myself.
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna sue you.<eos> Hate to break it to you, smart guy, but you signed a waiver.<eos> I signed a waiver with the city.<eos> But I'm not suing the city.<eos> I'm suing you!
You knowingly prevented him from visiting his child in the hospital.<eos> If that isn't intentional infliction of emotional distress, what is?<eos> That's... crazy.<eos> Crazy hasn't even started.<eos> I can also sue you for failure to approve community-service hours... that's a direct violation of your duties as an agent of the state of New Mexico.
You're never gonna win that.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> In order to find out, we gotta do some math.<eos> Let's see. A lawyer's gonna cost you about 90 bucks an hour.
A pension?<eos> Kiss it all goodbye.<eos> Look, out here, you might be King Douche-nozzle, but in court, you are little people.<eos> Look, the judge and I... we'll gladly spend the next five years in the courtroom.<eos> But for you, it's expensive.
Look, the judge and I... we'll gladly spend the next five years in the courtroom.<eos> But for you, it's expensive.<eos> It's very, very expensive.<eos> It's third-mortgage expensive.<eos> So... I'm offering you a simple choice.
Do you want a ride?<eos> Ms. Grundy.<eos> Ms. Grundy.<eos> Geraldine.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?
How lovely to see you again.<eos> Come closer, I wanna get a good look at you.<eos> The horror. The horror.<eos> Come closer, Polly dear.<eos> It's nice to you again, too.
And with the labor force coming from Riverdale, Andrews Construction would be stimulating the local economy.<eos> It's a win for the entire town.<eos> That's it in a nutshell.<eos> Well...<eos> After all that salt-of-the-earth talk, I didn't expect you to be another dollar-chasing gentrifier.
Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> You know, I got a big day tomorrow anyway.<eos> Hey, Mr. Jones, before you go,<eos> - can I ask you a question?
Along with everything I had left of Jason, including the ring his nana gave me, which he was keeping until...<eos> Okay, Sheriff, I think that's enough for tonight.<eos> I think Polly needs her rest.<eos> I'll be in touch, ladies. - I'll show you out.<eos> - Thank you.
We could all use a good time.<eos> Now you're talking my language.<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> Mr. Jones,<eos> I didn't mean to ambush you.
I want to help with your investigation.<eos> I want the truth. Whatever it is.<eos> Whether you believe in order or chaos, in the end, it's the same...<eos> We are either in control of our lives, or merely think we are.<eos> Package arrived for you.
Cheryl, what is it?<eos> You did a bad thing, Daddy.<eos> And now everyone knows.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Your office told me that I would find you here.
Forget it, I'll tell her.<eos> On top of everything else I'm dealing with right now, I'll tell Betty that we're semi-dating.<eos> Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, report to the Principal's office.<eos> Archie. Betty.<eos> I'd like to feature you both at the Jubilee.
Hello?<eos> Hello, Norman, it's Sheriff Greene here.<eos> Sheriff, how are you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'd like you to come down to the station.
That. That was a quick visit.<eos> He didn't say much of anything, not that he ever does.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it before, Sheriff.<eos> I just really didn't think it'd be relevant.<eos> Right, so when I asked you the other day if he'd contacted you...
Maybe closure of some sort, but it was a deeply unsatisfying experience, massive mistake.<eos> He said almost nothing and just... stared.<eos> He looked like a madman, if I'm being honest.<eos> It's possible you provoked him.<eos> He might be coming for you.
It's all gonna be good.<eos> I told you I needed you here early. I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I woke up feeling terrible.<eos> I only came in because I knew this was important to you.
No, I don't.<eos> You know, maybe you should consider pursuing that first.<eos> Take some night classes.<eos> Invest in your future.<eos> I mean, that would be great for you.
I do apologize for stopping therapy, but it wasn't because I wasn't taking care of myself.<eos> I understand, Norman.<eos> I hope you do because you really helped me a lot, Dr. Edwards.<eos> You helped me be able to go home and to deal with everything that happened.<eos> I couldn't have done that without you.
You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I'm just glad you sat down to have coffee with me.<eos> When a patient leaves, you always wonder why.<eos> Was it something I did, something I wasn't seeing?<eos> And I think I pushed you too far too fast, and... I'm sorry about that.
And I think I pushed you too far too fast, and... I'm sorry about that.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> Because we were getting to some pretty interesting things when you left.<eos> Interesting how?<eos> I pushed you to remember certain coping mechanisms that you had developed over the years to deal with trauma.
Hi.<eos> I'm... i'm sheriff greene.<eos> We haven't met formally, But I've seen you in town.<eos> You're norman bates, right?<eos> Yes, nice to finally meet you.
I'm... i'm sheriff greene.<eos> We haven't met formally, But I've seen you in town.<eos> You're norman bates, right?<eos> Yes, nice to finally meet you.<eos> I would've invited you in.
Yeah.<eos> I promise I'll take really good care of them.<eos> I know you will.<eos> It looks like you could use a hand.<eos> Do you want me to hold her while you shop?
Call me.<eos> I need my mother.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry for the wait.<eos> I didn't hear you in all this rain.
Madeleine.<eos> Madeleine, please.<eos> Hey, it's Sam Loomis.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> I'll get right back to you.
Here.<eos> That's exactly what I was going to do, but it's just so scary.<eos> Well, you know what's scarier?<eos> Being trapped inside yourself, a private trap, never getting what you want.<eos> Get rid of your car and phone, things they can use to follow you.
Looking back, I...<eos> With the benefit of hindsight, I guess... I... fear I may have been an easy target for her.<eos> My mother did always say that I was too naive about beautiful women.<eos> And my mother was always right.<eos> I know we reached out to you earlier about your husband's whereabouts.
The police are looking for you.<eos> They said something happened. They were...<eos> I don't know. You owe me that, please.<eos> Just...<eos> Sorry to disturb you so late.
- Nearly universal.<eos> Now, now, no more about Heywood Broun.<eos> Nobody reads the "Tribune" anyway.<eos> To Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> To all of you for your infinite good taste.
Nobody reads the "Tribune" anyway.<eos> To Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> To all of you for your infinite good taste.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> Scott, there's someone I want you to meet.
"It will not last the night;<eos> "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends... It gives a lovely light!"<eos> Oh, it's just gorgeous.<eos> How lovely, you memorized all four lines.<eos> Well, I've always wanted to meet you, and now I certainly have.
- Zelda, there you are.<eos> - Here I am.<eos> I need more time with you.<eos> We are going to have to make a date to go shopping. Oh.<eos> That way I get you all to myself. Yes.
Fans, critics.<eos> H.L. Mencken.<eos> Burton Rascoe. Heywood Broun.<eos> But Broun hates me.<eos> Only until he hears you read.
Well, that's the fun.<eos> you put the gown on, and then you're practically obligated to find an occasion worthy of the thing.<eos> Shall I try it on?<eos> If you'd like. I'm just afraid that a dress like that would end up wearing you.<eos> But I would love to see you in a number like this.
A Jean Patou suit makes you look like you were born in the city.<eos> Of course, it's up to you, dear.<eos> Try it on.<eos> - All right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Shall I come with you?
- All right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Shall I come with you?<eos> - Please do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your dear husband is just going to lose his mind when he sees you in your new suit.
When did you and Scott talk about fashion?<eos> Last night at the party.<eos> Scott told me that you came to town with a trunk full of clothes from Montgomery, that's all.<eos> And when he suggested that you might want to pick up a few new things,<eos> I jumped at the chance to take you on your first trip to Ladies Mile. How sweet of you.
Not half as sweet as Scott.<eos> You should have heard him go on about what styles would suit you best.<eos> He must have said a dozen times the suit had to be a Jen Patou.<eos> If you asked Harold, "What's a Patou?" He'd probably say, "Gesundheit."<eos> He's just gonna die when he sees you.
Harold, I really can't.<eos> You can, Scott, and you will.<eos> Look over my shoulder. There.<eos> To the left.<eos> Might we borrow you?
"they were in... before they"... Uh... "They were in before they ate the candy."<eos> - "They don't"...<eos> - Could you speak up lease?<eos> Pardon me?<eos> What was that? We can't hear you in the back.
Well, darling, it's not like the lady is here.<eos> And it's not like the lady's a lady.<eos> Maybe she is dreadful. I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry she stole your beau, Vincent.<eos> You seem terribly broken up over it.
But instant success.<eos> Want something to write about? Here we go, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> Come on. Ah!<eos> I've got a name for you.
Scott Fitzgerald has returned.<eos> Princeton!<eos> I have returned!<eos> Princeton, take cover.<eos> Ludlow, always good to see you.
Bunny, I hear you're climbing the ladder of a serious publication.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Ah, Mr. Fitzgerald. Man of the hour.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Monty. It's good to see you, old man.
I have done your patrons a great service by curating a collection of fine literature.<eos> Put it on his tab.<eos> Ah, Professor Gauss.<eos> At long last.<eos> Good to see you again, my boy. Indeed.
I'm just here as a guest.<eos> - Of course, if you do have some pages, I'd love to take a look at them.<eos> Ha ha. Of course.<eos> Yes, follow me.<eos> I'll take you to the inner sanctum.
I really must be going.<eos> Zelda, my dear, you have quite a presence on the page.<eos> I spent hours with your book.<eos> My book?<eos> I hope you don't mind.
When one does, one does.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> I should join my wife.<eos> Perhaps, yet, should she not be allowed a journey of her own?<eos> Well, again, it, uh, was a pleasure to meet you.
- What's it called again?<eos> - Between the Sheets.<eos> Oh, well, this is just what I needed.<eos> Oh, it is so comforting to be among friends.<eos> Montgomery certainly misses you two.
- Stand right there.<eos> I haven't seen your ID yet.<eos> - I'm here to see Maddie Kenner.<eos> - ID?<eos> I have a Katie Bowman here for you.
So sorry. We are out.<eos> We will open up tomorrow at 8:00 AM.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Your new boss wants to see you.<eos> He's expecting you.
I have no contact with him.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> But it's true.<eos> And if I try and reach out to him, he will know that I've been compromised.<eos> And it's gonna fall on you.
- You just invited me in.<eos> Would you stop playing games with me?<eos> Things are hard enough right now.<eos> I can't even work because of your cease-and-desist.<eos> I just wanted to see you.
- San Diego.<eos> - Fine. We'll still take my plane.<eos> - No plane.<eos> No helicopter, no boat, I will drive myself.<eos> I'll pick you up. I have to pay my driver anyway.
Door-to-door, two hours.<eos> Deal.<eos> Deal.<eos> Why are we doing this?<eos> Because I can't get you out of my head.
- Oh. No, no. We did not negotiate pre-late lunch drinks.<eos> You're right. I'll just have to pour out this extremely dry martini with olives flown in this morning all the way from Spain.<eos> That would be disrespectful to Spaniards everywhere.<eos> How do you know what I drink?<eos> Because I did a little research on you.
- There's no us.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Oh, come on, you're not really interested in me.<eos> It's absurd. Why?<eos> I've been into you since the second I saw you in my conference room.
Yeah, you're not under arrest.<eos> Well, couldn't I just go in the paddy wagon with them?<eos> It doesn't work that way. This is not one of San Diego's many convenient shuttles.<eos> I'm really trying to have a moral victory here. I feel like you're sandbagging me.<eos> I would love to help a fellow San Diegan, but I can't arrest you with no cause.
Shut up, son.<eos> - We run a clean shop.<eos> - Clean?<eos> Other than the $100 million in drug money that you and your father collect and transport to these two gentlemen to launder?<eos> Clean to you.
Listen, Del. Wh... Whatever money you're missing,<eos> No. "Stolen." That's my word.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Del Rio... I swear, we are not stealing from you.
Good morning.<eos> - Mr. Byrde.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's this?<eos> - Good to see you, sir. - Yeah, good to see you.
- Do I look okay?<eos> I tripped on your loose carpet. Can't you fix it in place?<eos> Look at this!<eos> Excuse me...<eos> This will really cost you.
I... I just feel like we should be honest about what we like.<eos> - And you don't like armpit hair?<eos> - I do not like armpit hair.<eos> Well, what if I do?<eos> Do you?
It was lovely to see you again.<eos> We're so glad you're home.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Good-bye. - Bye.<eos> - Nice to see you.
Of course I loved her.<eos> Well, maybe it wasn't real love, because real love is supposed to "make you feel wonderful,"<eos> and you made Mom feel like dog shit.<eos> And you didn't even have to watch.<eos> I mean, you just left.
Nobody glowers quite like you.<eos> Not even Grey Worm.<eos> This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?<eos> It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.<eos> Take it with you.
And now that I know it works, my team has my research and my blood.<eos> Your "merchandise," as you put it will soon be obsolete on the marketplace.<eos> I hate to say this, but your research is incomplete.<eos> If you had found the cure, you wouldn't have been attacked after you took it.<eos> But you were, weren't you?
Arias is planning something big.<eos> Patricio knew way too much about it.<eos> And that's why he was killed.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> They came to kill you but killed everyone you loved instead.
My apologies.<eos> If our simulations were correct it should start working in half an hour.<eos> Three down.<eos> Going for the next one.<eos> Nice to see you again, Mr. Redfield.
I'm Zoe, this is Jake.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Ana.<eos> - Stay with us.<eos> We're gonna have you out of there as soon as possible. Okay?
Captain ain't gonna like this.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, Ana.<eos> How you doing?<eos> What do you say we get you outta here?
I didn't want to say anything in front of your father, but, um...<eos> I understand his concern.<eos> I lost my kids.<eos> And I would do anything to protect my grandkids.<eos> [sigh] Chayton, I've heard from, um... a reliable source that the case against you is strong.
Now why would man who rip me off come back again?<eos> I can explain, but it would be a lot easier if I didn't have a shotgun pointed at me.<eos> Nah.<eos> Fool me once, motherfucker.<eos> I have something in my pocket that I want to show you.
Bank manager with gambling problem did.<eos> I know that now.<eos> We found my father's watch in the back of a drawer, and I wanted to come here and apologize and make it right.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I let you walk. - Okay.
Of course.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Good to see you, huh? - Hi.<eos> I took the liberty of ordering the Heart Attack Special for you.<eos> You know, kid, you're the only one in your family I always am happy to see.
You must be confident you will get custody.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - Just coffee.<eos> So your girlfriend didn't want to come with you?<eos> Help support you?
Then why'd you ask me to meet you here?<eos> I know why.<eos> Really?<eos> You think I'm a piece of shit.<eos> I don't know you.
Why is that a problem?<eos> You're not his real father.<eos> I care about what happens to him.<eos> You are unbelievable, man.<eos> You are disrupting Jacob's life.
A guy named Javier.<eos> What did you mean when you said you can help me get custody of my son?<eos> Finally, as you may have guessed by now, your parole officer said that you, Ms. Raines, under the right circumstances, might be willing to help me locate this man.<eos> Well, he was wrong. That's interesting.<eos> I'm hoping that's not the case, because, of course, if your current circumstances do produce that willingness, it sure would minimize the hailstorm of iced shit that's about to come raining down on you.
I'll have a milkshake.<eos> Chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think I should get?<eos> For you, I'd go with strawberry.
The drummer.<eos> Can I get anything else for you, sir?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'll take a refill on the Manhattan, and then bring another one right away.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Anything for you?
step number four is... pull the cards.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Yeah, give him a round of applause.<eos> Give him a round of applause. Great job, Wally, great job.<eos> Let's clean you off there.
Charming, as always.<eos> Not so difficult around you.<eos> Well, thank you for joining me.<eos> It is I who should thank you for inviting me.<eos> Now I can get to know you.
As for myself, does a lion consider the ant?<eos> He does not.<eos> I simply enjoy annoying him.<eos> Speaking of which, will you be joining us on Sunday?<eos> I would never miss a chance to see you.
Maybe.<eos> You'll excuse me, I need to use the little girls room.<eos> Pardon.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So we'll see you here in an hour.
Of course we don't have a gun!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think we'd have a gun?<eos> Do you think we'd let a gun come into the house in a million years?<eos> I don't know you.
- What if you don't have to go?<eos> - Oh, you'll have to go.<eos> Soil my...<eos> Soil myself?<eos> It's not pretty, but it's the most proven and effective method to ensure that an attacker will not want to touch you.
Hard work.<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you want to go shopping?<eos> Sorry. Who is this?<eos> I can barely hear you.
I don't believe that.<eos> I have a new boss.<eos> He's gonna turn over every stone in this bloc.<eos> The only way to stop him is to give him what he wants.<eos> I don't want to hand you over, but if you won't help me, I don't have a choice.
I meant what I said. You're out of time.<eos> You need to deliver.<eos> I'm gonna take my daughter up to my sister's place in the green zone.<eos> You can come, if you want.<eos> And then I'll walk into homeland with you.
Well, it's... it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.<eos> We've heard so much about you.<eos> I haven't heard about him.<eos> Well, neither have I, really, but, he seems great.<eos> Well, I'm happy to meet you guys, too.
I see. So it was a special occasion? Yeah.<eos> She came home very happy.<eos> But I would imagine you still have significant concerns regarding Ms. Bailey having regular, unsupervised visits...<eos> Objection. Leading the witness.<eos> Sustained. Mr. Gutteman, may I remind you that your job requires you to be an impartial advocate for your young client?
Yeah.<eos> Thought I heard my daughter.<eos> So you're Noah.<eos> I thought you might be.<eos> Do I know you?
- Is Noah here?<eos> Who was driving the car that killed Scott Lockhart?<eos> As far as I know, Noah was.<eos> He basically stood up in that court, and he volunteered to go to prison.<eos> Well, it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.
But don't let her shit on my lawn.<eos> Go.<eos> -Can I help you?<eos> -Hi. I'm your neighbor, Gene Handsome.<eos> I thought I'd come and welcome you to the neighborhood by, uh, bringing you and your daughter some cookies.
Fridays are my half-day.<eos> I'll watch her.<eos> -Wait, are you serious?<eos> -I'm totally serious.<eos> I've got some questions to ask you. Uh, we can get back to that as soon as you come back.
They were great. Amazing.<eos> -Ah, really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Because truth be told, they weren't leftovers.<eos> I made that batch just for you.
Go ahead.<eos> No, I...<eos> Sky? Sky?<eos> Hey, uh, forget about the intercom.<eos> These detectives are here to see you.
I... This... I can't believe this.<eos> I mean...<eos> I can't believe this, but I can believe this.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> -Huh? You know, some people, you can't imagine anyone wanting to murder.
- What?<eos> - Bingo.<eos> Okay, you were giving money to Heather to spy on your ex-wife.<eos> What?<eos> I see you.
And Heather would tell me things Nora would forget to do, like get Carys her flu shot.<eos> She told me the crap that Nora was feeding my kid. She told me what would stress Nora out.<eos> Besides me and my lawyer.<eos> Look, I'm gonna ask you a few questions, and, uh, Handsome over here's gonna know if you're telling the truth or not.<eos> Uh... Did Heather turn on you and threaten to give you up to your wife?
-Good!<eos> So, I think the mailman put one of your letters in my slot by mistake.<eos> Indeed they did.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> -Can I ask you something?
Yeah, as, uh, an actor, your body is your instrument.<eos> That's so true.<eos> You know, when I'm performing, I'm never just delivering a line.<eos> I'm... vibrating.<eos> No wonder the ladies love you so much.
-Oh, I think otherwise.<eos> As a matter of fact, I've got a half-wit theory about it.<eos> I think you met Heather at the Lalalime party.<eos> I think when she was denied a Silky Lamb gift bag, she went looking for a celebrity.<eos> And she found you.
It rolls off the tongue. Kaley Cuoco.<eos> Do you need any help solving this one?<eos> -No, we're good.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Even though you're Kaley Cuoco and I'd love to say, "Come on in."
Driver! Take me back to the airport.<eos> -Enjoy your good looks. -All right.<eos> Wow.<eos> "A Lil' Epilogue'll Do Ya."<eos> Wow, I am so lucky that I met you.
I cannot believe you have done this for me. I really can't.<eos> Well, if a person can make someone else happy, they ought to do it, right?<eos> Right.<eos> I can tell it makes you a little uncomfortable to be thanked, so I'll stop.<eos> We were gonna have you up once we get settled, but then I realized you would not be comfortable with that.
- Yes!<eos> Right, with Sarah stranded and Kira missing, and no word from Cosima?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Well, get packing, mister.<eos> Bell. I got a present for you.
Her current problem is she's a misogynist.<eos> My partner was overlyversed in sensitivity training.<eos> Regardless, there's a divorce in the family, so we're shuffling the deck.<eos> You finally got a new partner, Art.<eos> My advice to you both...
Open it!<eos> New arrivals just left, they must have locked it on their way out.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's time.<eos> He wants to see you.
Okay, I believe you.<eos> No harm.<eos> We good, Art? We done?<eos> We're just getting started, partner.<eos> Let's take you home and tuck you in.
- Just trying to show you.<eos> Look, there's no problem here. Defense of others.<eos> Works just like self-defense.<eos> Guy comes in here with a mask, pointing a gun at us.<eos> You think I'm stupid.
You told him the shitter was busted.<eos> Guess I had the magic touch.<eos> - Otto:<eos> Chayton...<eos> The night before my case gets tossed, guy comes in, sticks you up, - and he gets away with my money?
- What--<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.<eos> And I trust you know who I am? I do.<eos> But what do I call you?
Cigarette?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Never took it up.<eos> Really?<eos> But I thought they loaded all you G.I.s down with cartons of them on your way up the gangplank.
Never took it up.<eos> Really?<eos> But I thought they loaded all you G.I.s down with cartons of them on your way up the gangplank.<eos> They did.<eos> Supposed to help keep you alert.
Daily.<eos> Or, I don't know, maybe a surf-and-turf dinner at the Polo Lounge?<eos> And then maybe a room upstairs, at the Beverly Hills Hotel.<eos> And then, maybe--<eos> I'm gonna leave you here.
Mr. Archer?<eos> Depends.<eos> Who's asking?<eos> Charlotte Vandertunt, heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune.<eos> And I would like to hire you... to murder me.
I'll see you later.<eos> Show him the love! Give it up for The Hood!<eos> The good, the bad, the extreme, and the completely insane.<eos> Now, this is a team I can work with.<eos> I'll make this easy for you.
Please, please, please tell me you have a shot.<eos> Damn it.<eos> He's turned the heat up.<eos> I can't see shit.<eos> X, can't see you guys.
Well?<eos> Serena.<eos> We're a bit busy now!<eos> Marke's got Pandora's Box.<eos> She's gonna drop a satellite on top of you.
I cried so hard Teddy gave me his.<eos> He was always good like that.<eos> Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.
There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?
They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.<eos> Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.
And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.<eos> (GRUNTING AND YELLING)<eos> But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.<eos> - Do I know you?
Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.
(WHISTLES)<eos> Fuck me.<eos> (EXPLOSION)<eos> Let's go!<eos> - I'm holding you up.
Evening.<eos> So, where is he?<eos> He's a day's ride from here.<eos> As soon as she's safe, he will come.<eos> He poses no threat to you without the sword.
You will tell me what I want to know and with that knowledge I will conquer the universe.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.<eos> We may be royalty, but we are still warriors.<eos> Our father will not stop searching for us.<eos> But he won't find you, no one will.
- I was strong.<eos> - I know you were.<eos> It's okay, he's a friend.<eos> We have no friends here.<eos> Alright. I'll leave you two alone.
- We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.
Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.
Look. If we follow this river, we'll be right on course.<eos> Right on course.<eos> To the end of our rainbow.<eos> Smurfs?<eos> I thought I left you for dead.
Your dress is so pretty.<eos> Smurfblossom, remember, work on that filter, okay?<eos> - Right. Filter, filter.<eos> - What's your deal anyway?<eos> Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.
- I...<eos> - Don't get too close, Willow.<eos> Something's not right here.<eos> I promise we're only here to help.<eos> We came to warn you about the evil wizard, Gargamel.
Yeah, well, it keeps going in my head.<eos> Over and over, you know?<eos> Maybe you're having a stroke.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Here you go, boys.
You five-oh?<eos> We're practically eight-oh.<eos> (DOGS BARKING)<eos> JESUS:<eos> Now, I don't know you from Adam.
Thought we'd give it a go.<eos> "Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just give it a go."<eos> You could get life!<eos> Which I guess for you, isn't that long.
He's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck.<eos> May you enjoy every minute of every moment you have.<eos> We love you.
Someone very special.<eos> His name is Xander.<eos> How do you do, sir?<eos> I do just fine, young man.<eos> Well, I should leave you to it.
This one's me.<eos> Have you guys had much contact with the tribal leader?<eos> Sheikh's a waste of time.<eos> You ladies are in here.<eos> Make no mistake, no one outside that gate wants you here.
"I love Fergus more than anything.<eos> "But I'm finished, Gail.<eos> "I'm sorry.<eos> "Love you both.<eos> "I want to see you both smile again.
Good.<eos> So you know that I own a couple of saunas in the north of Edinburgh.<eos> In fact, you boys should know, I own all the saunas in Edinburgh.<eos> So your venture was never gonna happen, was it?<eos> I couldn't have you on my doorstep in competition for my members of staff, for my clientele.
It was never gonna happen, Simon, was it?<eos> - No, Mr. Doyle.<eos> - Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen. And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,
Because she doesn't love him.<eos> And now, it's too late.<eos> But she might still come back.<eos> I set her free.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
I've always been.<eos> I always am.<eos> I will always be.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Because I clung to you.
- I'm ashamed.<eos> I swear that I'm ashamed.<eos> - No!<eos> You're scared!<eos> If you were ashamed, you wouldn't be able to even look at me.
- No!<eos> You're scared!<eos> If you were ashamed, you wouldn't be able to even look at me.<eos> So, don't fucking look at me!<eos> Get on your knees, all of you.
They were completely unsuspecting it.<eos> The compound isn't a cure.<eos> They already had the cure.<eos> What they needed was the disease.<eos> These were the same jackasses who designed all you awesome, perfect GC humans.
I think he's trying to read my mind.<eos> That's what these are for.<eos> Eating his curds and whey.<eos> Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her. And frightened Miss Muffet...<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.<eos> We had to wait.<eos> It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.
- Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell Ally I'll see her at 2:30.<eos> Daddy says he'll see you at 2:30.
Thank you for your bravery.<eos> Well, what's going on?<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> That's a great question.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry for misleading you both, but this is a mediation.
- We can't prank him.<eos> - Shh!<eos> And you're gonna say, "Hey, I'm a nice guy.<eos> I'm doing okay."<eos> And the world is gonna unzip its pants, pull them down, and take a giant fucking shit all over you guys.
Playing pranks used to be fun.<eos> This shit is getting violent.<eos> I look like a fucking minion!<eos> Holy cow!<eos> They got both of you, huh?
I'll drop your nuts, bitch. Back the fuck up. Let's go.<eos> You wanna see what I'm made out of?<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> See?<eos> Let that be a lesson to you.
Raees, you read.<eos> Read!<eos> Gujarat...<eos> - ln the north of Gujarat... - Come here<eos> I don't want to, but you boys compel me to beat you. Hush.
We'll surely win the elections.<eos> Listen carefully!<eos> He is Raees.<eos> He's a class apart.<eos> Love him, and he'd even give up his life for you.
- Find each one of them!<eos> Where's Raees?<eos> Thrash all of them till you find Raees!<eos> He's a brother to me!<eos> - l'll charge all of you under the Terrorist Act!
So what you here for?<eos> Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so...<eos> The Borgia Pearl? They still after that, are they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, how did you two first meet?
There was absolute trust between us. The memory sticks guaranteed it.<eos> We all had one.<eos> Each containing aliases, our background, everything.<eos> We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.<eos> - Who employed you?
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...<eos> All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.<eos> I will keep you safe.
What happens if they don't get out before the pump turns on?<eos> The current will carry them through to this junction where they'll be chewed to pieces by the intake pump.<eos> - That would suck.<eos> - Literally.<eos> - You know we can hear you?
All the quicker now he knows about us.<eos> Three drone crates, the weapon canisters.<eos> He's had ample time to arrange transport out of Italy.<eos> Barofski's murders in Ukraine are likely a statement.<eos> After all these years, he's out for vengeance, telling the Russians, "I can destroy you. "
It's worse alone on the sea.<eos> I don't get why...<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why are you so determined to give up?<eos> What brought you here?
Did you crash here?<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.
It's more of, like, a plane than a boat, really.<eos> Let's call it a "ploat."<eos> We're on a ploat.<eos> We need their location, Slivko.<eos> Send up a flare so we can find you.
- I wish I had been.<eos> - What's your count?<eos> - What you see is what I got.<eos> We lost one, too.<eos> Good to see you, fellas!
- (BEEPS)<eos> - MILLS: Arm three.<eos> Packard!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I asked you fellas nice the first time.
Roll up your sleeves.<eos> Come on, roll up.<eos> This is obscene.<eos> All I'm doing, Faith dear... - ...is getting something off my chest. Without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you. But... You will forget it.
"Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide. Hold hard the breath "and build up every spirit to his full height.<eos> "On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers, from war-proof!"<eos> "And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us." "Here the mettle of your pasture!"<eos> "I doubt not, for there is none of you here so mean and base" "that hath not noble luster in your eyes!"<eos> "I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start!"
Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people.<eos> What would happen then?<eos> All that power, all that money, sweet little government, dancing attendants.<eos> A whole country, just to keep her warm and fat.<eos> We all love the Queen, don't we? And I bet she'd love you lot...
God save the Queen!<eos> She could open a slaughterhouse and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.<eos> No one's untouchable.<eos> No one?<eos> Look at you all.
- Seriously, we're not going to talk about this?<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> - I mean, how does it work?<eos> - How does what work?<eos> You and the woman, do you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes, is there
There's only one bullet left.<eos> You will only need one.<eos> But you will need it.<eos> Please...<eos> Go through. There's a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane who's getting very, very scared.
We have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.<eos> Barely dry.<eos> Recent.<eos> That's for our benefit.<eos> As a motivator to your continued cooperation, I'm now reconnecting you.
Well?<eos> You were always the grownup.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Uh, yeah. I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S. I know you two.
Mom, Dad!<eos> Hurry now!<eos> Move!<eos> We don't wanna miss our flight!<eos> - No! - I warned you!
I'm fine. We're fine.<eos> You saved us.<eos> You're our hero.<eos> And a great big brother.<eos> We love you both so much.
Hey there, rat!<eos> How's it going, you blue idiot?<eos> Not so bad.<eos> We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.<eos> This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.
Your friend... There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.<eos> Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.<eos> Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
I was about to...<eos> Push the Bat-Signal?<eos> Good call.<eos> I like your instincts.<eos> I've got a surprise for you guys.
I miss the '60s.<eos> Hey, can Scarecrow help?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - He's destroying our city, too!<eos> Permit us to lend you assistance.
I never doubted you, bro.<eos> Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.<eos> Rope! You lied to me!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean, without you,
Whoo! I did it!<eos> I don't even know why you bothered coming back.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> What?<eos> The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.
but I'm calling security.<eos> no.<eos> It's me.<eos> okay?<eos> Then I can leave you guys alone.
Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?
we have had a change of heart as well. and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.
I need to speak to the head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you should not come looking for it.<eos> He's the one.<eos> This one bested all of you?
- Hey, do the smart thing, Danny.<eos> Strike Gao down while you have the element of surprise.<eos> Leave Radovan.<eos> Look out for your own.<eos> I started this program... to teach you not just how to defend yourselves, but how to prepare for your futures.
Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.<eos> I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.
You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile. You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
What?<eos> Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you. I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...
did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> who are you?<eos> wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.
And I didn't want to do this alone.<eos> Any news from Joy?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.
Well, well, well, well, well, well.<eos> Well. Well. Well.<eos> It's the Adventure Club in the flesh.<eos> Adventure Club!<eos> So, good to see you guys.
It means the wish box works.<eos> We meet again, dorkuses.<eos> That's not the plural of dorkus. It's dorki.<eos> Shut up, brainy.<eos> I guess your pal Ozzie isn't here to save you this time.
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
- You can trust me.<eos> - I do.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Looks like that big guy made quite an impression, huh?<eos> I am glad that you two didn't end up in a fist fight.
It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.<eos> Believe me, this will drown you.
They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?<eos> How do you suggest we hide him?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.
- Try again. What?<eos> No. We had enough to worry about.<eos> What aren't you telling us?<eos> I was with Elektra.<eos> It was a mistake not telling you guys about her. I realize that...
The one your girlfriend tried to kill.<eos> He designed the place.<eos> What, you think he knows how Danny ties into this?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Well, I guess you two better get going.
- What does that mean?<eos> I don't think I have to answer to you.<eos> But considering the events of the last few hours, I thought it best to keep her isolated.<eos> Because you think we will kill her?<eos> I think she might kill you if she even senses your disloyalty.
How do we know what we're looking for?<eos> Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming.<eos> This is not okay.<eos> This shit is not okay.<eos> I will find you.
- There's a lot of this stuff in here.<eos> - Wait a minute. You know about this?<eos> Claire, whatever it is you're planning, it ends in either jail or a cemetery.<eos> Please.<eos> You guys are in way over your heads. All of you.
We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> You guys need to get to the surface.<eos> - No complaints here.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - No, I'm gonna meet you up there.
Or more accurately, never happened.<eos> Uh, what about Claire?<eos> Claire who?<eos> Hogarth, Benowitz Chao at your service.<eos> I hope you'll think of us for all your legal needs.
Scottish.<eos> It's Irish if I say it's Irish and if you can't listen to me, you can't hear what these horses have to say and that makes you no damn good to me.<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Got it.<eos> But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.
I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I watched you.
Grace, shall we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I think we're gonna head home too, bro.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll walk you guys.
I know the plan, Remove Kseniya, He does not remember anything about you,<eos> Arsus, You're a scientist,<eos> Forces formations mu Serbia is one of the best,<eos> But you're asking for something ridiculous,<eos> If I wanted to, you or dead Kseniya, So, you must first die,
If I wanted to, you or dead Kseniya, So, you must first die,<eos> And nothing can hold me, You know you need our strength,<eos> But you will not get it,<eos> That's up to you, my friend,<eos> What is clear, the reason I gather you here... Is to give you a chance join me,
No do not, Team Rocket Tornado is already on the way,<eos> What else do you plan?<eos> Even you can not survive!<eos> The transfer of energy to the firing is a process very unstable,<eos> I warn you, You could die,
The silence I think is very valuable,<eos> They want to know, you have proof, ,<eos> You guys are awesome, but not only the super powers that make you great,<eos> You taught me to find dignity to gain friendship,<eos> I found it, We are a true friend, Like you,
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got<eos> So, we wanna engage with maximum speed<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind<eos> Number one, I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet
How long are you in town for?<eos> Very briefly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're late to meet my daughter, so...<eos> I won't keep you, then.
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.<eos> Give us the bad news.<eos> As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer, I attended the funeral, and a ghost appeared-- a son we all thought dead in Africa.<eos> James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Mr. Wilton, I asked you to do some digging.
- What, why? Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.
Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.<eos> Now you're back, I want payment.<eos> If it wasn't for us, that kid would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.<eos> Mr. Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.
- How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.<eos> You don't even ask how your own blood fares.<eos> If you don't approve of me steadying my nerves with Madeira, then perhaps you should consult the directory of the Royal College of Physicians, see you know many others of them will agree to carry out this kind of work.
For the safe.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?<eos> On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> They will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life and death.
They've got him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> They took him to the Tower.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I have a use for you.
Is this the extent of your ambition?<eos> It is in return for my silence, and for Godfrey to burn his account.<eos> No.<eos> I can't deliver that.<eos> Then you had better get used to the taste.
From Mr Delaney.<eos> Mr Cholmondeley!<eos> Mr Cholmondeley!<eos> Mr Cholmondeley!<eos> I have a message for you, sir, from Mr Delaney.
And we can all pray to God that we haven't completely fried his brain.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Out!<eos> The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.
The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.<eos> Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.
These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.<eos> Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.<eos> There's still plenty of cocks left for you to suck.
His mother.<eos> *Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's*<eos> *You owe me five farthings, say the bells of St Martin's*<eos> *When will you pay me, say the bells of Old Bailey.*<eos> This just arrived for you, sir.
If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?<eos> That is a question to be asked and answered in America.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Tide's rising.<eos> You've lots of people waiting for you, people who have given up everything for you, James.
I need to be on the water by high tide.<eos> You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.<eos> You have people with you?
Take a look.<eos> It's a deed of transfer.<eos> Transferring my title to Nootka Sound to the East India Company?<eos> And your friend, Stuart Strange.<eos> When I first met you, you told me that a sheep can be meat, but it can also be wool.
I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.
Pick it up.<eos> So, you've no problem with the principle of obeying me, just the execution.<eos> Execution?<eos> Of Delaney.<eos> I told you to take care of it.
Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.
Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.
Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.
Help me! Captain!<eos> Holy Christ! Where the hell have you been?<eos> I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.
I'm off-duty.<eos> I have a wound in my left shoulder.<eos> A bullet wound?<eos> A splinter... from the mast of a ship called the Yankee Prize... that was struck by a Yankee ball.<eos> So I should call you comrade?
This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?<eos> You are a doctor... you are a merchant... and you are a spy.<eos> Unless you tell me who sent you, I will have to ask you to leave at the point of a gun.
The assassin we sent to kill Delaney is dead.<eos> The British want you dead.
! You must hold out.<eos> You will hold out.<eos> Look at me.<eos> These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India - and they will free you.
Think of the queue that'll form.<eos> An actress, no less.<eos> No. No!<eos> Don't leave me! No, please!<eos> You will answer to God for this.
So, as we... explore ways to make you change your mind... these next few hours... we will be doing God's work.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Miss Bow.<eos> I can find my own carriage.<eos> Mr. Delaney has business... but he instructed me to make sure you get home safely.
If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.<eos> I already did.<eos> I was very impressed.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I have a use for you.
You said I'm a weakness.<eos> I wasn't weak.<eos> I will fix that.<eos> I'll get Brace to fix that.<eos> In the cell, I called you "James".
It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.<eos> Is that why you let it happen? To teach me a lesson?<eos> No. That was to teach the King a lesson. And the Company.<eos> But if you're absolutely resolute on staying... then I may agree to incorporate you into the organisation.
She also allows and even encourages the closed and turning waltz.<eos> A ball.<eos> And why would she invite a man who cannot dance?<eos> Perhaps she likes oddities and curiosities.<eos> Or if she knows you're in the house in the light, you cannot be outside lurking in the garden in the dark scaring people.
Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.<eos> There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.
For you.<eos> There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.<eos> Miss Lorna Bow.<eos> Mrs. Lorna Delaney. And Mr. James Delaney.<eos> Judging by the horror on the faces of the ladies, you are known.
So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.<eos> But look, if you don't want to deal with the obstacle, we can certainly take care of that for you.
As a rule, I do this trick with a beautiful woman... Ooh! And a chimpanzee.<eos> In the absence of a chimpanzee, a gorilla will have to do.<eos> Please, madam, please, sir, take a deep breath... and step into the beyond.<eos> One wonders if they will ever be seen again!<eos> I did my research on you.
I did my research on you.<eos> Genevieve Decoux. From New Orleans.<eos> Please, Mr. Delaney, we do not have much time.<eos> You sent the giant to kill me?<eos> The outcome persuaded us you should be courted instead.
Get back in there, Lady Musgrove, and find that humping gorilla of yours.<eos> I was told you wanted tea. A monopoly.<eos> - Fanciful, of course.<eos> I want to meet with the Embassy in Paris.<eos> Oh, no. You assign to the United States, where someone will kill you.
And, when they come, let them in.<eos> You can open every door.<eos> We have nothing here to hide.<eos> You will hang.<eos> They will catch you and hang you.
Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!<eos> Now...<eos> They have reports that say that some of the robbers were women.<eos> But only the Company are aggrieved, so no-one can take you to the clink or to the poultry tower.
As in your premonition.<eos> The French, blew Mauritius almost in half.<eos> And where do we get this chlorate?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You need to ask a far more important question, which is, where will you get a chemist insane enough to work for you if you decide to add fucking chlorate to these vats?
Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?<eos> A commission is not the King, so they can't subpoena, so you will deal with it and treat them with disbelief.
It's freezing!<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> This is the Delaney household.<eos> We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.
You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?
Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?<eos> Carried you across the foreshore. A tiny baby in her arms. Innocent and sweet.
Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.<eos> She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.
She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Of who they say you are.
I will tell Mr. Madison I have made an extraordinary discovery.<eos> A man in London who can be relied upon.<eos> Hm.<eos> Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.
James.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No. Go away.<eos> I'm busy. I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> I brought this for you.
Yes.<eos> Come into the house, we'll find you something to eat and somewhere to sleep.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take into your loving arms this purest flake of snow, my daughter, my light, my love... my Winter.<eos> I thought I might find you here.
In his room.<eos> He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked. He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.<eos> Come out, or I will come in there and drag you out.
I really have no taste for this, so perhaps we can conduct this business like gentlemen.<eos> They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope.
Well, your plan worked...<eos> you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have a use for you.
The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.
And not only can we not resolve this disaster by killing Delaney, it is now in our urgent interest to keep the bastard alive.<eos> Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.

Hello?<eos> Winter, what are you doing here?<eos> This is where I come to sleep sometimes.<eos> You sleep here?<eos> I saw you.
Please understand that from this moment I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.<eos> Please. I'm your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> There is a woman here to see you and I swear the only way
- Mrs. Delaney!<eos> Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.
I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.<eos> As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.
You're as good as a hole in the hull.<eos> I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa.<eos> A slave ship?<eos> I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.
There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.
For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq, I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.<eos> Glen was known as a humble man.<eos> But humble in that way that says, my humility makes me better than you.
- Got a problem.<eos> I can't hear a word Dick's saying.<eos> He can hear me, but I can't hear him.<eos> - All right, can you hear us now?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.<eos> - All right, can you hear us now?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you.<eos> - What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you!
They've known we're coming for weeks.<eos> So don't be under any illusion.<eos> This will get ugly.<eos> We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.
We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!
- I said shut up.<eos> - I heard you.<eos> I chose to ignore you.<eos> Who are you working for, huh?<eos> Did Jerry Falwell put you up to this, huh?
- I'm just trying to make a point.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> The school board cannot force my son to pray, or anyone else for that matter.<eos> So... sue them.<eos> First of all, can I just say, it is wonderful to see you all again.
- Tomorrow...<eos> - Wait, tomorrow?<eos> - What about the dogs?<eos> - Don't worry, sweetie.<eos> Tomorrow... you're gonna write us a little check, and then we will be happy to get you the hell out of this place.
Your mother's a whore!<eos> Get the hell off of me!<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> Go to hell, commies!<eos> No one wants you.
You know... if somebody did something to them... it's probably someone from that place.<eos> My mother pissed off a lot of people.<eos> Especially those she was closest to.<eos> Uh, excuse me, uh...<eos> I just want to say American Atheists has had a wonderful year, and... that would not be so without all of you.
I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.<eos> You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.<eos> I love you two.<eos> Everything I've ever done, I... I've done for you kids.
Relax.<eos> I babysit his kid Jean, who's completely obsessed with me.<eos> Kids love me, just FYI, so there won't be any problems.<eos> This is a big problem.<eos> I can't let you guys travel, not under the school's name, not without an approved budget, a schedule, and a faculty Advisor.
I work in cafeteria for seven years.<eos> Sir, we never intended...<eos> You all have parents on the school board.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You're lucky that I don't suspend you all for fraudulently representing our school.
Hello?<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Visitors?<eos> I can't believe we have visitors.<eos> Oh, Caleb will be so happy to see you.
I know, it's not the perfect plan.<eos> But we need the bad part of the plan to make the good part work.<eos> You think she knows it's a bad plan?<eos> Anyone would know this is a bad plan.<eos> Which is why I have to ask you one more time, are you sure you don't wanna change your minds?
Does he need to stay in there?<eos> He's still Theo.<eos> Theo saved Scott.<eos> Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.
We're not making that deal.<eos> I hold all the cards.<eos> You're locked in a jail cell.<eos> You have no cards.<eos> You want me to tell you about Douglas.
At least it's a plan.<eos> I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.<eos> What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.
The immaterial human consciousness has reached out and touched the material.<eos> There is a calculable transformation in the real world, and solely because someone was there to watch it.<eos> Which may account for the fact that I have become significantly sweatier once I've noticed the mysterious stranger watching me from the back of the room.<eos> All right, that's it. Go get drunk.<eos> Hey, I remember you guys from...
Jules.<eos> We better go.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> Awful young to be here.<eos> Don't let it kill you.
She's in Parkview Cemetery.<eos> Target would be more interesting than here.<eos> If there isn't some kind of life after death, I'm going to be so pissed.<eos> Kicked fucking puppy.<eos> I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.
So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida,<eos> they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> Hello!<eos> It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.
Are you guys all right?<eos> Yeah. It just fruck us out.<eos> It did?<eos> Yeah. It came outta nowhere. We got it pretty good.<eos> Yeah, it must have frucked you out, big time.
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves. Or sex slaves.<eos> Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.<eos> See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or whatnot, but all I know is they already got two brothers we know, and there could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.<eos> What's the next move?<eos> And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothin' for you.

White girls.<eos> Oh, they get you every time.
Now, how is that for a story?<eos> 'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.
'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...
You like the girl.<eos> Can you still get it up?<eos> The slut has nice tits.<eos> Listen, creep!<eos> You think us Westerners are soft.
Say... you're still in business?<eos> Dumov. We want Dumov.<eos> Dumov?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think... I might have something for you.
- We're freeing you, asshole.<eos> Many thanks.<eos> Are you coming along?<eos> The legendary Falk Team.<eos> Incredible they dug you up, of all people.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.<eos> We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.<eos> It's just one long, drawn-out middle.<eos> Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.<eos> But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...

At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out...<eos> We have to destroy the machine.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.
We have to destroy the machine.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.<eos> I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.<eos> - You got to see your mom again.<eos> - I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
Eggs will be up in ten.<eos> Actually, to be honest, Grandma, I, uh...<eos> I didn't sleep at all last night. Hmm?<eos> I snuck out.<eos> I didn't want to wake you, so I... I went out the window.
You motherfucking genius.<eos> Really.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Well done.<eos> Although it creates a problem for me because, you know, I really like money, especially my own money, so if I kill the three of you, then I have to write it off, and, you know, a businessman,
Do, yeah, date night things I'm trying not to picture right now.<eos> - The only thing...<eos> - We've got pizza money.<eos> I'm just thinking maybe I should cook dinner for your new friend.<eos> She's gonna be my new ex-friend if you guys don't stop acting weird.
Though, to be fair, he's an asshole.<eos> Matt!<eos> Well, we actually get along pretty well.<eos> Really?<eos> I feel I saw you guys fighting recently.
- Jensen.<eos> What's up, Clay?<eos> Hey, Jeff.<eos> Let me guess:<eos> You two are seeing Never Say Goodbye for Valentine's Day.
I didn't hear anything, Dad.<eos> Honest.<eos> She thinks maybe you're having nightmares again.<eos> And if you are... and if you want to talk to someone about them, someone who doesn't share your DNA...<eos> I'll... I'll let you know.
Want me to clear these?<eos> No, I'm waiting for someone.<eos> Clay?<eos> No, why?<eos> Just seen you around with him.
The sign-up sheet is making its way around.<eos> Well, don't get used to it.<eos> I think it's gonna be my first and last time if you're going to be here.<eos> What?<eos> Why? Please only sign up for slots you'll actually use.
It was nothing.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> Didn't look like nothing.<eos> I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.<eos> Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> How do you know each other?<eos> We go back to the start.<eos> Well, the King is ready to see you.
Oh, right.<eos> I forgot to mention that... Yeah, a tiger.<eos> This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.<eos> Now, what brings you to our fair land?
We brought you into our confidence.<eos> Why did you break it?<eos> Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.<eos> And what plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?<eos> We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you, to join us in fighting the Saviors, fighting for freedom for all of us.
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead.<eos> I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.<eos> He obviously doesn't wanna be found. - Yes, he does.<eos> - BOAT<eos> We came to ask you to join us in fighting the Saviors.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors... either they kill you or they own you.
And the guns.<eos> Waited by the boat long time. Want something for it.<eos> So it's this.<eos> Jars and guns, guns and jars.<eos> You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you? Long time.
No.<eos> You didn't just hope.<eos> You got us here.<eos> I was beginning to lose faith.<eos> But then I saw you.
Where'd you learn to disarm bombs?<eos> Were you in the Army?<eos> Someone I knew.<eos> Not him.<eos> Listen, I'm not here to play "Get to Know You," so either we talk about the mission or we don't.
Eugene!<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't ask you to come, so go.
This is just about what you have, what we need.<eos> Nobody's taking anything.<eos> You need to let everyone go and leave right now.<eos> Just walk away or this one dies.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
No.<eos> Leave right now.<eos> Michonne, don't!<eos> We just wanna be left alone.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
Some of you actually want to fight them?<eos> After everything?<eos> We can lose our guns, but us leaving this place to fight?<eos> After everything?<eos> I have to remind you!
The sanctuary?<eos> Where negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.<eos> So, you don't like Eugene anymore.<eos> You guys gotta like Sasha.<eos> I do, too. Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.<eos> Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
I'll tell you what they're making, they're making a mess.<eos> Emmita, Que Alegría Verte.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, uh, it's time for dinner.<eos> I think your mom is expecting you.
We just keep him here because he's fun.<eos> Look at him go.<eos> We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.<eos> What say you, Summer?<eos> I say [bleep] you!
He's more like a demon or a super [bleep]up god.<eos> Let's not suck the ghost of his [bleep] too hard.<eos> He was a terrorist, and now he's dead. Oh, yeah?<eos> If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive.<eos> And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!
- I thought we were. - Just messing around.<eos> You're sitting in my seat, so can you move?<eos> Miss Allison? - Is my teaching. - Interrupting your argument?<eos> I've literally been sitting in this seat...<eos> Okay, everybody, we can thank Miss Allison for the pop quiz you're about to have.
Hi guys! I haven't seen you in so long!<eos> How are you, Carley?<eos> - Oh, I'm good.<eos> - I'm really good.<eos> I miss you guys.
Start your writing, son.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Don't fight us. Don't fight us! - Fuck you!<eos> - Don't fuckin' fight us!<eos> - Fuck you!
Come on. Come on.<eos> Don't fight us. Don't fight us! - Fuck you!<eos> - Don't fuckin' fight us!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - This doesn't go right, we'll bring your wife here, we'll shoot her right in front of you.
! How could you do this to him? !<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Really?<eos> You fucked up by coming here.<eos> Fuck you, man.
Madame President-Elect.<eos> Madame President-Elect, I have to speak to you.<eos> Javadi is lying. It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
_<eos> Okay, Brett, you're on in three, two one.<eos> Today, I don't even feel worthy of being here.<eos> Today, my soul is in crisis.<eos> I have failed you, and I have failed myself.
Elizabeth, please, you have to listen to me.<eos> Saul would not have made a mistake like that.<eos> Javadi is lying. It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
Look.<eos> I work my tail off for this family.<eos> You guys know it.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I love you guys.
He was okay with it.<eos> We'll hit a game when I get back.<eos> He wants a snow globe from there, he said.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll call you from there.
At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.<eos> The doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.<eos> It can be done, Lord, it can be arranged... with your help and guidance.<eos> And you shall have it, Brother Trew, I'm sure.<eos> Father Beocca, I will send for you when I have read the letter, which I shall do immediately, do not wander.
Thank you.<eos> _<eos> Forgive me, Lord.<eos> Please, Lord.<eos> May the gods protect you on your quest.
Red-haired women!<eos> To the shield wall that awaits us!<eos> To the joy of battle!<eos> And to the blood of the Scots!<eos> Ah, Father Hrothweard, we've been waiting for you.
Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!
We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.<eos> We will give you food and shelter and thanks, Lord Uhtred.<eos> God bless you.
A slave master.<eos> The village in which we are meeting sits on land that belongs to someone from your past.<eos> Kjartan.<eos> Kjartan's land will be full of men, warriors.<eos> Father, who's protected you so far? Do you have no guard?
I will be a changed man. I...<eos> You will never change!<eos> - You cannot change! - Lord!<eos> Lord, I beg you.<eos> That he fears you is enough.
We are looking for Guthred of Cumbraland, - son of Harthacnut.<eos> - I am Guthred.<eos> - How can I help you? - Lord...<eos> Is it you?<eos> We have found you.
A ransom was not paid, it goes back to the church.<eos> Some coins should go to them, the lepers.<eos> Without them, we'd all be dead.<eos> As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.<eos> This is for you.
They believe you to be the king, Lord.<eos> Then let him be the king.<eos> King for the day.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you and may God bless you all.
Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.<eos> Abbot, no...<eos> It is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert appeared in a dream, a glorious dream.<eos> - Abbot, please...<eos> - He showed me your face... and he called you King.
Sign 'em and get 'em back to me.<eos> Why do we even have to go through this?<eos> There's no way that marriage was legal.<eos> And now, in the name of me,<eos> Gosh Almighty, who you may know from, I don't know, Italian ceilings? I pronounce you Superman and wife!
- How do you do? - How do you do?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> It's a nice day.<eos> It is a nice day.<eos> I have some very bad news for you children.
Say goodbye, Baudelaires.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Until we've identified your designated guardian, you'll stay with my family.<eos> That's not so bad, is it, Baudelaires?<eos> I'm sure you'll become fast friends with Edgar and Albert.
I know you must be nervous about living with a guardian.<eos> I remember how I was when I was your age.<eos> We're all different ages.<eos> Well, I should think at least a fraction of your unhappiness will turn to excitement when you meet this man.<eos> I know he's certainly very eager to meet you.
Goodbye, Klaus.<eos> Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here.<eos> I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.
I told them to cry using their inside voices.<eos> - What? - Hmm?<eos> I... I just thought I'd stop by and see how they're doing.<eos> I know it's a little soon, but I'm about to become very busy with a difficult case in High Court.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I can tell you that it involved an illegal use of someone's credit card... and a poisonous plant.
Can you guess?<eos> Your secret tower room?<eos> Wrong!<eos> My secret tower room.<eos> Which you are forbidden to go into.
How are we supposed to make dinner for an entire theater troupe?<eos> We start with a recipe.<eos> Do you think Justice Strauss' library has any cookbooks?<eos> Baudelaires.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> We meant to come sooner.<eos> We've been cleaning.<eos> Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.
They're using me to send you a message.<eos> They want you to watch.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Oh, my God. [Will] This can't happen.<eos> I'm sorry I failed you.
- Oh, nice try.<eos> But you can just call me... the Old Man of Hoy.<eos> What's his name?<eos> He doesn't trust us.<eos> Of course I don't trust you.
This is a marvelous house, and at that price, you two made out like bandits.<eos> - Can I get the tour?<eos> Just this way.<eos> It's really good cheese.<eos> - You boys be good now.
Seems easy enough.<eos> I mean, you don't have to make it about her, right?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> You want a change.<eos> Could be the high road for both of you.
Yo, who's the one in charge here?<eos> You with the mouth, or me with the gun?<eos> Hey, you wanna be in charge?<eos> It's fine by me.<eos> All right, why don't you both just calm down, all right?
Hide. Ahhh!<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Yo, seriously?<eos> Are you not paying attention here?<eos> Get your asses up off the floor before this one shoots you.
Hey, fool!<eos> Fool follower!<eos> - We got here first. - Yeah!<eos> Buzz off!<eos> You really think you're gonna be able to chew through that steel with your meth teeth?
Listen to me. There ain't no fire.<eos> There's a guard out there going full-on San Bernardino.<eos> This is where you want to be.<eos> Until he bursts in and we're all sitting ducks.<eos> I'll keep you safe.
You forgot salty.<eos> Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.
You!<eos> You on that side.<eos> You on the other side.<eos> Stay away from each other.<eos> And I don't wanna hear no talking between you.
- He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding? - Why didn't you...<eos> - oh, oh, oh.<eos> - There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?
- It is... kinda.<eos> ...while waiting anxiously for Alterplex to launch what the company claims to be the final generation of energy solutions.<eos> If you're joining us now, we are less than a minute away from entering a new future.<eos> This is really big for me.<eos> I want it to be good for you guys too, you know.
Hi! You've reached Mia and Donny.<eos> We're not here right now, so please leave a message after the...<eos> Mia, it's me again.<eos> Please call me as soon as you can.<eos> Okay? - I love you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Mia?<eos> Mia!<eos> I should never have dragged you guys here.
And writing is a real job?<eos> - I write poetry. - My point exactly.<eos> And I write a column for the newspaper.<eos> I get a paycheck every week.<eos> Last time I checked, I was still supporting all of you writers.
This is in... this is insane.<eos> Norman is sick, okay?<eos> He needs psychiatric help.<eos> Did you forget your brother has been charged with multiple murders?<eos> What, so... so that means, you know, you don't care if something happens to him?
Oh, I, uh,<eos> I just... I fell down the steps.<eos> Yes. Getting used to this place. There... there are a lot of steps.<eos> But w-why don't you... Hey, come on inside.<eos> - Great. - We're not actually officially open yet, but I reckon we can accommodate you.
- No, am I talking quieter?<eos> - Mama Gus!<eos> I guess I just, uh, became self-aware of how dorky this conversation is, and I don't want anybody to overhear us, so...<eos> Those girls can't hear you! It doesn't matter.<eos> Oh, we can hear you.
- No?<eos> I am always up for talking about Friends.<eos> I've watched every episode 500 times. Oh, I love it!<eos> Maybe you guys should come over here and join us.<eos> You know what you're talking about.
But, of course, his mom wanted me to do it myself.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why would she want that? - Because she did it herself.<eos> So, tell me if this is super obnoxious, but Harrison's about to turn one.<eos> - Can I ask you about preschools?
- Jesus Christ. The card isn't here.<eos> - No!<eos> You made it up. Classic Mickey shit.<eos> You hate us because we have families with children.<eos> I don't hate you 'cause you have a family with kids.
- I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.
Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.<eos> She's counting on you.
Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled. I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits.<eos> That's a good job. That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Oh... I'm gonna miss all of you.
You see, keeping Klaus alive does come in handy.<eos> I keep him for his blood, in case the wolves get out of line.<eos> I keep him as collateral, in case his family comes back.<eos> I keep him, because I can.<eos> I put him down, I kept him down, and I am the only one that can stop him from coming after all of you.
I put him down, I kept him down, and I am the only one that can stop him from coming after all of you.<eos> New Orleans is mine.<eos> But you are all welcome to visit.<eos> Enjoy yourselves.<eos> But you follow my rules.
Vincent.<eos> I never figured you for Marcel's lackey.<eos> I'm nobody's lackey, Klaus.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, this is justice.<eos> And will it be justice when I escape and come for you both?
I see it.<eos> It's a kill switch.<eos> Come on, Clarke.<eos> The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down.<eos> The Earth's surface will be uninhabitable, so, you see, the City of Light is the only thing that can save you.
Let us help him.<eos> I saw you in the City of Light.<eos> I know you destroyed it.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Look around you.
I wish it was that easy.<eos> Today, you guys.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.
I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.<eos> - Rule everything. - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.<eos> Show them Wanheda's head while you do it, and they will worship you.
What I'm trying to say is, why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two?<eos> - It was Luke's night out.<eos> - Yeah, but Ellen got to go.<eos> It's "Eli" now.<eos> It might make you feel better to know that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days.
Are you trying to turn me straight?<eos> That's a different program.<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Okay, so this place we're going, I had to pull some strings to get us in there, so you have to behave.
I mean, that's one sassy unicorn.<eos> I can't believe you drew that for her.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - It's awesome.<eos> Um, I love you guys and thank you.
Just normal shit.<eos> The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.<eos> We could at least have some manners about it.<eos> Not rub up against you guys on the bus.
Unless you have my money, there's nothing to talk about.<eos> We can talk about the money later.<eos> I'm here to talk about this one.<eos> - Julia...<eos> - Shut up. He's no use to you.
Hmm?<eos> If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm?<eos> But of course that was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Feeding me the cards. Wasn't it? Hmm?<eos> What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I fucking got you.
Motherfucker.<eos> _<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I get a panic call from Carly in the middle of the night.<eos> She's worried about you guys.
We should let them go, right?<eos> Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> I-I assume there's a reason that he went all frat boy on you.
He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> I don't blame Annalise for that.<eos> I blame you, 'cause it's always you.<eos> I loved him so much more than I have ever loved you.
You know why.<eos> Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.<eos> How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?<eos> The Mahoneys?<eos> Then who asked you to cremate Wes' body?
Hold still, or it won't hurt enough.<eos> Hand me that, you imbecile.<eos> I guess if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.<eos> You sneaky little bastards.<eos> Always biting the hand that feeds you.
- Where did they take her?<eos> I don't know!<eos> - Damn it! - Do you know anything?<eos> All the outtake paperwork's in a storage closet by reception.<eos> I-I could take you there.
Now we just got to keep Slink from blowing our heads up.<eos> Yeah, about that...<eos> Slink's not the problem anymore.<eos> In a single moment in the dead of night, this country broke in two.<eos> A fissure of death, a pain-filled gash... heaven to me, but hell to you.
Miss me?<eos> Where's the controller, dipshit?<eos> I came to make a deal.<eos> Hard as it is for me to say this out loud, you two are the best fighters we have.<eos> Kill that giant for me, and I'll let you both go free.
This vehicle is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing, you don't sell it.<eos> You admire it.<eos> - You girls done kissing each other?<eos> - Town's this way.<eos> - Hey, if it's okay with you guys, I think I'm gonna stay here and see if I can make myself useful.
Unless you want a turn at the end of a rope.<eos> Look what I found. A cunt cop.<eos> Fellas, I don't want any trouble.<eos> - Trouble is what you found.<eos> - As an employee of ContraCrime, I'll be forced to place you under arrest.
I know nothing about it.<eos> But you probably shouldn't mess with their favorite racer.<eos> You, on the other hand, they probably want dead.<eos> So how about we give the fans what they want?<eos> Have you wondered why I sent you here to Red River?
Looks bad.<eos> Might need to come off.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Come on, I'm begging you.
Fucking cop!<eos> Better than dying, huh?<eos> Where'd you learn to screw like that... the Boy Scouts?<eos> We recalibrated the pulse charges, so good luck fucking your way out of another loss tomorrow.<eos> I let you live because I enjoy a good show, but you try that trick one more time or even bore me for a single moment, you'll see what I'm really capable of.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.<eos> What?<eos> The rest of you, back to work.<eos> I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.<eos> Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace, I want to keep a close eye on you.
You look so handsome.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Alec.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> It's good to see you both.
You can still steer that ship straight.<eos> Max says that you and Dad have been fighting. About me and Magnus.<eos> Max doesn't have any idea what's going on between your father and me.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> I didn't want to burden you all...
See?<eos> Madzie wants to help.<eos> That is, unless you'd rather I give her the injections.<eos> - No.<eos> - Good. Then I'll leave you two to get acquainted, huh?
Execute Clary Fairchild on sight.<eos> Care to rethink that?<eos> You'd be rotting in the City of Bones had she not insisted we save your life.<eos> Then consider this my way of returning the favor.<eos> By killing her, I'll be saving you from yourselves.
You need to be careful.<eos> The Downworld's falling apart.<eos> I'm guessing the meeting didn't go so well, then?<eos> The vampires and the Seelies want Clary dead.<eos> They'll be hunting for you.
Well, I think I have a pretty good idea who it is.<eos> Really, Raphael?<eos> Not tonight. Come on.<eos> Oh... you guys.<eos> Did Raphael send you with some sort of threat?
Not so fast, buddy.<eos> Wallets.<eos> - Just give us your motorcycles.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Give us the bikes, and we'll let you live.
- The recruits.<eos> - Prometheus.<eos> The fact that you killed his dad.<eos> Felicity and Lyla are working on finding his mother.<eos> What happened with the dude who trained the two of you?
Yeah, we get it.<eos> Yeah? Well, I say take her down.<eos> Overwatch!<eos> You heard the boss.<eos> This is an eyes-only operation for you.
Yeah.<eos> We'd like you to join us.<eos> We can give you a home, a team, and a place to better train the use of your power.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> Oh, and, uh, if you get in my way, I'll send the 3 of you back to star city with your nuts in a sling.
- Still unconscious.<eos> I don't know about you, man, but my head is still spinning a bit.<eos> It's his meta power.<eos> I think he can control Sonic waves.<eos> It would explain how he disorientated you guys and counteracted Tina and...
Why did Chase split up all the hostages?<eos> Why does Chase do anything?<eos> So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> - How'd Chase get you here?
Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.<eos> Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.
My future husband will never see my boobs at their best.<eos> I'm just, like, bummed out now.<eos> - Yeah, I feel really sad.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> Finally ran into you.
Do we have to keep watching?<eos> 'Cause it's...<eos> I can't. We have to go, actually, 'cause we have a sitter.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> Nice to see you.
Okay, guys.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> So good to see you guys.
- Sweet.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Bye, guys.<eos> - Miss you guys.
Yeah. My only worry is that he'll take that as a sign that I'm not interested at all.<eos> - And I don't want that, 'cause I am.<eos> - No. Yeah. No, totally not weird.<eos> He has family in Korea, he Skypes all the time.<eos> Even if you went to New York, you'd most likely just be e-mailing stuff back and forth anyway, so...
So, you know, if you wanted me to come and kick around ideas, I can. So...<eos> Gus, the ship has sailed.<eos> I mean, for Victor it's important that people be into a project from the get-go, so...<eos> Oh. We really need to get back to work, so...<eos> All right, well, I'll let you guys go, and, uh...
Gus, the ship has sailed.<eos> I mean, for Victor it's important that people be into a project from the get-go, so...<eos> Oh. We really need to get back to work, so...<eos> All right, well, I'll let you guys go, and, uh...<eos> Or I'll let you get back to work, and, um...
Sit.<eos> John Diggle, it's good to see you.<eos> Now you're my favorite American.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what brings you to Russia?
Let me go so I can try to fix myself.<eos> Your resignation's accepted.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My resignation letter's on the desk.<eos> When I signal, you must align with Anatoly, who calls spross dopross, or Gregor our incumbent Pakhan.
Go.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Everyone should have fun tonight.<eos> Just quickly, though... Might have buried the headline here... You all saved my life, and 5 months ago, I never would have thought that was possible.<eos> Thank you for working hard.
Canisters are in a storeroom, southwest corner, second floor.<eos> Copy that.<eos> If you would be so kind and let us in now, please.<eos> Alarms and cameras are disabled.<eos> I'll meet you at the target.
The crusade... all of this... The foundation of it is a lie.<eos> So I disbanded the team because I won't sit by and watch all of you participate in my murder spree.<eos> I am beyond redemption.<eos> You and the team will be fine if...<eos> You stay away from me, you stay away from this, you stay away from Chase, and you allow the Bratva to do their job.
The power coming back on will spark it.<eos> If we don't get the air vents back online first somehow.<eos> You guys are sitting underneath a... 4-story bomb.<eos> How long do we have before the generator kicks back on?<eos> And blow you up?
Here we go.<eos> Guys, we got a situation.<eos> - Yeah, so do we.<eos> - Sampson's on the move.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to let him make it without you. Oliver and Dig are in trouble.
- Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I almost forgot what it was like to celebrate a birthday.<eos> That's because we're usually saving the city from being destroyed this time of year.<eos> This, uh, it's like summer break for you guys.
You got to leave the city, you got to leave the state, and you can't tell me where you're going.<eos> Oliver, we're not leaving.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you. I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--
We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you. I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger-- and he's going to try to--that... My instinct will be to pull you close.
They'll never connect this to you.<eos> There are no surveillance cameras.<eos> I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you, I wouldn't know it was you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm glad to see you guys.
- What kind of game?<eos> - A game sounds better.<eos> It's simple, really.<eos> All I ask is a kiss.<eos> You want one of us to kiss you?
I really appreciate the offer but Yom Kippur is not a bring your friends kind of holiday.<eos> I wasn't asking.<eos> I mean, I... I didn't even tell my family I was dating Clary.<eos> And how would I explain this?<eos> Hey Mom, meet Maia, my werewolf friend who knows I turned a guy to dust and now she's kinda worried that I might hurt you,
Oh, I bet you'd love to get your hands on your precious Soul Sword now.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> I'm gonna be sending it with you.<eos> Considering my Demon Blood, it didn't seem wise to leave such a powerful weapon just lying around, even if it is deactivated...<eos> It seems a rather fitting end to you both, don't you think?
So you gave him passage to Idris?<eos> I wanted to protect my people, even those outside the safety of my realm.<eos> We Seelies understand the power of negotiation.<eos> Your idea of negotiation is putting the rest of the Downworld at risk.<eos> Which is just fine by you, isn't it? That way, you can rule it all by yourself.
Maia!<eos> You came too.<eos> Simon is quite valiant and chivalrous, unlike any of the other Night Children I've ever known.<eos> You're all free to leave.<eos> My servant will escort you out of the Court to safety.
Raziel, hear me!<eos> I call upon the Mortal Instruments and summon you into this mortal realm!<eos> We're too late.<eos> He's raised the Angel.<eos> Magnus, you need to get to safety.
He hasn't been himself lately.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Failure can break down even the strongest man.<eos> How are you?<eos> Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know, Greg abandoned you and the kids.
I love you, baby sister.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?

Feel your body beneath you.<eos> The only thing that is real is this moment.<eos> Right here.<eos> Right now.<eos> As the world moves around you, you too are capable of moving.
Right now.<eos> As the world moves around you, you too are capable of moving.<eos> You are your single self.<eos> Not attached to anyone.<eos> Just as people and circumstances change, you also have a greater power within you.
- Thank you.<eos> Well, Michael did a wonderful job in Texas.<eos> - Aw, thank you.<eos> - I heard.<eos> You guys looking at the Burgundy trip? Ah, well...
- It's okay, Maddie.<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Travis!<eos> - Travis!<eos> - I'll find you, Maddie.
We'll head south, back to TJ.<eos> - Border's swarming with them.<eos> - North, then. We head home.<eos> There is no home unless you build it.<eos> I can offer you passage east, let you catch your breath at least. It's a sanctuary.
The people whose hearts you aim to win.<eos> If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.<eos> Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.<eos> But if you let me live, I will serve you well.<eos> I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.
I swear it, my queen.<eos> And I swear this... if you ever betray me,<eos> I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.<eos> Forgive me, my queen.<eos> A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.<eos> With their help, the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores... mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,<eos> Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.<eos> This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.<eos> You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.
Dickon.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.<eos> They might not have come if you hadn't.
She was a great woman once.<eos> Now she's broken.<eos> She wants revenge so badly, she brought the Dothraki to our shores.<eos> The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.<eos> I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.
I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarly.<eos> The infection has spread too far.<eos> You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.<eos> How long?<eos> It'll be years before it kills you.
We don't poison little girls here.<eos> Myrcella was innocent.<eos> She was a Lannister.<eos> There are no innocent Lannisters.<eos> My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.<eos> Our army should be Westerosi.<eos> And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?<eos> You are.<eos> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.<eos> I was sorry when he died.<eos> Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.<eos> So did I.<eos> She wasn't fond of you, was she?
I was sorry when he died.<eos> Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.<eos> So did I.<eos> She wasn't fond of you, was she?<eos> Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.
Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.<eos> And then I won't have to share.<eos> "Mama!"<eos> How can you drink this piss?<eos> When we reach Sunspear, I'll treat you to a Dornish red. The best in the world.
The lep...?<eos> ...prechaun.<eos> Leprechaun, that's right.<eos> So we just leave a small ration from our harvest.<eos> 'Cause if they so choose, they can lead you off the path you've trod a thousand times before.
Master Richardson.<eos> I never realized... that you took me for...<eos> Essie told him how shocked and hurt she was, a poor widow woman to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had so much respect for.<eos> An indentured servant could not marry, so how could he think to torment an ill-starred transportee girl, she could not fathom.<eos> A poor transportee girl who's got feelings for you.
Have you ever even seen combat?<eos> How dare you treat these men without dignity and respect!<eos> Apologies, gentlemen.<eos> Our intel failed to inform us that there was a prison here.<eos> My current mission doesn't concern you, or else I'd invite you to come play with us 'cause we could surely use men of your caliber.
Six, this is Charlie;<eos> we're at the target area.<eos> Six is on his way.<eos> Well, it was good seeing you.<eos> Don't go anywhere, will you, gentlemen?
I had to do something while Wally was cuffing him.<eos> Thanks to you, we changed the future.<eos> If we can change one of these events, we can change 'em all.<eos> Nothing is set in stone.<eos> We'll see you guys tonight.
- Oh, hey. Hi.<eos> I hope I'm not too late.<eos> - Right on time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good, good. This is a... it's for you.
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Allen, this is an active investigation.<eos> There is protocol to follow... surely?<eos> Not if we're gonna figure this out.<eos> Okay, I'll bag the body myself and meet you there. Great.
- Yes!<eos> Finally. - You know what we should do?<eos> We should concoct some simulations to help Wallace learn this new skill.<eos> What do you say, Francisco?<eos> I got one word for you:
Ladies and gentlemen, for today's perp walk, we have a literal degenerate:<eos> The one and only Clive Yorkin.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Captain Mendez, Detective West, thanks for the assist.<eos> Couldn't have bagged this goon without you.
As in now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'd love that.<eos> - Hey. What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?
You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me. [ominousmusic]<eos> - Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.<eos> - You took my home away from me, and now I will take it back!<eos> The gorillas saw what you did, Flash.
The what of the what?<eos> What the hell you talking about, kid?<eos> My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club, and both of you work for me.<eos> We what now?<eos> I pay you to sing, not pepper me with questions.
- Oh, nothing much.<eos> Just put a little song in your heart.<eos> Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.
So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.<eos> - We sure do.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> You could poke around and see if you can find her. Mm-hmm.
Love is about... letting yourself be saved.<eos> It's not just about saving other people.<eos> Even if you are superheroes.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.<eos> I was just trying to get you to play the game, do the song and dance.
Sorry.<eos> I should've been stronger.<eos> You think you should've shot Kadabra?<eos> Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.<eos> I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
What the hell is going on?<eos> I would like to know the very same thing.<eos> I was about to check one of the most important boxes a man can check in his life.<eos> And who... who brought us here?<eos> I brought you all here.
I was wrong to do that.<eos> If you're all willing to... try to be a family again... I think I can, too.<eos> I don't know which... which one of you to hug first.<eos> Him.<eos> Well, I don't know about you, but... I'm in.
None of that matters now.<eos> All that matters is you.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> Oh, I missed you girls so much!
Because I-I need your help, brother.<eos> I love this dress.<eos> We look so pretty.<eos> How did you...?<eos> These could've fallen on you.
Cade?<eos> Cade!<eos> I can see why you both love her.<eos> She's a beautiful soul.<eos> Made dimmer, perhaps, by her association with the two of you.
No.<eos> No!<eos> Josie?<eos> Yoo-hoo, Lizzie?<eos> Come out where Uncle Kai can see you.
If Cade's not running hell, who is?<eos> Think of the only person worse than Cade.<eos> Think of the only person worse.<eos> The person who knows where all your weak spots are.<eos> Who wants to hit you there over and over again.
If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Unpack, reshelve, and my Sig Sauer could use a good scrubbing.<eos> I have three PhDs.<eos> And we're all very proud of you, luv.<eos> I'm doing this for you.
But what if you didn't have to?<eos> What if there was a different future for you, for us?<eos> That's why I'm doing this.<eos> That is what I'm fighting for.<eos> I am not trying to recruit you, but you need to know.
Powerful weapon.<eos> Sam, you are aware that there are five creatures on this Earth that gun cannot kill.<eos> I'm one of them.<eos> If that were true, I'd be dead already.<eos> That gun can't save all of you.
You bastard.<eos> Mom!<eos> Sam... you and I both know that gun isn't loaded.<eos> You sure?<eos> The gun can't save all of you.
There won't be a third.<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> How you feeling? Honestly?<eos> I'm sort of craving a Milk-Bone right now.<eos> Look, um... what I said before... you guys are here when I need you and that's all that matters.
They're dead.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> I'm not trying to recruit you, but you need to know, things are changing.
You sure about that?<eos> My hounds...<eos> You have anything to tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> We... didn't wanna bother you.
We... We hoped...<eos> We knew it could only be you.<eos> And we brought this.<eos> But... but...<eos> Before we, let you out, we have a few... well, I wouldn't call them demands, exactly.
Just to spare myself the Winchester Man Pain... You lot moping about like a bunch of schoolgirls.<eos> Well, I just wanna say thank you.<eos> Or... a few years ago, who would've thought you'd be working with the King of Hell?<eos> Maybe you've rubbed off on me.<eos> Maybe I've rubbed off all over you.
Cindy, for $350, tell us what it is.<eos> Pumpingiron?<eos> Not right.<eos> Chip and Cindy...<eos> Got a lot of people in the audience who think they know, but we have a Toss Up Catch Phrase for you.
I...<eos> My truck broke down. Then...<eos> Then why didn't you call us?<eos> Cass, we could've helped you. I know.<eos> I wanted to keep you out of this.
My truck broke down. Then...<eos> Then why didn't you call us?<eos> Cass, we could've helped you. I know.<eos> I wanted to keep you out of this.<eos> I-I was trying to keep you safe.
Kelly, are you sure?<eos> As long as you're here, I know it's gonna be okay.<eos> Castiel.<eos> Kelly.<eos> It's good to see you.
Thanks.<eos> That should be the last one.<eos> Walt.<eos> Well, damn.<eos> We haven't seen you guys since --
You gonna tell us what we're doing here or what?<eos> Of course. Yeah.<eos> Um, so my -- my brother and I, we -- we, um...<eos> No, you know what?<eos> I called you here because people... um, our people, are being slaughtered.
You.<eos> Once, maybe.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> Well, whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand, I know where to place my bets.<eos> It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel.
Hey!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> No.<eos> Bobby?<eos> Do I know you?
Mature.<eos> Real mature!<eos> You guys?<eos> I really want to enjoy this.<eos> Really wanna savor just ripping you apart, gettin' all up in there, and gettin' all gooey.
You, uh, are certainly living up to the hype.<eos> Look, seriously, I just wanted to say thank you for everything.<eos> I owe ya, kid.<eos> Mom, Mom, Mom.<eos> I love you.
All I required was a single, lifeless head.<eos> Lord, may I suggest that you rest?<eos> Aidan, how many days have we been marching?<eos> - Six days, Lord.<eos> - And you should rest.
Together.<eos> Please tell me he's not here as a suitor.<eos> He's Ceolwulf, the father of Mercia.<eos> He is barely alive.<eos> Lord Ceolwulf. Wessex is honoured to welcome you.
We demand swords... and the men to carry them.<eos> To help stem the wave upon wave of raiders, Lord, from the Daneland.<eos> Forgive my interruption. Mercia lost many a warrior at Ethandun, and willingly.<eos> I expect repayment.<eos> I hear you, Ceolwulf.
At Eoferwic?<eos> We ride first for Loidis.<eos> What awaits us at Loidis?<eos> We shall see.<eos> Need I remind you, first and foremost, our purpose here is the king's business.
Another mistake.<eos> Lord Guthred? I am Lord Aethelwold, I come in King Alfred's stead.<eos> We have gifts.<eos> Sigefrid's sword hand.<eos> The brothers won't trouble you again.
The brothers won't trouble you again.<eos> They are dead?<eos> In return, you will give me your army.<eos> You will ready them to march. But...<eos> You will do as I ask, Guthred, or I shall kill you.
You will do as I ask, Guthred, or I shall kill you.<eos> He does not know what he says, Lord.<eos> No!<eos> Steapa, no!<eos> I will kill you and take every consequence.
Mr. Met meet and greet. DJ Fingablast is spinning.<eos> We were calling WFAN for weeks trying to win tickets, but luckily, Andrew's got unlimited minutes.<eos> [shakily] Unlimited?<eos> Well, good for you. [sobs]<eos> For both of you.
I'm good.<eos> Thanks again for the soup.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> You're welcome, even though you don't deserve it.<eos> Next time you want to take a day off, take a day off.
Latin and legal.<eos> "In loco parentis" means "acting in the role of a parent."<eos> It is a legal term and it applies to Count Olaf.<eos> The actor is acting as your parent.<eos> And as your legal guardian, Count Olaf may raise you using any method he sees fit.

But there are certain things you must get used to.<eos> Now, I'm sorry if I have to usher you out posthaste, but I've got work to do.<eos> "Posthaste" means "very, very..."<eos> It means he'll do nothing to help us.<eos> Oh, on the contrary, I'll have my new secretary give you a ride home as soon as he's finished typing up that report.
Oh, on the contrary, I'll have my new secretary give you a ride home as soon as he's finished typing up that report.<eos> I think we need to call the IT guy.<eos> That man works for Count Olaf.<eos> He did say Count Olaf was one of his professional contacts.<eos> It was good seeing you, Baudelaires.
Look at Klaus' face!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, orphans.<eos> Look at mine.<eos> Shall I let them off the hook?<eos> I spent all morning making these cupcakes for you.
Jacquelyn here. [sighs]<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.<eos> Therefore...<eos> There are many words for people like that.<eos> ...to make you feel a little more at home here...
I have never been married myself.<eos> I once desperately loved a remarkably brave and bravely remarkable woman, who, when I asked her if she would be my wife, found, for complicated and unfathomable reasons, she could give me no answer.<eos> No answer.<eos> [gasps] Baudelaires!<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
Oh. You will suddenly find yourself in the enviable position of being a struggling actress in middle age.<eos> It's almost too good to be true.<eos> It is.<eos> Justice Strauss, Count Olaf is...<eos> Count Olaf is welcoming you into his life by making you an important part of this theatrical enterprise.
Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?
We'll do anything, anything.<eos> Just don't harm her.<eos> [mockingly] Anything?<eos> Anything? Would you, for instance, consider marrying me during tomorrow night's performance?<eos> I would never, ever marry you.
Yes, you did.<eos> You just didn't finish the job.<eos> [sighs] Remember when our parents first brought Sunny home?<eos> She bit the doorknob off the nursery.<eos> Mother and Father... they made me promise to always look after you two and make sure you don't get into any trouble.
Certainly would.<eos> Come, orphans.<eos> It's time for the big event.<eos> - My associate here...<eos> - [grunts] Hello, good to see you again.
- Do you take this woman...<eos> - Man.<eos> Do you take this man... to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> - I do.<eos> - [Olaf chuckles softly] By the powers vested in me by going to law school, I now pronounce you Count and Countess.
What? After all Justice Strauss has done for us?<eos> We never would've figured out Count Olaf's plan without Justice Strauss and her library.<eos> That may be so, but your parents' will is very specific.<eos> He's right.<eos> There's a vigorously fixed destination your parents had in mind for you, and it is not with Count Olaf or Justice Strauss.
That may be so, but your parents' will is very specific.<eos> He's right.<eos> There's a vigorously fixed destination your parents had in mind for you, and it is not with Count Olaf or Justice Strauss.<eos> Well... goodbye, children.<eos> I'll miss you very much.
If I were you, I would look away before viewing any of the horrible and horrifying events that comprise this ghastly new episode... in the Baudelaires' unfortunate lives.<eos> It's a brand-new episode in your lives, Baudelaires.<eos> In a few minutes you'll be meeting your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.<eos> He's your closest living relative and apparently should've been your guardian all along, according to your deceased parents' will.<eos> I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant who walked into my office with no references and no identification, and who suggested that I place you in Count Olaf's care.

You're finally safe now, children, just as your parents wanted.<eos> Actually, Dr. Montgomery...<eos> - Monty.<eos> - Monty...<eos> Uncle Monty, I hope, once you get used to me.
Who needs an assistant when I have three charming Baudelaire bambinis to help me with my research?<eos> Bambini?<eos> Bambini.<eos> It's Italian for "children."<eos> [chuckles] Why, I'm so giddy having you here that I might as well be talking gibberish.
So we're allowed to read all these books?<eos> You are not only allowed, you are implored to read these books.<eos> You know, I always wanted to have a family of my own.<eos> But... time flies like a winged lizard.<eos> Now... I know... that a few dangerous reptiles can make you skeptical of the entire species.
Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!<eos> Retinal scan one.<eos> Retinal scan two.<eos> [loudly] I am so sorry, Baudelaires, that you were frightened by that man who arrived earlier.<eos> Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed, being that he chased you up and down the stairs with a knife.
Ah, there's so much to learn.<eos> Unfortunately, some of that learning is going to have to be delayed tonight, because of you-know-who.<eos> [whispering] Promise me this... If I leave during the showing, you will not act as if anything is amiss, but you'll keep your eyes on that fraud Stephano. [Sunny cries]<eos> - I got the popcorn. - Ah!<eos> This one is for me, and this one is for the rest of you.
I have some unfinished business with Stephano.<eos> - Will you be okay?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I am your guardian.<eos> It is my job... and my delight, might I add, to keep you safe.
First one to find one gets to name it.<eos> - Sounds wonderful.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> Listen, children. I know that the loss of your parents was a great tragedy.<eos> But you can still have the life they wanted for you.
Fine.<eos> Right this way, nurse.<eos> But remember, I will be just on the other side of this door.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, children.<eos> Dr. Montgomery did seem like an appropriate guardian for you.
Wasn't it locked?<eos> - It was.<eos> - Oh, how clever.<eos> But I bet you're not clever enough for this.<eos> I have four tickets with me to Peru right now. I was going to take you and your siblings, because that's just the kind of guardian I am.
Who were we supposed to meet there?<eos> I know you children have a great many questions, and I promise there are a great many answers.<eos> Find your Aunt Josephine.<eos> She's a fierce and formidable woman.<eos> She can keep you safe and tell you everything you need to know.
Where are they taking them?<eos> Well, they're orphans now. So they'll be moving on to other homes where their guardians hopefully won't die on them like Dr. Montgomery.<eos> Can we at least say goodbye?<eos> After what you've been through, I'd think you'd never want to see a reptile again.<eos> Besides, I have to take you to your next guardian.
Yeah, he knows you're the one who took down MacLeish, the only guy in the world he trusted.<eos> Look, he's damaged goods.<eos> I can reach him. The story of this conspiracy starts in Afghanistan.<eos> Until we understand that, we don't understand anything.<eos> "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
Well, it looks like we are calling arrowhead, and you are staying a while longer.<eos> Get me prints on that weirdo. Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kevin?<eos> What can I do for you?
Don't, don't!<eos> No!<eos> Your girlfriend isn't the most competent nurse I've ever seen.<eos> Jesus Christ, you sound like she did.<eos> But don't worry. You'll see her again.
I doubt it.<eos> It was an amicable split.<eos> My ex-wife and i are still on good terms.<eos> In fact, your ex-wife is present with us today, is she not?<eos> When was the last time you two saw each other? Objection.
You see that? Fender Stratocaster, signed by Ritchie Blackmore.<eos> - You know who that is, right?<eos> - Someone no one's ever heard of?<eos> That's real good.<eos> I hope your parents enjoy supporting you for the rest of their lives.
I think you should pursue your music, but not with me.<eos> We're blue!<eos> And go!<eos> We're dynamite!<eos> We'll take you down, and fight the fight!
Good morning, students.<eos> This is your principal speaking.<eos> There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.<eos> Now, on a less felicitous note, if you could give your attention to Sheriff Keller.
Don't call her that.<eos> Okay, she's not like that, she cares about me.<eos> Stab in the dark. I'm guessing she cares more about herself.<eos> She's the one who's telling you not to say anything, right?<eos> Look, I saw you guys.
Come here, sit.<eos> Now, remember Veronica, I grew up here.<eos> The Southside Serpents may be from the wrong side of the tracks, but I went to high school with some of them.<eos> I was just being polite.<eos> Cheryl said it looked like you were arguing.
No, Archie can.<eos> And he will. Call him if you want, but do it soon.<eos> His spots fill up fast.<eos> Hey, now you have zero excuse for avoiding music.<eos> Sorry to interrupt Sad Breakfast Club, but I'm here to formally invite you to
And he will. Call him if you want, but do it soon.<eos> His spots fill up fast.<eos> Hey, now you have zero excuse for avoiding music.<eos> Sorry to interrupt Sad Breakfast Club, but I'm here to formally invite you to<eos> To my surprise and chagrin, mother added you to the guest-list.
Valerie.<eos> Right, Josie and the Pussycats.<eos> Oh, I'm a big fan.<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, I saw you guys at Taste of Riverdale.
We're this close to a break in your son's case.<eos> Speaking of breaks, what's a big one worth to you, Mother?<eos> Letting me be a River Vixen again?<eos> What on earth are you talking about, Cheryl?<eos> I have information you... Both of you, would find interesting vis-a-vis my brother's case.
Oh, come on, Fred.<eos> This was supposed to be my treat.<eos> Hey, you get it next time.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> Pop? We invited you guys out.
But, of course, we don't want to just offer financial support, we want to give Polly all the emotional support that a young mother-to-be needs.<eos> Where is Polly staying now?<eos> I'd rather not say yet.<eos> You understand.<eos> Of course, but you and Polly are part of the Blossom family now, and we will protect you ferociously.
Dad, Betty Cooper.<eos> Betty, this is my dad.<eos> Hi, Mr. Jones, nice to meet you, officially.<eos> And you, and you.<eos> Why don't you guys sit down?
Don't let go.<eos> I won't.<eos> Valerie, hi.<eos> I thought you should know,<eos> Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.
- No, Chuck,<eos> I'm going to ask you to leave.<eos> - Nicely. - Nicely?<eos> Because, what, you're back to being the nice girl now?<eos> Betty, what you and Veronica did when you guys got me kicked off the football team, you ruined any chance I had of playing for Notre Dame.
I...<eos> I thought the ring had been lost...<eos> Nothing's lost forever.<eos> Everything comes back.<eos> Now. Unless you have any more questions, I'll leave you to finish getting ready for the dance.
No...<eos> That's why your mom invited my dad and I to dinner?<eos> So these two could break into my his trailer while she interrogated him?<eos> No, I didn't know what they were doing.<eos> But yes, that is why she invited you guys.
Archie and I wanted to tell you...<eos> We've kissed a couple of times.<eos> It's okay, Vee.<eos> I appreciate you being honest with me, but I'm with Jughead now.<eos> If you guys want to be together, I'm happy for you.
That's the price we pay for having what we have.<eos> It's just the two of us.<eos> - I understand, mother.<eos> 'Kay.<eos> you just need to, like, cook a nice little dinner for the two of you.
Dylan?<eos> Yeah, where are you?<eos> Just out for a walk.<eos> Katie and I needed some fresh air, and now one of us is currently fast asleep.<eos> I miss you guys.
- Zelda, please, honey.<eos> - Just put it down.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Scott, stop it.<eos> Both of you sit down.
Is that okay?<eos> This is what I did on my vacation.<eos> June 5th, I watched the doctors carve a hole into my boyfriend's skull...<eos> - Miles, take that down!<eos> - Have you ever loved somebody so much that you just wished you could take all their pain
Something wrong?<eos> Um, yeah, just normal stress eating.<eos> Hey, you and Yael have been together for a while, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> Have you ever wondered what you would do if you guys, like, got pregnant?
I make most of my money during breakfast, so this protest of yours is about as well-timed and well-choreographed as your show.<eos> Well, you really can't speak to the dancing in our show because you entered during a book scene!<eos> And for the record, our choreographer has won six Tappy's, which are the greater San Diego area's community theater awards, sponsored by Dress Barn.<eos> Dress Barn?<eos> - What, do you all take turns...
- Jesus Christ, Sol.<eos> - All right, let's move them out of here.<eos> - Wait! Not without me.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't let you do it alone, Sol. Or you, Peter.
They let me know that I wasn't alone.<eos> Yeah, that your thoughts weren't wrong even though they were really scary.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Listen, my band is going on tour this summer and we've been looking for an opener forever.<eos> - Are you asking me to open for you?
- You owe me so hard!<eos> - Road trip!<eos> Okay, I still can't believe you thought that gun was real.<eos> You guys were so scary.<eos> And I hadn't seen you in, like, a year.
The exam's tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, so is prom.<eos> Gotta be well-rested.<eos> Yeah. We're not cramming anything else into our brains tonight.<eos> Says you.
- She is the<eos> - They.<eos> - Is the one who changed.<eos> Why can't we just go back to hanging out like we used to before me and Yael were together?<eos> I mean, I barely see you guys anymore.
General rule of thumb...<eos> Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.<eos> True... but I'm not a Stark.<eos> I'd say you get used to them... but you never really do.<eos> Come, their mother is waiting for you.
I've done my part.<eos> I've brought ice and fire together.<eos> Strange.<eos> You spoke so highly of Jon Snow, but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.<eos> I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
Our two houses were allies for centuries, and those were the best centuries the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.<eos> Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.<eos> I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.<eos> Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.
Is that another figure of speech?<eos> The Army of the Dead is on the march.<eos> The Army of the Dead?<eos> You don't know me well, my lord, but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?<eos> No, I don't think you're either of those things.
While we stand here, debating--<eos> It takes no time to bend the knee.<eos> Pledge your sword to her cause.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.
As far as I can tell, your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name, and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.<eos> The lords of the North placed their trust in me to lead them, and I will continue to do so as well as I can.<eos> That's fair.<eos> It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom, you are in open rebellion.
Does she like it gentle or rough?<eos> A finger in the bum?<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> I want you to know I understand.
Perfect Dornish beauty.<eos> I imagine she's your favorite.<eos> I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites, but still, we're only human.<eos> We love whom we love.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't understand you.
We both know how expensive war can be.<eos> And we both know gold wins wars.<eos> Your vaults are empty. Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.<eos> Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.<eos> You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
You're making it difficult.<eos> You look a lot better brooding than I do.<eos> You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.<eos> I'm a prisoner on this island.<eos> I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.
After a single meeting, it's not a reasonable thing to ask.<eos> So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Maybe you are a Northern fool.<eos> I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.<eos> Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?<eos> You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.
And what then?<eos> Don't fight in the North or the South.<eos> Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.<eos> Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend... every possible series of events is happening all at once.<eos> Live that way and nothing will surprise you.
They will have less armor and fewer weapons.<eos> But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.<eos> The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.<eos> They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.<eos> They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triumph.
And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.<eos> But your sister has done things... I was incapable of imagining.<eos> That was my prize mistake-- a failure of imagination.<eos> She's a monster, you do know that?<eos> To you, I'm sure.
I made sure of that.<eos> That's good.<eos> I'd hate to die like your son.<eos> Clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes bloodred, skin purple.<eos> Must have been horrible for you, as a Kingsguard, as a father.
That's good to hear.<eos> I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.<eos> Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support.<eos> - As soon as the gold arrives.<eos> This is for you.
The other dagger, the one that took her life,<eos> I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.<eos> I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.<eos> But I am here for her now to do what she would have done, to protect her children.<eos> Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.
Because the enemy is real.<eos> It's always been real.<eos> And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?<eos> No, I don't think I can.<eos> I will fight for you.
I will fight for the North.<eos> When you bend the knee.<eos> My people... won't accept a southern ruler. Not after everything they've suffered.<eos> They will if their king does.<eos> They chose you to lead them.
When you bend the knee.<eos> My people... won't accept a southern ruler. Not after everything they've suffered.<eos> They will if their king does.<eos> They chose you to lead them.<eos> They chose you to protect them.
Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families...<eos> I'm not beheading anyone.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,<eos> Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.
Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.<eos> Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.<eos> Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.<eos> I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?<eos> Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.
What's it say?<eos> Nothing good.<eos> I thought Arya was dead.<eos> I thought Bran was dead.<eos> I'm happy for you.
Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.<eos> The only person she listens to is Jaime.<eos> He might listen to me.<eos> And how would you get into King's Landing?<eos> I can smuggle you in, but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,
I haven't given you permission to leave.<eos> With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.<eos> I am a king.<eos> And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.<eos> I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.
And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.<eos> I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.<eos> Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger... because it's our best chance.<eos> The King in the North should stay in the North.<eos> We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.
Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.<eos> And here I am, ready to train.<eos> Why down here?<eos> I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.<eos> Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
Don't be so sure.<eos> Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.<eos> Bad things are coming.<eos> You came to get me.<eos> You want me to come with you.
This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?<eos> It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> But bring it back.<eos> Our queen needs you.
You're not the only ones.<eos> My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.<eos> Said they were on their way here.<eos> You're the Hound.<eos> I saw you once at Winterfell.
Don't trust any of them.<eos> They're the Brotherhood.<eos> And the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.<eos> Thoros?<eos> I hardly recognized you.
Your faithful sister, Sansa.<eos> - They forced me to do it.<eos> - Did they?<eos> With a knife at your throat?<eos> Did they put you in a rack and stretched you until your bones started to pop?
- Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?<eos> Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
The North did not raise you from the dead.<eos> The Lord of Light never spoke to me.<eos> I don't know anything about him.<eos> I don't know what he wants from me.<eos> He wants you alive.
It's interesting, these heroes you name...<eos> Drogo, Jorah,<eos> Daario, even this...<eos> Jon Snow...<eos> They all fell in love with you.
I know you're brave.<eos> I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.<eos> So... if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister.<eos> From everything you've told me about her she's rather murder me than speak with me.<eos> Oh... first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.
So... if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister.<eos> From everything you've told me about her she's rather murder me than speak with me.<eos> Oh... first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.<eos> Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.<eos> But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you,
So we walk into the lion's den?<eos> My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.<eos> Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.<eos> Except yours.<eos> And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.<eos> I am taking their side.<eos> You need to take your enemy's side. If you're going to see things the way they do.<eos> And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them.<eos> Which I want you to do very much.

If you're going to see things the way they do.<eos> And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them.<eos> Which I want you to do very much.<eos> Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.
Their loyalty is to Jon.<eos> Jon is not here.<eos> I haven't heard from him in weeks.<eos> You're the Lady of Winterfell.<eos> The King chose you to rule in his absence.
And rule you have.<eos> Wisely.<eos> Ably.<eos> They say that, they respect you.<eos> Some may even prefer you.
Where's the rest of them?<eos> If we wait long enough we will find out.<eos> Go back to Eastwatch.<eos> Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.<eos> - I'm not leaving you.
To King's Landing.<eos> - Milady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.<eos> - I am.<eos> And you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them.<eos> They invited you, they want you there.
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.<eos> I have work to do here.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Ser Jaime will be there.<eos> You said he treated you honorably before.
I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.<eos> I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.<eos> This is the safest place for me.<eos> Milady.<eos> I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister.
I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.<eos> This is the safest place for me.<eos> Milady.<eos> I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister.<eos> If I abandon you...
- Nothing.<eos> Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.<eos> If you die we're all lost.<eos> Everyone, everything...<eos> You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you.
You're letting a grudge get the better of you.<eos> God.<eos> - I cannot believe how alike you two are.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You're acting like a couple of selfish brats right now.
Yo, paramedics!<eos> We ain't playing no more hide and seek.<eos> And we ain't leaving neither.<eos> Not till you give me that clown you've got hiding down there!<eos> You have three minutes to hand him over, or we're coming down to kill you.
Look, we don't have the equipment.<eos> He needs a blood transfusion.<eos> Carter, there's nothing more that we can do.<eos> We're not handing him over.<eos> You know, I can hear you.
Are you sure about that?<eos> Shut up!<eos> My partner, he's not just some kind of paramedic.<eos> He's an ex-Marine, a trained killer.<eos> And he'll send every last one of you guys to hell before he deserts that kid.
Hey!<eos> Mr. Paramedic man!<eos> You don't know me, but see here, I run this show!<eos> I got more men and more guns coming.<eos> And we're gonna sweep every inch of this place until we find you.
Mr. Paramedic man!<eos> You don't know me, but see here, I run this show!<eos> I got more men and more guns coming.<eos> And we're gonna sweep every inch of this place until we find you.<eos> And I will find you!
Why did you do all this?<eos> It was a debt.<eos> When I was in jail, some guy offered me and my buddy Taylor protection.<eos> When we got out, said we owed him.<eos> He told you to kill somebody for him?
Give me the shotgun.<eos> Come on, Cole.<eos> Give me the shotgun.<eos> Reach.<eos> I'm coming to get you.
And y'all are fucking blind if you don't see it!<eos> Are you gonna take charge, Alonzo?<eos> You traitor piece of shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Son of a bitch, I'll fucking kill every one of you!
What?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna drag Pete along.<eos> You can't miss that.<eos> It's nice to see you guys close again. It's been a long time.
- He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him.<eos> - Why didn't he?<eos> - I made him back down.<eos> What? Why?<eos> Why? Because he would have been killed, and so would you.
Totally.<eos> Are you nervous about going to court tomorrow?<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> I want everything to go back to normal.<eos> I didn't think you'd all start fighting just because I e-mailed him.
Coming to the beach is such a treat.<eos> And we're all so curious about this business you two are starting.<eos> We're so excited to hear what all of you think about it.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> If you all will take a seat, make yourselves comfortable, we can get started.
What are you saying?<eos> Am I in danger?<eos> Because I will go back and hide in the ocean right now!<eos> Don't test me!<eos> Would you please sit on her or something?
Why does he still matter so much to you?<eos> Because he's the father of my children, and he's blowing his last chance to have any semblance of a relationship with them.<eos> I get that. I do.<eos> I-I really do.<eos> I understand about the kids, but maybe... maybe it's best for all of you just to... let him go.
Fine.<eos> Congratulations on your divorce.<eos> Right.<eos> So that's what all this is about.<eos> You told me you hadn't seen him.
You and I both know that breath can end.<eos> So we know that life is a gift.<eos> You'll miss Dawn, but you'll keep her with you.<eos> You'll keep that memory alive.<eos> And you'll live now for both of you.
Er... Well, Rachel didn't get all of it.<eos> You're meant to put that in your uterus?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would, actually.<eos> No. No way.<eos> You and I are gonna go find Charlotte... and we're gonna get you to somewhere safe.
Yes.<eos> We're right here.<eos> Well, you better just kill me.<eos> That's-- That's what I said.<eos> Because when, not if, I find out who you are, I'm going to liquefy you.
But it's the same loop, over and over, and endless loop to the grave, because that's what it is out there in the I.S. world.<eos> We are taught to be helpless and powerless.<eos> Helpless and powerless.<eos> With little pockets of fun so we don't do ourselves in.<eos> But you, all of you in this room, have chosen something different.
You want to roll the dice. And if you roll threes, you want to move 12, right?<eos> Yeah, you want control and clarity.<eos> You want to be the master of your fate.<eos> And you can do it, because you have that much power inside of you.<eos> You have The Light to use, to focus, to shape the world around you.
- Remember what I did to those lifeguards who tried to block me from double-tubing down that lazy river?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> And you want to know why?<eos> Because the two of you love each other.
Bud, we should go.<eos> "Bowl of wangs" is how it started with those lifeguards.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You two are best friends!<eos> And everyone who knows you can see that, even if we don't understand how.
Please accept my... my deepest sympathies<eos> on your loss... on our losses.<eos> And I would like to publicly thank the LaBorde Sheriff's Office for working so diligently to... to take these monsters off our streets.<eos> I only wish we could've done it sooner.<eos> God bless and keep you all.
I amped it up with Nightshade and a couple of Ativans.<eos> Might make you a little woozy, but it could do the trick...<eos> Temporarily.<eos> So keep a stash on you.<eos> It is good to see you guys, though.
Cute.<eos> You asshole!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Human tacos.<eos> We love you guys.
- What's going to happen to them now?<eos> - Oh, Joe.<eos> Your heart bleeds the way only a vagina should.<eos> Get a picture!<eos> We love you, Flaritza!
- You can write letters. - No.<eos> Letters?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, where are we going?<eos> You think they're gonna let any of you back in there after all this?
- Yeah.<eos> I'm glad I met him when I did.<eos> Sort of marches to the beat of his own drummer, doesn't he?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I was watching you two at the meeting.
L'Angelle.<eos> L'Angelles, where were they?<eos> They weren't invited.<eos> That Internet is a soul killer.<eos> Stay clear of it if you can.
- You're the one who should be afraid.<eos> - Never.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> I've been standing by the gates of your world, keeping you all safe.
I know.<eos> I'm so happy to be back here with you.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I thought I was gonna go crazy without you.<eos> - Welcome back, guys. Good to see you.
- Hey. We just got back from the M.E.'s.<eos> We got a dead body full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<eos> It's something found in bug saliva.<eos> Hoping you might know of a Wesen that uses it to kill its victims.<eos> Did we catch you at a bad time?
Was there anybody else there besides Wesen?<eos> There were people.<eos> Very primitive.<eos> They called anyone who wasn't Wesen "Gehfleisch."<eos> I'm sorry, they called you what?
-What are you doing here?<eos> -I've come to help.<eos> We don't need your help.<eos> I understand why you're angry, but I need you to listen to me.<eos> If you're not interested in what I have to say... I promise I'll never bother you again.
Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.
- Robert...<eos> I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.<eos> But as my partner told you before, we don't need your charity.<eos> Then I'll stop giving it to you.<eos> But you better put that dog on a leash and shut that shit down, or I'll shut you down.
You're all such pathetic pieces of shit.<eos> Whatever you have to tell him is lies.<eos> You just want to tell him something to make yourself feel better.<eos> He doesn't need to hear that.<eos> He doesn't need you in his life.
Everyone assumes you'll be dead soon... or you'll run away or vanish or go mad.<eos> There are stirrings of rebellion in the Southern Orchard, the Outer Islands, refusal to pay the Crown's taxes.<eos> You know who loves paying taxes?<eos> People with broken legs.<eos> Abigail would remind you that money cannot fill the Wellspring.
That's never gonna happen.<eos> This is what's up.<eos> And, Rick, now that I'm insured, I'm out-skis.<eos> You're quitting just like that?<eos> Well, I'm not gonna leave you all high and dry, like a total douche, B. I'll stay to the end of the week.
Yeah, there.<eos> I'll take your shoes off for you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Why aren't you in the bank?<eos> It's 'cause I was having sex on you.
Have fun.<eos> Say hi to my picture on the wall.<eos> Fuck you, Topper.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Fuck all of you!
Speech! Speech! Speech!<eos> If you want! If you want! If you want!<eos> - If you want! - All right, all right.<eos> You know, I guess... not that long ago, I didn't think that I needed... anyone's help but my own.<eos> But the truth is... I wouldn't be here without all of you.
I can see old houses anywhere.<eos> Stamps, money, insurance commercials, salsa labels...<eos> I don't know.<eos> [Sophia] I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure tomorrow will be better for you guys.
It's the perfect legal analysis combined with the perfect presentation.<eos> So, you don't think the fact that Jessica isn't here--<eos> Jessica Schmessica.<eos> Carly's gonna be blown away.<eos> I should promote you both right now.
They told me to pound sand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Teddy gunth!<eos> So I told them, "you listen to me right now."<eos> You send me his goddamn audition tape right now, or I'm gonna have screen actors guild on you so fast, "your shoes are gonna curl." And believe me, that got their attention.
Or we leave and we never come back.<eos> After all that time buried in a hole, you still got some nerve.<eos> Yeah, well, you stand there with a straight face and try to sell this like it's your choice.<eos> But here's the truth.<eos> I could kill all of you right now.
All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.
May we have a word... privately?<eos> You can wait like the other ambassadors.<eos> Echo, leave us... please.<eos> We were right to be concerned about Trishanakru.<eos> Rafel is gonna challenge you for control.
No one has to die.<eos> The point of our arrangement is to give us time to find a solution to save everyone.<eos> And how is that solution coming?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> In the meantime, I'm here to keep you in power.
Chance to survive the end of the world.<eos> That's what they're offering to all of us.<eos> Soon, Praimfaya will once again destroy everything.<eos> Skaikru's trying to stop it.<eos> My King, they're lying to you.
I saw you talking to Coulson!<eos> Where's Chris?<eos> You know, go ahead.<eos> Take me to him.<eos> 'Cause if not, I'm gonna find the Resistance and come after all of you.
- He's gonna kill her.<eos> - Fitz would never do that.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Get back to the Quintjet.<eos> I'll deal with this and meet you there.
Glad you've finally come to your senses.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Actually, I was thinking we might try to find another way through the back door.<eos> I still believe Daisy's right. Wake up!<eos> There is no back door, just like she's not Moses about to take you to the Promised Land.
Well, let's add it to the list.<eos> Just make sure I'm still breathing when the team arrives?<eos> So, you can't go any faster?<eos> The only fuel left is in the center wing tank.<eos> And we burned all of our electrical power keeping you guys plugged into the Framework.
- seems better safe than sorry.<eos> There's been enough killing.<eos> Which leads to the next question.<eos> What do we do with Fitz?<eos> What do the two of you remember of your Framework lives?
If she'd asked me, I could've got a far better price.<eos> - You'd have swiped it long ago.<eos> - Oh, spare me!<eos> At least it would've stayed with the family, not someone who's imposed on us forever.<eos> You mean someone who's laboured for you forever.
That hard-to-describe muffled quality... It's all there in what you've written.<eos> It would make a great novel, you know that, right?<eos> But look. There's something more important than any of that.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I asked you here to share the decision I've made.
They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.<eos> Fertility is a gift directly from God.<eos> He left you intact for a Biblical purpose.
Am I correct, girls?<eos> Yes, Aunt Lydia.<eos> Offred.<eos> But that is not the worst of it.<eos> Now, you know that I do my very best to protect you.
Folks, may I have your attention, please.<eos> Ladies, you should all know that I feel really sorry about this.<eos> Shit.<eos> It isn't my decision. I don't have a choice.<eos> - I have to let you go.
Ladies, you should all know that I feel really sorry about this.<eos> Shit.<eos> It isn't my decision. I don't have a choice.<eos> - I have to let you go.<eos> - What? I have to let you all go.
A bit higher, Janine.<eos> That's better.<eos> Now, girls.<eos> Soon you will be leaving us for new homes, a new family.<eos> And they won't judge you for your looks, or your clothes, or your ability to sound clever.
Now, girls.<eos> Soon you will be leaving us for new homes, a new family.<eos> And they won't judge you for your looks, or your clothes, or your ability to sound clever.<eos> Take your hands out of your mouth!<eos> They will love you for the blessing only you can provide.
- Why do you do this, Dan?<eos> I'm just asking my neighbor a friendly question.<eos> Well, Joel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ants Away, Ants Be Gone, Fuck You, Ants.
I'm just asking my neighbor a friendly question.<eos> Well, Joel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ants Away, Ants Be Gone, Fuck You, Ants.<eos> Fuck You, Ants.
- How many times did you call? - [sighs]<eos> I'm not telling.<eos> You might take my phone away.<eos> He's gonna be at a paranormal conference today in Oxnard.<eos> He meets you, you put on your little horror show, eat a finger, let him stab you in the stomach,
How is he gonna learn?<eos> - College.<eos> - Smooth.<eos> While I enjoy mother/daughter stuff on the Internet, this isn't working for me.<eos> So why don't you get out of here before I press charges.
Anything. Benjamin applied for a patent, and it turns out that our technology overlaps with someone else's.<eos> - How much overlap?<eos> - 32.5%.<eos> That's over the threshold.<eos> Unless Benjamin can get you below 30...
We better get you in.<eos> You said, "shit." I did say "shit." Yeah, I did.<eos> I got you in some trouble, there.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Well, you folks stay warm.
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look, they're patrolling all over.<eos> You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.
Spill it, kid.<eos> The detective asked to interview me about the thing.<eos> The killing?<eos> The killing.<eos> Of a man who was trying to choke you to death.
OK, that's enough now.<eos> Now is the hard time, but it's supposed to be hard.<eos> When I lost Chris, I thought I would never...<eos> Point is, it gets easier.<eos> I'm here for you.
- What?<eos> What the... What are you...<eos> Here you go, piggies.<eos> Some slop for you.<eos> Gotta fatten you up for the slaughter.
But he cheated on me so we're totally over.<eos> And I don't care about your friend.<eos> Go live your life.<eos> I gotta go judge.<eos> Not you... something else, okay?
Great, so we don't even rate a semiautomatic.<eos> Let's go.<eos> She's deadweight.<eos> I'll tell MCC... about the dead guard.<eos> I heard you in the stall.
So are you sure you want to be getting in my face?<eos> You think blonde Katy Perry and...<eos> I never seen you before.<eos> Um, I'm...<eos> 'Cause we all look like janky versions of white celebrities to you.
Everyone!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now all you bitches quiet down so my Muslim friend here can talk a little bit.<eos> Um... yeah. So we been talking, and we have a plan we'd like to run by all of you concerning the demands.<eos> Who put you in charge?
I think everything is gonna be okay.<eos> You know, a little water and some honey... that's gonna tame that frizz, okay?<eos> - You want me to show you later? - Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, yeah? Okay. There you go.<eos> Girls, I'm so happy to see you.
After the probably apocryphal figure in Sicilian mythology.<eos> Well, I don't have time to learn things.<eos> The banking day has already begun. In any case, I'm sure you'll be off on some exciting adventure with your new guardian.<eos> Remember, you can always rely on us at Mulctuary Money Management.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I will leave you alone on this mostly deserted dock to await for your taxi to your Aunt Josephine's house.
One, yes, a great deal of limes at a reasonable price.<eos> It's perfect for cold lime stew.<eos> The other is even better.<eos> Something wonderful.<eos> Baudelaires, I know I am a disappointment to you and to countless others.
[hook-handed man] I thought you were guarding the waiter.<eos> I thought they were.<eos> - [both] We thought he was!<eos> - So, nobody's guarding the waiter?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on you.
Let's go.<eos> Thanks for meeting us back here.<eos> It's been so long.<eos> Seven years.<eos> Not just since I've seen you guys.
I think we just wanted to give our son a normal one.<eos> Kind of hard when you're the last generation on Earth.<eos> But maybe Abe's research will change all that.<eos> Thanks again, Dariela.<eos> I really couldn't have done this without you guys.
No, General Washington, I'm fine.<eos> You, on the other hand...<eos> Stand at ease.<eos> Gentlemen, General Washington is dead. Hooray!<eos> Now, I know you would all like nothing more than to return home
I, Raymond of the Palms, and my band of merry men and women, humbly request safe passage to Camelot, and an audience with King Arthur.<eos> King Arthur?<eos> Yes, you can his crest on their shields.<eos> I am Guinevere.<eos> We shall escort you to Camelot... But your leper must remain outside the castle walls.
Rip Hunter.<eos> Yes.<eos> He said the Spear could alter reality itself... that it was too powerful for any man or woman to possess, so we broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods.
Deliver the fragment to me by dawn, or I'll come back with an army just as obedient as Arthur here.<eos> Choice is yours...<eos> Camelot... or the Spear.<eos> Galahad, may you rest in peace, where sorrow and pain are banished.<eos> May the everlasting light of Camelot shine upon you.
It seems your wizard is too late.<eos> Is she talking about Professor Stein?<eos> No matter.<eos> We shall settle this at the point of our swords.<eos> Camelot calls to you in its hour of need.
Um, he said something about paying his respects to the queen before we left.<eos> Hm, funny,<eos> Sara said the exact same thing.<eos> I just wanted to say good-bye.<eos> I enjoyed meeting you.
Either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> - Mr. Hunter took one.<eos> - And took the rest of you to three different time periods, which means the last piece unaccounted for must be with your grandfather.
But we would love to work with you.<eos> Always.<eos> You know, you two were heroes to me. Way before all of this.<eos> I know you want to help people, but this is not the way to do it.<eos> I won't stop you. But as long as you are putting yourselves in danger, I can't support it.
The Greens have been silenced.<eos> The ones who thought they were better than us.<eos> We are now one pure hive.<eos> So, who are you going to kill next?<eos> What other species deserves to be obliterated because you decide you're better than them?
It will be such a pleasure to watch them burn.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> They'll just find you again.<eos> I've put you all in danger.
Like what's the scented candle that I hate?<eos> - Teak wood and tobacco.<eos> - No.<eos> They can read minds, too.<eos> They know all your preferences, everything that makes you who you are.
No, I can't.<eos> There's some kind of psychic interference.<eos> Well, that's convenient.<eos> He's after me.<eos> I should turn myself over. Maybe he'll let you go.
Great, we are...<eos> We're great.<eos> Eve is great.<eos> - Things are great.<eos> - I'm so happy for you. More drinks for you guys?
She wanted to save the human race.<eos> - That's enough, thank you.<eos> - It is not enough!<eos> Lillian Luthor is not a criminal.<eos> She wanted to save you.
Lena Luthor and... It's fine.<eos> Hey! Hey, how's everything going with Mon...<eos> Um, with Mike?<eos> Actually, it's not going.<eos> I thought you two were going out. You mean, went out.
I mean, could eat it for every meal, literally.<eos> It's like her happy food.<eos> And she loves bonsai trees, which I know is totally random, but I mean, find it adorable.<eos> That's all great. So why don't you create a tailor-made Maggie Valentine's Day?<eos> And you can re-invent the holiday for the both of you.
I mean, back on Daxam, they used to throw parties when people got together.<eos> You're lucky I didn't arrange a parade. - Ha ha! - I'm just saying.<eos> Can we just pretend like that never happened?<eos> I'd like nothing more.<eos> But unfortunately, as your supervisor, I have to ask you to report to HR.
Don't do this.<eos> Project Exodus.<eos> It's almost ready.<eos> "The Overman shall be the meaning of the Earth.<eos> "Remain faithful to the Earth, "and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes."
Yeah. - A lot of years.<eos> We should catch up sometime.<eos> Sure. That would be good.<eos> Sometime.<eos> I should go. And let you guys get up to whatever you've got going on.
I know them.<eos> In their minds, they honestly believe that if they get rid of you, then I'm just going to go back home.<eos> We need to retaliate.<eos> I mean, if we strike back, we could force them to pull the bounty and leave Earth.<eos> Uh, listen, I like revenge just as much as the next geek but need I remind you that they have an impenetrable warship?
It's worth a shot.<eos> Krypton on Earth?<eos> And I thought the location of our last meeting was vile.<eos> Uh, this place is sacred to me and my cousin.<eos> I thought it was the only place on Earth worthy enough to entertain you, Your Majesty.
I'm gonna go. No, Kara, don't do that...<eos> No, it's fine. Thank you.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> Babe!<eos> I know you're upset about earlier, but I really... I just want you and Kara to get along.
Can you? But I don't know where she is.<eos> It's somewhere I've never seen before.<eos> Can you take me to her?<eos> You'll protect her?<eos> I will protect you both. I promise.
We have crossed a sea of stars in order to bring you a new way.<eos> A better way.<eos> I will be your Queen,<eos> and you will be my subjects.<eos> Obey our orders, and we will protect you.
Will you agree to the ceremony now, or only after I've murdered thousands of lives in the city below?<eos> Because, after all, the Luthor's Children's Hospital isn't the only hospital in town.<eos> Fine.<eos> We will do as you ask.<eos> I know it's hard for you to see now, but in time, you will realize you made the right choice.
I can see why Kara loves you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Uh, Kara Danvers sent me to get you. Yeah.
I think I remember you saying you were going on a whaling trip off of Okinawa?<eos> I hope that was fun.<eos> So, yeah, give me a call.<eos> I wanted to talk about my future, see if you had any use for this old bag of bones around the old shop, so, yeah, anyway, give me a call.<eos> I miss you guys.
Don't feel you need to talk to me.<eos> Nothing ventured, nothing gained!<eos> Hey, Harita!<eos> I want to talk about my future, see if you had any use for this old bag of bones around the old shop.<eos> I miss you guys!
- Hello.<eos> - Hi, Jeffrey.<eos> - You've gotten tall.<eos> - Before I forget...<eos> - For you.
You don't get everything you want.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> That is wonderful news!<eos> So, cut to the chase.<eos> We invited you here this evening to showcase my slow cooker, obviously, and to say that, well, because of the divorce, we have to do some estate planning.
I'm pregnant.<eos> That is wonderful news!<eos> So, cut to the chase.<eos> We invited you here this evening to showcase my slow cooker, obviously, and to say that, well, because of the divorce, we have to do some estate planning.<eos> And we wanted to ask you two if you would consider being legal guardians to Jeffrey.
And look after him if we die, if we both die.<eos> Oh...<eos> - OK. Well, that's... that's a lot to take in.<eos> - I mean, may I ask, why us?<eos> - Because we love you, man.
Stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How'd you find us? I didn't, I didn't find you...
Marcel was exposed, as well.<eos> In your visions, our father's goading you to kill your enemy.<eos> If Marcel has seen something similar...<eos> Then we're all on the chopping block.<eos> I need to purify you both.
Mary, come on.<eos> Vampires aren't welcome.<eos> You're the exception.<eos> Rules of the house.<eos> I'll leave you two.
They're in the Ninth Ward now.<eos> In St. Theodora's Health Clinic.<eos> Honestly, she might be dead already.<eos> But if you kill me, then you'll never find out where her body is.<eos> I beseech you... accept this offering as a sign of our faith.
Man, you don't have to do this.<eos> I mean, we're all New Orleans witches here, right?<eos> You talk of witches as you make deals with vampires.<eos> It's 'cause of them that we need the Hollow.<eos> Please, man, she is never going to save you.
I mean, we're all New Orleans witches here, right?<eos> You talk of witches as you make deals with vampires.<eos> It's 'cause of them that we need the Hollow.<eos> Please, man, she is never going to save you.<eos> She's just gonna damn you to hell.
The spirit that's been haunting this city has gained the power that it needs to be reborn in the flesh.<eos> All right, now, you guys have been strong.<eos> You've been loyal to the ideals that we all value.<eos> But there's a battle coming that we are not prepared for. There's a time to fight and there's a time for us to survive.<eos> Right now, I need you to gather up your young ones, pull together your families and get out of town.
Unfortunately, as is his custom, Marcel is unfashionably late.<eos> So until such a time as he graces us with his presence, let us all raise a glass and salute the glorious city of New Orleans.<eos> But, before we do, my brother and I wish to acknowledge a painful truth.<eos> Our relationship with this city, and indeed with most of you, has been long and complicated.<eos> We hope you will be put at ease knowing we intend but a brief and peaceful stay.
I'm on my way to New Orleans right now. And I have good news.<eos> I went through the remains of the Lockwood estate, and I found you one creepy-ass, ancient finger bone.<eos> Your efforts are appreciated. Now, if you could only pick up the pace.<eos> Easy, Klaus.<eos> The only reason I'm heading your way is because I don't want you anywhere near Mystic Falls.
Here's a proposal.<eos> You come with me, I surrender the only weapon that can take your life.<eos> We need your blood.<eos> That's funny, I didn't hear you say "please."<eos> If you want answers, we have to guide you to the Ancestors.
One last time.<eos> Give me what I seek.<eos> - Why don't you come get it?<eos> - Fair enough.<eos> So long as you're prepared to die.
Thank you.<eos> Shall we?<eos> And I'd love to not have to turn the room upside down to find the clicker.<eos> That wasn't fun.<eos> Love you both.
You steal that money, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> 'Cause there's another man who works for Mr. Navarro, a very serious man... and he's gonna come to town.<eos> He's gonna ask me where that money is. And if I'm still alive, I'm gonna have to tell him that the Langmores stole it.<eos> At which point he's gonna find someone with your last name and start removing their skin until he locates the rest of you.<eos> So you decide, right now, once and for all, are you killers?
Who's got the big mouth?<eos> Who's the weak link with the big mouth and dates the trashy women and drinks too much with the trashy men?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Who's the irresponsible one that's gonna burn through theirs in, like, five years?<eos> They're gonna come asking you for a little bit of yours and what are you gonna tell that person? Hmm?
Who's the irresponsible one that's gonna burn through theirs in, like, five years?<eos> They're gonna come asking you for a little bit of yours and what are you gonna tell that person? Hmm?<eos> You gonna tell them, "No"?<eos> What happens then?<eos> Do they threaten to rat you out for stealing the money and killing me?
Smiles aren't just smiles.<eos> Psychologically, they have a measurable effect on your mood states.<eos> Yes.<eos> These robots, they built this place. They grew those trees.<eos> Something went wrong but they were designed to make you happy.
I'm sorry about your friend, but the danger isn't over yet.<eos> There must be more of you living rough here - tell me where.<eos> - So, you can take us to the Magistrate?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We're not here to arrest you, we're here to help.
On the side, like.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> For coin, of course.<eos> Why else? Someone pays you to promote the fair?
- Why?<eos> For coin, of course.<eos> Why else? Someone pays you to promote the fair?<eos> To get people onto the ice?<eos> Who? Who pays you?
She's free!<eos> Go!<eos> Where will she go?<eos> Somewhere cold, I imagine.<eos> Hopefully, she's smart enough to avoid you lot now.
- This is so weird. This is a new coat.<eos> There's something on the back of it.<eos> Can you scratch there?<eos> - Party Dog!<eos> - I was fucking with you guys.
It really fucks up the room.<eos> Yeah, that's actually what most of the girls are saying.<eos> Hey, ladies!<eos> You're all queens.<eos> Or however you choose to identify.
Please do not call me "big city girl," Kenny.<eos> We missed you at Christmas.<eos> Yeah, I know. I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I missed you guys, too.
The whole year, you've been telling anybody who would listen that all you wanted for your birthday was a dog.<eos> And you think that you're on your way to the pet store to pick one out right now.<eos> But what you don't know is that your mom just found out that she's going to have another baby.<eos> And your parents have already been stretching their money to make sure that they can pay for your college education.<eos> You don't know any of this yet because you're just a kid and they work really hard to shield you from that stuff.
I'm excited too.<eos> Your cells, for those of you that don't know, are powered by a central generator.<eos> From this generator, each block draws its allowance of power...<eos> An allowance... a very specific allowance based on personnel.<eos> Based on you.
Who are you?<eos> We're the professionals.<eos> I see a mistake has been made.<eos> I wanted women.<eos> I will compensate you for your time, but I must show you the door.
[man over radio] Yes, Doris, go ahead.<eos> Yeah, we can see you approaching us at the moment.<eos> If you can keep a bit of a safe distance.<eos> We have pretty much no maneuverability.<eos> [man] We won't hit you, don't worry about that.
I'll be rowing to Samoa, and then Megan Dyos will take over from me and go to Cairns.<eos> It's just something so far from what I've ever done before or even thought possible.<eos> [Laura] Girls, thanks for making this happen.<eos> For finally being an amazing team.<eos> I'm so proud of all of you.
What?<eos> All for Helen.<eos> News flash, ladies.<eos> Those boys don't wanna fuck any of you.<eos> They don't see you as women.
Fine.<eos> This motherfucking meeting is called to order!<eos> Welcome to Litchfield 2.0!<eos> Still busted-ass, but getting better by the minute.<eos> Now, because you're such a special fucking audience, we got a free riot giveaway for you.
All right.<eos> There you go.<eos> Got it.<eos> Motherfuck! Oh!<eos> Hey, nice knowing you, boys.
It's difficult to assess the extent of the damage at this point.<eos> It is?<eos> Well, we're taking him anyway.<eos> Don't try to stop us.<eos> Nobody's stopping you.
It's a tough fucking crowd.<eos> Got any family out there?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, guys. So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.
Listen, all I can do is stand up here and tell you how I feel, all right?<eos> I'm a person.<eos> I'm talking to people.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm just gonna leave you all to it.
And this time, I'm gonna listen to her... 'cause she's the expert, right?<eos> It's too late.<eos> I drank, like, eight bottles, okay.<eos> I'm sorry for being such a fuckup.<eos> I love you guys so much.
-Bullshit.<eos> We don't all agree, but so long as we're all in here doing this thing, we think that our justice system should focus on rehabilitation. Yeah?<eos> One crime should not define a person.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna make you guys so proud.
It's useless!<eos> All that hard work was for nichevo!<eos> I'm a failure!<eos> I failed my girls!<eos> I failed you!
Ooh. Anybody ever tell you size matters?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Yeah, fuck off.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it's Mr. Butch to you!
- I hope it's a book burning.<eos> - Fingers crossed.<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> Uh, thank you for bringing your books.<eos> In honor of Poussey, I'd like to welcome you all to the new Litchfield Community Library.
Quit the bitching, please.<eos> Try to remember, you are federal inmates, not line cooks at Applebee's.<eos> Now there's a new shipment of produce out on the loading dock that is not gonna move itself.<eos> Rosado, Hernandez, bring the boxes back in, and you're done for the day.<eos> CO Samuelson will escort you back to your block.
Or you want me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah, we all know that's how you like it, you dinge queen.<eos> You a fucking bucking bronco, ain't you, you motherfucker?<eos> Kiss my fucking ass, bitch!<eos> Fuck you!
It's difficult for me to condone violence, even if it's him.<eos> Nicky, please.<eos> If we don't get his confession, this was all for nothing.<eos> Don't make me beg.<eos> How many times has this woman been there for you, huh?
It's just his body.<eos> - His soul is in a better place now.<eos> - He's in heaven, Suzanne.<eos> Hey, Cindy Rubenstein... you don't believe in heaven.<eos> I believe you're referring to the modern cultural Jew who typically doesn't believe in a stringent concept of heaven and hell.
I got you. Ok.<eos> All right.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's already here.<eos> It's not safe for you here.
How old are you?<eos> We think you're pretty weird, too, you know.<eos> All that skin and flesh exposed.<eos> You're weak and slow and live a third of the time that we do.<eos> We could hunt you down and destroy your kind so easily.
- Yeah, right.<eos> - Please... stay hidden.<eos> We can't trust anyone anymore.<eos> Ordinary people did this.<eos> But I am here for you all, to keep you safe however I can.
That won't get you anything but bloodshed.<eos> When has this land ever not had bloodshed on it?<eos> You'll kill some of them.<eos> Sure.<eos> But then they'll kill all of you and they'll start here.
You'll kill some of them.<eos> Sure.<eos> But then they'll kill all of you and they'll start here.<eos> And when all of you included are gone and they've bled the city dry, they'll move out to the mountains, to the mobs in the deserts and the plains.<eos> They'll wipe you all out. And for what?
Koen is right.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> We fight, we'll all die.<eos> You trust this skin?<eos> You think he can save you?
It's me.<eos> I really didn't wanna do this again, but, um... I need you guys to... wire me $200 so they don't turn off my phone... and so I can eat.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I swear this is the last time.<eos> I love you.
You...<eos> You are the most real person that I've ever been with.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, over the next two days, I'm gonna be casting a squad of 12 women to play wrestlers on TV.<eos> Based on one, can you move, and can you follow basic direction?
You've heard of him, right?<eos> He's the two-time champion of... some stuff.<eos> All right, if you don't wanna leave here with a broken spine, I suggest you listen to what he has to say very carefully.<eos> All right, go ahead.<eos> Ladies... we're gonna go through the basics, so, you need to focus.
This is Josh Silverberg.<eos> I believe you knew his father Gary?<eos> Josh has some questions about his father's suicide.<eos> Nice to meet you, Josh.<eos> Leave you two to talk.
- Daddy?<eos> - Charlotte?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I scared you.
When Jesus chose his 12 disciples, he knew that one of them was the devil... one was Judas.<eos> Yet he sat with them all and broke bread still.<eos> So what's the Bible telling us... here? Um...<eos> Well, as a minister, it's... it's imploring me to embrace those of you who might be... doing bad things.<eos> You have to understand that Christ still loves you.
Sorry I missed your call. Please leave me a message.<eos> Kevin wanted me to give you this.<eos> Give Kevin our love, okay?<eos> And keep him healthy for when the baby comes.<eos> - I will. - God bless you.
He wanted to be forgiven.<eos> You know anything about that?<eos> No.<eos> Thinks that he's responsible for his dad's death.<eos> He said that he made a mistake and he's the reason that Danny had no other choice but to go back home and ask all of you for help.
Hey. You got a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, that pissing match back there between you and the boss, that about him or me?<eos> That's about him, 100%.<eos> So, you guys are just gonna be assholes from now on?
Hey, hey, listen.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - I'm on probation, okay?<eos> If I get even seen with this shit, I go to jail.<eos> I'm not gonna go to jail for you.
All right.<eos> Guys, you guys!<eos> All right, who wants to make ten bucks? Huh?<eos> Who here likes women's wrestling?<eos> $10... all you have to do is sit.
Aw, who the heck cares?<eos> It's Edna and Ethel Rosenblatt,<eos> - a.k.a. The Beatdown Biddies! - Thank you.<eos> - Are you cheering?<eos> I can't hear you. - Yes.
Monty, it's too risky.<eos> Jasper was right.<eos> You're not God.<eos> I have an announcement to make.<eos> Clarke Griffin has been lying to you.
We need you, Abby.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There must be a way.<eos> - Alright.<eos> We can see you.
Hey...<eos> We will get through this.<eos> On your feet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're bringing you home.
Roan wants you alive.<eos> Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> Skaikru made me murder my entire family.<eos> We're bringing you home.
You nearly killed Octavia.<eos> You're holding Bellamy and our Chancellor hostage.<eos> You marched an army here to do what, exactly?<eos> Why would you kill us when you know we're all gonna die soon, anyway?<eos> We're not here to kill you, Clarke.
You had this information and you never came forward?<eos> My daughter... is not on trial for murdering Marco Diaz, Ms. Santos.<eos> Your client is.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you all.
Just catching my breath.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> All right.<eos> Youknow, we hate you guys so much...<eos> That we invite you down here every 12 months just to make us remember, "Why is it we hate them so much?"
- What is it, 20? Twenty-three years.<eos> - God.<eos> - God, we're old.<eos> I can honestly say... - this is the highlight of our year.<eos> - It is. - Seriously, we love you guys.
If you two left now, you would not regret it.<eos> Trust me. - Believe he's right.<eos> - I'll make you a pledge now. Within...<eos> A year.<eos> Within a year, we'll come visit you.
Telling you, not gonna give you that, just gonna say, "one year."<eos> All right then. Enough shop talk.<eos> Let's make a toast to tomorrow.<eos> To tomorrows.<eos> And to you guys for having us back here every single year and to the first day... - of lobster season. - Of lobster season.
But yours do. When you mock or belittle us, you enforce an existing system.<eos> Cops everywhere staring down the barrel of a gun at a black man don't see a human being.<eos> They see a caricature... a thug... a nigger.<eos> A nigger.<eos> So... nah! You don't get to show up in a Halloween costume version of us and claim irony or ignorance, not anymore.
We came from the Balkans.<eos> I'm from the Thrace!<eos> You too, move over there.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, make your preparations and say your goodbyes to your friends as you'll never see them again.
Just once...<eos> -What are you saying, weasel face?<eos> -I just want to hear her voice.<eos> We couldn't make her talk 25 years, how are you going to do it?<eos> God damn you.
-What are you saying, weasel face?<eos> -I just want to hear her voice.<eos> We couldn't make her talk 25 years, how are you going to do it?<eos> God damn you.<eos> God damn you.
Oh my God, please hear me.<eos> Hear our pleas.<eos> Let's go quick and hear the news.<eos> My God, please end this suffering.<eos> "We have assigned six warriors for you.
-Would you?<eos> -No, I wouldn't.<eos> Right, you wouldn't.<eos> Then, honorable pasha, what is you?<eos> I'm a specially authorized state officer charged with bringing you to your post of duty.
Please don't be upset, your honor!<eos> There you are!<eos> Now, you're talking!<eos> Set this man free!<eos> -God bless you.
Now, you're talking!<eos> Set this man free!<eos> -God bless you.<eos> -Set him free!<eos> -God bless you.
First, tell us this:<eos> Will those warriors like us?<eos> Oh, they will love you.<eos> Just do as I say.<eos> They can't find anyone more precious than you in this village.
If the pasha finds them, he will cut off our heads, you idiot.<eos> Our heads, you say?<eos> What are you saying, brother?<eos> Kamil, Cumali.<eos> Everybody calls me "pasha" because of you.
But they gave me three instead of one. I don't know what to do.<eos> You know the saying "God gives you three chances".<eos> But three of them the same night...<eos> We should get going.<eos> Don't forget, I chose you to preserve your own language, culture and tradition.
You know what, I've prayed to God every night to have a child.<eos> Thank God, I have seven children before my eyes.<eos> I don't know when my journey of life will end, but my passing from this mortal world where there are lies among the truth is soon.<eos> I'm waiting for the day when I will reunite with my wife.<eos> May God keep you in right path, and keep you loved.
Sir, I didn't want to have a love that prevents me from living for God.<eos> I kept myself away from earthly affairs and devoted myself to God's path.<eos> It's written in the Quran:<eos> "God created women for men."<eos> So, we can marry you with someone from this village.
-God.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Oh, my sweetheart with an exceptional face.<eos> After I was honored with the magnificence of your pretty face, I was rejuvenated by your love.<eos> I never intend to annoy you, I would like to exhibit my sincerity.
From now on, the destiny of our village will change.<eos> You became the most important woman in this region.<eos> Stop crying please.<eos> I'm crying because I'll be separated from my children.<eos> I do everything for you and our village.
What am I going to do with this woman?<eos> What am I going to do with this woman?<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't keep our papa magistrate waiting anymore.<eos> May God give you a happy marriage.
Well, it's kind of like a jacketed sweater.<eos> It's a "swacket."<eos> A swacket.<eos> Dad, uh, where is Vicky?<eos> Oh, she's checking you guys in because Rob was so late.
Ta... fucking... da.<eos> Your royal accoutrement.<eos> This is ceremony, people, and I expect you to slather yourselves in it.<eos> Thank you, Eliot.<eos> I missed you all.
You're such a girl.<eos> You know, I would like to see you dead regardless of your gender.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I'm gonna take you someplace safe, but if I have to shoot you to get you there, I will make sure it hurts.
My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.<eos> By killing you.
Shit.<eos> Why don't you and Alice come join me?<eos> You're weaker.<eos> And you're down six fingers.<eos> More than enough to kill you both.
[chattering] [hip-hop music playing] [man] Is that supposed to be Nicki Minaj?<eos> Nicki Mi... hell no.<eos> All right, y'all.<eos> Let's do this. [narrator] Lionel Higgins wasn't always a revolutionary.<eos> Don't let the Afro fool you.
I root for you.<eos> When I see you, I see the best in you.<eos> Well, maybe sometimes, I want you to just see me.<eos> Is that why you chose him?<eos> Do you know how hard it was seeing you two together last night, walking home together?
We need to work together to make our voices stronger!<eos> Too bad we can't vote.<eos> With me as your lifeline, we will have unprecedented access to the administration.<eos> So we should vote for you because your father's the HNIC?<eos> No, because of all the other candidates, who do you think is gonna have your back?
That is the last time I share a personal story with you.<eos> Well, you see, with me, there is no confusion.<eos> People take one look at my skin, and they assume that I'm poor or uneducated or ratchet. So, yeah, I tone it down, make myself more palatable, join a sorority.<eos> What's so wrong with that? [scoffs] Everything.<eos> Dear white people, you made me hate myself as a kid, so now I hate you, and that's my secret shame.
- No, you couldn't.<eos> - Yes, I could. A Cayenne Turbo is 120.<eos> A Cayenne Turbo is a proper car built by Porsche.<eos> This is two scrap cars glued together by a Muppet.<eos> It isn't designed for people like you.
- I'm from Belgium.<eos> - Oh. How do you know they're footballers?<eos> Well, do you not recognise them?<eos> They're in football outfits.<eos> He doesn't recognise you.
So that is a no.<eos> It's OK, though.<eos> We anticipated that Nena may float away. We have a back-up plan.<eos> We'll activate it. You sit down.<eos> You see, the thing is...
That's what we're about.<eos> - That's what this show is, it's all heart.<eos> - It's what we are.<eos> those are the two pillars that underpin everything, really, on this show.<eos> - I've got some conversation for you. - Have you?
- That is good news.<eos> - It's good news.<eos> Only 35 on the road. No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're absolutely right.
That's the prison where Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where are you going with that?<eos> Nowhere, really.<eos> Just thought you might like to know.
Please! This is what we voted for.<eos> We have to be safe in here.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Fuck you!
We have to be safe in here.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck all of you!
Do you blame them for burning Trikru villages as they go?<eos> That's funny coming from you.<eos> Enough.<eos> We know the woods are a war zone.<eos> After what happened with Ilian, I can't spare many of the guard to protect you.
She was a warrior, a champion, and her life was cut short by the senseless actions of this man before you.<eos> Murderer!<eos> This is insanity.<eos> The Lieutenant died so that all of us may live.<eos> She sacrificed herself for you.
It's been a while. Yeah, no, everything's great.<eos> Mary is great.<eos> No. No, no, no. I'm...<eos> I just... you know, really.<eos> Yeah, I miss you too.
Get her to the infirmary. Yes, sir.<eos> Secure her before you treat her.<eos> All right, everybody, that's enough fun.<eos> The show's over.<eos> Go back to doing what you were doing.
- Most of them don't mind.<eos> The ones who do, we win them over.<eos> - You want to win over Troy?<eos> - Work in progress.<eos> In the meantime, both of you stay away from him.
Here's the file on your death.<eos> And... the one on your father's.<eos> I want to say, Your Majesty, it's an absolute honor to have you back.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hill.<eos> What's on this disk is a little graphic, I must warn you.
This attack is an act of terrorism.<eos> Things are about to get a whole lot worse.<eos> Prince Liam and Princess Eleanor are not descendants of His Royal Majesty King Simon.<eos> The King's memorial dedicate...<eos> Father believed in you.
Why the, er, the sign then?<eos> I'm trying to get a hold of Jasper.<eos> He's giving me the silent treatment and not responding to my texts.<eos> - Oh, for shit's sake! - I know.<eos> As impossible as it is to imagine your supremely eloquent emoji texts going unanswered, the palace private cameras are not a messaging service for you two.
Jasper Frost. My boyfriend.<eos> Mm, I wanted to introduce you because I thought that you should know what's going on.<eos> So it's serious, then?<eos> Well...<eos> Well, does everybody know about you and Jasper? Jasper?
What do you think of Jasper? He's good.<eos> Trustworthy.<eos> Great company.<eos> Right.<eos> I've got to say it's still weird for me that not only are you and Len getting on, but you're like close.
I tell you, anything that you are going through, any test in life, any difficult situation you are going through, only be strong. Grasp the hand of God.<eos> Keep going and make your kids the engine of your life.<eos> Never give up.<eos> Push with all your might, and you will persevere. So that your kids don't lack anything.<eos> Think about them, always. And doors will open for you.
- It's an expression.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You should be scared.<eos> If you're not, you got no idea what you're getting into, sweetheart.<eos> I survived the wasteland without you and your guns.
- She hated you, didn't she?<eos> Even in the end, when you cared for her and bathed her, she still didn't love you, did she?<eos> Who says we should rest up?<eos> I'm the only one who knows the way back.<eos> So you better pick your asses up at first light because I will leave you. I'll leave you all for the wasted.
'Cause some of us like to work.<eos> - We starting?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna take a piss first.<eos> So, why don't you guys stretch it out?
Girls... could I stay here with you?<eos> Just for a couple of days, until things calm down and I find a solution.<eos> Did something happen to you?<eos> [crying] I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't want to burden you with my problems.
Lord Odda.<eos> Steapa, my friend.<eos> Uhtred, you do not deserve such a charming wife.<eos> I can only agree, Lord.<eos> I was not expecting you, there has been no message.
I'll need to watch the trader.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would like that.<eos> Lord!<eos> I was just thinking about you.
I would like you to meet Father Pyrlig.<eos> Lord Uhtred, I have heard much about you.<eos> Father Pyrlig was once a warrior himself.<eos> Sword and spear, Lord, but a man tires of sticking ironware into the bellies of other men.<eos> I would have enjoyed a cup of ale with you both, but I must leave you.
A man old enough to be her much older brother.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're laughing at me.<eos> No, Father, I swear, I am not laughing at you.
And if I had my way, I would not be here.<eos> My men... are afraid.<eos> Of ghosts?<eos> It is not a sight you will forget.<eos> My lord wants you to know that by now he will be at Beamfleot and not Frankia.
Please. Please, please...<eos> To raise the dead, Lord, we need to send a messenger across the gulf.<eos> He is guilty?<eos> - Twice over.<eos> - Please, I beg you, Lord, please.
And a prayer?<eos> I don't know any prayers!<eos> I will say a prayer.<eos> Hild. Please.<eos> Let us pray that God and all his saints and all his angels in Heaven, smile and bless you.
I was offered the Kingdom of Mercia.<eos> And your response?<eos> He is here, is he not?<eos> I would say that is response enough.<eos> Uhtred, I did not see you at the church, I do hope you were there.
I call you queen because you mean that much to me.<eos> I do not like your tone nor accusation.<eos> What I would like... is you, on your belly... on the bed.<eos> Lord...? Your husband wishes to ride you.<eos> You will lie on your belly.
Your spies are wrong, lord. I've already married Alfred's daughter.<eos> Oh, how does she ride?<eos> I've no complaint.<eos> Uhtred, why is he here?<eos> I am here, lords, to ask of you your price, for leaving Lunden.
You're warriors, you will know that Lunden is impossible to defend, so let's get this done.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> Your price?<eos> It sounds like a threat.<eos> I'm asking you to retreat, lords, for a price, for silver.
She has great beauty, a good mind.<eos> I am in need of a wife.<eos> I am in need of a hump, we will share her.<eos> She is my wife.<eos> Aethelred, they're teasing you.
And I can never know you, I...<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> And I will never understand you - that is a fact, and one of increasing concern.<eos> And on top of this, my enemies now call you "King".<eos> And they called you a weasel, lord.
A stranger to my wife?<eos> Lord Aethelred!<eos> Welcome to Coccham!<eos> The jewel of Wessex.<eos> Uhtred is expecting you.
You must not tell anyone what has happened here.<eos> You're quiet today, Father Beocca.<eos> A sleepless night.<eos> Should I speak with Thyra?<eos> Tell her you need your rest?
What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.<eos> Mark.<eos> Peter.<eos> I can't get to you.
Reggie heard the message loud and clear.<eos> Hey, see you at practice tomorrow.<eos> Uh, I'm not on your team, Coach.<eos> Good one, Marcus.<eos> Despite the divisive hashtags that would have you believe otherwise, our great nation is built on that most famous of declarations:
Hey, is that Lionel? Or a really skinny lesbian?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Oh, hey, Lionel. Thanks for holding a spot for us.<eos> Oh, hey, guys.<eos> I've been waiting here for you, my friends.
We have to.<eos> We need more time.<eos> Can you reposition your army at the temple?<eos> If I do that, we lose the tower.<eos> The tower won't save you.
- Mrs. Kirkman?<eos> How is he?<eos> We're waiting on the X-rays, but it seems like the bullet went in and out.<eos> It didn't hit anything vital.<eos> Um, I know he wants to see all of you, but if we could please not overwhelm him.
No!<eos> Help!<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you. - Hey.
- John 8:32.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Alvin, no. Alvin.<eos> - "And you will know the truth." - This is important.<eos> - "And the truth will set you free." - You don't know how important.
Including President Richmond's son.<eos> - Tyler, really good to see you again.<eos> - Same here, Mr. President.<eos> Allow me to introduce the Student Orchestra of Robert Richmond High School in New Orleans.<eos> It is an honor to meet all of you, and I heard a rumor that we're gonna get to hear you perform later this afternoon.
And I-I let her go.<eos> And I surround myself with people who do love me.<eos> Loving begins with you.<eos> Love begins with you, but it rarely ends with you.<eos> It will lead you into your own heart... into yourself.
You eat non-halal. You used to smoke cigarettes.<eos> You don't wear the hijab.<eos> Why can't I have my interpretation where I'm just nice and I eat pork?<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Look, I get it. For you guys, religion has this cultural value.
Now you don't have to.<eos> All 'cause of Zeke.<eos> You should be worshipping him, but instead you want to go?<eos> Zeke brought us together and made us a family.<eos> Don't you give a damn about family?
Her mother Mae will be here in an hour.<eos> In the meantime, get to work.<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> We thought we would help With the Mae Wilson interview.<eos> Prentiss send you?
Now, this I can get used to.<eos> Play around.<eos> Try on anything.<eos> Okay?<eos> Maybe these could help inspire you in your wrestling personas.
You guys did blow all weekend, and we have to live like nuns?<eos> Not nuns, roommates.<eos> Sorority sisters.<eos> I'll make it easier for everyone.<eos> If you want your paycheck, you'll live at the hotel and you follow the rules.
I'll make it easier for everyone.<eos> If you want your paycheck, you'll live at the hotel and you follow the rules.<eos> So, when exactly do we get to move into this deluxe training camp?<eos> - End of the week.<eos> - Yup. So, make all the arrangements you have to, call your landlords, hide your drugs, flush your fish.
- You guys think you can handle that?<eos> - Sure, seems manageable.<eos> Right, Debbie?<eos> Or maybe we could open with a bit more panache.<eos> I picked this sequence because it's something you actually can do.
Fucking white, right-wing idiots.<eos> Someone's grumpier than usual.<eos> We lost the venue.<eos> - The lady just called me an hour ago.<eos> So, now I'm here to drink and not be alone before I never see any of you again.
I did what I could.<eos> You simply think it's over for me.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> All of you, with your birthrights and your titles and your esteemed sense of privilege.<eos> You had a king who let you be corrupt and you destroyed that.
and how it matches "think of me kindly, even though I'd done this terrible thing."<eos> It should be "I've done this terrible thing."<eos> Yes, it is a terrible thing, and I'm sure it's very upsetting to read.<eos> But once and for all, we can see the note is not a forgery.<eos> You're right. But why would this Captain Sham person go through so much trouble just to place you under his care?
It should be "I've done this terrible thing."<eos> Yes, it is a terrible thing, and I'm sure it's very upsetting to read.<eos> But once and for all, we can see the note is not a forgery.<eos> You're right. But why would this Captain Sham person go through so much trouble just to place you under his care?<eos> We've already told you, Captain Sham is Count Olaf in disguise.
Why would Captain Sham do something terrible to his closest friend?<eos> Good point, Poe. - He isn't Captain Sham.<eos> - He's Count Olaf.<eos> I understand that losing your parents and your home has had an emotional effect, as I imagine it would have on many people.<eos> I've done the best I can to find a suitable home for you, but nothing I do seems to be good enough.
- Klaus really did it.<eos> - But Violet knew how to work the sailboat. Without Violet, we never would've made it here.<eos> Sunny spotted the lighthouse.<eos> Well, I am so glad to see all of you.<eos> Just let me catch my breath and I'll help you bring in your things.
- We miss them, too.<eos> But we have questions about them. They never told us about you.<eos> They never told us about Uncle Monty.<eos> I have a feeling there's lots of things they never told us about.<eos> Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.
Oh, my!<eos> We don't know how to thank you.<eos> I can think of a way.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> You can stop faking your death and running away and rescuing each other and making me ferry around this godforsaken lake searching for you. Parenting is exhausting. You're not our parent and you never will be.
- Klaus?<eos> Come on. We don't have all day.<eos> You said you were going to go home and rest, but instead you steal a sailboat and push Josephine's house down a hill?<eos> I missed the prehurricane discount tickets and had to spend the night in a bed and breakfast that uses powdered eggs!<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if Captain Sham was no longer interested in serving as your guardian, even though I filled out these forms in triplicate while he boated around Lake Lachrymose looking for you on a hunch.
They really should be more careful, Dr. Orwell.<eos> If they were to do something impolite to me, like, for example, call me by the wrong name, I would have to do something impolite to them, like, for example, tear their hair out with my bare hands.<eos> Cookie?<eos> What's all this?<eos> I don't pay you in gum to stand around gabbing!
They burnt down the town, and now you've come back to finish the job.<eos> Sir, be reasonable.<eos> Perhaps we should reevaluate our safety procedures. Or perhaps we shouldn't let children near dangerous machines.<eos> I got a better solution.<eos> One more mistake, Baudelaires, and I'm gonna send you away to a place where you'll learn the value of discipline and child labor.
Haven't you learned anything this year?<eos> Week?<eos> Season?<eos> Wherever you go, I will be waiting.<eos> Wherever you hide, I will hunt you down.
Yes, you may have saved Charles, but there will still be a fatal accident at the lumbermill tonight.<eos> - Oh, there you are.<eos> - (BABBLES) If you want our fortune, you can have it.<eos> Just leave Sunny alone!<eos> You think you're so clever, but you only see in black and white.
You're alive!<eos> I think you children will have a good home here.<eos> I hope so anyway, because I've just received a promotion.<eos> Vice President of Orphan Affairs.<eos> Which means I'll be too busy to check in on you orphans.
Which means I'll be too busy to check in on you orphans.<eos> What's our new guardian's name?<eos> Guardian?<eos> Oh, no. Good God, no.<eos> I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.
I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.<eos> Not after what happened to the last three.<eos> Uh, two.<eos> No, four. Oh, no, children, you're going to boarding school.<eos> It's the end of the season, um, semester, so you're gonna have to work very hard to catch up.
You can wait on that bench.<eos> You're not coming with us? Oh, this has already taken up much too long already.<eos> Banking hours.<eos> Um... I do want you children to know... (COUGHS) I hope you find comfort here.<eos> (COUGHS) Um, this came to the bank for you.
- It could just be a coincidence.<eos> - It could be Count Olaf.<eos> Maybe we should leave.<eos> (SIGHS) Forgive me.<eos> I thought you might be trespassers.
Trouble?<eos> I'm your partner.<eos> - I'm speaking to the Baudelaires.<eos> - Right.<eos> I took a chance on treating you like grown-ups.
-We're busy.<eos> What's up, paper boy?<eos> Nice speech, Mr. President. [Sam] Mm, yeah.<eos> Not a single racist got a pardon and you promoted fire safety. Way to go.<eos> [Troy] I'm surprised to see you two here.
Well, there is some comfort in that, knowing he's not some London street Arab or some French ruffian.<eos> An orphan, Marilla?<eos> Matthew's been terrible set on it.<eos> Well, I hope and pray it works all right.<eos> Only, don't say I didn't warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well.
No, Clarke, not if he comes peacefully.<eos> We will make room for one.<eos> Indra agreed.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> It's good to see you.
How bad do we want this?<eos> There is a way out now.<eos> When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.
I'm not a quitter.<eos> Thanks for understanding.<eos> Where's Monty?<eos> Unloading the rover.<eos> We're leaving it behind for you, by the way.
Sorry we're late.<eos> There's been some developments.<eos> Not all good.<eos> They've...<eos> Fill you in on the way.
Part of A.L.I.E.'s code is still in my head.<eos> Heightened mental ability, hallucinations, it's all connected.<eos> - Raven.<eos> - Becca?<eos> Make no mistake... you choose to stay and you're choosing death.
This is your time.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> This is it.<eos> We are all that remains of the human race.<eos> I won't lie to you.
Bellamy, if you can hear me, you're alive.<eos> It's been 2,199 days since Praimfaya.<eos> I don't know why I still do this every day.<eos> Maybe it's my way of staying sane, not forgetting who I am... who I was.<eos> It's been safe for you to come down for over a year now.
Anyway, I still have hope.<eos> Tell Raven to aim for the one spot of green, and you'll find me.<eos> The rest of the planet, from what I've seen, basically sucks, so...<eos> Never mind.<eos> I see you.
And no ejaculating between now and then.<eos> -Yep. -Gotcha.<eos> Okay. I should... -I'll write this down.<eos> -Maybe don't masturbate for a minute.<eos> If you need help, you can call the page operator. She can put you in touch with the doctor on call.
You call, leave a message, and they get right back to you.<eos> I assure you, it happens.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Good to see you guys and good luck.<eos> Thank you and we will no longer interrupt you.
"McDonald's is the reason why I'm out of shape."<eos> "I would have got a salad, but you didn't have the option, so I was like, "Well, I guess I gotta get 52 Big Macs."<eos> "Thanks a lot, McDonald's!"<eos> It's like, "Dude, you're an adult.<eos> It's not their job to babysit you.
A little pull back.<eos> It's about police brutality.<eos> It has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world, and mine, right?<eos> Just let it go. I don't give a fuck if you watched every episode of McHale's Navy.<eos> This is still not about you.
Before it even registered that it was Kanye, my first thought was, "Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, thank God. It's just a black guy."<eos> "Thank God!<eos> It's just a black guy."<eos> Yeah, I know, you're right to pull back.
"Dude, run down to the bar!<eos> It's the next Michael Jackson, I swear to God!"<eos> You would consider it.<eos> "Michael Jackson, I've got to fucking see that."<eos> But if somebody woke you up, like,
You're gonna have to buy something again.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - No, I'm an idiot.<eos> Felix came home from New York last night, right?<eos> Yeah, he's gonna be here after school, take you to Alison's, and I'll meet you guys after my test, yeah?
Believe me, the last thing I want to do is see another face like mine.<eos> Have a nice life, Rachel.<eos> Don't you all look cosy.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> 'Cause I've got something for all of you.
It's another status handbag, some obscenely expensive bottle of wine you buy and show off at a dinner party.<eos> To the people we're helping, it could mean the difference between life and death. - All right.<eos> - Thank you, Cal.<eos> That was illuminating for all of us.<eos> Now it's my job to ask you all to go back to enjoying yourself.
Hey. I'm talking about just other things.<eos> - Okay, but you know I can't help but ask about her, right?<eos> - I'm sure some of the missing is tied into her.<eos> - "Some of the missing"? You still talk to her, Eddie?<eos> Eddie, do you see her?
How'd it go?<eos> It was good.<eos> Mommy! I missed you.<eos> How was the conference?<eos> Great. Did they like you guys?
Who is it?<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> What are you doing here, Tess?<eos> Restitution, right, Dad?<eos> Thought I'd stop by and remind you all that I still exist.
Oh, he'll understand.<eos> You talk to Meredith without me.<eos> You talk to Richard.<eos> You talk to Jackson.<eos> I mean, you two go way back.
Until my little promotion today, I was head of PR for the Redskins.<eos> I won a Digie for my sweet tweets.<eos> But just imagine the optics of having a Native American in the family. We'll be bulletproof.<eos> What do you mean "in the family"?<eos> Let's get you and Russ married before God takes him.
Just how much Lucifer loves me.<eos> So these small ones are for couples who don't really care.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Tell me more about you and Lucifer.<eos> What comes next for you two lovebirds?
I love you.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> - I love you!<eos> - Bye!<eos> It totally sucks that Marianne kicked you out of her place.
- [Chuckles] - You're awesome.<eos> [Murmuring]<eos> Em --<eos> EMMA: It's all cool.<eos> Everybody just -- you guys relax.
You know, unemployed polygamists?<eos> Oh, yeah. You should just shave your heads and get, like, crazy tribal face tattoos.<eos> You know, just fuck it, right, cuz?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Yeah. Be good for you?
No, that's -<eos> Nope, it's all good.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Okay, this is still weird.<eos> Well, doesn't help when you braid tongues in front of me.
Get over it. It wasn't that bad.<eos> It was that bad with a dollop of shit on top.<eos> Not sure what was cringier, you and Izzy publicly vacuuming each other's mouths or Jack awkwardly watching it.<eos> It's not like he's never seen us kiss before.<eos> Well, the untrained eye might mistake you two for a couple of full-blooded lesbians, not bisexuals.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, fuck you for making massive life decisions completely on your own that affect both of us.<eos> - Is that... is that me?<eos> - Um... Are you talking about me?<eos> Well, then, fuck you both for chasing me down half-cocked, you matching set of dumbshits!
The three of us.<eos> You guys have been third-wheeling the shit out of me!<eos> You've decided that I'm not fluid, I'm a lesbian?<eos> Okay, well, fuck you for making massive life decisions completely on your own that affect both of us.<eos> Well then, fuck you both for chasing me down half-cocked, you matching set of dumbshits!
You stay pretty and keep your shit together so I don't have to.<eos> Does it hurt? - Don't answer.<eos> Don't say it. Don't answer.<eos> - Does what hurt?<eos> You know, you two getting your heads so far up each other's asses.
Yeah. Yeah, no. No, that sounds... that sounds fun.<eos> Then we'll be there Friday. - Yes. Stupendous.<eos> - Mother: We might not...<eos> Yeah, just call me when you're close.<eos> - Byzie-byzie. Okay. Love you too.
I'm not really "Notorious Orgy Girl."<eos> She was just joking.<eos> Don't care.<eos> So, when you said the name Andy, were you referring to Andy Cutler?<eos> I've seen you guys together, right?
I'm definitely getting my face eaten off.<eos> Wow, Janis, this place is far out.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Hashtag blessed that you finally came.<eos> The mosquitos don't bother you out here?
- Fierce winds. - I thought he was kidding.<eos> That actually happened?<eos> Could've happened to anyone.<eos> That's not that funny.<eos> Glad you all find my lack of mundane masculine acumen so amusing.
Glad you pervs are having fun.<eos> - Mom. - No. No, we're not.<eos> Um, we were just trying to convince Emma that she couldn't have given Hal a heart attack.<eos> Well, nobody forced him to find the best cheeseburger in every state, right?<eos> Oh, I'm just fudging with you.
You three need some space and some time.<eos> Besides, your dad needs to get home and rest.<eos> You got a lot to work out.<eos> Two-person relationships are complicated enough.<eos> Not for you guys.
I think, uh...<eos> I mean, I think nobody can make this place look cooler than Emma, right?<eos> The house at Hawthorne Heights is always gonna just be Jack and Emma's.<eos> But this place... this place could be ours.<eos> I love you.
I could be drunk and a goldfish and still "fulfill my duties as bartender" better than you.<eos> Oh, that's... that's very funny.<eos> Yeah, because it's very true.<eos> It is very true.<eos> Y... you might want to take a look around 'cause it's just the two of you and, like... barfly over there.
That is some very weird science.<eos> Is there, like, a polygamist community down there or a... some special school for children of threesomes I don't know about?<eos> Well, it's just Izzy's part of the bargain.<eos> We get her womb and she gets a loft. Ah.<eos> Translation... she doesn't want to live anywhere near you boring losers.
- Here, I'll take her.<eos> How do you want to do this? Uh... - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yes. It's okay.<eos> - I want you two to become friends.
Hey.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You okay down there?<eos> Oh, it's the whiny man from the police station.<eos> I'm gonna get you out, okay?
What if you're both wrong?<eos> - What if it's...<eos> - If Thomas is right, then we'll die out there.<eos> But if one of us is right, if one of us survives, then you will know who to follow.<eos> Then that person can save you.
- But to twins, it's mad disrespectful.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> So, we were about to check this nigga.<eos> And I think that he saw that we were angry, so he tried to, like, calm the situation down.<eos> He was, like, "Yo, I'm sorry if I offended you guys."
we know you guys have suffered, "so we are going to pay you $100 million."<eos> - That's right.<eos> "But we can only guarantee about 20,000, all right?"<eos> - "We've got a state to run." - Yep.<eos> "And if you disagree, we will kill you on the spot."
I mean, you would be.<eos> You started it.<eos> I understand you hate it, I do.<eos> I really, really do.<eos> However, while you may hate waiting for a weed dealer, the consequences of a world without the War on Drugs are far worse for you.
However, while you may hate waiting for a weed dealer, the consequences of a world without the War on Drugs are far worse for you.<eos> Dude, that's insane.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> I would like to show you a world without the War on Drugs.<eos> [stammering] Might I indulge you?
No Ready to Die.<eos> [Kenny] Is that...<eos> [Nixon] Christopher Wallace...<eos> CPA.<eos> - How does it make you feel?
Whilst many turned their backs on the afflicted, fearing cholera, Master Jennings and the rest of the White House staff flung open their doors and vowed to conquer this epidemic by any means necessary.<eos> With symptoms ranging from high fevers to pulsing hot rashes, Master Jennings labeled the sickness<eos> "Influenza Incendium," or "Fire Flu."<eos> I must join you.<eos> Be still, let us tend to you.
"There is no place like home."<eos> You said you have some maps for me?<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> This way, Miss Alex.<eos> While you two get busy with the topography, I'll, take a look around for info on ley line interference.
This is a road we should not start down until Miss Jenny and the others are securely in position and ready to distract the Sphinx.<eos> Hey, topside, what's your 20? In position.<eos> I'll signal when I have contact.<eos> Hey, hold up.<eos> I will need you to hang back by the truck.
One of LAPD's real hidden assets.<eos> Detective Henry Cho, meet Detectives...<eos> Murtaugh and Riggs, in the flesh.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm very thrilled to meet you guys.
Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods, which means the last piece unaccounted for must be with your grandfather.
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have we ever destroyed anything we've ever stolen, let alone the most valuable score in the universe?<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> How the hell are we supposed to find anyone in here?<eos> - I said, how the hell are we sup...<eos> On your feet, you lazy good-for-nothings, or I'll have you shot!
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.<eos> Mr. Snart?<eos> Wait, you can see him?<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> Yeah, they told me all about how I get soft and die for you losers. I didn't believe them.
What do you hear?<eos> My parents.<eos> What are they saying?<eos> "Don't play with fire, Mick."<eos> Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.
Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Yes, but you do it so well, and with such... style.<eos> And you've done a bang-up job dealing with my... pest problem, though that term may be giving you vigilantes a little too much credit.
I know you loved her to pieces.<eos> Well, if you want something done right...<eos> Well done, Leonard.<eos> You bastard.<eos> I'll kill you all.
With word of your capture, there will be more.<eos> All waiting for war.<eos> You have my thanks, Lady.<eos> There will be many men inside.<eos> They will want to get close to you, look you in the eye.
I told you I would invite King Alfred's daughter, and she is here!<eos> I swear to the gods... ..that this prize will not be sold cheaply.<eos> There will be wealth and glory for every man here.<eos> It is the best we have.<eos> These are my own men, they will watch you.
You began so well.<eos> I will be reminding the King who it was who travelled into Daneland.<eos> I will be reminding the King that your friend Uhtred has been called King of Mercia, and I shall remind him how fond you are of his seat.<eos> Do that.<eos> But allow me to remind you of this-the only man capable of cleaning up this puddle of shit is the man you are desperate to blame.
No, I'm doing it!<eos> I think I have something!<eos> Supper at last!<eos> Oh! He's a sea monster!<eos> Lord. You said I should find you.
Why so many guards?<eos> Are you afraid of me?<eos> You're a prize, Lady.<eos> Even when unwashed.<eos> She's the daughter of a King, you will all turn away!
Some might say it would mean martyrdom.<eos> I hear you, Odda. I'm glad you feel able to proffer this advice.<eos> Now, I wish to sit. You will leave me.<eos> Lord...<eos> Look around you, see the sacrifice that has been made.
Haesten.<eos> We're travelling to Beamfleot.<eos> For Alfred?<eos> For Alfred, yes.<eos> I am here to take you on to the fortress, Lord. You and two others.
My advice to you, Lord, is rescue her by all means, but not at a price that will cut our throats.<eos> You will all kneel.<eos> We will not.<eos> We have come here in peace and as equals.<eos> You've made us walk a good distance to meet you. That is respect enough.
Please, Lord.<eos> Think about what you are doing, you are making traitors of your men!<eos> The men you see are here to die for their King, not betray him.<eos> They know nothing of Alfred's weakness.<eos> But Uhtred, Lord! Did he not ask you to do nothing?
But Uhtred, Lord! Did he not ask you to do nothing?<eos> You will get down from your horse and you will return to Winchester.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> Now, Father Pyrlig.<eos> Lord, I beg you, think again.
Not lost but abandoned, Lord.<eos> I'm returning to Winchester with an important message for Alfred.<eos> We're going to see Alfred.<eos> Climb onto the cart. You can help guard Mercia's ransom.<eos> God bless you, Lord, saviour of my blistered feet.
Lord?<eos> Osferth?<eos> Can I say to you that I'm afraid?<eos> I wear a sword but barely know how to use it.<eos> I pray that when battle comes, I will not fail you.
You answered my call at the risk of everything.<eos> I only wish he did survive, Lady.<eos> Erik is still with me.<eos> And perhaps within me.<eos> And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.
Do you swear?<eos> You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear, Lady.<eos> Then I shall dare to kiss you.
To protect a muddy little hillside, you doomed your whole world.<eos> One man.<eos> You think one man can save us all?<eos> Come and meet him.<eos> He came here to meet you.
One man.<eos> You think one man can save us all?<eos> Come and meet him.<eos> He came here to meet you.<eos> He's met loads of people like you - the terrified, the desperate.
Course I can, I'm going to.<eos> This is not your job.<eos> No, it isn't, Bill.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> I've been standing by the gates of your world, keeping you all safe, since you crawled out of the slime.
Obvs.<eos> But remember what de Beauvoir wrote in Le Deuxieme Sexe?<eos> The concept of woman is a myth invented to oppress us.<eos> Man. You guys are so smart.<eos> I just called you guys "guys." Sorry.
What happened?<eos> She's gone.<eos> Now... someone is going to tell me where she went.<eos> Are you really going to protect her?<eos> She doesn't care about you.
Now... someone is going to tell me where she went.<eos> Are you really going to protect her?<eos> She doesn't care about you.<eos> I'm the one who cares.<eos> Snow White doesn't love you.
You don't think you deserve it.<eos> You really think you know me so well?<eos> Hmm?<eos> I'm going to spare this wretched person's life to prove she's wrong.<eos> I do love you.
And tonight reminded me of something that I hope I never forget again... love can save even the darkest souls.<eos> You just have to believe in it.<eos> Speaking of love...<eos> Emma told me.<eos> Killian, I couldn't be happier for you... both of you.
I'll just claim it back on the old expenses. What's your poison?<eos> I'm not fussed.<eos> Whatever you're having.<eos> Lovely lager.<eos> Same for you, boyses?
Although it's not always easy getting a receipt from a knocking shop in Manchester, is it, Mart?<eos> No, it is not, Philip. But it did save me from having to fellate the client myself.<eos> Here you go, boyses.<eos> Winner. Winner. Winner.<eos> Nice meeting you, boyses.
Do your parents know you're hanging out in pubs?<eos> Yes, very funny.<eos> I'm clearly not a child.<eos> OK, that's us.<eos> Nice meeting you, boyses.
Yeah? Well I'll see your... and I'll raise you.<eos> Oh, I'm not going to fire you, mate, I've got something much, much worse in store for you.<eos> No, I'm going to be your mentor, I'll be Yoda to your Luke Skywalker.<eos> I see what's happened here. You've mistaken being a weird, ugly fella for being a Jedi Master.<eos> Are you two fucking imbeciles going to get off your arses and sell my bloody windows or do I need to sack you, too? !
That's not the quote, actually.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> You were right.<eos> I've let you all down.
She wanted to speak to someone about windows.<eos> On her lunch break?<eos> It certainly beats dragging the whole class down here during lesson time.<eos> Don't get fucking smart with me, Vincent.<eos> I've already had Boring Anne from next door take great fucking pleasure in telling me how she saw you two driving through town together.
Ape-hanger handle-bars and the old suicide clutch.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> Yeah, well, we're a bit short of cash so I had to sell my car... so, yeah, that's embarrassing.<eos> Come on. I'll drive you guys home.<eos> Or, better still, you drive you guys home and I'll take the Chopper.
I want my daughter to be able to look up to her father and know that her dreams are possible.<eos> Shinobi arrived ready to school the Beast... but the Beast was the one who taught Shinobi a lesson.<eos> Next up was Matias Chávez from Mexico.<eos> I'll defeat the Beast.<eos> I'll beat you!
Daddy said my room was a pig sty.<eos> Okay, we'll double back to that unnecessary and inaccurate slam on pigs, and I think daddy meant for you to clean your room.<eos> We can't have you cleaning our daughter's room.<eos> It just... it sends the wrong message.<eos> We get to review you guys, too, you know.
Don't move.<eos> I've been compromised.<eos> Okay, g-get in the house. Ow!<eos> Ooh! Bad idea! Ow!<eos> I was gonna take you to a farm! Ow!
Bye. You have been phone-fussing all night.<eos> Have you got something going on the side?<eos> What?<eos> Ahem!<eos> So, guys, uhhh, Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you.
And we all miss her.<eos> Hi, Chad.<eos> Hi, Jake. Hi, Esme.<eos> We... we...<eos> Pff, I haven't seen you since...
No, Sam, that is insane.<eos> - We don't have an apartment yet.<eos> - Too late, bed bought.<eos> Congratulations on your new bed.<eos> Also, let me and Jon take you guys out for dinner tonight.
It's kind of pathetic.<eos> You bought them a bed?<eos> Yes. What is the big deal? I buy beds for people every day.<eos> Yeah, with their money, not ours.<eos> I know you love your college friends, but when you see them, you all become bitches, all the sniping and showing off.
Does this include the friends and family discount?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Thank you. - Good luck.<eos> We will talk soon.<eos> - Let me know if you have any questions.
[Ethan] Look at this thing. It's like we're in a Black Mirror episode.<eos> - Stupid looking truck.<eos> - At least it has a roof.<eos> Look at how she's dressed, it's Black Mirror.<eos> Hi! It's so good to see you guys!
Yep.<eos> - It's working. - Okay.<eos> You guys are going to have a child.<eos> It might not be on your calendar, but it will be on the universe's calendar.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two alone now.
Cheers to that!<eos> - Well, thank you, Felix.<eos> - I like your attitude, Felix.<eos> - Yes, you're welcome.<eos> And I want everyone to know that after a long talk with Max last night, I have decided to go ahead and try to like you.
No one has ever thought to put a wolf on trial.<eos> And what do you think, Max?<eos> I think it should end with a... with a courtroom scene.<eos> I think you might be a little distracted on the personal front.<eos> I punked you guys.
And what do you think, Max?<eos> I think it should end with a... with a courtroom scene.<eos> I think you might be a little distracted on the personal front.<eos> I punked you guys.<eos> I punked you, that was a... the reverse punk, so...
Stop doing the thing!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - It's annoying.<eos> Guys, listen.<eos> Do you remember our performance at the Leverett Old Library?
Guys, listen.<eos> Do you remember our performance at the Leverett Old Library?<eos> Okay?<eos> The students complained because the laughter was so loud nobody could study.<eos> Do you remember that? That laughter?
How long have you known about us?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> This is not your life.<eos> Why do I care so much?<eos> It's because I love you guys.
All right, last question.<eos> Have any famous dogs stayed there?<eos> Maybe that dog from The Artist might have stayed there once.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, guys, a table just opened up if you want to grab it.
I'm sorry. ‐ Calm down, calm down.<eos> Hi. I know it's late.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sarah told me you were thinking of leaving.<eos> She's making arrangements for you to go on retreat.
All we can do is pray for him.<eos> And, as Bill said, don't forget the amazing work we're doing here and at the city center, the work we tried to do in Clarksville.<eos> It's always an uphill battle when you take on "big business," but we took on a fight no one else was brave enough to.<eos> And Hawk even got thrown in handcuffs.<eos> I tell you, honestly, I...
Your licence. Unn's and Ravn's too.<eos> - I could be imprisoned... - That's what you're afraid of!<eos> After everything she's done, you're worried about a law suit?<eos> You deny her the only hope left.<eos> It's safer for you if she just dies! Put this on record.
Police spokespersons are very tight-lipped about...<eos> Fuck.<eos> I would like to thank Odd and Signe, Vilma's parents, for arranging this lovely memorial service.<eos> Apologies to those who have tried to contact me these last 6 months.<eos> For having been of so very little help to all of you.
What I want is for you to get out of my huntin' cabin.<eos> Well, that's the thing, Dad.<eos> It's not your huntin' cabin anymore, it's Mom's.<eos> So if anybody's gettin' out of here, it's gonna be you, neighbor.<eos> Look, why don't you both just agree to stay out of each other's way?
Why didn't you tell us?<eos> There's no upside to it.<eos> Gallo, we live in fear every day.<eos> You know, five miles over the speed limit, and it could ruin our life.<eos> Why would I wanna put that on you, too?
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. Something I need to talk to you about...<eos> Mom, I'll take it from here.<eos> Rooster, your drinking has affected me and...<eos> That talk is coming, but not today.<eos> Look, when you guys were little, if I bought one of you a toy, I had to get the other one a toy.
Yeah, I understand.<eos> Kids don't come cheap, Colt.<eos> When your mother got pregnant, we had to sit down, work out a real strict budget.<eos> You know we used to have Broncos seats?<eos> We gave those up for you and Rooster.
No, no, n-not all men, okay?<eos> We... we just talked to Rainer, and, um, that wasn't a date.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - [Shatters] Okay, why did you break that?<eos> 'Cause now I'm mad at you!
I know of Brynjar.<eos> Well, I am Guthred, I'm king of Cumberland.<eos> Lord... forgive me.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> If you are here to join me, there's nothing to forgive.
No, no, no!<eos> If you are here to join me, there's nothing to forgive.<eos> Brynjar's not with you?<eos> My lord is an old man now.<eos> He sends you here, why?
Please.<eos> Are you a Christian?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I would sit here to please the abbot, but... now I find there's... there's peace here.<eos> I am disturbing you.
I have my own mind.<eos> The abbot Eadred dreamt my brother to be king, but it was not his idea to offer a ransom. It was not his idea that we should go to Alfred for silver.<eos> It was you?<eos> It was.<eos> That all said, without you, Lord, my brother would not be free.
You might not know this, but... in your absence, all Danes and Northmen in Eoferwic have either been killed or fled.<eos> Eoferwic will be mine.<eos> There will be no fight... none.<eos> Unless it's with Sigefrid and Erik.<eos> I will fight you... and I will win.
No!<eos> I do not see that.<eos> I am indebted to Uhtred.<eos> Lord, we are all in his debt.<eos> But in helping to free you, did he not also act for himself?
Yes, but you cannot be a friend to all men.<eos> There are times, Lord, when you must be ruthless.<eos> You speak of Sigefrid and Erik. I do.<eos> They should have been dispatched to Corpse Hall.<eos> Now they think you're weak.
There are times, Lord, when you must be ruthless.<eos> You speak of Sigefrid and Erik. I do.<eos> They should have been dispatched to Corpse Hall.<eos> Now they think you're weak.<eos> Men must fear you.
Guthred! Guthred, whatever your plans, change them.<eos> You are to be sold.<eos> We're to be sold?<eos> ! Why?<eos> Lord, we are your army! We saved you!
Yes.<eos> Ragnar is a hostage!<eos> And a man of his word.<eos> Could he not remain a hostage whilst outside of Winchester?<eos> Earl Ragnar. I have a task for you.
Father, I want to fight with you.<eos> As do I.<eos> And I won't risk the lives of either of you.<eos> You're the future.<eos> My duty is to protect you. Go to bed.
Quickly!<eos> Come!<eos> Quickly!<eos> From the fury of the Northmen, Oh Lord, deliver us!<eos> May God, in his mercy, bless and keep you.
The scary thing is, that's what got her killed.<eos> If Sandra was white, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.<eos> - Yeah, you got that right.<eos> - Yep.<eos> That's why I keep telling y'all, if the police pull you over, just nod your head and shut the fuck up.

Yeah, but did you really think this scenario through?<eos> I mean, what was gonna happen?<eos> She was gonna break up with Pino?<eos> Move to New York?<eos> I mean, that's so much pressure for both of you guys.
All right. -Look at this. -Hi, how are you guys?<eos> -Hello, future guys.<eos> -Hope you're well. -Yeah. [Dev] Um, we just wanted to make this video to remind you of, um, the really fun night we had.<eos> And I hope you guys are happy. Yeah.<eos> Maybe you're watching this in different places or maybe you're together, who knows, um...
Let's hurry up.<eos> I've got some lovely sweets in my carriage for the ride.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Uh... hello, young masters.<eos> I've been sent to take you home.
You're overexcited.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I don't think I've ever been so excited in my whole life.<eos> Oh... my hands are shaking.<eos> With this pen I take you... Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert to be my family forever. To call you mine... and to be yours.
Are you just really sad she can't breastfeed you anymore, is that it?<eos> Whoever would have thought that you two were brothers?<eos> To what do we owe the honor of your visit?<eos> I wanted to see my family.<eos> I also wanted to warn you.
So help me God.<eos> And so, let me remove from you the sacred emblems and signs of your kingship.<eos> I give this holy scepter into your hands, Prince Aethelwulf.<eos> And with this ancient crown, I do make thee king over all those places and kingdoms once ruled by your father, but now by you instead.<eos> In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I crown you King Aethelwulf.

- Yes, yes! Go, go!<eos> Go, go!<eos> And farewell, Bishop Edmund.<eos> My dear vintner.<eos> May God bless you and keep you.
Besides, the cellars are still stocked with some of the finest wines in Christendom.<eos> - Mmm. - Am I supposed to leave them to the pagans?<eos> Who don't know the difference between one grape and another?<eos> Let's go!<eos> May God be with you all!
But... Now the tables have turned.<eos> We can make a new deal.<eos> What are you proposing?<eos> Well, as you say, it's only a matter of time before you are driven away from here.<eos> Without any legal right to English lands, you have no hope of staying.
And where they take me, I shall go.<eos> Take care, Bjorn.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Allmyfuture lies with Ragnar.<eos> Theonlyperson you truly care for... Is yourself.
Unfortunately, I will not be here to see this new settlement grow and thrive.<eos> My fate will take me elsewhere.<eos> I always knew I had to return to explore the Mediterranean Sea.<eos> And now I feel free to follow my destiny.<eos> But, my brothers will be here for you.
She'll learn to like it, and that's that.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> Anne?<eos> Anne?<eos> I'm sure you're both wondering how the school day went.
Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.<eos> Good afternoon, Diana.<eos> This is Miss Ruby Gillis.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello. What brings you both by?
- However do you know that?<eos> - It was Anne! She did it!<eos> The Fire Manual in the orphanage.<eos> There wasn't much else to read.<eos> And we thank thee, O Lord, for your mercy. And of some have compassion making a difference, others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hastening even the garments, spotted by the flesh, now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,
It's alright.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure no one will think you're my friend.<eos> I reckon we should be off.<eos> Now, I'd like the two of you to go upstairs to bed for a few hours.
I don't like these budget cuts any more than you do, but I want you to know I'm in this with you.<eos> I've cut my expenses.<eos> All the execs are flying coach.<eos> But I do want you to feel like you have a voice in this.<eos> So, not only is my office door always open to you, I've actually had it removed.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Hey!<eos> I will kill you!
Maybe I'll move the party to Monday. Oh!<eos> I'm free Monday.<eos> Let's talk later.<eos> No, please.<eos> I never meant to betray you.
What time is it?<eos> Bell rings in two hours.<eos> There must be at least a dozen men between here and the school.<eos> But thanks to our misspent youth, I can get in and out via the basement, no problem.<eos> When we do this, they are going to come down on you hard.
You look like corpses.<eos> You are corpses to us.<eos> Your world is ending.<eos> You can do nothing.<eos> But we can save you.
Your world is ending.<eos> You can do nothing.<eos> But we can save you.<eos> Save us, then.<eos> To save you, we must be asked.
But we can save you.<eos> Save us, then.<eos> To save you, we must be asked.<eos> Then what?<eos> We will protect you.
Do you have power?<eos> Well, right now, we're representing the three biggest armies on the planet, so I guess we do.<eos> Does power consent?<eos> We consent.<eos> If your consent is impure, it will kill you.
I'm sorry, Michael, but that's my wife that I put into the simulation, and I'm not just gonna sit here and let myself get cucked by the likes of you!<eos> Get him!<eos> Ow! Oh, baby, it is so hot watching you beat up Michael Bolton.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah. I'm just gonna leave you to it.
Thanks, Michael.<eos> I want to thank everyone in Hollywood.<eos> I want to thank show business in general.<eos> It's just great.<eos> I love you.
And now one of you has betrayed her and stolen something from her... a key.<eos> Return it now, and you'll face only my wrath, and not hers.<eos> No one?<eos> Then I have no choice.<eos> With just a bit of magic, I can turn you vermin into... well... vermin.
I mean, like--<eos> It's always something with her.<eos> Reggie, I know it sucks to want something from someone they're not willing to give you... but you got to let it go.<eos> Trust me.<eos> They're just gonna drown you out out here.
-What the fuck is this?<eos> -Taking a stand.<eos> You're stomping on an already marginalized--<eos> Cut the shit, Sam!<eos> So a few dumb kids offended you by accident.
It's the cut of them. That's what makes 'em sexy.<eos> Three tickets.<eos> Dog off the leash, without a collar, no license.<eos> Yeah, so much for fraternal brotherhood of police.<eos> So let me ask you guys a question.
-[both scream] Welcome to my village.<eos> Here, all are safe and warm.<eos> [both scream] Please, do not startle our guests.<eos> I am Florona.<eos> The almighty Queen Luxia, keeper of our land, would love to meet with you.
You can't remember because you were under her control.<eos> Our theory is, the queen controls minds by using her voice to strike certain head switches in your ear pan.<eos> And her magnetic stare locks on to your eye-to-brain pathway plug.<eos> Plus, her mind-control sonar is always broadcasting through the waters.<eos> Bong! She trains her people to use hypnotic movements to lull you under her control.
Didn't you see how he stole the Black Lion right out from Shiro?<eos> Or that he could do all that cool stuff with his bayard?<eos> Shiro's bayard? You know, the black one?<eos> [Shiro] Why didn't you just tell us the truth about Zarkon?<eos> I wanted to protect you from the dark history of the paladins so that you would have a chance to bond with your lions on your own.
This is the Galra who set me free.<eos> You've come.<eos> [Shiro] I don't think this is necessary.<eos> I will not have some quiznak-ing Galra soldier on the bridge of my ship!<eos> If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
It's another one of Zarkon's robot... beast... ro-beasts!<eos> -We have to get back to the ship.<eos> -Shiro, wait.<eos> These are instructions on how to reach the Blade of Marmora headquarters.<eos> Before you go there, find out how Zarkon is tracking you.
I'm going to take it down from the inside!<eos> [Shiro] Ulaz, no!<eos> Let us handle this!<eos> Voltron is too valuable.<eos> The universe needs you.
You don't really think Ulaz gave us up?<eos> After he sacrificed himself?<eos> Yeah! Maybe Zarkon found out about this place on his own.<eos> He's probably been searching for the Blade of Marmora.<eos> It's clear the loss of Ulaz has caused you great concern, but, regardless of how Zarkon located us, we cannot stay here any longer. It isn't safe.
[sobbing] She loves you!<eos> King Lubos?<eos> Yes? Who are you?<eos> The jesters I requested?<eos> Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?
Yes? Who are you?<eos> The jesters I requested?<eos> Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?<eos> You could have just said, "No, thanks."<eos> Looks like someone came to rescue you, Lubos.
The Galra could destroy us!<eos> So, you helped enslave your people to build some super weapon?<eos> Don't make me the bad guy!<eos> He forced me to do it!<eos> Did he force-feed you, too?
-Klanmüirl!<eos> Klanmüirl!<eos> Xznly Squiwl.<eos> Oh, quiznak.<eos> What are you doing here? You should be resting.
[Lance] In English, please?<eos> In order to test a hypothesis...<eos> -I said English! -[groans]<eos> Never mind!<eos> Pidge is right. If Zarkon finds you despite my absence, we will know with total certainty that we are not the ones he is tracking.
If Zarkon does find us, I can pilot us to safety.<eos> We're in wide-open space with plenty of room to maneuver.<eos> Plus, we'd be able to outrun him. Pidge added that booster rocket.<eos> That thing's still on there?<eos> -We need both of you back here now! -[all screaming]
Zarkon is definitely not tracking us through either of you.<eos> - He's not?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because you're out there, and a Galra fleet just showed up here!<eos> We need you now!
Me too.<eos> We thought we were doing the right thing.<eos> But clearly you were correct, Shiro.<eos> We are always stronger together.<eos> At least we learned that Zarkon isn't tracking us through you two.
You!<eos> [giggling] Absolutely stunning!<eos> After we defeat Zarkon, I'm taking you on the road! [mice squeaking]<eos> I'll just hold it.<eos> [giggling] Can I interest you in the latest Earth fashions?
Hold on a tick!<eos> No take-backs!<eos> Get back here!<eos> Doggone it! You better run!<eos> Don't let me catch you in my jurisdiction again, pirates!
You sound worried. I was thinking of my father.<eos> He gave his life to try to keep Voltron out of Zarkon's hands and now we have a chance to defeat him.<eos> I... I don't want to fail.<eos> [Coran] You know...<eos> Princess, your father would be proud of you.
- [Allura] Paladins, are you there?<eos> - [Lance] Princess, what's happening?<eos> That monster that attacked us on the Balmera before has returned!<eos> - [all] What?<eos> - [squawks] [Allura] I need you back here immediately.
-[Yermuther] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. [upbeat music]<eos> Lillian.<eos> I need you, Lillian.<eos> Lillian!<eos> Oh, well, I see you finally found the trash-picked baby monitor I hid in here to listen to you and Kimmy.
I'm sorry, but the fountain isn't real.<eos> He deceived you.<eos> I know that's really hard to hear, 'cause he deceived me too.<eos> My family, scientists, governments, military, all over the world.<eos> He used you all.
-Uh, hang on, toots.<eos> I'm not looking for a whole to-do here.<eos> Yes, you are. Trust me. I know this world.<eos> Don't you want to impress Artie's children?<eos> You could be spending a lot of time with them in court after he dies.
I just mean he keeps his private life private.<eos> Saint Paul says, "Love does no harm to a neighbor."<eos> Hold up.<eos> Miss Clara, are you trying to set me up with Reuben?<eos> I just thought the two of you could get together sometime and... I don't know... touch butts?
Mom, why?<eos> Because we're above it all now.<eos> Listen to Mommy.<eos> [Clara] This morning's reading is from Saint James.<eos> "Humble yourself, and God will give you grace.
Your childhood days are over.<eos> Guillermo, come back here!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't run away from your mother.<eos> Life is going to tear you apart soon enough.
- I said love and I meant it.<eos> It's Christmas Eve and I'm so happy.'<eos> *THE ROYALS* Season 03 Episode 06 "More Than Kin and Less Than Kind" Ho, ho, ho!<eos> - Hell of a run. - Hey.<eos> Didn't see you there.
Viewership is down almost 10%, ad revenue is falling, and merchandise sales are off.<eos> The number-one-selling jersey last year was Colin Kaepernick, and he's a damn anthem-kneeler.<eos> Americans don't kneel.<eos> Come over here and try to bend this!<eos> You people don't care about anything.
So, people in your twenties, enjoy your twenties.<eos> It's great.<eos> You're so far from death.<eos> But dating in your twenties is the best part.<eos> You don't know who you are, so you think anyone would be a good match for you.
One time, I took my girlfriend to dinner to a fancy restaurant.<eos> I forgot to pull the chair out for her at the table.<eos> She's, like, "You're not ready to be a father." What?<eos> She was right, but how'd she know?<eos> Women, you think however we treat you in one scenario, that's how we'll treat you in every scenario.
Because a couple of weeks ago, I'm watching TV with my girl.<eos> I absentmindedly get up, go to the kitchen, get some chips, come back, sit down.<eos> As my butt hits the couch, I realize I didn't ask if she wanted anything.<eos> And I can feel the nuclear reactor starting.<eos> So, women, if you don't feel safe or protected or thought of, your brains go to the worst-case scenario fucking immediately.
And then, finally, there's...<eos> There's doggy style.<eos> Here's something you might not know about doggy style:<eos> Sometimes we'll be back there and your legs are too close together, so you're too high for us.<eos> We have to take your legs, pull them apart and lower you like a tripod.
We're dealing with a bear, Yolanda.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Salvador, everyone knows it's not a bear.<eos> When do we get the truth?<eos> My husband would not lie to you.
But you all knew S didn't go anywhere without a fight.<eos> And that fight was for all of us.<eos> A people, a network, her family.<eos> ♪ I'll gently rise and I'll softly call ♪<eos> ♪ Good night and joy be with you all ♪
Right, Scottie?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Um, out.<eos> I thought we were all heading over to Felix's together.<eos> I'll catch you guys later, okay?
If I turn her down, I might not get a second chance.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> Always.<eos> Hello, olá, and Eoh, wasseo, gamers and gamerettes.<eos> It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City - with your daily dose of... - knowledge.
How do you plan on explaining what's been going on?<eos> The press have been calling me.<eos> Of course I haven't said anything.<eos> I wanted to talk to you first.<eos> But you may need the hospital to back you up.
- Leif?<eos> - Hi!<eos> This is my brother Leif.<eos> He works for the city council.<eos> I've prepared a safe place for you.
We got a new problem.<eos> Your old selves are back.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You mean that we've returned from the church?<eos> Yes, and if you come out of the ship now, they'll see you and wreck time itself.
We won't be time jumping together.<eos> You're not coming with us.<eos> This has always been a one-way ticket for us.<eos> Your team has to get the Spear of Destiny away from here.<eos> We won't fail you guys.
My parents, the Octomom.<eos> Also, I understand babies be havin' babies.<eos> Oh, heavens.<eos> I should let the babysitter go.<eos> But when she's in a better mood, I really want you to meet her, hmm?
Then why are you telling people that I'm going to go there and buying me shirts?<eos> Because I think you're amazing, and I think you're gonna get in anyway.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm scared because I don't want to leave you guys and Evan and my team.
We were close. After we graduated, I stayed in New York, he went home.<eos> All these years later, I'm me, and he's the head of Venezuelan intelligence.<eos> Gephardt approached me three years ago.<eos> Said he wanted some files from Alberto.<eos> I said, "Okay, I'll put you in touch."
Okay, I want you to consider the problem of time-- what's your relationship to it.<eos> Right? A piece of art is always a relic of the artist's past-- an idea, a thought, an impulse that by the very nature--<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> of time itself is fleeting.<eos> So just silently right now, I want you to just take in this place.
And if I see a cell phone, I will smash it.<eos> Sorry. It was me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your first assignment,<eos> I want you to look around the space and allow yourself to naturally gravitate to a piece of art.
That's much better.<eos> You know what? If you're hurt, take it out on him, not me.<eos> I've got nothing to do with this.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We could hear you from the hallway.
[Carlota] Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You didn't think twice about lying to me.<eos> [Miguel] You're scolding me for that?<eos> Normally, the best defense is a good offense, but not this time.<eos> My being there was the least of it! You were kissing!
-Yes, so much fun.<eos> -Don't worry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Anyway, we were saying good night, weren't we? [Alba] Yeah.<eos> I like that you're getting along, but maybe get along at a decent hour.
Yes, at least while I get my life in order. [sighs]<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -It was Lidia who did everything.<eos> [Ángeles] Thank you, all of you.<eos> Thanks to you, I was able to make the decision to leave Mario and start over again.
Well, it would be an understatement to say it was an incredible inaugural season of Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Terry and I have almost lost our voices, and if you guys think you have what it takes out there, well, I suggest you start training right now.<eos> The Beast is still undefeated, Charissa, and he'll still be waiting for his next challenger. Whoo!<eos> Congratulations to Felipe Camargo, our first ever Beastmaster.<eos> - We will see you next time, everyone.
I finally got to see the New Kids when I was 33.<eos> They reunited, right?<eos> My boyfriend at the time went to the concert with me because he wanted to see me lose it.<eos> He's like, "Hey, are you gonna be okay?" I'm like, "Dude, I'm 33. I got this, bro."<eos> "I love you!

You know what pisses me off?<eos> It's great for kids.<eos> It sucks for me.<eos> It pisses me off that kids will never know the pain of having to save up money to buy a whole record album or CD for one song.<eos> Do you remember when you had to do chores?
San Antonio, I just wanna say thank you so much for coming tonight.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> It's a very special night for me.<eos> I'm glad you guys came out.<eos> Most of you might remember, I had a show on TV called Cristela.
Give me his Social Security number and his date of birth.<eos> My cousin works for Reiden.<eos> She may be able to track him down, get him out.<eos> We'll send it to your phone.<eos> I'll call you, soon as I know something.
What?<eos> You.<eos> Given the circumstances, I think I'll let it slide.<eos> Maybe these will help.<eos> Um, I'll leave you two alone.
"Well, my good man, I am here to tell you that India is now under the British Empire."<eos> "And I'm glad that I can tell you that India is exactly where it was yesterday."<eos> "No, no.<eos> I feel you're not understanding what I'm saying.<eos> I'm letting you know that we are here to colonize you by order of the Queen."
You realize vaginas can start revolutions and end wars.<eos> You realize, even on a physical level, the vagina is one of the strongest things that have ever existed.<eos> Virtually indestructible.<eos> Many men in this room... Many, many men in this room have tales of how they once defeated the pussy.<eos> Let me tell you now, they have not.
Thank you very much."<eos> And the Russians were like, "What did you say?"<eos> "The truth is, you know, the Olympics is for everybody.<eos> You can come when you want to.<eos> I mean, who am I to ban you, ja?
Walking through the streets, men catcalling.<eos> In the office place, people groping.<eos> Feeling like they have ownership of the female form.<eos> I know we can't solve this tomorrow, but if you learn the Russian accent, half of those problems would disappear.<eos> The next time you're in a compromising position, you're at a bar, waiting for your drink. That creepy guy comes up and starts grinding on you from behind.
I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.<eos> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.
Thanks.<eos> Everyone, this is Rebecca.<eos> Hey.<eos> She's younger and far more attractive than he is.<eos> They're copying you two.
Stop!<eos> Zuru, get away from him!<eos> Sutezo, wait!<eos> Why are you all showing your faces?<eos> You'll be spotted by the watchtower!
Yes, even food, anything you like.<eos> Really?<eos> Killy.<eos> To be honest, we don't even understand half of what she's saying.<eos> But... we'd like to take a chance with you, and her.
- Take as many spears as you can!<eos> - We need one more person!<eos> - Leave some to defend the village.<eos> - Do we have enough helmettals?<eos> Stop stalling, all of you.
Right.<eos> - Take care of Pops. - I will.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> I'm going first!<eos> You guys, hurry up!
Tell it to Bess Burrows.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> No?<eos> You and Mayer humiliate your wives.<eos> You fuck the women who work for you, and pretend they want you, and then cower to the Nazis.
We make nothing. We shoot nothing.<eos> We use their own stuff as propaganda for ourselves.<eos> Let them see. Let them see the guys. Let them see these guys."<eos> [shouting in German] [man] "Stop thinking and follow me," cried Hitler.<eos> "I will make you masters of the world."
Take out your machete.<eos> I'm off the script?<eos> Afraid so.<eos> Dell? E.B., thanks for your fine work.<eos> We'll find something else for you.
Are you Raymond Moody?<eos> Yeah, speaking.<eos> What took you so long to get to the door today, Raymond?<eos> You caught me in the can.<eos> How can I help you guys?
You, me, Zukor, Cohn, pain in the ass Warner Brothers.<eos> We're building something, together.<eos> And I'm sure, if I were in your shoes and you were in my shoes, you'd be generous with me.<eos> It was an act of real friendship.<eos> Irving here thinks I should tell the two of you to go jump in the lake, and as we know, boy geniuses are never wrong.
Well, then, yes to Bess Burrows.<eos> Uh, Pat, the other titles.<eos> Yes. Her Royal Shyness, very funny comedy we developed for Minna.<eos> I don't have a money tree out back.<eos> Why don't you just take your three yeses, you say thank you, and if they're hits, we'll talk.
I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather.<eos> We sat ringside, okay?<eos> That...<eos> Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that's what that was.<eos> But if you know what's popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes.
"That nigga did that shit.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> I could feel like... murder in the room."<eos> Well, you young heads missed that shit.<eos> You're all too young. You don't remember that.
That's right. So, a guy your age doesn't really know how he feels.<eos> Are you pro-choice?<eos> Are you anti-consequences?<eos> What does it all really mean?<eos> It's easier not to care for you.
What the fuck is wrong with her?<eos> What does she think?<eos> Does she think that I don't know that rape is wrong?<eos> Does she think that maybe I don't have empathy for Bill Cosby's alleged victims?<eos> And I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that technically these are all still allegations.
Here he was again.<eos> The Juice.<eos> He had his camera ready.<eos> He was like, "Dave, Chris.<eos> Good to see you guys.
And lunch. For school.<eos> What time is school?<eos> Never.<eos> Darla...<eos> I told your brother I would look out for you.
It had to be a hit.<eos> Now... it's failing.<eos> I failed.<eos> Pat.<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna drag you down with me.
They're not real life.<eos> They're better than real life.<eos> Darla, Nathan.<eos> He's awake.<eos> And he wants to see you two.
- Right. - Unbelievable.<eos> This is the woman behind Devon's big inspiration.<eos> Oh, she's coming over here.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - She heard you? - Oh, boy. - Hey.
What the fuck happened?<eos> Uh, rehearsal got, you know, intense.<eos> - We were kind of just like...<eos> - [sigh] ...talking about, like, reading these letters and talking about cunt-red stuff, and Toby just kind of...<eos> You said you were just going to have a meeting, sit around and talk.
Not alone. You're not going to go there alone.<eos> - Okay. - No. No alone.<eos> No, no, no. I can't...<eos> I... No.<eos> No. it's got to be somewhere... it's got to be somewhere public, you know, so I can be... like, watch you.
Oh, good.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad. It sounds like a really fun afternoon.<eos> Did you put out snacks?<eos> Did you... Were you a good host?<eos> 'Cause you guys must have gotten famished after all that fuckin' horse trading.
[chuckle] Tell me what?<eos> Oh, I'm your abortion.<eos> And I'm your miscarriage.<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> I always thought you would be girls.
You said next time you saw me...<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You promised.<eos> I should've known you two couldn't stay away.<eos> I heard you all the way down the street.
I wouldn't count her out if I were you.<eos> She's survived harder things than this.<eos> Before she dies, I'll tell her she's lucky to have you as a brother.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> After she guts you and before you die, you tell her I was the lucky one.
Believe me, I know exactly where I stand on the Spencer Reid hot or not list.<eos> I told her to pretend to be Maeve.<eos> Maeve Donovan.<eos> The love of your life.<eos> Who had her brains blown out right in front of you before you two could even kiss.
Dance with me.<eos> You guys got this up?<eos> Streaming now.<eos> Ok, uh, listen, you're gonna hear a lot of weird stuff, like Spence saying he is the father of Cat's baby.<eos> Don't let that distract you.
All right, the dress is coming off. [chuckles]<eos> There will always be people who wanna push your limits.<eos> It's actually a turn on to a lot of people to see you uncomfortable.<eos> And I had to learn that the hard way.<eos> [Bailey] Today, you guys will kind of get a feel for... what these producers can see you, like, really fitting into.
-[Renae] Hi.<eos> [Renae] Bonnie? [Bonnie] Mmm-hmm.<eos> [Eva] I'm Eva.<eos> Hi, Eva.<eos> Hi, Bailey. Girls, why don't you sit over here.
[Renae] Bonnie? [Bonnie] Mmm-hmm.<eos> [Eva] I'm Eva.<eos> Hi, Eva.<eos> Hi, Bailey. Girls, why don't you sit over here.<eos> -So I can get a better look at you.
-It's companionship.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna say if someone's paying for your time...<eos> You don't have to call it escorting. [chuckles]<eos> [Bailey] I'm just saying that most people do.<eos> And John kinda trusted me to steer you guys in the right direction.
To all Americans tonight, I make this promise.<eos> We will make America safe again.<eos> We will make America strong again.<eos> And we will make America great again!<eos> God bless you and good night!
We will make America safe again.<eos> We will make America strong again.<eos> And we will make America great again!<eos> God bless you and good night!<eos> I love you.
Evan.<eos> Mr. Gardner.<eos> Dad.<eos> Why are we all saying each other's names?<eos> Guys, why don't you go sit on the sofa and talk amongst yourselves?
Heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune?<eos> Really?<eos> Schmancy. Well, then, seeing as how that's the case, are the keys in the Rolls?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're-- Wait. Why? Because I'm going to drive it, and Sergeant Poovey is going to drive you in my car.
And you know, Monroe never makes a movie from start to finish with just one writer.<eos> Oh, God. That mean I have to start looking over my shoulder?<eos> It is hell working for a guy who's smarter than his writers.<eos> Monroe doesn't think he's smarter than we are, he just thinks our brains belong to him, because only he knows how to use them.<eos> I would be lost without you.
He was so cute with those curls! - Didn't you hook up with him?<eos> - Huh? You have to take the chance once it's there!<eos> You went around both, in the front and in the back. What were you doing on Friday? Nothing, we just...<eos> You really enjoyed yourself, at least!<eos> - We texted you, though. - Yeah.
Could you tell?<eos> I heard it.<eos> What did you do with Yousef the other day?<eos> With Yousef?<eos> Yeah, mom told me she saw you together.
- I'm not so hungry.<eos> - Do you have carrots?<eos> -Yes.<eos> We'll take it.<eos> Serve you.
And if the fates are kind, in a couple of days, he and I will be holding an Oscar in our hands.<eos> Sorry, Joe.<eos> Today, all that Monroe holds is the hand of Kathleen Moore.<eos> And that makes this a family affair, because Kathleen Moore is the future of our studio.<eos> Rose, Celia and I love you both.
You can say that again.<eos> Thank you for this evening and... and for being like a family to me.<eos> I love you all, very much.<eos> As for my wife-to-be... she knows how I feel about her.<eos> So, instead of boring you with talk, I'll thank you all for celebrating with us and leave you to enjoy this wonderful party. Please.
I love you all, very much.<eos> As for my wife-to-be... she knows how I feel about her.<eos> So, instead of boring you with talk, I'll thank you all for celebrating with us and leave you to enjoy this wonderful party. Please.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Got something for you.
Are you a ghost?<eos> I don't think so, but it would be really cool.<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?<eos> Oh, uh, I saw you guys come outside, and I-- I wanted to make sure you were all right.
But I don't get it.<eos> Why not just come back and chat with us?<eos> Why create the big mystery?<eos> Because I knew, with a little bit of encouragement, you'd realize Rae wasn't preventing you from doing what you loved.<eos> Thinking creatively and not backing down from a challenge, like solving a mystery, is going to serve you well for the rest of your lives.
Five days until the start of the race, and in recent years in the LMP1 top category,<eos> But with Porsche, Toyota, and now Nissan also challenging for the top step on the podium, this year there's simply no room for error.<eos> We're at Le Mans, despite everyone's theories, we've got three cars.<eos> We're looking pretty smart at the moment, but of course, we don't know how it's going to go until the cars roll out of the end of the pit lane.<eos> Earlier on, the head of Audi motorsport, Dr. Ulrich, came past, and said," it's good to see that you're here."
You never know what impact it's had.<eos> It's kind of changed him a little bit I think.<eos> He said, every time we leave the house, we've got to say I love you.<eos> On a phone call, on a, on a message. No matter where we are.<eos> No matter where we are in the world, I love you.
Fine.<eos> I know.<eos> I am now.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> It just makes me wanna cry, the two of you getting together.
Oh! My party shoes.<eos> Did someone say party?<eos> Gramps!<eos> Zoe!<eos> But how wonderful to see you!
Especially when people are being mean.<eos> I don't think I get your meaning.<eos> No, I think you do.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Girls, would you mind staying away from my horse?
I know it's not your fault, but... if you can hear... they don't know what they're doing.<eos> Be better than them.<eos> Please!<eos> Are you Mr. Tepes?<eos> She talked about you.
Drinks?<eos> I should minister to the Archbishop.<eos> I fear he's not long for this world, to be honest.<eos> Off to heaven with him, eh?<eos> I suppose that's the ultimate goal for you priests, serving God in His true house and all that.
Then we can catch up with the party and prove we can have a good time.<eos> Pardon me, my fellow carefree, fun-loving teens.<eos> Uh, we're looking for the Bingo Bash.<eos> The Bash is over, Daddy-O, we're splitting.<eos> You cats should split, too, if you know it's good for you.
Fine.<eos> But I'm watching you.<eos> Come on, Mitzi, what are you standing around for?<eos> We've got things to do.<eos> - It was nice meeting you.
I sure do.<eos> Daphne, you go investigate the pier.<eos> Talk to that Dwight Monkfish. See what you can find out.<eos> Shaggy and Scooby, according to my guidebook... Bingo Belle and Captain Bash's ship, the Salty Brick, is still docked in the harbor as a historical exhibit.<eos> Why don't you go check it out?
- Yeah, that.<eos> - Look, chum...<eos> - It's Chad.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Listen, if we did something to offend you, I'm sorry.
Scoob, what are you thinkin'?<eos> Hmm...<eos> Open concept.<eos> You took the words right out of my mouth!<eos> Try, if you will, to picture our vision.
[MUFFLED VOICES]<eos> [ROB MUFFLED] And yet, you're both rude.<eos> You're rude, ill-mannered kids.<eos> (LAURA) The way you've been treating those nice, young teens.<eos> We raised you better than that!
Pretty easy when you've been cracking poem-based clues as long as I have.<eos> Brenda, Tommie, will you take these hats over to the front of the ship?<eos> So the poem says, "Go on bow."<eos> The bow is what you call the front of a ship.<eos> Now, if you guys will tip the hats.
We've already had too many bad guys today as is.<eos> (ALL) Yay!<eos> I'm sorry I ever doubted you.<eos> Ah, who could blame you, I'm very unlikable.<eos> Fred, Velma, I think I speak for everybody here when I say, we want to name the two of you this year's Captains of the Bash.
And then back up to about the middle of my back.<eos> And, um... Isn't that funny that that's funny?<eos> And it's a lie.<eos> I did my arms, too. But, um...<eos> I can't lie to you guys.
That's never gotten a laugh before.<eos> Well, you didn't have to undo it.<eos> Keep laughing.<eos> So, um... The truth is, I am... I have gotten into squirrels.<eos> And now I'm gonna get you into squirrels.
You were so... You had so much empathy.<eos> You were so worried.<eos> You could hear a pin drop in this story.<eos> It was so nice.<eos> And, you know, I understand.
The app that I do Twitter with, I can, um...<eos> I just sounded so old saying that.<eos> The app that I do Twitter with, it's like I can schedule tweets.<eos> Which I like, because sometimes I'll think of two, three tweets.<eos> I don't wanna spoil you.
Good point. Mm-hmm.<eos> Anyway... How have you been, Dad?<eos> How's your time-out going?<eos> It's been pretty quiet.<eos> A little too quiet without you guys.
Okay...<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Totally in love with her.<eos> She has no idea.<eos> And as riding is very hungry work, you'll be very pleased to hear that our barbecue is up and running.
I'm sure Marcus could find you a helmet.<eos> As if.<eos> Think of the hat hair.<eos> Everyone ready?<eos> We're waiting for you.
Welcome to my world.<eos> Looking for anything in particular?<eos> Yeah, a flashlight.<eos> For a sleepover.<eos> So, Mia invited both of you to her sleepover?
I wonder what happened to him.<eos> Who made him like this?<eos> Some horses are just born wild.<eos> Hey!<eos> I didn't realize it was you. What are you doing?
Looks like a race.<eos> Good guess, Einstein.<eos> Too right it's a race. I'm gonna show your mates that when it comes to horses and bikes, horses win every time.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Her horse will outpace you guys in a heartbeat.
Raven is valuable... isn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I used you, Zoe.<eos> I used you so you would train Raven, and he would go quietly.<eos> I betrayed you both.
[G.B.] Hold up.<eos> Centuries?<eos> What are they, vampires?<eos> G.B. The three of you are way too gullible.<eos> [sighs] Guys. Didn't I tell you to behave?
- [Katie] I know!<eos> I don't know what it is, but I think I'm finally ready for him.<eos> And I think, judging from the brief conversation that we just had, - he might be ready for me. So, we'll see!<eos> Now, let's go back to unpacking.<eos> Oh, guys, I wanted to take a moment to say that it's so great to have you all back.
He's driving on Fifth Avenue.<eos> He's driving south through Juárez.<eos> Follow him.<eos> Hey Cougar, we're almost up to where you're at.<eos> I can see you.
Trust me, you want to see my ID.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll take that gin and tonic now.<eos> Lime and soda. Best I can do.<eos> I saw you guys... you and my mom.
If she cared about us, she wouldn't have done it in the first place.<eos> I don't know about that, but I don't think it's so simple.<eos> What the hell do you know?<eos> Not much, really.<eos> But I know she really loves you two.
- Beth!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - You having fun?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I guess you're wondering why I invited you back to camp this weekend.
- Cut the crap.<eos> I pitched you a piece on the recent dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and instead you've assigned me a puff piece on dog treats.<eos> Look, we're not 50 Minutes. We're local news, okay?<eos> How you guys doing?<eos> Wendy keeping you in good shape?
Oh, poodles!<eos> We're talking shop.<eos> Oh, poo!<eos> Well, do come join the fun when you're done.<eos> It was nice seeing you two.
What I'm trying, and failing, to say, is...<eos> Kathy, this is Gumpy.<eos> Ah, fuck!<eos> - You guys...<eos> What you're...
- ♪ Brontosaurus ♪ - ♪ Where did you go ♪<eos> - ♪ Stegosaurus ♪ - ♪ My friends, dinosaurs ♪<eos> ♪ Don't forget the pterodactyl ♪<eos> ♪ Why did you leave me On the verge of extinction ♪<eos> - ♪ Everybody's doinâ€™ the Dinosaur Stomp ♪ - ♪ I shed a tear for you ♪
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> -What's what supposed to mean? -You chortled.<eos> Just surprised you have a boyfriend, that's all.<eos> You seem fairly unlovable to me.<eos> -Fuck you, Logan! -Fuck yourself, Suze!
There's no magic out in the forest.<eos> It's just some crap they put in the pamphlets so that the parents can feel warm and fuzzy about sending their children away to sleepaway camp for eight weeks.<eos> 'Cause spirit doesn't pay the rent!<eos> And spirit doesn't put food in your belly, or a shirt on your back.<eos> And spirit doesn't help you from feeling lost... and unloved.
She's the mole.<eos> She's been the mole the whole time.<eos> I don't know what they're paying you, but this is madness.<eos> Thousands of lives are at stake.<eos> The only madness is you thinking I'm gonna let you anywhere near that nuke.
And good luck with the rest of the shoot.<eos> We can't thank you enough for helping to save this camp.<eos> You've done a good deed.<eos> We're in.<eos> Oh, man, I'm gonna miss slinging bull with you jack-wits.
- And this time it's forever.<eos> Me and Neil are gonna be together for the rest of our-<eos> - What the fuck is that?<eos> This is it, guys.<eos> I love you.
Mitch?<eos> Greg?<eos> Didn't you get shot?<eos> Guys, guys, wait for me!<eos> I love you! I love you, guys!
Some of us made tons of money.<eos> Beth, I'm talking about you.<eos> Well, I'm doing okay.<eos> Oh, all of us will be forever changed by this amazing camp reunion.<eos> And so I toast to all of you, and I toast to Camp Firewood.
I warned you.<eos> You can't say I didn't warn you.<eos> You did not listen to me, sir.<eos> Are you talking back to me?<eos> No, I'm merely talking to you.
But... it is appreciated.<eos> I am the elder of the Codrii Speakers.<eos> Thank you for your kindness and, I think, your restraint.<eos> You're welcome, Elder.<eos> Can I accompany you to your train?
I also know you gather hidden knowledge and have practitioners of magic knowledge in your tribes.<eos> A Belmont?<eos> I thought your family had vanished.<eos> If vanished is the polite way of saying exiled, hated, and burned out of the ancestral home, then...<eos> Then you know something of magic, and so you know that just because we found a story in our past, it doesn't mean it originated there.
If you want to put it that way.<eos> If I go and recover your kid's body, will you please leave?<eos> Wait outside the city. Give your aid to the survivors when the night horde finally just rips through this place.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> They're going to come for you soon.
Metal veins pumping hot liquid?<eos> Torches that light by themselves that exactly fit descriptions written by my great-grandfather.<eos> Descriptions of the inside of Dracula's castle.<eos> I don't know what's down there, but it's not a messiah.<eos> I'll leave you all to it.
From you?<eos> From the baby-eating freaks of nature who apparently raid Gresit every night.<eos> I'm here to save Gresit.<eos> And how do you intend to do that?<eos> I brought you here to answer some questions, not ask them.
She even married him.<eos> I see.<eos> And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.
By the way, you're all going to die.<eos> What?<eos> The current bishop of this place is...<eos> Well, he's beyond insane.<eos> Over the top and into new lands of just snake-fuckingly crazy, and convinced that the salvation of Gresit lays in you people being torn to pieces by a mob.
I don't think it's a Belmont thing, either.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You need to leave, and leave now.<eos> I don't think we can leave these people, not in their time of need!<eos> These people believe you're causing their time of need!
You are here to fight us?<eos> You're here to convince the people that nomad black magicians are good for Gresit, and it is the presence of men of God that brought the night hordes upon us?<eos> - You know...<eos> - Silence!<eos> Look at you.
What do you expect to achieve against us?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> So you're going to die for nothing?<eos> For people you don't know?<eos> I don't know any of you, but that doesn't matter, does it?
For people you don't know?<eos> I don't know any of you, but that doesn't matter, does it?<eos> My family, the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country.<eos> We do this thing for Wallachia and her people.<eos> We don't have to know you all.
We do this thing for Wallachia and her people.<eos> We don't have to know you all.<eos> We do it anyway.<eos> And it's not the dying that frightens us.<eos> It's never having stood up and fought for you.
1476.<eos> Perhaps a year, then.<eos> There.<eos> And on top of that, what kind of messiah creates mechanical death traps to buy himself an uninterrupted nap in a stone coffin?<eos> My defenses were not for you.
Lotor?<eos> Why is he not at his father's bedside?<eos> Zarkon needs no one by his bedside.<eos> Least of all, you.<eos> [Allura] It is our honor to have you all here together.
Shiro is gone.<eos> He was the Black Lion.<eos> And until we find him, there is no Voltron.<eos> The lions are still a substantial fighting force and this Castle is also a considerable weapon.<eos> The Blade of Marmora can lead you.
-According to whom?<eos> Your savior, Voltron?<eos> And where is your precious protector now? Gone.<eos> Leaving you with nothing but a hollow promise of freedom.<eos> And now you must answer for what you've done.
No. No way, I didn't--<eos> I'm just simply pointing out that more than half of the team are in new lions.<eos> Maybe now's not a great time to bite off more than we can chew.<eos> [Lance] You can blame our hot-headed leader for that one.<eos> First, you want me to lead, and then you complain about how I do it.
Hey, I already told her yelling at her lion wouldn't work.<eos> Didn't go over well. She yelled at me, too.<eos> Yeah, count me out.<eos> She scares me when she's under pressure.<eos> -I can hear you. -[all scream]
-No, keep going.<eos> -[Keith's voice breaking up] ...going.<eos> -[Hunk] What? All I heard was "going."<eos> Are we going back? Is anyone else getting this static?<eos> I'm losing visuals on you all.
We have a mission that's more important than any one of us.<eos> We need to find Lotor and stop him, and I plan on doing that right now.<eos> [Lance sighs] Come on, guys. We'd better stick together.<eos> Prince Lotor requires your assistance on Planet Thayserix.<eos> We expect you here immediately.
Now!<eos> Fire!<eos> Hello?<eos> Paladins, help!<eos> I am impressed that you're able to hide, but I will find you.
[Allura] Hailing Pidge and Hunk.<eos> Are you paladins looking for an exit?<eos> No way!<eos> You guys found us! [laughs]<eos> Actually, Allura found you.
Victory or death!<eos> The most important thing is for you to get eyes on that comet.<eos> Second is figuring out who we're dealing with.<eos> You!<eos> Lotor sent you to finish off what he started?
[Acxa] It is a Galra fighter.<eos> Let's invite our guest aboard.<eos> [grunts] No!<eos> [static] [female voice] Prince Lotor requires your assistance on planet Thayserix.<eos> We expect you here immediately.
I told you we should have eaten him.<eos> His leg is hurt.<eos> He can't be far.<eos> Let's split up. I'll check outside. You check the tunnels.<eos> I don't want to have to hurt you!
Sire, forgive me for this, but I know no other way.<eos> Your empire needs you.
Pull up a bench and join the feast!<eos> [Zarkon clears throat] You know that fraternizing with the servant class is not permitted.<eos> It erodes discipline.<eos> Well, perhaps a bit of discipline erosion would do you good, Zarkon.<eos> Something I will consider the next time you are surrounded by Lambonite scavengers.
I understand.<eos> It may take some doing.<eos> These are not regular ships to be chosen at a whim.<eos> You do not pick the beast.<eos> The beast will choose you.
Voltron.<eos> Voltron... It is the only way.<eos> [Zarkon] Alfor tried to warn me, but I would not listen.<eos> Now, my wife has fallen ill, and my planet is on the brink of collapse.<eos> So I must beg you, my trusted comrades, to join me on a most dangerous quest.
Not really, he doesn't come to these, they're not his "thing."<eos> Whose thing are they?<eos> It's not like we come here for the fun of it.<eos> No offense.<eos> I like you guys.
Anyway.<eos> Sam is... he had a good week, you know?<eos> But the thing is, at this bar, for the first time since, probably, Sam was diagnosed, I wasn't worried or scared.<eos> I was just having fun with a group of strangers who had nothing to do with autism.<eos> And, again, I love you guys.
Why don't you go back to Galilee?<eos> Take your tools and your women and your bewitched children, and just leave.<eos> Seven years is too long.<eos> We're done with you.<eos> We don't want you here.
It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> It's a hard thing you have to do.
It's a hard thing you have to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.
Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.
We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.<eos> The Lord lift up his countenance upon you!
Father! I found a cave.<eos> Travelers!<eos> We seek a family from Nazareth, with a boy of seven named Jesus bar Joseph.<eos> If you know such a family, and you know this child, then tell us<eos> and Rome will reward you.
There's 100 of us here. We could pick it clean all in one day.<eos> - Can we do that?<eos> Now, we pick it clean. We hide it away, we divide it amongst ourselves later on.<eos> Meanwhile, by the time they get down here, we done scattered.<eos> Yeah. - How's that sound to you?
That's fine, Ward.<eos> You leave any time you want.<eos> Save your farms. All you got to do is lay down your arms.<eos> You ain't being' disloyal. You're just bein' smart.<eos> Your mama don't need you dead.
I know y'all have your own home now. No.<eos> That's fine.<eos> You stay here with us.<eos> There's a little shack on the other side of the farm.<eos> We could fix it for you.
Gettin' chilly.<eos> Hmm.<eos> It is. Yeah.<eos> You ain't got to fill it out now.<eos> I'll fill it out for you.
Like hell you were!<eos> What was that?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.<eos> Are you trying to insult me?<eos> Here, in the shelter that I built that's keeping you alive?
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.<eos> There's a strength to him.<eos> Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.<eos> I've seen it all before.<eos> He reminds you of Kaecilius?
She does draw power from the dark dimension.<eos> Kaecilius.<eos> I came to you broken... Lost, in need.<eos> Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.<eos> I tried to protect you.
I tried to protect you.<eos> From the truth?<eos> From yourself.<eos> I have a new teacher now.<eos> Dormammu deceives you.
Beyond death.<eos> Beyond time...<eos> Strange.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Even strange has left you and surrendered to his power.
All right.<eos> Good gag.<eos> Hey, are you getting that?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Is everything a joke to you guys?
This world cannot be cleansed fast enough.<eos> Hi.<eos> Enjoy the show.<eos> Rock and roll.<eos> So, how did the two of you guys meet?
Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!<eos> We need to get up those aisles!<eos> All right, move, people!<eos> I need to get down that aisle!<eos> If you're not gonna move, you're gonna become part of this operation!
All right, heads up!<eos> Come on! Move me left!<eos> Watch the rings. Watch the rings.<eos> Okay, you sweaty freaks.<eos> I'm 'bout to save you from this ghost!
Charge the lines.<eos> Create the vortex.<eos> Break the barrier.<eos> Enjoy your fun, Ghostbusters.<eos> For soon, you shall bow down before me.
Hold on.<eos> Roll your window up.<eos> I'm watching you.<eos> You think they got genitals in there? Or is it more of a Ken doll situation?<eos> I'm watching you!
You think they got genitals in there? Or is it more of a Ken doll situation?<eos> I'm watching you!<eos> I'm gonna go with Ken doll situation.<eos> It's smooth.<eos> We're watching you!
Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.<eos> And the one in Chelsea?<eos> - Chelsea is at 10th Avenue and 18th.<eos> - 18th. 10th and 18th.<eos> What do those look like to you?
Thank you for everything you did.<eos> You saved us all.<eos> The mayor thanks you, of course.<eos> Privately, so don't tell anyone.<eos> Can I walk you out?
The mayor thanks you, of course.<eos> Privately, so don't tell anyone.<eos> Can I walk you out?<eos> Well, why don't you all go get some rest?<eos> These gentlemen here will get you out of here. Okay?
- Thanks for all you've done, ladies.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> I just have to say a couple things to the press.<eos> You know how that goes.<eos> So we just are gonna fake-arrest you now.
All right, let's go save this city and get our terrible receptionist back.<eos> We're not gonna find another one that pretty.<eos> Who's the flying beefcake?<eos> Hello.<eos> Dear brave men and women of the protection services industry, I would like to see you dance.
Dear brave men and women of the protection services industry, I would like to see you dance.<eos> Get it off.<eos> I can't.<eos> It won't work anymore.<eos> I control all of you.
Get out of here!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I think we should've gave him a heads up about what was going on out there, y'all.<eos> It's been a very long day.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?
- That's...<eos> Sweet, sweet Kev.<eos> The two are unrelated.<eos> More important question. When did you have time to get a sandwich?<eos> When I was looking for you guys, I looked in that deli over there.
But it cannot answer the essential question of what is our purpose here.<eos> And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.<eos> And to love is what you have shown me.<eos> I didn't think that I would ever really have a friend until I met Abby, and then I feel like I have a family of my own.<eos> And I love you.
No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I like it.<eos> Don't worry, Father.<eos> I ain't gonna shoot you.
Good to see you.<eos> Emir Abreu.<eos> - Hey, man. - What's up, my man?<eos> I've set up phone lines on the switchboard.<eos> - So, how did you two meet again?
All right.<eos> Out, out, out.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> Oh, oh, wait.<eos> You're all on administratively uncontrollable overtime, so I own you.
- Surprise.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Bob.<eos> Kathy.<eos> I'd like you to turn around and take a look at everyone that's gathered here today to celebrate your love.
Stand by.<eos> Arming device.<eos> - HARLEY:<eos> Who are you?<eos> - I don't know who you are.
(MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE)<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> This is Katana.<eos> She's got my back.<eos> She can cut all of you in half with one sword stroke, just like mowing the lawn.
Without Waller, you got nothing.<eos> (KILLER CROC GROWLS)<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I'm back!<eos> I missed you all so much.
I'm gonna draw out the big one.<eos> My boys will detonate the bomb underneath him.<eos> You know, we should get a drink sometime.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> I've been waiting for you all night.
What the hell?<eos> Grab her.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because the soldier led you?
ENCHANTRESS:<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because the soldier led you?<eos> And all for Waller.<eos> Why do you serve those who cage you?
Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air... to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.<eos> If your brainwaves slow, meaning you're about to pass out... then we'll turn up the O2.<eos> If your heart rate slows... meaning you're able to catch your breath... we'll turn it back down.<eos> And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.<eos> And I thought you guys were dicks before.
Is that you?<eos> Yeah, it's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse.<eos> I'm gonna wait out here, okay?<eos> It's a big house.<eos> It's funny that I only ever see two of you.
Mrs. McGrath, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, uh, yeah.<eos> Everything's just fine, Sofia.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Miles Edwards ordered you to kill Steel?
Let's eat 'em together.<eos> You know what? You take them.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Nah. We're not going anywhere, Jet.<eos> This whole thing will be over in a jiff. Hey, how about this? Why don't you and your boyfriend apologize to Big Rick here and then go jerk each other in the parking lot?
(SIGHS) Men, a few years ago... (SIGHS) I found the Lord Almighty.<eos> And, ever since then, my life has been completely different. Okay?<eos> He's got a plan for each and every one of us and, in his infinite wisdom, he makes no mistakes.<eos> You're right about that.<eos> I think the Lord put you here because he wants me to get something off my chest. He wants me to clear my conscience and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.
Can I get anybody, like, water or anything to drink? - Water or...<eos> - I'm okay. Thank you.<eos> I'll take some water. - Feel free to make yourself at home.<eos> Just through there.<eos> Yeah, have a seat in there and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.
So... Okay, well, first off, I was hoping you could show us where you found the tape.<eos> We're gonna make that our starting point. Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan.<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.
We're gonna make that our starting point. Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan.<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.<eos> I mean, if you're gonna be looking around, we wanna be a part of that.
Whatever spell the witch put on these woods, you have to be out here at night for it to get you.<eos> You have to spend the night.<eos> Wait, well, then how come you're still alive?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> Maybe she's using us to lure you all out here.
Don't go close. It's a trick.<eos> When was the last time you saw us?<eos> Uh, earlier this afternoon.<eos> They're not lying.<eos> It's been five days since we saw you. Maybe six.
Dinner is ruined!<eos> Guys, I told you not to wait for me, didn't I?<eos> Remember, we talked about this.<eos> Can't we just take it slow?<eos> When I met you guys two years ago, it was the best orgy of my life.
Look, tiny phone!<eos> That is so retro.<eos> I'm gonna take a picture of it with my phone.<eos> This is Billy Zane. I'm not here right...<eos> Well, Don Atari is waiting for you down in the lobby.
Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged.<eos> We couldn't save it.<eos> Only your brain survived.<eos> We made you a new body.
Initiate the hack.<eos> Help me.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't let me die.<eos> Who sent you?
- Hey, Ming!<eos> - Hey, Batou!<eos> - I got your bones. - Thanks, man.<eos> For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people, how come you care about dogs so much?
I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your decisions.<eos> I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> You are human.<eos> People see you as human.
You been here before?<eos> My friend had some mech work done here. Industry stuff.<eos> We don't do mech work here.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Why don't you come have fun with us?
Enough!<eos> The truth is, I wasn't built to dance.<eos> Back on comms.<eos> I'm heading to the back room.<eos> I missed you.
The truth is, I wasn't built to dance.<eos> Back on comms.<eos> I'm heading to the back room.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I'll meet you there.
You can see all my thoughts, so you should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance, Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.
I'm not beautiful like you.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I have been born more than once.<eos> So I have more than one name.<eos> I'll find you.
I am that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life my name is.<eos> Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have connected you to a network of my own creation.
We are not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> "Innocent," is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?
You killed 98 innocent people.<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> "Experiments"?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?
The way they died.<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you to fight terrorists.
Checking upper zones next.<eos> Is there any word on Major?<eos> Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.
Things the world thought were impossible.<eos> Now, that kid needed that drought.<eos> The world needed those empty pools.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday?
I'm no hero.<eos> I'm no hero.<eos> I'm just a footballer.<eos> My bad.<eos> So, I'll leave you be, then.
My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.<eos> Stiff odds?<eos> The things I do for my country.<eos> Like finding needles in a stack of needles.<eos> Even though you're shackled by the Queen, you're still the best in the world.
Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul...<eos> Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.<eos> I know you.
One grenade, three people.<eos> I like the odds.<eos> Two grenades, three people.<eos> I'm loving these odds.<eos> You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?
Where you been?<eos> You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?<eos> Your mom says hi.<eos> Tracker on board?<eos> Nobody saw you?
I'm just doing the math.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What math?<eos> Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.
I can't see shit.<eos> X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> - Right?<eos> - I've lost you in the heat.
Watch the watchers.<eos> Fight the enemy within.<eos> Damn, that's so complicated.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me simplify it for you.
Hey, baby, it's me.<eos> Hey, I fucking got it.<eos> When can you get away?<eos> Okay, Shimmer Lake?<eos> I'll wait for you.
His partner's not even in the room. I don't even.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't see how that makes any sense.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm not stranding you, am I?
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> Look at me. My life is in ruins.<eos> I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces and hawking life insurance.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that before you took Ed's money.
I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.<eos> You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother. We're talking about you.
- You having sloppy Joes or fried chicken?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> It's me.<eos> No, baby, listen. Don't hang up. Don't hang up.<eos> I know I said that I'd never call you again but I just could use a little company right now.
- We don't know that for sure.<eos> Who else could it be?<eos> Oh, gee, Chris, maybe it was the cops who pulled us over for speeding half a mile from the fucking bank!<eos> - We were making a getaway.<eos> - Ugh! I'll take you.
- You have a watch?<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> - Know how to tell time?<eos> - It's digital.<eos> Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.
Bradley, what's wrong?<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all.
When I was in prison, I told myself that I'd be done with this life, get on the straight and narrow.<eos> Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - For you.
Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
- Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.
Look, he's right, Chris.<eos> My brother doesn't even lock the door.<eos> I think he figures that the fact that he's inside, no one is gonna try anything.<eos> Seriously, he must be the stupidest cop in the history of the police force.<eos> - Hey, Ed, can I talk to you a sec? - Yeah.
I'm Doug!<eos> Schwarzenegger! Arnold's less successful. Brother.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> All right. Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault. Huh?
And if I suffocate in there before morning, I guess that'll be an accident too, right?<eos> Do you want me to kill you?<eos> 'Cause I can fucking do that!<eos> You know what they say. Once you take a life, it's always easier the second time.<eos> I could kill you.
And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.<eos> But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins. But probably Chris, then Dawkins.<eos> And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy. What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except. None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.
Shit, what's happening?<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed.<eos> - Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed.<eos> - Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.
Stop saying that. Ed.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.
It was an accident.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Zeke.<eos> We thought we were doing the right thing.<eos> We thought you'd changed.
- I'm gonna shoot him.<eos> - What? No! Get the.<eos> You stupid. Chris Morrow.<eos> - It's your lucky day.<eos> - Ed Burton shot you?
Okay, impeached.<eos> Too late.<eos> I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.
Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie take you, Douglas, as you are to love and to cherish to have and to hold until death do us part.
Hello, Roger.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Thank you so much for inviting me, it really means a lot.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I didn't invite you.
Thank you so much for inviting me, it really means a lot.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I didn't invite you.<eos> Francie did.<eos> I honestly thought they wouldn't let you travel out of state.
Not okay.<eos> I could just see you staring at somebody for a minute.<eos> Like a real, true minute which is a long time to stare.<eos> Tells me you got something brewing up here.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?
Don't do that.<eos> Do what?<eos> Just say something smug and walk away.<eos> No, it wasn't like that.<eos> I just saw you there, and I...
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
That was an overreaction, okay?<eos> I had too many of the mini hotdogs and...<eos> Can we just forget about it?<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone. If you even go...
Hello.<eos> Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.
It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a... That I was just a joke?<eos> It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now. Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.
Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.<eos> That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.
That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.
And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.<eos> I'm ridiculous in a million ways. I am.<eos> I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you as much as I disappoint myself.
Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Thank you. You wear it well.<eos> No.<eos> I look all right.<eos> Wait. Why didn't your dad stop you?
You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.<eos> You don't out-detective me, Bina Kepp.<eos> I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.<eos> I know you.
Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!
Bye, guys.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that. Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...
Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?
After everything.<eos> Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!<eos> Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up. What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.
It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.
Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?<eos> We shout at each other in front of strangers all the time.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> Well, the you then or you now?
Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.<eos> The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.
A denial...<eos> As if, by this vigil... He can undo what is done.<eos> You're telling me he wants his mother back, hmm?<eos> Well, that's a... That's a revelation.<eos> I've been looking for you, Jakob.
Jakob!<eos> Help me down.<eos> You scared me, Jakob.<eos> But you've helped me realize something.<eos> I can't leave you.
It's not what it pretends to be.<eos> It's important to understand that.<eos> I want to hear you speak.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> I care about you.
What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have spoken about the future before she died...<eos> About the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.<eos> Try to remember what she said.<eos> And imagine what she might say now if she could see you.
Jakob.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.
Jakob. Jakob. Another woman will come.<eos> This is how it must be.<eos> We must help her.<eos> Jakob. Jakob, listen to me closely.<eos> Your mother is watching over you.
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> SYREN 1:<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.
For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.
He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on where?<eos> You've got some heat on you, Arthur.
Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.
The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.
I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.
And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand<eos> as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?
Mmm-hmm.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.
And you will help me.<eos> (PEOPLE CLAMORING)<eos> Bring him here.<eos> There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.
King Vortigern!<eos> VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.
VORTIGERN:<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> MERCIA:<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.<eos> I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.
Where exactly were you thinking of going?<eos> You have no more home. It was razed days ago.<eos> You've no more life to go back to.<eos> Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.
Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> - (GASPS) - (EXHALES)<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.
Between them, they can rustle up 12,000 warriors.<eos> In order to stand a chance, we are going to need at least some of their support.<eos> We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> Let me stop you there.
I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us.<eos> They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.
- I'm holding you up.<eos> Go on without me.<eos> - No, Lack, come on. Let's go.<eos> - No, I'll see you at the safe house.<eos> - I'm not leaving you!
Nothing.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Just got to get to the safe house.<eos> Can you make it?<eos> I love you, mate.
Did you find your father?<eos> He's found him!<eos> Ah!<eos> (HORSE WHINNIES)<eos> We need to get you out of here.
Take it.<eos> (YELLING)<eos> Apparently you have something to tell me.<eos> I suppose you wanna know what happened to me.<eos> I don't wanna push you, but...
I don't wanna push you, but...<eos> George?<eos> Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium. Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.
Not just in Londinium. Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.<eos> If there was ever a chance, it's now.<eos> It's not going to last.<eos> But, like he said, we're not going to push you.
Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.<eos> Now, you're a big man. Now, let's see you move.
As soon as she's safe, he will come.<eos> He poses no threat to you without the sword.<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.
What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.<eos> Oh!<eos> (EXHALES AND INHALES SHARPLY)<eos> I love you very much.
Bad move.<eos> On this planet, you always have backup.<eos> Saber Raine.<eos> In the flesh.<eos> I'm surprised to see you alive.
A necessary action.<eos> Our mission is paramount.<eos> Besides, it's a very unstable substance.<eos> Are you saying my friend could blow himself up?<eos> - Now let me ask you something.
My construct is not powered by science.<eos> It's powered by the mind.<eos> Alive because I will it into existence!<eos> So you would kill me as a show of your power?<eos> No, killing you would be pointless.
We will find a way out of here, and get back home.<eos> And we will return to this planet with a vengeance.<eos> Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!<eos> You must lead our people.<eos> I can't let them put their hands on you again.
I can't let them put their hands on you again.<eos> I don't matter!<eos> - You've always been so strong.<eos> - We must fight to protect what is ours.<eos> I know Father never said it, but he is proud of you.
Caliope, please, as you said we must protect what is ours.<eos> You know. That's a pretty good plan.<eos> Just might work.<eos> How do you know he would honor your request?<eos> We will have a code word a word that you will give to those that return you to safety.
- Now I understand.<eos> You were the oldest, yet Father chose to pass his mantel on to me.<eos> He must've recognized what I did not.<eos> You are unworthy!<eos> Regardless of what happens to me, Ares will stand against you!
What did they do to you?<eos> I think I know what happened to the rest of my crew.<eos> It's synthetic, but I can feel it.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Yeah, about that, I brought you a present.
Turn around.<eos> You really don't understand what's happening here.<eos> I... I think I do.<eos> You teamed up with some bad guys tried to kill your brother. Some sort of plan for world domination, blah blah blah.<eos> My job was to find you.
Aresian power core installed.<eos> Ion engine capacity improved by 300%.<eos> Weapons upgraded.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I have something for you.
That is a Smurf.<eos> We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.
Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?
Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?<eos> You are never going to find that village, Gargamel.<eos> Smurfette, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even know about those other Smurfs.
- Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Clumsy!<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'm coming, Clumsy bro.<eos> I got you, little buddy.
No, no, no.<eos> No, no! No! No, no, no.<eos> You know, you're right, Brain Man.<eos> Your little book does come in handy.<eos> Shame. Shame on you.
It's not my purpose to help him.<eos> I'm meant to save those Smurfs.<eos> And we're gonna help you.<eos> We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.<eos> And by "together," I mean me and you.
And we're gonna help you.<eos> We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.<eos> And by "together," I mean me and you.<eos> And those guys.<eos> But mostly me and you.
But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,<eos> Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.
He's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic.<eos> And he knows about your lost village.<eos> "Lost village"?<eos> You're the ones who are lost, not us.<eos> We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.
Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.<eos> Trust us, he's a goner.<eos> Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?<eos> Check things out.<eos> And leave you here with these four?
And I had to sit across from him.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Al.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I never told you this, but I've seen you perform a few times.
No habla Inglés.<eos> I know it's you, Murphy.<eos> (SIGHS) What are you doing here, Joe?<eos> I've come about the child support you're not paying.<eos> Didn't I lose you in the divorce, Joe?
You know, it soaks up all the juices.<eos> Okay. Sounds good.<eos> You will never, ever taste a better one.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive.
Well, you have made that perfectly clear, Al.<eos> You want to have dinner some night?<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> I just don't think you hear me!<eos> Oh, I hear you.
You want to have dinner some night?<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> I just don't think you hear me!<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> I hear you real good.
Now go get me some food, because I'm starving to death.<eos> All right. That's more like it.<eos> Didn't think you'd be joining us today.<eos> I'm too old for grudges.<eos> That never stopped you.
Holy shit!<eos> - Easy!<eos> - Language.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your father will be picking you up today.
Give him a shot, babe.<eos> For me.<eos> Sure, Joe.<eos> But only because you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, kiddo.
Yup, and I'm going to bring you fried dough with your name on it.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Okay.<eos> That's a little tight there.<eos> I love you too.
Go make something of yourself.<eos> I will, young man.<eos> See you later,<eos> Dad.<eos> I've been giving you crap for a long time, Murphy.
There's always another way.<eos> My business is my business, kid.<eos> Forget that you know it.<eos> And if in the end, I don't come back, it's on you.<eos> I can't cover for you anymore.
Time to get in the bag.<eos> Got to the park around 2:00 p.m. Talked to my friend Paul for a few minutes, then ran one of the ticket booths.<eos> Hi, Tony.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I've got you a souvenir.
Uh, he might be sleeping.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I won't wake him.<eos> Oh, good heavens, aren't you just the cutest little thing?<eos> Let me get a look at you with your smushy face.
Thanks.<eos> Good luck.<eos> May you enjoy every minute of every moment you have.<eos> We love you.<eos> We love you too, young man.
Escape route's on your phone.<eos> Right.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> The airport.<eos> He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.
Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.<eos> And I must say, the beard does give you a certain...<eos> Can't have that.<eos> I should shave it off at the first opportunity.<eos> I like you with a little scruff.
Already on it.<eos> - But, Simon?<eos> - Yes, darling.<eos> I might have been wrong about the beard.<eos> It makes you a little, dare I say... Older.
He's an international thief.<eos> He's wanted for money laundering, computer fraud, smuggling...<eos> - This the guy from Russia?<eos> Coop, look...<eos> You're the kid genius and all, but the director feels we went way out of our comfort zone for you last time.
We're the FBI, not the CIA or interpol.<eos> He compromised an active anti-terrorism operation, and we're what?<eos> We-we're gonna let him walk?<eos> He's not our problem.<eos> The bureau won't back you on this.
We-we're gonna let him walk?<eos> He's not our problem.<eos> The bureau won't back you on this.<eos> - No, but you... - I...<eos> Won't back you.
I tell you what.<eos> Because I like you, you've got 48 hours.<eos> Patricia, I knew you missed me.<eos> Desperately.<eos> Really just thought you might be interested in something I picked up at brunch.
On my way.<eos> Just need to Chuck a few things in a bag.<eos> Morning, ladies.<eos> -Hi and I took your advice and got rid of the beard.<eos> Whatever makes you happy.
Put your hands up!<eos> Now!<eos> After years of chasing you around the globe, I finally got the Saint.<eos> Simon!<eos> - Good to see you. - You too.
Is it too late to order?<eos> I'm thinking some queijo minas with pinhao in a half-moon pastels. And maybe some cuscuz branco.<eos> So what happened in rio?<eos> Before your time, darling.<eos> Sonali, good to see you.
How do you think valecross got this in the first place?<eos> From the same man who shot your mother and your father.<eos> It's the only me you're after.<eos> Leave my family out of this.<eos> First time my dad brought you home, i knew it.
Yeah, isn't that a Daisy?<eos> Go on. Get.<eos> But I want my 20, okay?<eos> Dollars, not dinars.<eos> How about I pay you in freedom and democracy?
A pharmacy.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Can you step out of the vehicle for me?<eos> Hey. Hey. Hey.<eos> I want you... I want you to stand right there
You guys go around and join the line. Go around and join the line.<eos> I'm serving people who've been waiting first, okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's good.<eos> Let's get some sleep.<eos> Rodriguez, I got you a movie!
Oh, yeah, that's good.<eos> Let's get some sleep.<eos> Rodriguez, I got you a movie!<eos> - Keep your hands off of me.<eos> - I'll be thinking of you!
They're just scared.<eos> What is that, some kinda fuckin' excuse?<eos> - We're all fuckin' scared, ocre.<eos> - Yeah, well, give it time.<eos> You know what? You need to crawl out from behind your faggotty little rainbow.
- We're gonna be needin' your help.<eos> - Yeah, Roger that.<eos> Good.<eos> Full brief in about an hour.<eos> I know. I've... I heard you, Anne.
Eagle six, you are directed to go back to your operating frequency of two-zero-eight-zero-zero in the red.<eos> Medevac is two Mikes out.<eos> Get a stretcher over here!<eos> - Come on. Let's go. Get him up.<eos> - We got you. We got you.
But some of my best memories are just hanging out, meeting new people, living on the edge.<eos> God I miss college.<eos> - Well in my experience, meeting new people usually leads to relentless mockery by said people.<eos> - Don't you think that's a little pessimistic.<eos> Give people a chance. They can often surprise you.
- Good luck.<eos> - But then in ninth grade, the Young Astronomers Association selected me for the Rising Star Award, which I accepted despite the lazy pun and then in 10th grade I won second prize at the state science fair for my project anisotropic versus isotropic materials.<eos> - Okay Mindy, it's clear that you're a really talented scientist.<eos> Great grades, great test scores.<eos> But what makes you tick?
Nice.<eos> Some best friend you are. - I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?<eos> - I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were. - I told you you couldn't trust her.<eos> - And now all of a sudden you're, you're,<eos> - Yeah because between you and Whitney,
- I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were. - I told you you couldn't trust her.<eos> - And now all of a sudden you're, you're,<eos> - Yeah because between you and Whitney,<eos> Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.<eos> - I'm turning you in. - If you're not with me, you are my enemy.
Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> You in this with her, are you?<eos> You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, Cunt, you fucking die.
"Fergus needs things to be simpler.<eos> "I know how embarrassed he is about me.<eos> "I could not be the man that you both need.<eos> "I've tried and tried and tried for 20 years, and everything I try is another disaster.<eos> "I love you.
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
I'll need an office if I am to be Madame Veronika.<eos> All right.<eos> Your office... Is there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
Takes after his old man, eh?<eos> Don't you?<eos> - Cheers, boys.<eos> - See you again.<eos> I covered up for you there.
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.<eos> Choose your future, Veronika.<eos> Choose life.<eos> Anyway, it amused us at the time.<eos> I like you, Mark.
Okay, okay.<eos> I might've heard something. I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.
I might've heard something. I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.<eos> I bet you were fucking looking forward to it, too, weren't you?
- Sick...<eos> Sick Boy? What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me? - No, not about you.
"He loved Spud.<eos> "Spud had never hurt anybody.<eos> "If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate, "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.
Rent Boy.<eos> You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.
You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
People talk.<eos> This is a small village, you know.<eos> Small minded as well.<eos> But small also means safe.<eos> Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you, who was so... ahead of her time.
Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.
He never liked me either.<eos> Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though?<eos> They're never going to trust the kind of change you're trying to bring.<eos> All I wanted was to teach a child to read.<eos> The only children you should concern yourself with... are your own.
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.<eos> This is our world, Belle.<eos> For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better.<eos> I might be a farm girl.<eos> But, I'm not simple... and I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.
Who's there?<eos> Papa, is that you?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.
Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.<eos> Belle, you must leave here at once!<eos> This castle is alive!<eos> Now go, before he finds you!
Come into the light.<eos> Choose.<eos> Belle, I won't let you do this.<eos> I lost your mother.<eos> I won't lose you, too.
Now go.<eos> Live your life. And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.
Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I love you too, Papa.
Enchantée, mademoiselle.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.
Froufrou, send my love to the maestro.<eos> Picture it, LeFou.<eos> A rustic cabin... my latest kill roasting on the fire... adorable children running around us as my love... rubs my tired feet.<eos> But what does Belle say?<eos> "I will never marry you, Gaston!"
I believe there's another 'T'<eos> It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.<eos> How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?
It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!<eos> How lovely... to make your acquaintance.<eos> It's a very long journey.<eos> Let me fix you up... before you go.
Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, oui, our guest<eos> Be our guest<eos> Beef ragout Cheese soufflé Pie and pudding en flambé<eos> We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret<eos> You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared
She's our guest<eos> Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request<eos> It's been years since we've had anybody Here and we're obsessed<eos> With your meal With your ease Yes indeed, we aim to please<eos> While the candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, we'll keep going
With your meal With your ease Yes indeed, we aim to please<eos> While the candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, we'll keep going<eos> Course by<eos> Course! One by one 'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"<eos> Then we'll sing you off to sleep As you digest
While the candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, we'll keep going<eos> Course by<eos> Course! One by one 'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"<eos> Then we'll sing you off to sleep As you digest<eos> Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now let's eat up
Because I want to marry your daughter!<eos> Now, let's go home.<eos> Belle is not at home.<eos> She is with the...<eos> You say beast one more time... I will feed you to the wolves!
We become rubbish.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> There must be some way to break the curse.<eos> Well, there is one.<eos> It's not for you to worry about, lamb.
A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.
It's just... every time I close my eyes... I picture Maurice stranded alone.<eos> And then when I open them... he's...<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.
It's hero time.<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> She's very headstrong.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> No one to protect you now, huh?
And stay out!<eos> I'm Gaston.<eos> Belle sent me.<eos> Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?
When we return to the village... you will marry me.<eos> And that beast's head...<eos> - will hang on our wall.<eos> - Never!<eos> I'm coming for you, beast.
I'll never leave you again.<eos> I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.<eos> We're together now.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> At least I got to see you.
It was an honor to serve... with you.<eos> The honor was mine.<eos> Come back.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I love you.
Come back.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I love you.<eos> Cogsworth, we beat the clock!<eos> Chip! Look at you!
Yes, it certainly does.<eos> She's a special girl.<eos> You two are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you daddy.
She's a special girl.<eos> You two are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you daddy.<eos> I love you.
She's barely holding the ends.<eos> Have you prayed for this?<eos> I just want your truck.<eos> But you know that's not a good idea, right?<eos> And if it's that guy And he's trying to get you there
Tell me when you arrive?<eos> Look that... I know you're fighting something.<eos> It's okay if you do not know how to talk about it.<eos> But we've lost so much already.<eos> I do not want to lose you too.
I did not know we were going to fish.<eos> We will need to do something, When we find out that I went crazy.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're not planning on coming back, are you?<eos> I do not want to lose you too.
What a great Pope you are.<eos> It's cold out here, is not it?<eos> I have a fireplace at home if you want to warm up.<eos> Come on, Mack.<eos> I know a person who would love to see you.
Do not.<eos> I told you.<eos> MacKenzie Allen Phillips.<eos> Well well well.<eos> Look at you.
I know you?<eos> Not very well.<eos> But we can sort this out.<eos> I've been waiting so long for this.<eos> To finally see you face to face.
The "I am"?<eos> I am what I am.<eos> Look, I'm already quoting the scripture.<eos> You knew my son.<eos> Good to see you, Mack.
Right.<eos> So...<eos> Which one of you is...<eos> I am.<eos> And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's all right.<eos> Remember that smell?<eos> Ma Griffe.<eos> The perfume of his mother.<eos> She loves you more than she could know.
Why did you bring me back here?<eos> Because... It was here that we had a blockade.<eos> She's wearing a dress.<eos> How is it?<eos> I always... I imagined you With white beard.
On here. Be useful.<eos> Knead. Fold. Turn.<eos> That's it.<eos> I know there's... A great chasm between us, Mack.<eos> You may not believe... But I have a special affection for you.
You know everything.<eos> It is everywhere, at the same time.<eos> And it has infinite power.<eos> And somehow... Let my daughter die.<eos> When she most needed you... You abandoned her.
He did not understand the mystery.<eos> Never think that choosing my child Did not have a high price for us.<eos> Love always leaves a mark.<eos> We were there together.<eos> I never left him. I never left you. I never left Missy.
You, on the other hand, Was created to be loved.<eos> Living without love is like... Take away the wings of a bird.<eos> Pain does this to us.<eos> If left unresolved, Can forget for what was created.<eos> It's not what I want for you.
Love was meant to exist in a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we want to have with you.<eos> Even if you can not see.<eos> You are at the center of our love and purpose.<eos> Even if all this is very beautiful, It's nothing compared to how we see you.
My what?<eos> His wrath.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.
Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.<eos> Do not.<eos> I do not need to punish people.<eos> Sin is punishment itself.<eos> Even if it is difficult for you to accept,
Caution.<eos> This one is deadly.<eos> What are you doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.<eos> Alone, The sap of that branch would kill you.
What are you doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.<eos> Alone, The sap of that branch would kill you.<eos> But combined with the nectar of this flower, Will suddenly contain incredible healing properties.<eos> Let me ask you, how much you trust
I think so.<eos> Have you been wrong?<eos> Or did you change your mind after a while?<eos> Of course.<eos> And there are billions like you...
Believe me, none of this will hurt you.<eos> Keep your eyes on me. Breathe.<eos> Good, Mack.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Now, let's get you off that boat.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.<eos> And I meant it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Do not forget what you have learned.<eos> I'll be waiting for you, right here.
Of course.<eos> I do not think God loves his children well.<eos> If that's what you believe in... Come here.<eos> You can judge me from there.<eos> Judge you?
You know what I did.<eos> Yes, but you are not being judged.<eos> Today, you are the judge.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you surprised?
You must choose one of your children, To spend eternity in Heaven.<eos> The other will go to Hell.<eos> I can not...<eos> Can not what?<eos> I'm just asking you to do something that you believe God does.
I'm just asking you to do something that you believe God does.<eos> So, who will go to Hell?<eos> You can choose Kate.<eos> She said some very painful things.<eos> She pulled you away.
So, who will go to Hell?<eos> You can choose Kate.<eos> She said some very painful things.<eos> She pulled you away.<eos> You're not even sure if she still loves you.
She pulled you away.<eos> You're not even sure if she still loves you.<eos> Or, you can choose Josh.<eos> He has been disobedient.<eos> He ran away, lied to you.
I go in their place.<eos> Leave my children alone and take me.<eos> MacKenzie,<eos> You have judged that your children are worthy of love,<eos> Even if it costs you everything.
And has.<eos> But the best way involves trust.<eos> I do not want to be the judge anymore.<eos> Missy.<eos> She can not hear you.
It's time to leave it behind.<eos> How was it?<eos> Terrible.<eos> It is wonderful.<eos> I'm proud of you, my friend.
Certainly.<eos> Now you understand.<eos> I can take a lot of good things Of great tragedies.<eos> But that does not mean that I cause the tragedies.<eos> After all I felt for you, Why continue working with me?
Children of the Pope of all languages, tribes and nations.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, We see it as color and light.<eos> What's going on with that one?<eos> Why is it coming to us?<eos> It's coming to you.
IT IS...<eos> Father.<eos> Mack, I'm sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> I was blind, I could not see you.
I was afraid.<eos> I did not know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.<eos> You became the father that I could not be.<eos> I'm very proud of you.
Son, I forgive you.<eos> You became the father that I could not be.<eos> I'm very proud of you.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> See you, son.
Ever.<eos> You're going to need a father for what you have to do today.<eos> Where will we go?<eos> We are almost there.<eos> We're here to do something. That will be very painful for you.
Nobody gets away with anything.<eos> Everything has consequences.<eos> What did he do...<eos> It was horrible.<eos> I'm not asking you to justify what he did.
Everything has consequences.<eos> What did he do...<eos> It was horrible.<eos> I'm not asking you to justify what he did.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right. And that I know what's best.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right. And that I know what's best.<eos> And then?<eos> Forgiveness does not establish a relationship.<eos> It's just relieving the lump in the throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.<eos> If you leave, you'll leave her behind.<eos> But only for now.<eos> What does she want?<eos> She'd love to see you today.
So I want to go home.<eos> Good,<eos> Can we ask you to do something when you go?<eos> Anything.<eos> Kate needs you.
I always am.<eos> I will always be.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Because I clung to you.<eos> I love you, Mack.
Yes I arrived.<eos> I was there.<eos> Right. Dude, this is a lot to digest, right?<eos> I knew God.<eos> Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.
I know what it feels like to feel what you're carrying.<eos> And I'm starting to learn how to forget.<eos> I hope it's something we can learn together.<eos> It does not matter what is going on. You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.
And I'm starting to learn how to forget.<eos> I hope it's something we can learn together.<eos> It does not matter what is going on. You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.
I hope it's something we can learn together.<eos> It does not matter what is going on. You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.<eos> I love you very much, Kate.
He'll give me $ 10 if I beat him.<eos> That's easy money.<eos> Did you bring me a stick?<eos> Choice.<eos> I brought it to you too if you're lucky.
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
Listen.<eos> You're still divorced, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still.<eos> Good for you.
Good for you.<eos> 'Cause the chase is the key.<eos> The chase.<eos> I got a wife, I'm settled in, but I don't have that... that drive, that sand.<eos> You, the love of your life left you.
Maybe.<eos> You?<eos> I love trucks.<eos> Consider yourself lucky.<eos> Trucks never leave you.
I suppose so.<eos> Hello, Nellies.<eos> What's the scoop?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> Styvesan's looking for you.
Did it at school.<eos> It had a heart on it, and, uh... crayon color.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> What did it say inside, do you remember?<eos> "I love you, Mom.
You know, actually write in class.<eos> Yeah, that was so I could write.<eos> I know.<eos> It was something to see.<eos> I want to see you do it again.
Truth is, I haven't written anything good in three years. I...<eos> Three years.<eos> Gosh, that is... that's a bummer.<eos> Wonder what could have happened three years ago that would have crushed your spirit.<eos> I wonder if it was maybe when your wife left you for another guy.
Don't do it, Ray.<eos> Thanks for the advice.<eos> Come on, Denny.<eos> Karen, Ray's here!<eos> Well, I guess I should invite you in.
Big Ray here used to be the best, the Bill Shakespeare of romance cards.<eos> Words.<eos> You're not still picking up the cat, are you?<eos> 'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> "I'm with you in hard times especially."
Paper Hearts.<eos> What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.
What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.<eos> I think very highly of you, too.
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
- What?<eos> Okay, Eileen, what about you?<eos> Yeah, it was all right.<eos> One thing I didn't under...<eos> Man, it's painful watching you sometimes.
They already have.<eos> I should've done something.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Like what? - I shouldn't have run.<eos> No one's mad at you for not being a hero.
- Thanks, Danny.<eos> - Wait, I know you're not going to school.<eos> - I thought I might.<eos> - Head trauma is wasted on you, mate.<eos> Danny, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Maybe you'll be able to come back to school soon.<eos> - Yeah, maybe.<eos> - Boring without you there.
- Like you'd ever dare throw chips at me.<eos> - Yeah, what would you do about it?<eos> Give you a slap, obviously.<eos> You'd have to find a chair to stand on first.<eos> You're gonna regret all this talk when I'm owning you in front of everyone.
- Naw, man.<eos> No time to chill.<eos> - What am I gonna call her for?<eos> - For me.<eos> - Good seeing you, Cutz. - What's going on?
- Luce, what happened?<eos> - Tom...<eos> No, I... I just...<eos> I want you to know you can...<eos> I want you to feel safe when I'm around.
- Yo, start the car, Eugene, bruv.<eos> - Calm yourself down, man.<eos> Nothing in the glove compartment, fam, not even sunglasses.<eos> Hey, Hazzard, check the dash, bruv.<eos> I beg you, hurry up, bruv, or they'll be out here, man.
What you saying, bruv?<eos> - What's happening?<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah, man. What you saying?<eos> Nothing, man, I just wanted to ask you a little question.
Got ya.<eos> You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> I don't have to tell you everything.<eos> You know, I see your mom in you when I look at you.
- She was a junkie.<eos> - She was your mother.<eos> And she was my daughter.<eos> She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.
She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.<eos> So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.<eos> I love you.
He was a dickhead, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what happened to you?<eos> Oh, just... got jumped, that's all.<eos> I haven't seen you around lately.
- What if I pay you?<eos> Well, then I'd be in private practice, but I'm afraid I would still have to say no.<eos> You've got to help. Things haven't been the same since it's happened.<eos> Look...<eos> Perhaps, I'm not the kind of doctor that you need to be talking to.
Now, I want you to ask yourself one very important question.<eos> "Where, oh, where is Lucy?"<eos> You see her, don't you?<eos> She's got nothing to do with any of this.<eos> That's entirely up to you.
- I can't kill no girl.<eos> - It ain't gonna come to that!<eos> - Yeah, what if it does?<eos> - I'm right here, you know.<eos> Yeah, we see you.
- Most people just get dead.<eos> - Lucky, I guess.<eos> That's yet to be established.<eos> - So go on. Show me what you can do.<eos> - I won't steal for you.
And do you know? He didn't even want to be here to see if he was right.<eos> - How long have you known Danny?<eos> - My whole life.<eos> Your whole life.<eos> I've never even met the guy and yet, he gave you up to me.
I knew her well, you know.<eos> Very well.<eos> Gosh, you don't think...<eos> We both certainly like getting into a lot of trouble, don't we?<eos> I wasn't actually gonna kill you, Luce.
It's really great.<eos> The view's pretty good, though.<eos> So, are you gonna stick around, then?<eos> In case you need me?<eos> In case I want you.
I try to look at this data, I try to do my job, but the only thing that I can think about, the only thing that... means anything to me, is you.<eos> -But why?<eos> - I'm a mess.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm seeing you for the first time.
- What do you think her next move is?<eos> - To kill all of us.<eos> Chris.<eos> I need for you to know that whatever happens...<eos> I want you to know I love you.
- I don't care.<eos> - The point was trying to stop him.<eos> He's better off if we use his impulsiveness as a diversion.<eos> - Come out and face me!<eos> I know you are in here!
So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.<eos> But neither one of them can drive, one being fictional, the other one extinct.<eos> And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well...<eos> this is a '24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?
She found you yet?<eos> Gabriela?<eos> See... I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.<eos> Well, not really.<eos> I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.<eos> She took something of mine when I wasn't looking.<eos> Something for which I am responsible.<eos> Mexican lady.<eos> Has her sights on you now.
How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.<eos> I always know who you are.<eos> It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
- Forces?<eos> - They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.
Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.<eos> Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.<eos> They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.
You always thought... we were part of God's plan.<eos> But maybe...<eos> Maybe we were God's mistake.<eos> What a disappointment you are.<eos> When I found you... you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
When I found you... you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.<eos> A warm capper to a life as an assassin.<eos> Hooked on barbiturates.<eos> You were an animal.<eos> But we took you in.
You know he needs a higher dose.<eos> And I know you got more money squirreled away.<eos> That money's to get us out of here.<eos> No, not us.<eos> You and him.
- I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really, if you're not going to talk to me.<eos> I hear you at night. You're not sleeping.
On the inside you're sick.<eos> I can smell it.<eos> Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you.
I can smell it.<eos> Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Hey!<eos> I told you to stop it with that ball!<eos> - Bad girl!<eos> - No, please.<eos> - I told you, bad girl!
Please.<eos> You have to. Please.<eos> Please.<eos> - I like those. - Huh?<eos> They make you look younger.
This is Laura.<eos> Caliban, come!<eos> This is who I've been telling you about.<eos> This is Laura.<eos> We've been waiting for you.
Come.<eos> Come. It's okay.<eos> You can stay here, Laura.<eos> It's safe.<eos> We can look after you here.
Yeah, not for long.<eos> You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him.<eos> What if he wakes up before I get there?<eos> Text me where you are.<eos> We'll pick you up.
Where?<eos> - Stay here. - Don't move.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> He will be back for you.
Or I could ask Cue Ball. He seems quite friendly.<eos> I told you, she's not here.<eos> Where's Caliban, motherfucker?<eos> Well, I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in.<eos> Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.
Sit back.<eos> Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I asked you a question.
I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.<eos> You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.
I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.
It was a special needs school. Um...<eos> Uh-huh. That's a good description.<eos> He was there, too.<eos> Oh, yeah, no. Um... I got kicked out a few times.<eos> I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.<eos> Honey, check the sink.<eos> They shut it off again.<eos> They are just not going to let this thing go.<eos> Well, you might as well handle it now.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.<eos> Until today, I didn't know.<eos> You wouldn't tell me.<eos> So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.
Just breathe.<eos> Your body has work to do.<eos> Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization... stromal cell proliferation.<eos> This will help you heal.<eos> Make you stronger.
No.<eos> I know, I understand.<eos> This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.
This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.<eos> I am fucked up.<eos> And I cannot get you there.
I am not taking you to North Dakota.<eos> I am fucked up.<eos> And I cannot get you there.<eos> It is a two-day drive.<eos> And I am not taking you...
- Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> You wanna go?<eos> I'll take you there.
Hey, what is it?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Where we came from.<eos> They gave it to us when we would fight.<eos> It makes you stronger.
Where did you get that?<eos> Where we came from.<eos> They gave it to us when we would fight.<eos> It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.
Where we came from.<eos> They gave it to us when we would fight.<eos> It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.<eos> It'll kill you.
Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> You're with your pals. You made it.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Nearest bar, for starters.<eos> Hey, I got you here.
Charles never asked for this.<eos> Caliban never asked for this.<eos> And they are six feet under the ground!<eos> Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head... but I am not whatever it is you think I am, okay?<eos> I only met you, like, a week ago.
Run.<eos> They'll keep coming and coming.<eos> Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Don't be what they made you.
You're good. I'll find a new spot.<eos> - Fucking rent-a-cop.<eos> - Guys!<eos> I need you to stop rocking the cart.<eos> Fuck you!
And I'm up all night thinking about what I'm gonna say to the superintendent at 2:00.<eos> You know, I don't have anything planned.<eos> I know what I'm gonna say at my meeting.<eos> I'm gonna be like,<eos> "Fuck you for trying to make us re-interview for our jobs again!"
She wants to change the song to a Big Sean song.<eos> Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right? Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves. - All right, look, Ally,<eos> I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let you down.
Isn't that great?<eos> I really cannot have you getting fired right now, okay?<eos> We can't have that right now... That would be no good.<eos> It's the hottest thing I've ever seen.<eos> You know what, sweetie? I gotta call you back.
Oh, hey. That must have sounded pretty bad.<eos> Uh, let me explain.<eos> He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching. I caught you.
I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...<eos> So you're telling me that there's nothing you can do?<eos> I could do CPR.<eos> I could potentially revive you after he renders you unconscious.
If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.<eos> Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> You cussed.<eos> I'm gonna write you up!
Hey, buddy, let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm still a teacher at this school, okay?<eos> Are you?<eos> Yes!<eos> I could get you in a lot of trouble, Neil. Okay?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I knew that you wouldn't stand up to these people. I just knew it.<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean, you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes, you just let people push you around.
- I don't either.<eos> Because technology's always changing. You gotta keep up.<eos> Otherwise, you're one of those dumb families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.<eos> I ruined the surprise.<eos> Now, let's talk about you.
Right?<eos> I've been practicing all the moves!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - You know what I mean? I got them down!<eos> I'm not gonna let you down.
- of his own seat. - Yeah.<eos> So, forget my statement 'cause I wasn't in the right...<eos> - It was chaotic.<eos> - It was chaotic. Yeah.<eos> And shame on you because we have been through an ordeal over all of this.
No, I would never sleep with a student.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Without protection.<eos> By the way, did that twin say anything to you about me?<eos> No. He doesn't talk to me about you at all.
- Creeping on them and trying to...<eos> I want that teenage dick, you know? I want that teenis.<eos> Holly, why are you texting me that you're pregnant?<eos> I... I gotta be in class.<eos> Can you just wait one second? 'Cause it's all gonna make sense.
I... I gotta be in class.<eos> Can you just wait one second? 'Cause it's all gonna make sense.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Who raped you?
These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.<eos> I say fuck a trophy.<eos> Nobody's being held accountable anymore.<eos> So, I'mma hold you accountable.
Booty kick!<eos> Nine-one-one. What's your emergency?<eos> Yes, hi. There's a crazy guy at my high school. He's trying to beat me up.<eos> Nine-one-one is for emergencies only.<eos> If you have a problem with a bully, I need you to speak to a teacher.
Oh, shit!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Fucking damn it!<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what? You have to relax. I got something for you.
They're gonna come in here if you light that little toothpick pencil joint?<eos> You wanna find out?<eos> You be a man.<eos> I refuse!<eos> You know, first I was just gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.
Do I trust either of them?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> All right, we got this.<eos> Yeah, we got this.<eos> You stay out this shit, Mehar.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
Yeah, getting locked up. It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I...<eos> I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.
I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.<eos> And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. I couldn't believe it.<eos> He just keeps going on and on and on that he wants to fight you.
You could just go over there.<eos> And I'd stay here if you're worried about losing your seat.<eos> I can see that that's not it.<eos> Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.
Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.<eos> But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.
But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.<eos> Okay. I gotta go.<eos> Okay, so you still wanna fight?
Fight's off.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> First, I was just pissed off at you.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's give it up again for Ally Campbell and her... And herself.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Um, I'm gonna need a little favor from you.
Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - Let's get out there.<eos> Let's go. - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.
Thanks, Dad.<eos> I'm gonna be a rock star here now.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I think you're gonna be expelled. - Oh...<eos> Yeah, yeah. But, look, look, I'm super proud of you
- Campbell, stay down!<eos> Campbell, stay down!<eos> Bruce Lee style!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Right here. I should just kill you.
You dirty mother...<eos> What the fuck is this shit?<eos> Campbell!<eos> Come here.<eos> So I can fuck you up.
Fuck over here.<eos> Shit!<eos> Excuse me, I'm the superintendent.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.
- You sure?<eos> Yeah, it's a hospital. So they got doctors and stuff. But, listen.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> Like, thank you for the fight. Really.<eos> You did good.
Hey!<eos> You cut out all that grab-assing.<eos> You get your ass to detention, Freddie.<eos> All right, I'm not joking around. You get there before I kick it there!<eos> I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie. I will kick you into dust!
- Do it.<eos> - Boom.<eos> Up top! Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.
We'll set up by the corner.<eos> Hey! Don't you get it?<eos> Brother, it's Eid.<eos> We'll also make some money.<eos> You'll have our blessings lf we slaughter you along with the goats, we'll be blessed.
Life is a journey.<eos> The city of my dreams traverses, bundled in a bottle lf you have the wisdom, patience to boot, and a lot of guts, you have nothing to worry.<eos> This world is fake.<eos> You have to turn crooked to fix it.<eos> Follow your passions push your will far enough, and luck will shine on you lt's the spirit of business lt's the spirit of business
Raees.<eos> - The stairs.<eos> - Where?<eos> Ah, right where they are<eos> I love you I see no one but you around I have so much to say.
- The stairs.<eos> - Where?<eos> Ah, right where they are<eos> I love you I see no one but you around I have so much to say.<eos> Let me pour out my feelings now I love you

Actress Sridevi.<eos> Why do you always beat about the bush?<eos> I can't help it.<eos> When you smile, it strikes me dumb!<eos> And I just feel like watching you!
Father. What else?<eos> What are you droning about father?<eos> Fine.<eos> Try this.<eos> What if someone calls you father?
O Laila.<eos> These moments are so enchanting.<eos> My eyes are playing games with me.<eos> You are here I can't believe my eyes.<eos> My heart desires to feel you.
I'll do what postman Hari does.<eos> Home delivery.<eos> So many phones!<eos> Have you changed your business? Are you selling phones now? I'm not changing business.<eos> These are for you.
- No. Sadiq...<eos> - To heck with Sadiq! - Sadiq, did you hear...?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did you say?<eos> 'l did this for you, I did that for you'
O cruel one I'm drunk in your love.<eos> Don't intoxicate me more, O cruel one.<eos> O cruel one.<eos> Those eyes, mesmerizing.<eos> Your words, alluring I fall head over heels for you a hundred times over.
Go!<eos> Hack him!<eos> Start shelling!<eos> Fire!<eos> I warned you not to pass through my neighbourhood
He created all the mess. What about my business?<eos> I'll give you all the facilities in jail.<eos> Do your business from jail. Who stops you?<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I'll have you released when you tell me lt's only a matter of a few days
- Hello? Who is it?<eos> - lt's me.<eos> At this hour?<eos> is all well?<eos> I'm missing you.
is all well?<eos> I'm missing you.<eos> Liar.<eos> Listen. We made 22,000 in cash today.<eos> That's not what I called you for l told you, I'm missing you.
Pasha and the Chief Minister have joined hands. Take a look.<eos> 'Coalition politics completely wipes out Raees' I told you to get used to tea at the cop station.<eos> Get ready to contest the elections.<eos> Raees, politics is not meant for us.<eos> I'm arranging bail for you.
Are you here to meet me or to conduct a raid?<eos> Well, rest assured. Everything is legal about Our World.<eos> Liquor pays for the construction.<eos> What could be more legal?<eos> Luck favours you these days.
All your hands are tied.<eos> That's why I came here to reason with you.<eos> Make sure you don't give me an opportunity.<eos> Never. I never gave you one.<eos> Hang on, SP lf you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you I'll book a place for you in my world.
Since the last three weeks, we've been distributing free meals to four colonies lt doesn't come for free!<eos> I swallowed it? He's asking me the accounts!<eos> Don't you yell at me!<eos> Are you doing me a favour by giving me the details?<eos> I've been noticing. You get worked up over every little thing. What is wrong with you?
Let Raees in.<eos> - Send him in.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Greetings, bhai. - Tell me.<eos> Can I help you?
Let's go.<eos> Who wants it in writing anyway?<eos> The cops will be here any moment. Run, Raees!<eos> I won't run I'm not a coward, Sadiq!<eos> And to prove that, you should live lf you don't escape, they will... kill you!
Reason with her, Sadiq.<eos> Take Faizan and Aasiya to Sanjanwala's. Now. Right now!<eos> You know that it's the only safest place for them.<eos> - And you? - You know that, Sadiq<eos> - l'm not going anywhere without you. - Don't argue with me!
Hold them back.<eos> Enough of the adoration! Let's go.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Take him away.<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?
is it true that no business is small? And no faith greater than business?<eos> It's true.<eos> As long as it doesn't harm anyone.<eos> Bhaijaan!<eos> What if someone calls you father?
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Happy birthday.<eos> Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?<eos> No! Picture's frozen!<eos> 'Yeah, signal's rubbish.<eos> But I can still hear you.'
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'<eos> - They know everything!<eos> - 'Solved it, then? '<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
- He's thinking.<eos> He's really not moving.<eos> Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.<eos> You just like this dog, don't you?<eos> - Well, I like you.
So Ajay survived as well.<eos> And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?<eos> Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?<eos> Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
No, Mary...<eos> You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember? To look after the three of you.<eos> Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.<eos> Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
Go on. One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team. Indeed?<eos> Well, that's news to me.<eos> Is it?<eos> He's already killed looking for that memory stick.<eos> AGRA always worked for the highest bidder, I thought that might include you?
Uh-huh. You said it was your initials.<eos> In a way that was true. In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,<eos> - most of the time. - All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...
- most of the time. - All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...<eos> All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
They tortured Alex to death.<eos> I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?<eos> You, where were you? That day at the embassy, I escaped.<eos> Ha! But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Little whispers. Laughter. Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!<eos> Me?<eos> You know I'll kill you too. You know I will, Ajay.
Brought down by you!<eos> Me?<eos> You know I'll kill you too. You know I will, Ajay.<eos> What, you think I care if I die?<eos> I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
What's going on?<eos> I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.<eos> What?<eos> 'So many lies.<eos> And I don't just mean you.'
I'm coming darling.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Oh, what are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?
- Yes, I promise.<eos> - Promise me!<eos> Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you.
Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.<eos> I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows? Nothing's certain, nothing's written.<eos> My old life it was full of consequences.<eos> The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.<eos> You need to remember that.<eos> So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
So, what have we got here?<eos> Mysterious meat with... onion thingy for you.
So, what have we got here?<eos> Mysterious meat with... onion thingy for you.<eos> Mystery meat and bean for me.<eos> And veggie thing for you which I actually think is meat too.
I thought she was gonna fire-bomb that pathetic barge of yours.<eos> Would have improved the neighbourhood.<eos> I loved that mug.<eos> I found it on my first dive in Poole harbour.<eos> Ah, she was no good for you.
Keep your crutch.<eos> - Friend.<eos> - But I was your friend.<eos> A true friend would have let them carry out the sentence, put the bullet into your head?<eos> I let you live.
This was never supposed to happen.<eos> This was never part of my plan, alright?<eos> You do trust me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> There's a special place in hell for you.
This was never part of my plan, alright?<eos> You do trust me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> There's a special place in hell for you.<eos> For you and for Barofski.
Take the next left.<eos> Take the next left. There.<eos> At least we took two drones out of play, Stratton.<eos> - Aggy?<eos> - Let me take you in.
Eyes on the drone.<eos> I repeat, eyes on the drone.<eos> We're on the move.<eos> Come on. Move, move, move, move.<eos> Come on, Aggy, help us find you.
Three weeks RR.<eos> Which for me means my sofa, a good book and tea.<eos> It sounds very nice right about now.<eos> That it does.<eos> We couldn't have put this together without you.
That it does.<eos> We couldn't have put this together without you.<eos> Thanks, John.<eos> Well, over the next few weeks, while you're recovering on your sofa, you might feel the need for dinner and something a little stronger than tea.<eos> If I do, I think you should remember what a wise man told me about Napoleon.
Well, over the next few weeks, while you're recovering on your sofa, you might feel the need for dinner and something a little stronger than tea.<eos> If I do, I think you should remember what a wise man told me about Napoleon.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Show up and see what happens.<eos> Where are they sending you next?
I just wanna get home.<eos> I know.<eos> If there's even a... A home to get back to.<eos> baby, guess what?<eos> There's still room service and it's just for you.
What if something were to happen to you?<eos> There is no 9-1-1.<eos> There is no one.<eos> You're freaking out right now.<eos> Can you just relax and enjoy this...
Great bedtime story for an eight-year-old.<eos> For whatever reason i-i hung onto it, I connected with it.<eos> You're in there.<eos> I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.
I'm in your book?<eos> The first time i said I love you.<eos> Well before I said it to you, I wrote it in there.<eos> when I look around, i see a beautiful country,<eos> I see land, Springs, houses, and then there's you and me.
Just so were clear. Your boyfriend took me to Europe.<eos> My boyfriend is hungover.<eos> So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Love you.
My boyfriend is hungover.<eos> So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Love you.<eos> Hey, I must have just missed you.
Love you.<eos> Hey, I must have just missed you.<eos> Well I wanted to tell you that I just bought the tickets so Iceland is a go.<eos> And uh, I'll see you at dinner.<eos> I love you.
What's so funny about that?<eos> Maybe god got impatient.<eos> I can't tell you what's happening tonight.<eos> I've been trying to figure it out and I don't...<eos> I'm not giving up on you.
I'm not saying that it's a mistake.<eos> I'm just saying it doesn't really matter.<eos> Is this gonna change the way that you live your life?<eos> Does it have to?<eos> Is it gonna change who you are?
(YELPING)<eos> (SNARLING)<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> I got you!
MILLS: (ON RADIO) Fox Five, come back.<eos> ls there anyone out there?<eos> Hey!<eos> This is Fox Five.<eos> We hear you.
You know, they've gone down the pub.<eos> It's all on me.<eos> Faith.<eos> Don't you think I should take that?<eos> It's only going to upset you.
- What are you doing here?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?<eos> - You should be at Baker Street.<eos> - I am.<eos> They found your address. They brought you here.
He's not so difficult when you've got a gun on him.<eos> How did you know?<eos> How? On Monday, I decided to get a new therapist. Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.<eos> Wednesday morning, I booked today's session. Now, today is Friday.<eos> So two weeks ago, two weeks, before you were abducted at gunpoint, and brought here against your will over a week before I even thought of coming here, you knew exactly where you need to be picked up for lunch?
You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> - My God, he knows you.
But did you know... I'm a cereal killer?<eos> And cut there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You should bag that up. Sell it. Make money from that on eBay.<eos> You can make more, if you like.
Thank you.<eos> You should bag that up. Sell it. Make money from that on eBay.<eos> You can make more, if you like.<eos> Anytime you like.<eos> Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain, that you've just been played?
It was quite lovely in its way.<eos> Take it easy, it's okay.<eos> I don't want to rush this.<eos> You're Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John, is to make him save you.
That sounds about right to me. Possibly I'm biased.<eos> Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind.<eos> - I'm intrigued.<eos> - Look, I know you are.<eos> Which is why we're all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.
- nights of passion in High Wycombe?<eos> - For God's sakes. - I don't text her back.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You bloody moron!<eos> She's out there, she likes you, and she's alive, and do you have the first idea how lucky you are?
- Why?<eos> - Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.<eos> I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe. That's only the beginning, mate.<eos> As I think I've explain to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people...<eos> Would complete you as a human being.
Trust me, Sherlock, it's gone before you know it.<eos> Before you know it.<eos> She was wrong about me.<eos> Mary?<eos> She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way, I'd... I'd rescue you or something. But I didn't, not 'till she told me to.
Look at me, you are doing yourself a disservice.<eos> I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, - and I can safely say...<eos> - I cheated on her.<eos> No clever comeback?<eos> I cheated on you, Mary.
You know who.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> Coming to get you.
Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> Coming to get you.<eos> There's an east wind coming, Mycroft.<eos> Coming to get you.
- You used that to scare me.<eos> - No.<eos> You turned my sister into a ghost story.<eos> Of course I didn't.<eos> - I monitored you.
- You what?<eos> Memories can resurface. Wounds can reopen.<eos> The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.
The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.<eos> I used, at discrete intervals, potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition.<eos> I was looking after you.
Look and play.<eos> No, not Bach.<eos> You clearly don't understand it. Play you.<eos> Me?<eos> You.
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.<eos> I'm only trying to help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.<eos> I don't trust you. So clearly, you remember me.
Mycroft was quite clever.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you...<eos> You were my favourite.<eos> Why was I your favourite?<eos> Because I could make you laugh.
You think it's a trick.<eos> You look so...<eos> Unsure. You're not used to being unsure, are you?<eos> - It's more common than you'd think.<eos> - Look at you.
Does it really make a difference, killing the innocent instead of the guilty?<eos> Let's see.<eos> The train has left the station.<eos> No. That felt pretty much the same.<eos> John, don't let her distract you.
- Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.<eos> Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.
Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
Sherlock...<eos> What is it? What do you want?<eos> Tick-tock, tick-tock... Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.<eos> What words?<eos> "I love you."
- Leave me alone.<eos> - Molly, no, please, no, don't hang up.<eos> Do not hang up.<eos> Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.<eos> Why you doing this to me? Why are you making fun of me?
- Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.
Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Molly.<eos> Molly, please.<eos> I love you.
You didn't win.<eos> You lost. Look what you did to her.<eos> Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions. I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock. It destroys you every time.
Get it over with, and we can get to work.<eos> God! I should have expected this.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> You always were the slow one. The idiot.<eos> That's why I've always despised you.
John?<eos> Yeah, it's flooding. The well is flooding.<eos> Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to find you.
Sherlock?<eos> The bones I found...<eos> Yes?<eos> They're dog's bones, that's Redbeard.<eos> Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.
Look how brilliant you are.<eos> Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.<eos> You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.<eos> Now, I'm just an idiot. But I'm on the ground.<eos> - I can bring you home. - No.
Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> Wake up, little halflings!<eos> Morning, Wizzie!<eos> What great adventure lies in wait for you today?
Doodie!<eos> I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.<eos> You can talk!<eos> No, you can really talk.<eos> I heard you!
Everyone wants the hot, new thing.<eos> Destroy. Destroy.<eos> - Lam-Lam!<eos> - I've got fresh batteries.<eos> Mom and Dad don't even know you.
What's the use?<eos> Arise for a nutritious breakfast!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> What's wrong, Timothy?<eos> Has that little dwarf made you blue?
I'm not sucking that!<eos> - Suck it.<eos> - I don't know where it's been!<eos> It's not where it's been.<eos> It's where it will take you.
- Or this?<eos> - Nada.<eos> Karate!<eos> Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton.<eos> I can still see you.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
Come on!<eos> Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
You didn't have parents, did you?<eos> Tim, I may look like a baby... but I was born all grown up.<eos> I can't even imagine not being a kid.<eos> You missed out on your whole childhood?<eos> You never had someone to love you?
Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang out with us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?<eos> Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to.
Who cares?<eos> My parents are in danger.<eos> I care!<eos> Baby Corp is going to go out of business.<eos> That's all you ever talk about.
You're a baby!<eos> You take that back.<eos> My life was perfect until you showed up!<eos> Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.<eos> I wish I'd never met you!
I don't know what it's like... to be part of a family.<eos> But I do care.<eos> You do?<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.
But I do care.<eos> You do?<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.<eos> I need you.
Come on. You said you never really had a childhood, right?<eos> Why don't you give it a try?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - It's fun!<eos> Here, let's get you into character.
Hey!<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Not again!<eos> Come on!<eos> I need you!
The parents.<eos> Yeah! You could have had your parents' love all to yourself again!<eos> But no!<eos> You blew it!<eos> You let that baby boss you around.
You ruined everything!<eos> It's not fair! It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!<eos> Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone your own size!
- Absolutely!<eos> Here you go, big guy.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> You wanna hug me, don't you?<eos> I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> - But you know what I found out?<eos> - What? There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Here you go, kid.<eos> Go get yourself a horse.<eos> You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.
I can clearly see you winking.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm using my left eye?<eos> I am Groot.<eos> They were not looking at you funny.
Oh, shit.<eos> I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was meant to be behind your back.<eos> Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.
I wasn't.<eos> I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.<eos> That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!<eos> Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
It's not ripe yet... and I hate you.<eos> You hate me?<eos> You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.<eos> And yet here you stand, a hero.<eos> I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.
Stop it.<eos> Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed... and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.<eos> And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"<eos> And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!<eos> You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.<eos> I bet it's the one-inch man.<eos> After all these years, I've found you.
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."<eos> Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl... but you're losing your mind!"
You betrayed the code!<eos> Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!<eos> I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.
I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.<eos> You may dress like us... but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.<eos> You may dress like us... but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.<eos> And the Colors of Ogord... will never flash over your grave.<eos> If you think... I take pleasure in exiling you... you're wrong.
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.<eos> But instead of returning you... Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.<eos> It made it easier for thieving'.<eos> Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.
Why do you have so much luggage?<eos> I don't want Groot playing with my things.<eos> I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.<eos> What is your goal here?<eos> To get everybody to hate you?
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm the one what sticks up for you!
"Taserface!"<eos> What was your second choice?<eos> Scrotum Hat?<eos> New plan.<eos> We're killing you first.
Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.<eos> This is Sam Cooke... one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.<eos> Drax thinks you're not a dancer.<eos> If you ever tell anyone about this... I will kill you.
Damn it.<eos> Psychopath!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I win.<eos> I win. I bested you in combat.
I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.<eos> No, that's not what I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm imagining being with you physically.<eos> Drax... I don't like you like that.
No. I don't care about those things.<eos> I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!<eos> I can lord this over him forever.<eos> What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

I mean, that was true.<eos> They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.
You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
So, I did what I had to do.<eos> But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.<eos> What?<eos> Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?
He will be back soon.<eos> What's Smurfette doing here?<eos> Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.<eos> She tried to murder me!<eos> I saved you, you stupid fox!
Yondu?<eos> Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?<eos> That's what you told me, you old doofus.<eos> Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.<eos> Dive!<eos> Um... Captain?<eos> Captain?<eos> Tell me why Ego wants you here?
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants.<eos> He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
Yondu, we're about to blow!<eos> Get to the ship!<eos> Not without Quill!<eos> You need to take care of the twig!<eos> Not without you!
I had a pretty cool dad.<eos> What I'm trying to say here is... sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life... it's right there by your side all along.<eos> You don't even know it.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.
I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.<eos> I'm trying to make it right.<eos> There are little girls like you... across the universe who are in danger.
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.<eos> He did not.<eos> Fare thee well, old friend.<eos> Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
Really?<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, get on 17 now. We'll make you indispensable yet.
Go fetch!<eos> You go fetch it!<eos> Hey!<eos> What would you do without me?<eos> I'm gonna miss you.
It's okay. I got ya.<eos> You're okay. You're okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think the exit protocol doesn't apply to you?
Do you think the exit protocol doesn't apply to you?<eos> You could've caused an atmospheric breach, not to mention, died.<eos> Nobody rides unaccompanied, no matter who they are!<eos> Gardner, what's going on here?<eos> This isn't like you.
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.<eos> You got it. You got it.<eos> Keep going.<eos> There you go. Remember what you're running for.<eos> Assuming all goes well, I'm coming to see you.
But light.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> I believe the term is "euphoria."<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
Yeah, you completely blew me off. You didn't return any of my messages.<eos> I told you, I was taking a trip.<eos> For seven months?<eos> People have phones, you know? You can text, email.<eos> I couldn't contact you.
Very specific type of travel?<eos> Who even talks like that?<eos> Tulsa, can you slow down, 'cause gravity is very heavy.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that this is heavy for you, but I really do not appreciate being blown off by the one person who I don't...<eos> Tulsa, I would never ghost on you.
What are you wearing?<eos> This is so weird.<eos> Look, I have a lab, okay? So, I don't know.<eos> Um...<eos> Can you just stay here, all right? Do not move, Gardner.
You know, I don't like to be played, Gardner.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> Mars? Some weird disease?<eos> People have been lying to me my entire life, which is whatever, 'cause people suck.<eos> They suck. They lie. They use you to get what they want, and then they just throw you away.
So get out!<eos> Tulsa, I'm not lying to you.<eos> My mother was an astronaut.<eos> She made a mistake. I was born on Mars.<eos> Just because people lied to you before, it doesn't mean I'm lying now.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.<eos> Okay, just slow your roll, kid.<eos> You gotta calm down.<eos> I don't wanna calm down.<eos> And I don't understand why this is making you so upset.
You don't understand.<eos> On Mars, people, they didn't do this.<eos> We just had scientists and they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.
Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.<eos> I know what's gonna happen.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to Earth.
I mean, it's not real, you know?<eos> It's not how I pictured it.<eos> It's hurting my head to see it like this.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Gardner, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want.<eos> It gave me you.
You hear what I said?<eos> Whoa. Yeah, I did. Uh...<eos> But, Gardner, I think you're sick. None of this was how it was in my head.<eos> You need to go to the hospital. Except you.<eos> We need to get you to a hospital.
Scared me.<eos> You act like you hate the world so much, Tulsa.<eos> Save your strength.<eos> It's all an act.<eos> The beautiful music you make gives you away.
Just look better.<eos> This is the best place I've been so far.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's gonna love you.
You're my father.<eos> Yes.<eos> There they are!<eos> Hurry! There's no time!<eos> I knew I would find you.
But you've done this before? Yes.<eos> All the time.<eos> Virtually.<eos> Great. Buckle in.<eos> All right, let's buckle you in.
Are you ever gonna stop slapping me?<eos> You have to go back.<eos> No, Tulsa, don't... I hate it.<eos> But, Gardner, we both know you have to go back.<eos> I love you, Tulsa.
You have to go back.<eos> No, Tulsa, don't... I hate it.<eos> But, Gardner, we both know you have to go back.<eos> I love you, Tulsa.<eos> And I love you.
And you?<eos> You okay?<eos> Apparently.<eos> This is good to know.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Gardner.
Let's go visit your mom and dad.<eos> Now?<eos> I want to watch this.<eos> They'll be doing this all day.<eos> Your mom and dad appeared in my dream last night and said they missed you.
You must be hungry.<eos> I made your favorite, chicken stew.<eos> Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.
Jay. If this kid doesn't give her consent, what, we just abandon the mission? Is that what you're saying?<eos> 'Cause, brother, we've come halfway around the world for this.<eos> - We should get this done now.<eos> - Don't be so selfish.<eos> This isn't about you or us, and she is Okja's family.
Just what I need!<eos> Hey, Nance.<eos> How's London?<eos> Is that rain? That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
Really?<eos> They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?
You know, this is... this is the coolest mission ever.<eos> - I have all this stuff and...<eos> - Hey, K...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front.
We're just gonna take some of your meat.<eos> And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.<eos> We have tasters for that.<eos> They're a bunch of half-wit, degenerate fucktards!<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna poke you in five places.
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.
Watch out you don't fall in and drown.<eos> Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.<eos> There it is!<eos> Hello, Lucy!<eos> Lucy, we love you!
But, by God, did he know about business.<eos> Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.<eos> The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
- Why?<eos> Because I will be taking over the city.<eos> Mmm...<eos> - What?<eos> - Batman will stop you.
Because I will be taking over the city.<eos> Mmm...<eos> - What?<eos> - Batman will stop you.<eos> He always stops you.
Me!<eos> The Joker!<eos> Joker, do you read me?<eos> 10-4, girl buddy.<eos> We're ready for you, sugar plum.
Phone call for Commissioner Gordon.<eos> Hello? Batman?<eos> Hi, Jimmy!<eos> It's the Jokes. Oop!<eos> Nobody calls you that.
You're making me look bad in front of Batman!<eos> 'Puter, where's the bomb?<eos> The bomb is located at the base of the energy core.<eos> What the... ♪ I get the last laugh, I get the final grin ♪<eos> ♪ Throw you into the asylum With Harley Quinn ♪
♪ I'm Batman! ♪<eos> ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey! ♪<eos> ♪ I'm Batman! ♪<eos> Hi, Batman!<eos> So weird to keep running into you.
You know why?<eos> Because I'm always one step ahead of you.<eos> And I always get away!<eos> Not this time.<eos> 'Cause this time... I got you.
No, I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Who else drives you to one-up them the way that I do?
I am fighting a few different people.<eos> What?<eos> I like to fight around.<eos> Okay, look, I'm fine with you fighting other people if you wanna do that, but what we have is special.<eos> So, when people ask you...
- What?<eos> As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.
You did it!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - Thank you, Batman.<eos> - Oh, my pleasure.<eos> Batman, we love you!
- Batman, you're the greatest!<eos> - Oh, pray hands, pray hands.<eos> - Thanks for saving the city!<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Batman, I love you more than my kids!
Ta-da!<eos> And how am I supposed to get Batman's respect when I'm working with these human farts?<eos> Boo-boo, look at me.<eos> You're too good for Batman.<eos> He needs to open his eyes and see what it feels like when you're not around.
I surrender!<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Cool it.<eos> You're a criminal.<eos> You run, and I catch you.
You're a criminal.<eos> You run, and I catch you.<eos> Not anymore, Batman.<eos> You were right. There is no "us."<eos> So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore.
- What?<eos> I probably shouldn't leave until I get the thumbs up from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Bruno and I decided to share custody of you.
Right now.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Don't worry about it, dawg.<eos> I'm not here to throw down or anything.<eos> Uh, no, I would crush you.
I am?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I wanna be just like you when I grow up, Padre!<eos> Wait, what did you call me?<eos> I called you Padre.
Yeah, I could've been saying it that way.<eos> Then I'll allow it.<eos> Oh, you're such a great padre!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to give you a big old hug.
Unlimited!<eos> All right, kid.<eos> We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.<eos> So, lesson number three.<eos> When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally.
I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.<eos> I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.<eos> But you're not who I thought you were.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.<eos> Yeah, bad guy.<eos> - My name is Phyllis.<eos> - Oh, that was my grandma's name.<eos> Now hold still while I scan you.
- Batman.<eos> - Would you stop doing that?<eos> I sent the Bat-Fax.<eos> I hate to say this, but you're right.<eos> The city needs you.
Or there's no way - to blast these monsters... - Monsters.<eos> - ...back to the Phantom Zone.<eos> - Phantom Zone?<eos> Yep.<eos> Batman, I really don't need you to finish my...
Gotcha!<eos> Barbara, did you see that?<eos> Batrope saved Alfred.<eos> Sick moves, rope.<eos> I never doubted you, bro.
- Hey, Bat-Dad.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.
- A family battle mission!<eos> - Right.<eos> Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> - Anything for you, Padre.
Bruce Wayne's house?<eos> You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.<eos> What happened to all your friends?<eos> I don't need friends.<eos> I don't need anyone to stop you.
I don't need friends.<eos> I don't need anyone to stop you.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Look in the mirror, Batman.<eos> When I saw you working with your friend-family, I actually thought you'd changed.
I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!<eos> That is right.<eos> Respect!<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,<eos> "I hate you, Joker"?
Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.<eos> That's for darn sure.<eos> Annoyed is not the same thing!<eos> Listen, Batman.<eos> I... hate you.
Well, yeah.<eos> Are they really the ones you're protecting?<eos> Computer, Batman's in danger.<eos> Please, Computer, take us back!<eos> Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?
Don't do what I would do!<eos> I never even taught you how to drive!<eos> Hold on a second, Brick Lady.<eos> I'm so sorry. I need to get down there and stop this.<eos> I can't let you go.
What is that?<eos> I don't...<eos> You gotta turn around.<eos> I call it the Babs-Signal.<eos> And I'm flipping the switch for you.
Bat?<eos> How about a cool costume?<eos> Nice!<eos> That one's called Batgirl.<eos> If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?
Stop moving around, you Muggles.<eos> All right, team, let's shut him down.<eos> Orca! You're up, baby!<eos> You wanna see a magic trick?<eos> I'm gonna make you disappear.
You got this, Alfred?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Abs of steel.<eos> Great!<eos> Now you bend, and I'll grab the other side!
Now you bend, and I'll grab the other side!<eos> No!<eos> - Batman, what's going on?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> I've got you.
No! I'm not gonna help you.<eos> At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!<eos> I'm gonna have to die to know it.<eos> Shut up, Joker!<eos> If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.
If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.
Why?<eos> Because I need you to crunch them.<eos> Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.
Because I need you to crunch them.<eos> Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.
Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.
I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.
Who?<eos> - Superman.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> It's you.
I love it!<eos> White.<eos> All important movies end with a white screen.<eos> And tying up loose ends.<eos> We're coming for you, Gotham City!
- It's the rules.<eos> Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello! we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello! we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.<eos> And give you lots of hugs and kisses and tell you what a sweet little boy you are.
And give you lots of hugs and kisses and tell you what a sweet little boy you are.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Danny's been kind of a problem.<eos> Uh... I didn't mean to spook you.
Uh... I didn't mean to spook you.<eos> uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Don't think I've seen you around here before.
- What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you. It...<eos> It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.
It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.<eos> hey...<eos> And I will make sure that you're arrested.
okay?<eos> You can talk to the police. That's who you can talk to.<eos> I have been met with nothing but anger and hostility since I've been home.<eos> And honestly... it's kind of aggravating.<eos> So I'm going to ask you one last time.
I know you know more.<eos> I was 15 when they died.<eos> Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?<eos> And why do you care?
It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.<eos> Ask Master Lei Kung the Thunderer.<eos> I'm asking you... nicely... one last time.
Is this another one of your stupid tests?<eos> I'm not behind it. so that I don't see my company destroyed.<eos> - So it's your company now?<eos> - It's always been my company.<eos> I could just ignore you.
No.<eos> Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay. and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?
Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Maybe the truth is somewhere in between.<eos> If you wish to see the truth... then hold no opinions.<eos> It's a Zen saying.<eos> then... I guess I should call you Danny?
- No.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Simon... no!<eos> I was just saying hello to the new guy.<eos> We're gonna get you cleaned up now.
I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?<eos> business as usual.<eos> I'll back you.
He's your tour guide.<eos> You gonna try and stab me?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I get stressed.<eos> but don't let that fool you.
too.<eos> For... for what?<eos> For being alive.<eos> That's just stupid.<eos> Apologize now or I'm going to hurt you.
You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?<eos> okay?<eos> one of the richest families in New York?<eos> Yeah. And they have a problem with you?
Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> Do you remember that song I used to sing... that would annoy the shit out of you?
you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
and I'm gonna make you a great man.<eos> Just cooperate.<eos> I get it.<eos> Ward.<eos> I love you so much.
- Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> whatever.<eos> But you sleep in that corner.<eos> And you don't go anywhere near the students.
but... - Yeah.<eos> It's all I got.<eos> it doesn't sound ridiculous.<eos> I was 13 when Dad died.<eos> And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.
You think I could cover that with what I make pushing a broom?<eos> but those private fights are illegal. you want to bust me for making a dollar fighting?<eos> Darryl.<eos> they ask about character as well as skill.<eos> I want to be able to give you the highest recommendation.
I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.<eos> Where was my office?<eos> Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.
my firm is on permanent retainer for Rand.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> We have a suite set up for occasions like this.<eos> I need you to lay low... and I need you to keep from drawing any attention to yourself.
Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you... you've got your look.
Stay loose. Good.<eos> Good. Nice.<eos> move! Keep it moving.<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> Don't let him get you. Don't let him get you.
I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you... that's fine.<eos> You know I back you no matter what.
Back up.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Isn't it obvious?<eos> he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.
Fighters... huh?<eos> - For him?<eos> - Cut the bullshit.<eos> you tap out.<eos> I warned you last time about the biting.
You died.<eos> - I saw pictures.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did die.<eos> You look the same age as when I last saw you.
too.<eos> are you sure you should be saying this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.
It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.<eos> I've got two kids to take care of. and it placed me in their debt.<eos> And they cured you?
- No. what they failed to tell me was that I had to die first.<eos> I still remember my last breath.<eos> Scariest shit I've ever experienced.<eos> And three days later... I'm breathing again.<eos> who saved you?
You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.<eos> but they never get to see you go all out.
she will.<eos> son.<eos> This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?
It was horrible.<eos> Anyway... and I didn't like it.<eos> so...<eos> I had to do the right thing.<eos> I think Harold would have been crazy proud of you.
This guy's twice your weight.<eos> How about you add another fighter?<eos> you double my payday.<eos> you know that?<eos> But I like you.
Ward said to buy it. I facilitated its purchase.<eos> for chief counsel to... buy things without knowing why?<eos> I don't really need to know the "why.<eos> Ward's leadership has led Rand to success after success and...<eos> Why are you so interested in this?
- But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.
Me, too.<eos> How'd the meeting go?<eos> Exactly what you said.<eos> They don't have a case.<eos> You don't seem especially happy about it.
Use your hips more.<eos> Better.<eos> Oh, what was that?<eos> Come on, hit me.<eos> You are not to be underestimated, Claire.
Guess I got tired of people doing things for me all the time.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> In that case, we better keep practicing.<eos> You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.
Stacks and stacks of synthetic heroin.<eos> Wouldn't they hide it?<eos> They don't have to.<eos> They own the pier.<eos> I just need you to watch my back.
You're joking.<eos> You want me to come with you?<eos> I'm just a karate teacher, Danny.<eos> No, you're not. You're a fighter.<eos> I know you've been testing yourself - in an underground fight club. - What...
Daniel Rand's miraculous return to Rand Enterprises is making headlines once again after a video where he apologizes for a corporate scandal puts the fate of the company at stake.<eos> Suck on that, Dad.<eos> A spokesperson for the class action suit claimed that Rand Enterprises callously turned a blind eye when it was brought to their attention that a chemical plant may have been responsible for 15 cases of cancer in a Staten Island neighborhood,<eos> Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
I got used to it as a kid.<eos> Well, just watch yourself.<eos> How so?<eos> You've gone from homeless man to billionaire in a matter of days.<eos> All that money, press, power, makes you a target.
there will always be forces gathering against you... waiting... looking for a weakness in you.
- She may be in one of these...<eos> - Stop with your crazy story.<eos> - We have a real problem.<eos> - This is a real problem.<eos> Have you seen the video of you apologizing?
I have a vision of total victory and nothing else.<eos> It's the reason I've gotten this far.<eos> Defeat has no place in my mind.<eos> This isn't a tournament. Or any kind of challenge you're used to.<eos> If you lose... they'll kill you.
Keep him calm.<eos> do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.
The challenge has begun.<eos> You cannot be in two places at once.<eos> You must be a double-edged sword.<eos> So you know how to fight.<eos> But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.
Or did you come here to destroy the Hand?<eos> - Is that why you're here?<eos> - I don't think he knows why he's here.<eos> He's just a little boy chasing girls.<eos> The enemy will try and divide you.
Let it take you.<eos> You're trying to get my heart racing to spread the poison faster.<eos> Good!<eos> This is the real you.<eos> and I will let you be who you want to be.
isn't it?<eos> The one who feels everything and can't control himself.<eos> They wanted you to push it down.<eos> But it's here at last.<eos> I hear you crying at night in your room.
Well... we seem to be having a problem here.<eos> I was feeling a little...<eos> I... I hurt my hand.<eos> Joy.<eos> Let's get you out of here.
I swear on the lives of my children, I have nothing to do with Danny Rand.<eos> Harold, we have a problem.<eos> You killed them.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> They were going to kill you, Danny.
Hey, don't play her game.<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.
Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?<eos> To remind me of my mistakes.<eos> Do you understand how stupid that was?<eos> What if someone had seen you in there?
- I'm glad you did.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I need your help with something over at the penthouse.<eos> It's important. Really not a good time.<eos> Hey, I need you, son.
Okay. "My actions were impulsive, and I now realize the severity of my words."<eos> Is this an apology?<eos> No, it's the statement you're gonna be making at the board meeting this afternoon.<eos> It sort of seems like an apology.<eos> Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.
I, uh, I talked to Danny.<eos> He said he's gonna apologize to the board.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.
He said he's gonna apologize to the board.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.
There are places... discreet places... that could help you.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
Mostly.<eos> You deserve this.<eos> For your work ethic, your commitment to the code, and, most importantly, honoring and protecting your fellow classmates.<eos> You're part of something bigger than yourself now, Darryl.<eos> And that will make you stronger.
For your work ethic, your commitment to the code, and, most importantly, honoring and protecting your fellow classmates.<eos> You're part of something bigger than yourself now, Darryl.<eos> And that will make you stronger.<eos> A single arrow is easily broken... but not ten in a bundle.<eos> I came to warn you.
How did you know?<eos> How did you know - about the account?<eos> - I always knew.<eos> Did you really think it was that easy to steal millions of dollars from the company and not get caught?<eos> Come on, I thought I raised you smarter than that.
Much simpler.<eos> I am sick of it!<eos> The control, the manipulation...<eos> Yeah, I know you're upset.<eos> You don't see it now, but I had to stop you from leaving.
Now, if you had run away, run away like a scared child, you would have regretted it every day for the rest of your life.<eos> Now, relax.<eos> You just had a moment of weakness.<eos> Eh, it happens.<eos> I'm not gonna punish you for it.
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.
Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> The hell is wrong with you?<eos> I thought you were one of them.
- The Hand.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> I think you should sit down.
You can't believe anything that she says to you.<eos> Look, that may be true.<eos> But if there's even the smallest chance that I can find out the truth, then I have to go.<eos> Otherwise, it's just gonna be this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.
Actually, yes, it is.<eos> Not too long ago, you were fighting like a rabid animal to keep Danny from taking away control of this company.<eos> You know...<eos> I've been thinking a lot lately about that last summer in the Hamptons with Dad.<eos> Do you remember... what you said you wanted to be when you grew up?
The handwriting is distinctly not feminine.<eos> He'll be glad to hear that.<eos> "He" is?<eos> Presently unavailable.<eos> Danny, I want to ask you something.
Say everything that's going through your head. Just let it out.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just feel like you can't.<eos> You just need to focus on something else.
What happened next?<eos> Mom! It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.
Mom! It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.<eos> Dad! I love you, Danny!
It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.<eos> And the rest?<eos> Is glad I found you.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
Exploiting his corporate crusader image?<eos> Exposing the board for wanting to oust us because we wanted to stop poisoning people?<eos> I'm sorry, but that is a profoundly stupid idea.<eos> You can't keep him in line.<eos> Every time he opens his mouth, he digs you deeper into the hole.
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?
I just have no idea who you've been seeing, or what you've been reading, or... anything about your life outside of Rand.<eos> We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.
One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> From what?<eos> Ward, I love you.
You're the person I most admire.<eos> Come on.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't know anyone as brilliant or as fearless.<eos> You come up with these crazy ideas. And you stand your ground, even when the entire board tries to fight you on it.
Sounds good.<eos> You ready?<eos> All set.<eos> That looks like the tattoo on your chest.<eos> How are you connected to these people?
I suspect our guests may be from a bit further away.<eos> Go and find out.<eos> Find Claire.<eos> I'm gonna go after Gao.<eos> She's expecting you.
What are you doing?<eos> Come on. No.<eos> Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is... I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
I don't understand why we had to bring her here.<eos> Never let the enemy choose the battlefield.<eos> Always work from a position of strength.<eos> Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.
I don't believe you.<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Just stay away.<eos> Don't go near there, okay?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> If you don't get out of here, I will bust your head wide open.<eos> Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own. Your choice.<eos> After your mother delivered you... the nurse wrapped you in a blanket... placed you in my arms.
I've destroyed everything that ever mattered to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant it.<eos> Please, please, please, please, forgive me.<eos> I love you. I love you so much.
Please, please, please, please, forgive me.<eos> I love you. I love you so much.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> You're my son, and I love you.
So... what do you want, Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
So you'll let me go?<eos> I want my family back, healthy and whole.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'll do anything, anything to make that happen.<eos> I was only trying to toughen you up so you could... face this world and win.
I hope someday you can understand that.<eos> Then I can go?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.
Is there any vanilla?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I don't like all these fancy flavors.<eos> Vanilla's fine for me.<eos> I go to all the trouble of, uh, getting you all this ice cream, and all you can do is complain. Oh! No, no, no!
- I'm not an addict.<eos> The heroin that the cops found in your car tells a different story.<eos> As does your father's very public death from cancer.<eos> So, where would you like to begin?<eos> I missed you so much.
You know, we just do the best we can.<eos> Do you remember those nights?<eos> When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed.
Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile. You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.
I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy, I... I love you.
What?<eos> Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you. I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...
Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.<eos> Thanks for showing me how to heal her.<eos> Of course.<eos> I see it took a lot out of you, though.
What do you mean?<eos> Colleen told me you were the Iron Fist, the Immortal Weapon.<eos> Uh... not many people know what that is.<eos> Well, it's always been a special interest of mine.<eos> But you weren't taught how to recharge your chi?
Why are you frowning?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.
She's very special.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.<eos> She's just being protective.<eos> Does that bother you?
We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.<eos> This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.
I thought they were fairy tales for children... until I was gifted that film.<eos> Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist. What it was capable of.<eos> What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.
People like Colleen.<eos> People like you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm a billionaire.<eos> Is that how you feel?
- Come on. Open it.<eos> - and I'm...<eos> I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me. Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.
- Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...<eos> - I already met you!
How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.
I'm not sure I can explain.<eos> You owe me an answer.<eos> The people of K'un-Lun need to know why they were abandoned.<eos> And what about the people here?<eos> The ones who were just trying to kill you?
You have failed, Danny.<eos> Failed in every way.<eos> The Fist won't even ignite now.<eos> Our only chance may be to return and submit to Lei Kung.<eos> And let's hope he can restore you, because if not... I don't know what happens.
- He's troubled.<eos> He's confused as to why you would abandon your post and leave us unprotected.<eos> yeah... he's also very pissed.<eos> Davos?<eos> I saw you taken by those men outside that dojo.
too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing.<eos> - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.
The Iron Fist must be controlled.<eos> The Hand needs him.<eos> you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Danny. I've been looking everywhere for you.
In case we're being followed.<eos> I've... I've already checked.<eos> Twice.<eos> - Just do it again.<eos> - I'm... I'm not going to leave you.
These are Rand accounts.<eos> - It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> Joy!<eos> I am so proud of you.
He always does.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.
What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.
Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.
Wait.<eos> I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?
Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> Danny.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.
He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Joy. He was just respecting my wishes.<eos> He was trying to keep you safe.
Even if we have to murder people to do it?<eos> Joy.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> I just got you back.
what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
I blame myself for this.<eos> I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.
you look pretty broken to me.<eos> Shit!<eos> She broke my damn nose.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> I didn't let you drive because it's not my car.
And look what a mess you've made here.<eos> I've seen this world.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.<eos> Come home.<eos> what is keeping you here?
Oh, shit.<eos> - Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here. And most importantly, I can free you from your father.
And you're saying you would share this with Rand?<eos> All of this and freedom from your father forever.<eos> It sounds good, no?<eos> Yeah. Good.<eos> I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.
Don't let him bait you.<eos> It's all he knows. All he's ever been taught.<eos> When did you become such a milkmaid, Danny?<eos> We're gonna take care of Bakuto, and we're doing it with Colleen.<eos> You know, this place has confused you.
- "Crazy in Love"?<eos> I know it wasn't easy being there by my side during those treatments.<eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> I mean, those moments...<eos> - I felt like I had you all to myself.
- Well, I'm...<eos> I'm helping Dad free us from the Hand.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's using you, Joy.
- No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a...<eos> It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you. It was a mistake.<eos> Never trust him again.<eos> Joy. I love you.
There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.<eos> We're going to change the world.<eos> Well, the promises I've made you are still in place.<eos> I'll help you realign your chi so you can access the Iron Fist again.<eos> I'll help you become what you were meant to be.
I'll help you become what you were meant to be.<eos> I don't even know what I'm meant be.<eos> How are you gonna help?<eos> I kind of got this feeling you're not allowed to kill me.<eos> That doesn't mean I won't do what it takes to subdue you.
You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.<eos> He's trying to draw you out.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.
- It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?
K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.
Stepping out in public?<eos> Ward. The time is now.<eos> Combination the same?<eos> I didn't even know that was there.<eos> the world thinks you're dead.
buddy Bakuto has.<eos> Now we'll get rich both ends.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You owe Danny.<eos> He freed you from the Hand.
Because you know I didn't kill your parents.<eos> Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?<eos> It was someone much more treacherous than I. as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.<eos> She is playing mind games.<eos> She's trying to get you on her side.
okay? but Bakuto?<eos> I really wanted to kill Bakuto. otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you. What?
- Ward.<eos> right?<eos> You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.
I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Which part?<eos> or when you failed to do it?<eos> I'm sorry that you got hurt.<eos> I swear I was trying to protect you.
you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?<eos> Who forced you to lie about that?
what are you doing here?<eos> You shouldn't be out of the hospital.<eos> I had to get out of there.<eos> Yeah. Look... I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home.
Yeah. Look... I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Ward said I could find you here.
I saw everything that you had on the Hand's drug operation.<eos> Remember?<eos> so... tell me the truth.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.
Let's get ready for him.<eos> no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> and I'll hit you again.
and I think that's my greatest regret.<eos> That I didn't kill Wendell then... before you were even born.<eos> you destroyed my family!<eos> Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.
I can go there.<eos> It's my choice!<eos> but you won't. That's why you're gonna die.<eos> Better that than to live like you.<eos> Hated by those who should love you no matter what.
Give your Uncle Harold a hug.<eos> Finish me off.<eos> finish me off.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Come out of the darkness so I can see you.
Any news from Joy?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.
'Cause I'm gonna need it.<eos> It's time for you to go to bed now.<eos> I want you to come brush your teeth, okay?<eos> Baby.<eos> I'm proud of you.
It's a tool that astronauts use to prepare for space flight.<eos> Yeah, you may think so, but you will not catch me anywhere near that thing.<eos> Just looking at it throws me off my equilibrium.<eos> My mom hates any kind of amusement park ride.<eos> Remember what happened when we were at Wonderland, and I convinced you to go on the space coaster with me?
Well, let's hope so.<eos> It's hard to adjust to a new town.<eos> Well, you're not on the mean streets of Cleveland anymore.<eos> And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.<eos> 'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.
And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.<eos> 'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.<eos> Well, there's always an exception to the rule.<eos> Lucky for me.<eos> He really likes you.
Kinda like what I'm getting from you, right now, watching you.<eos> But you went to like a whole other level.<eos> You-- you've gone method, my friend.<eos> What are you talking about, Langley?<eos> You're really falling for her, aren't you?
- I went to prison.<eos> You got to go free.<eos> Please. You owe me.<eos> -I did-- -you owe me. You owe me.<eos> And I will rat on you.
You better, because that thing is priceless.<eos> Remember? My father spent his whole life trying to get it back, and he died in squalor, begging for assistance from anyone.<eos> I'm not goin' like that.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I hope so, 'cause I'd hate to recast you.
I guess your pal Ozzie isn't here to save you this time.<eos> Sorry, I don't fight girls.<eos> How unfortunate.<eos> Because I'm sick of you science geeks and your dumb Adventure Club.<eos> -We never invited you to be a part of it.
The clubhouse!<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> You know, I think we can help each other out.<eos> Let's just say I'm the guy who understands your situation.<eos> You don't have many friends 'cause you got a bad rap for being a bully when really you were the one who's excluded and was misunderstood.
-Hi. Wow, that's a cool jacket.<eos> Look at all those pockets.<eos> A fella could hide a lot in there, huh?<eos> I'm sorry. Would you mind excusing me for a moment?<eos> Really good to see you.
Have it handled?<eos> Did you find it?<eos> -No.<eos> -Exactly.<eos> It would have been really nice for you to be here.
Sure, I'm at your service.<eos> We need something from you.<eos> Does this have anything to do at all with what we talked about the other day?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry. We should have listened to you.
Okay.<eos> About anything in particular?<eos> I need to tell you that--<eos> Martin, it's okay.<eos> I just- - I wanted to tell you how much I... care about you.
Martin, it's okay.<eos> I just- - I wanted to tell you how much I... care about you.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Good.<eos> I care about you, too.
Don't go away.<eos> I guess this proves you losers aren't much of an Adventure Club after all.<eos> Seth, don't do this.<eos> You're not one of the bad guys.<eos> I'm sorry we never included you in our club.
I'll see ya in the big house, where you belong.<eos> Oh, and Jane, don't wait for me.<eos> Live your life, you rambling rose.<eos> Martin, don't listen to him.<eos> Langley blackmailed you.
Have you at least started answering the phone?<eos> Only you could turn that big personal victory into a defeat.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - Sentences that start like that.<eos> You're not comfortable with what you've become.
- You okay?<eos> Mind if I tell you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out... it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.
- Mr. Murdock...<eos> - Mr. Murdock, sir...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.<eos> I'm sorry. After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.
Wrong number.<eos> Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.
Harlem's gone through changes.<eos> It was bound to happen.<eos> What's Mariah doing?<eos> The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.
- Thanks.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> But I'm glad to see you're settling in.<eos> Hey, Misty.<eos> It's good to see you.
Yeah, right.<eos> Have you tried tracking the call yet?<eos> It doesn't work that way. You can reroute phone numbers.<eos> I mean, maybe he didn't, though.<eos> Maybe he's just a regular guy trying to throw you off the scent.
New Yorkers like saying that.<eos> Still, after all this time, I... I don't know how I feel about it.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> It can be whatever you need it to be.<eos> What do you need it to be?
If I ever come across that warrior again, I'll be prepared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I've been thinking about the man who died in the sewer.<eos> He called you Iron Fist.
Are you hunting criminals?<eos> 'Cause I thought you said you were gonna take it easy on that for a while.<eos> Look, someone's hiring young men in Harlem to do their dirty work.<eos> Misty said the NYPD doesn't know what these young men are doing, but the body count's growing, so...<eos> Okay. Is the NYPD gonna pay you for doing their job?
- You haven't returned my calls.<eos> - I haven't returned anybody's calls.<eos> I couldn't help but take it personally.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> I'm here to ask you to be careful.
I didn't stumble onto anything.<eos> I took a case on purpose.<eos> - Oh, I... I heard you'd put that off.<eos> - You heard wrong.<eos> Listen, I... I know you well enough, so I'm going to say this very simply.
They just found enough C-4 in that motel room to level a city block.<eos> What do you think it looks like?<eos> The government is not going to rest until they've got him.<eos> I just... I don't wanna see you caught in the cross fire.<eos> Is this about protecting me or protecting you?
- I've only seen him a couple times.<eos> Try around 151st and Amsterdam.<eos> If this isn't the truth, I'll be back.<eos> And you won't like me then.<eos> I don't like you now.
Get on your knees, now!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Everyone else on your side is dead.<eos> You know who I am, I know who you are, so let's skip the wartime banter.
It's all right.<eos> Stand down.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> We are your family.<eos> I have waited so long to meet you.
Bring it to her.<eos> You asked me a question.<eos> This is the answer.<eos> This is who you are.<eos> She's ready for you.
- Elektra.<eos> - The vessel you knew is gone.<eos> Only the Black Sky lives.<eos> Listen to me, kid. She's full of shit.<eos> - We gotta get you out...
But I know what I am.<eos> You asked for it... Elektra.<eos> You'll die here tonight, old man.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Don't you bet on it.
- Hi, sweetie.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hi, Mom.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.
Like you were helping to clean up.<eos> - Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> You don't take the blame for something that's not yours.<eos> - Whoever hired you...
They got eyes and ears all over.<eos> And the longer you talk to me, the worse it looks.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> - Who's the guy in the white hat?<eos> - Man, would you stay away?
- If you just give me a minute?<eos> - Great.<eos> We met the other night.<eos> Oh, we didn't meet, son.<eos> God himself sent you.
My father made sure of it.<eos> But it might not be too late.<eos> Cole was working for some bad people.<eos> I'm going to stop 'em.<eos> May the Lord bless and keep you for doing his work.
But, please, go on.<eos> You were telling us what you were going to do.<eos> - Murdock!<eos> - We need to leave now.<eos> If you grab me like that again, I'll punch you so hard, you'll see.
- From where? - Prison.<eos> Yeah, we'll... we'll talk about it later.<eos> How'd you end up here?<eos> - I'm working a case.<eos> - Yeah? How's that going for you so far?
- Ms. Jones, lose my card.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.
- I did.<eos> You smashed it.<eos> I'm not threatening you.<eos> I'm just stating the obvious.<eos> They saw you fight.
They're two seconds away from figuring it out themselves.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> - Nothing. And I want zero to do with this ancient organization.<eos> I just want to crack my case.<eos> And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing.
I promise you, you cannot fight these people.<eos> Not even with whatever it is your hand can do.<eos> - It's chi.<eos> - It's not.<eos> What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed.
You have your sport, I have mine.<eos> Ten days, I tracked him.<eos> We sparred in the forest.<eos> He nearly killed me.<eos> They always nearly kill you.
Three of them.<eos> Only three?<eos> They were rather exceptional.<eos> And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.
Then, as we used to say...<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape.<eos> Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you.
How come no one told me?<eos> There are things I don't know.<eos> Why are you here, Stick?<eos> Because this one, the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon and protector of the ancient city, is still a thundering dumbass.<eos> Shit like that... will get you killed.
I told her where I was.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties. These are what they'll use to end you.
This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I just want to get answers for my client. I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.
With who?<eos> Don't bullshit me.<eos> Elektra.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I know you, son.
She hesitated.<eos> She didn't kill me. She had...<eos> She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
What do you want?<eos> Kid, don't even think about it.<eos> I just want an answer.<eos> I might even let them go free.<eos> You walk with her... and I'll take you out myself.
What's he thinking?<eos> - He's not.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.
Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.
This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!
It's our only way out.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> And where's the Black Sky?<eos> That's a question for our leader.<eos> - Man, am I glad to see you.
I'm fine.<eos> Actually, I'm, uh... I'm better than fine.<eos> I got one of theirs.<eos> You're skilled, my child.<eos> It's clear, watching you fight, that you know much more than anyone can learn in a single life.
She wasn't a warrior.<eos> She wasn't like you and me.<eos> And now I know... I was never meant to raise her.<eos> I was meant to raise the Black Sky.<eos> I'm grateful for you.
The woman on the radio.<eos> They'll come for them next.<eos> How many mice must drown with you?<eos> He talked too much.<eos> - Claire, I need you to get dressed.
That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.
- He give you anything yet?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> If she's as sweet as she smells, - I get why you're tore up about this one.<eos> - Don't bring her into this.<eos> All these years, this is what I've been protecting you from.
For a man who believes in God, you sure like denying<eos> - He has a plan for you. - Don't use my faith against me.<eos> And what about this city?<eos> The place you can't live without.<eos> The place that made you what you really are.
Well, it went south fast, and you may be in danger. Me?<eos> It doesn't matter. I can't just leave those people.<eos> They are safer far away from us.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.
I feel lost.<eos> I can't believe I'm admitting this, but... all I want... is something stable.<eos> Something I can hold on to.<eos> Funny you should say that.<eos> Because I know you.
Think she's here to write a story?<eos> Doesn't look like it.<eos> You, too?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Oh, my God, am I glad to see you.
It is not as simple this time.<eos> Or you are not as committed.<eos> Your judgment has always been clouded when it comes to your old disciples.<eos> Just because I don't blind my disciples, doesn't mean I'm made weak by them.<eos> - It's good to see you.
Daredevil.<eos> - I mean, it's... it's kind of cool.<eos> I'm gonna make this real simple.<eos> You're gonna answer our questions or shit's gonna get dark in here.<eos> What do they call you?
I believe you have.<eos> You made a unilateral decision and used the last of the substance to resurrect her.<eos> And now, we are all vulnerable.<eos> Actually, I have never felt better than with her at my side.<eos> Except, it's not about you.
You need me.<eos> We all need each other.<eos> This is exactly how they work.<eos> They divide us. They get into our heads. They weaken us.<eos> They make you question the people you trust. Danny, just take a deep breath and calm down.
You know how they can operate.<eos> And now we know what they need.<eos> It's you, kid.<eos> Stick, you're falling for their trap.<eos> If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.
- Not anymore.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> Hey, you guys seriously need to back off.<eos> You just stay here.<eos> We can keep you safe, all right?
We think there's more to your dad's story.<eos> If you could just answer a couple of questions, it'd be a tremendous help.<eos> Closed door used to mean something.<eos> My apologies.<eos> In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.
There was a man.<eos> They call him the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> And in this other life, he let Elektra die.<eos> Is he the one I faced in battle?<eos> He may try to deceive you again and turn you away from us.
But even our bodies have always had limits.<eos> And when death doesn't come from outside forces... sometimes the organism tries to end itself.<eos> The thing I need is a substance that we first discovered at K'un-Lun.<eos> And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.
And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I knew you would be our salvation.<eos> And then seeing you, I realized that after all this time, and even with the others at my side... I was tired of being alone.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Alexandra said I didn't know what you were.<eos> She was right.<eos> You were our weapon.<eos> But they made you theirs.
- Matthew.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> All right? You don't belong to them.<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> It's good to see you.
The Chaste needs Matt Murdock.<eos> I've tried... but I couldn't convince him.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You let him off the hook.<eos> I've sent you to do things a lot harder than this, Elektra.
I've sent you to do things a lot harder than this, Elektra.<eos> I did everything you said.<eos> I made him give in to his darkest impulses, but he's stubborn.<eos> I can't change his mind or who he is.<eos> Instead, you let him change who you are.
Instead, you let him change who you are.<eos> - That's not what happened.<eos> - 'Course it is.<eos> When have you ever come to me with your tail between your legs, making excuses?<eos> Thought you were stronger than that, but... here you are, 'cause... you fell in love.
Harlem precinct. Private office.<eos> And if we're painting the whole picture, you look like shit.<eos> - They took your shirt for blood samples.<eos> - Right.<eos> Claire gave you a quick look. Nothing's broken.
She killed Stick.<eos> Yeah, Danny.<eos> They took Danny.<eos> And then now, I have to save him from the Hand.<eos> You are in no position to save anybody.
- You guys okay?<eos> - I'll live.<eos> I don't suppose either of you snuck a flask in here.<eos> How are we gonna get out of this?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Deep down inside... he is still just a kid looking for his family.<eos> With me... and with them... almost had it.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About?<eos> Look, I brought you in to help one family.
- There is no plan.<eos> - I can tell.<eos> - Look, Luke, I am your friend.<eos> - I know, Misty.<eos> That's why I'm trying to protect you.
I don't think you understand the gravity of your current situation.<eos> Your real life and your other life are two trains dangerously close to colliding right now.<eos> I am well aware.<eos> Did you hear what that cop said?<eos> If you're ever investigated, you lose everything.
They'd reopen every case.<eos> Matter of fact, I come with you. We both get disbarred.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know. And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.
I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know. And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.<eos> So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.
So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> 'Cause the people in this building need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer.
I listened.<eos> In doing so, they guaranteed that only one thing could open it.<eos> Another Iron Fist.<eos> Behind that door is the true power of the Hand.<eos> And you expect me to open it for you?
That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you.
They told me all about you.<eos> About your struggle.<eos> But what was it for?<eos> You're still at this alone.<eos> Especially since you know that your precious elders chose to keep you in the dark.
Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe I did run.<eos> Maybe there were things in this world that I wasn't ready to confront.<eos> But you... you are not one of them.<eos> I should warn you, I'm stronger than I look.
For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?<eos> The circumstances could be better.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.
Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.<eos> To be who you were meant to be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.<eos> Asshole!<eos> What the hell did I just walk into?<eos> I ask myself that all the time.<eos> Drop it, or I'm dropping you.
Danny, light it up.<eos> Now.<eos> - Remember this?<eos> - Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.
- Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen. Raised you.
As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen. Raised you.<eos> Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.
Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> She's losing too much blood.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?
- No, I'm gonna meet you up there.<eos> - What?<eos> I can get through to her.<eos> - You back on that again?<eos> - We're not gonna leave you here.
Let's go!<eos> Are you done hiding behind your friends?<eos> You're the one who's hiding, Elektra.<eos> What do you want, Matthew?<eos> I lost you once.
What do you want, Matthew?<eos> I lost you once.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> I know... I know I loved you.
You know nothing.<eos> I know... I know I loved you.<eos> - Your heart will be your downfall.<eos> - Please...<eos> listen to me. - I don't want to hurt you.
We can still walk out of here.<eos> Together.<eos> Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> Before they took you from me.
Together.<eos> Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> Before they took you from me.<eos> Before they turned you into their weapon.
This is what we get, isn't it?<eos> For ever thinking we could make it work.<eos> Who says we didn't?<eos> We're together.<eos> Something I've wanted since I first laid eyes on you.
I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's... all of our losses.<eos> I should go.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a... It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...<eos> "Connections"?<eos> He owns it.<eos> Maybe they can help.<eos> Get you back up and running.
You, uh...<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.<eos> Look, I know you, Danny.
You like Twix?<eos> Um, also got, uh, some Sour Patch Kids, some...<eos> Got one of these... kind of weird ice cream sandwich things.<eos> Why do you have so many snacks?<eos> Did, like, a fifth-grade class invite you over for their slumber party?
You know, like... what you're going through, you know, being an addict and everything like that.<eos> I don't know. I feel like I told you what I wanted to say.<eos> I thought you wanted to tell me something.<eos> No, I just...<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess I just figured since... I kissed you, like, right after you told me, I didn't really give you an opportunity to... unpack it.
I don't know.<eos> I just feel like, for me, I just need to take a year off and get my head on straight.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Good for you.
- None of my business. - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Honestly, I'm just not that equipped to deal with a situation where I'm... juggling women or whatever, you know. I'm not Warren Beatty.<eos> Not even Ned Beatty.<eos> I guess I was worried that if after we had sex, I started texting you or calling you, you would just be like,
Holy shit.<eos> Maybe we should go inside.<eos> It feels, like, a little dangerous to be out here. You know what I mean?<eos> Jeez, Chris!<eos> - I got you good, man!
So everyone's living in a culture of fear.<eos> Oh, I remember those days, man.<eos> Before that, you could bring a box cutter on a plane, but then after, it was a whole thing.<eos> Hey, Mickey, I'm sorry.<eos> I feel like I forced you to come out here and now you're stuck.
Yeah. 'Cause if I stay, you know, it's gonna be...<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I get it.<eos> Well, can I go with you?<eos> I think I'd feel a lot better if I could just get you to the road, to the Uber and stuff.
Nice and comfy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The coats are comfy.<eos> If I borrowed, like, $100 from you, I could pay you back $110 later on.<eos> - If you were cool with that.
Yeah. Well, I've actually gone to a few meetings, so...<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> Gus, that's amazing.<eos> I'm so proud of you. - Ah.
- You gotta taste this sauce.<eos> - What?<eos> Taste this sauce I made. It is amazing.<eos> That was really hot.<eos> Oh, sorry, should've warned you.
The one at the Springwood?<eos> Gus?<eos> No!<eos> This has nothing to do with him.<eos> Yeah, that guy will... never make you happy.
There it goes!<eos> You called me a whore again.<eos> You are the same.<eos> This is all the same.<eos> Bertie, I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward situation with Dustin.
I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.<eos> Well, me, too.<eos> I mean, I'm into you, not me.<eos> - Or... you get it.<eos> - Hey, hey, I have a question for you. What?
Well, me, too.<eos> I mean, I'm into you, not me.<eos> - Or... you get it.<eos> - Hey, hey, I have a question for you. What?<eos> What do you always wanna do in bed, but you're too nervous to ask for?
We just woke up.<eos> I know, but I'm feelin' antsy.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's do something fun.<eos> - Look at you.
- and I'll meet you...<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah. - You seem jumpy.<eos> Ugh, when I gotta pee I'm...<eos> Um... Ask a lot of questions, make sure you don't get, uh, ripped off, okay?
Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?<eos> You're chasing me around a farmers market?<eos> You're stalking me?<eos> I am doing what I didn't do last time.<eos> I'm fighting for you.
I wanna be here when he gets back. I want to tell him about us.<eos> So you... you want to ruin this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to tell him about us.<eos> And then, he's gonna leave you, and you and I can get back to making this work, okay?
And then, he's gonna leave you, and you and I can get back to making this work, okay?<eos> This is the story we're gonna tell our kids.<eos> "Your mom was dating a loser, and I... I came after her. I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.
This is the story we're gonna tell our kids.<eos> "Your mom was dating a loser, and I... I came after her. I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!
Good dog.<eos> What are you doing, John?<eos> Looking at you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm waiting for you.
Let me know when it's fixed.<eos> All right.<eos> Ciao, John.<eos> Santino.<eos> Good to see you.
No.<eos> Listen, John... with all sincerity...<eos> I don't want to be here.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> I'm asking you not to do this.
But I do find myself here.<eos> Please.<eos> I didn't want to do this, John.<eos> Had you stayed retired, I would have respected it.<eos> Look at you.
She's in Rome, for her coronation.<eos> You will take the catacombs in...<eos> It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.
Gianna.<eos> There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> What brought you back, John?
Santino will lay claim to my seat at the Table.<eos> He will take New York.<eos> And you will have been the one who gifted it to him.<eos> What would your Helen think about that, John?<eos> What would your Helen think about you?
Do you fear damnation, John?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, I always thought I could escape it.<eos> That I'd see it coming.<eos> That I'd see you.
Maybe we both could.<eos> Yeah, you hear me, don't you?<eos> Mm-hm, you do.<eos> We're gonna get out of here together, ain't we?<eos> You just be cool and everything's gonna be all aces.
It won't happen again, i promise.<eos> Nice job in there. Don't pay attention to what anybody out here is saying, you keep it in the ring, you'll be fine.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, your horse needs a name.<eos> Aces.<eos> I'm gonna call you aces.
Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.<eos> So, if you don't stop what you're doing, I will make an example out of you.<eos> Don't get timid with this horse, Irish, you do, he's gonna eat your lunch.<eos> If you get bucked off, and everybody does, roll with the throw and you keep on rolling until you're out of the way.
You all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh? Nah, nah, nah.<eos> All right, let's get on up out of here. Hey...<eos> - I'm gonna call you buster.
Shouldn't we help?<eos> We are helping them.<eos> - You set it on fire?<eos> - Screw you, old man.<eos> I asked you a question.
You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yeah, somebody trained you really well.
What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yeah, somebody trained you really well.<eos> Now, don't you move or I'll be ass over teakettle, and we don't want that, do we?
Come on!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Hey, don't be afraid. I would never hurt you more than it hurt him.<eos> I got you. I got you.
I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already?<eos> Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. I'm proud of you.
A bottle then.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So? Let's talk.<eos> I want you back.
Okay. Well, um...<eos> Generally, a key part of good communication is that both parties be conscious.<eos> I'm really sorry about your mother.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Now, I brought you here to negotiate.
Thanks, Taylor.<eos> No strings attached.<eos> This is spiky.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm gonna need a road map.<eos> I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> If we're to communicate, you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.
I'm too dressed.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> I want all of you.
Why do you think you waited?<eos> For sex.<eos> I was reading Austen and bronté and nobody ever measured up to that.<eos> I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.<eos> And then I met you.
I was being romantic, and then you just go and distract me with your kinky fuckery.<eos> "Kinky fuckery"? Mmm-hmm.<eos> I don't know what that is, but I like the sound of it.<eos> You looked so peaceful.<eos> I didn't wanna wake you.
Christian, I don't care about my hair!<eos> Explain to me what's going on.<eos> I'll explain when we're there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, you can either walk or i can carry you. Your choice.
You put money into my account that... I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian.<eos> It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.
You won't even notice they're here.<eos> Come on.<eos> The way you wear your hat the way you sip your tea<eos> the way you sing off-key everybody's looking at us.<eos> Not us. You.
$24,000.<eos> New blood!<eos> $24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you.
$24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you.<eos> And now it'll go to someone who needs it.<eos> I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you.
You know he's had three assistants in the last 18 months, all of whom have quit without notice?<eos> You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything. And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.
Your boyfriend has a reputation for being a little ruthless.<eos> Is that what you like?<eos> If you have a problem with my work, then you should take it up with hr. Whoa.<eos> Why are you being so serious?<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do? Make you fuck me?
Why are you being so serious?<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do? Make you fuck me?<eos> Jack.<eos> I just think...<eos> I just think if you're gonna fuck your way to prominence, then you should do it with someone who can at least make you smarter.
It's okay.<eos> Hey...<eos> I left everything. I don't have any of my stuff.<eos> Taylor will get it. It's fine, okay?<eos> I'll take you home, come on.
No.<eos> Hey, it was all you.<eos> What? You don't believe me?<eos> I don't believe it myself.<eos> I asked you a question last night.
Red room, here we come.<eos> Oof. Shit.<eos> I hope you're not a sore loser.<eos> That depends on how hard you spank me.<eos> I want to be very rough with you.
Do you wanna see him?<eos> I came to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.
I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.
I've had people out combing the streets, looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I saw you, Christian.
Is she here?<eos> What?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you... Yeah.
She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you... Yeah.<eos> She scared me.<eos> But you scared me more.<eos> Seeing you like that with her.
I get off on punishing women. Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.
You're going to have plenty of time.<eos> We're so glad that you're here with us and in Christian's life.<eos> You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.
It's all right.<eos> Ana, I'm here.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> I thought i lost you forever.
Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?<eos> You know you didn't have to.<eos> All I want is you.
Take me to the red room.<eos> Take me... Take me to the red room.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you.
Take me... Take me to the red room.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, I love you.
I know.<eos> I've been...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?
I know that we haven't been together very long,<eos> but I love him so much.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Oh, sweetheart!<eos> I'm so happy for you!
Christian.<eos> Mom.<eos> Happy birthday. Thank you.<eos> And Ana.<eos> Hi. It's so good to see you again.
Oh, my god!<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Stop crying, mom.<eos> Can't help it. I love you so much.
Oh, we're gonna choose it together.<eos> No rock.<eos> Christian grey.<eos> Oh, my god! I have a sister!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple weeks, and this is what happens?
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why are you even here, Elena?<eos> She's not right for you.
Be mine.<eos> Share my life with me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I'll marry you.
Marry me.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> I solemnly vow to love you faithfully and to keep you safe for as long as we both shall live.
Do you think you are?<eos> If I brought you some flowers, you'll be treated better?<eos> You could try harder to remember?<eos> Looks like I have not seen you, We have to get acquainted,<eos> Before I kill you,
Hey, I taught the movement,<eos> You should try other moves,<eos> I was the one who taught the gesture, Then you teach him,<eos> Kseniya,<eos> We all know you,
I see you again,<eos> Good morning my friends, You look alright,<eos> There was a time when we happy together,<eos> You forget, I know all your weaknesses, Kuratov,<eos> I know the plan, Remove Kseniya, He does not remember anything about you,
What if we need you again?<eos> It will not happen, I guess I'll see you again,<eos> One more thing, ,<eos> We have found another Guardian,<eos> Who sent you?
Are you serious?<eos> Look at that smile<eos> I love it when you smile<eos> Make me happy<eos> I think this place makes you happy
- Great plan Tez<eos> - Just so you know You miss some<eos> I'll just wait for it<eos> Shit!<eos> I hate you, Tez!
Jumped.<eos> I jumped out of a 4 storey window Saving my partner's life<eos> Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs<eos> Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue<eos> I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me? And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
It scrambles your senses<eos> Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour<eos> Probably<eos> Hello, Deckard.<eos> Nice to see you again
Probably<eos> Hello, Deckard.<eos> Nice to see you again<eos> Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom<eos> Your family's already replacing you
- No<eos> We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this<eos> We agreed on that<eos> I know<eos> Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
I simply made one but so did you<eos> You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do<eos> I wonder what Letty thought about that<eos> The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up<eos> I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here
Good visit?<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you're thinking<eos> I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room<eos> Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room With one very... specific instruction<eos> It's not to save me<eos> It's to kill your son<eos> And that's a lot of bullets And it only takes one for you to loose everything<eos> So, I have to ask you, because... I know family is so important to you
That was the one thing we could use to find him<eos> We lost everything<eos> - Yeah, princess?<eos> - Find it to rail<eos> But I've got couple of minutes to spare If you want me to send you to the hospital again
Don't do this<eos> - This is your doing<eos> - My doing?<eos> Pa pa pa Pa pa Pa pa<eos> Please don't hurt him. I'm begging you
I'm the crocodile at the watering hole<eos> You've got one last job to do<eos> Cipher..<eos> If I were you, I would kiss my son<eos> Because whether you value it or not, all of this... Your plane, your security and you... are still on this earth because of him
It's stopping world war 3<eos> What's it gonna be rook?<eos> You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?<eos> Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?<eos> Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world
This...<eos> This is for my son!<eos> Dom!<eos> You are out of bullets Deckard<eos> Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
What's that?<eos> Only one of us has a parachute!<eos> Told you this would be fun!<eos> Time to land, Boys!<eos> You know I've never left you, Letty?
Brother-hood.<eos> I saw that look you gave Cipher I knew you wanted revenge<eos> Glad I did it<eos> Can't believe you went to see my Mother<eos> All this fuss of you
All this fuss of you<eos> Yes<eos> Elena, I promise to keep our son safe<eos> And now.. he always will be<eos> I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe
You're Mr. Gallo.<eos> I know that.<eos> Nice to meet you, Martin.<eos> Fuck.<eos> It's really good to see you.
No. This is delicious.<eos> These beets are really well steamed.<eos> I'm sorry. I gotta take this.<eos> - He hates me.<eos> - He doesn't hate you. He hates me.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...<eos> In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.<eos> - You'd be up for that?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I would go through that hell all over again for you.
- What do you mean, she's moving on?<eos> - Okay, everything is in place.<eos> Barry, look, my phone is about to die.<eos> Okay, Barry, stop talking.<eos> I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
Very briefly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're late to meet my daughter, so...<eos> I won't keep you, then.<eos> Well, it was good to see you.
- Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.<eos> - Yeah. No, I haven't seen her.<eos> - Sorry. It's so loud in here. I know.<eos> It's unbelievably loud in here.<eos> I feel like I'm screaming at you.
- Sorry. It's so loud in here. I know.<eos> It's unbelievably loud in here.<eos> I feel like I'm screaming at you.<eos> It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.<eos> Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
Yes.<eos> Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I don't know if that's gonna happen.<eos> - Yeah, I saw you play, like... like a year ago at the River Room.
Yeah, thanks, I think.<eos> That's at least partially what... exactly what...<eos> - Marty?<eos> - Hey, Trevor.<eos> - They let you in here? - Yeah.
I know this guy!<eos> He's an idiot!<eos> Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go. Okay.<eos> And if I do play that show, maybe I'll see you there.<eos> - Yeah. Good to see you.
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.<eos> It's hilarious.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, you know, you look like a... a rapist...<eos> Like you've committed rape.<eos> You know why Ginnie dumped you?
- Mr. Gallo...<eos> - Where do you live, Megan?<eos> - You know where.<eos> Burger King.<eos> Because we're trying to drive you home.
- Mr. who? - Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.<eos> Really?<eos> Damn it.<eos> For you, man. Damn it.<eos> That sucks for you.
Ginnie.<eos> - What the hell, dad? - I know.<eos> Look, I was worried.<eos> You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.<eos> I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
- I'll meet you there? - Yeah.<eos> It was nice to meet everybody.<eos> I guess I'll... I'm gonna be going, too.<eos> Um, Ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.<eos> It was really nice to see you, though.
Um, Ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.<eos> It was really nice to see you, though.<eos> Martin!<eos> Look, Ginnie, I'm truly...<eos> - No, no, you don't have to apologize.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.<eos> - I didn't know if I should call. - No.<eos> Kip seems great, Ginnie.<eos> And you, you seem... You seem really happy.<eos> And I'm happy for you.
You're not in my life.<eos> Okay? You are never here.<eos> When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?<eos> Look...<eos> You're my dad and I love you...
- Have some respect.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> Well, I'm busy.<eos> And after I beat this level, I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.<eos> Hey, it's time for you to move now.
- That girl is clearly here for you.<eos> - We met up before the show.<eos> - Did you, now? - Yeah.<eos> You were right about that whole body-language thing.<eos> Look at you.
Not tea, brandy.<eos> Two glasses.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you. To the wake, at least.
You send me 12 men,<eos> I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.

You heard right.<eos> Be punctual.<eos> - They've brought the carriage up.<eos> - Yes. I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.
I'll know in 20 minutes.<eos> Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> - You will pay for this. - No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.
Suicide.<eos> That will teach you not to steal, won't it?<eos> You're not here.<eos> You are not here.<eos> I have no fear for you and I have no guilt for you.
The son is as unstable as the father.<eos> Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.
'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> 'The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> 'Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> 'Whether God will accept me is another matter, 'perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> 'Or perhaps my feelings for you, 'unforgiveable feelings for you, 'will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.
What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.<eos> Winter, she's your daughter, isn't she?<eos> And that's why you don't rent her.
I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't. What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.
Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't. What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?
There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.
You will not be granted a licence to purchase.<eos> Your name is already on a blacklist.<eos> You will not get a single grain anywhere in England.<eos> So, now... is the game up?<eos> When they speak of you, there is such hatred now.
James.<eos> For God's sake.<eos> The Art Of War.<eos> Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.
Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.<eos> But I don't keep anybody around me that doesn't deserve what they get.<eos> Does that include me?<eos> Yes, that includes you.
Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in? - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - You do. You feel me.<eos> And I could come more often, but I spare you.
You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now.<eos> Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.<eos> There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process. And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.

We need the powder in eight. I need more gunpowder.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> - You are now one of us.<eos> - Why burden him? Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.
Of who they say you are.<eos> The African devil.<eos> Stop staring.<eos> Go home to your mother.<eos> Helga loves you.
May he rest in peace until he's reignited with his Saviour.<eos> Slow, slow, slow over the potted roads.<eos> The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.<eos> "For the purpose of preventing contagion." Hm?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.
No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> - I would never have thought...<eos> - But you don't think. Do you?<eos> I know you.
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> - I would never have thought...<eos> - But you don't think. Do you?<eos> I know you.<eos> I know your nature. I know you.
I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.
Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> There's someone I need you to see.
And all of those who have use to me will sail along with me.<eos> And on my ship, there will be no rules and there will be no judgment.<eos> We're sailing to a new world and that is the plan.<eos> James... you are a fool.<eos> They are going to hang you.
I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.
Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account...<eos> he will secure it and keep you safe.
- Blackmail? - Yes.<eos> But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?<eos> I want that information.<eos> I will pay you for it.
I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.
- If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.
And there was I thinking that we were just brothers in arms.<eos> Didn't we share a bed sometimes in the great hall?<eos> It was torture.<eos> Exquisite.<eos> So you can trust me... and I will protect you.
I have sailed to places where there is no damnation.<eos> We used to talk to each other without words in dark corners.<eos> Your curiosity and hunger for all that is possible out there could never be tethered by base religious morality, ship insurance and new china.<eos> Please understand that from this moment I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.
I used to think we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We're not.<eos> Now...<eos> I never want to see you again.
But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, and I am... I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
Yes, you are.<eos> You're calculating days.<eos> You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.<eos> Yes, I know. I know.<eos> But I just did that because... I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
Yes, and I was thinking maybe it's time we paint.<eos> We haven't redone the exterior of the motel in a few years now, and that hardware store just reopened.<eos> I wish I could go down to the village with you and look.<eos> I know, Mother.<eos> I know it's hard for you always having to stay here in the house.
They'll... They'll come looking for it.<eos> I just don't remember checking this person in.<eos> Huh.<eos> Mother?<eos> Do you ever have the feeling that you've had the same nightmare over and over again but that you can't remember it?
How'd I get so lucky?<eos> You had quite a tour of duty in the lower levels of hell.<eos> Here, give her to me.<eos> Go enjoy your party.<eos> I got you. I got you.
So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?<eos> Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?<eos> I spend 24/7 in this house looking after you, feeding you, bolstering your moods, doing your laundry.
Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?<eos> I spend 24/7 in this house looking after you, feeding you, bolstering your moods, doing your laundry.<eos> I can't leave!<eos> I can't go anywhere! I'm going nuts here!<eos> I literally gave up my life to protect you.
In a closet?<eos> I'm not gonna bring her here to dinner.<eos> It's... this... This is absurd.<eos> I know you, Norman.<eos> Come on, I know you.
I'm not gonna bring her here to dinner.<eos> It's... this... This is absurd.<eos> I know you, Norman.<eos> Come on, I know you.<eos> I know you better than anyone.
I know you better than anyone.<eos> You can't have other people in your life, especially women.<eos> You're just making my job harder.<eos> Your job?<eos> Protecting you.
The truth is, Em...<eos> Caleb came up with a bunch of money to help pay for your transplant.<eos> He did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.
I felt bad; I should've just told you that yesterday.<eos> No, no... Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I was actually gonna stop by later today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me walk you to your car.
Well, think about it...<eos> If you can come to the meeting.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I hope I didn't wake you up.
But you shouldn't be;<eos> you have blackouts.<eos> Is this just your passive-aggressive way of getting me not to go to the meeting?<eos> You know, Norman, sometimes you can be so full of yourself.<eos> No, no... this is not my way of keeping you from doing anything except having blackouts while you're driving.
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.<eos> You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> Oh, I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you...
You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> Oh, I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you...<eos> What scares you, what you want, what you Google.
What scares you, what you want, what you Google.<eos> Oh, so you're looking on my computer now?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm doing, looking at your computer.<eos> No, I'm not looking at your computer.<eos> I know you.
Oh, so you're looking on my computer now?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm doing, looking at your computer.<eos> No, I'm not looking at your computer.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you better than you know yourself.
I know you.<eos> I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry...<eos> Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.

What do you think you're trying to protect me from?<eos> No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?
Check their restraints.<eos> You wanna tell us what the hell we're doin' here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're tellin' me to shut up?<eos> I don't think you know whose weeds you're pissing in, buddy.
You're tellin' me to shut up?<eos> I don't think you know whose weeds you're pissing in, buddy.<eos> - I said shut up.<eos> - I heard you.<eos> I chose to ignore you.
But I didn't get a law degree to be a damn receptionist.<eos> You'd be lucky to be someone's receptionist.<eos> If I were you, I'd start praying.<eos> How do you put up with him, Mother?<eos> The question is, how do I tolerate you?
What were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to teach your grandson a lesson.<eos> "Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> What about the neighbors?<eos> What do you care what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> What about the neighbors?<eos> What do you care what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?<eos> You really are one selfish SOB.<eos> Just 'cause you read the goddamn Bible every night, you think you're so high and mighty and moral, when there are people out there who are actually, really, truly suffering...
I'm calm.<eos> He's a big boy.<eos> You didn't plan this very well, did you, David?<eos> I am in no mood for a jerk-off contest.<eos> Do I need to remind you who's holding the guns here?
Ooh, this is a good one.<eos> "The next thing you know, Madalyn Murray will force the country to eliminate 'one nation under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance."<eos> It's actually not a bad idea.<eos> We should be clipping coupons, not articles. Oh, pfft.<eos> I cannot believe that the Family Aid Society fired you.
- Please!<eos> Gary, please.<eos> Not so tough now, huh?<eos> You're gonna owe me.<eos> - Oh, fuck you.
Jesus, David.<eos> Just as vain as ever, huh?<eos> You sure you're not a homo?<eos> You are the last person who should be lecturing me about vanity.<eos> I'll lecture you about whatever I goddamn well please.
- Uh, Murray O'Hair.<eos> How can you look at yourself in the mirror every day?<eos> Only a godless bitch like you would go to court to stop prayer.<eos> Thanks to you, this country's on its way to hell in a handbasket.<eos> Somebody should cut your tongue out, tie you up and throw your lifeless corpse off the...
Lady, have I gotta explain the damn birds and the bees for ya?<eos> It's called sex.<eos> And you can bet the Virgin Mary was all for it.<eos> Virgin birth, my ass.<eos> Jesus loves you, Madalyn.
They're treating me for nerve damage.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right. I...<eos> I understand.<eos> Probably very frightening for you, and we shouldn't have dragged Robin and Susan through all this.
I have a wife and a child now.<eos> I'm not sure this is the life that I want for them.<eos> - Right, that's your decision.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just don't know if I can keep up what I'm doing without you.
Mom.<eos> Remember that protest at White Tower?<eos> You couldn't have been more than ten.<eos> And that day you said to me,<eos> "If something makes you really mad, you've gotta go out there and do something about it."
I told you so, didn't I?<eos> - Mother.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You were over that fusspot a long time ago.<eos> At least she didn't cheat on you like Richard did with me.
I wanna live my own life! Okay?<eos> I'm sick and tired of living your life!<eos> What, you're gonna leave me?<eos> Like all the rest of 'em?<eos> After everything I've fucking done for you?
Follow it up.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Frank!<eos> I love you!
This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.<eos> You were the boss.<eos> I had to.<eos> Does that mean I'm supposed to let you win now?
Garth... you try anything... anything, Madalyn and Robin are dead.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bye, Mother.<eos> - You be careful, Garth. - Okay.
Yeah, you live long enough and you lose faith in people.<eos> Not that I ever had much faith in anyone.<eos> But... you have impressed me, David.<eos> Starting to wish Bill Jr. Could've turned out more like you.<eos> He really hurt you, huh?
Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.<eos> I'm giving you a promotion, David.
All right, I got it. I got it.<eos> You're the big boss.<eos> But God damn it, David, if you aren't fucking up this job like everything else you've ever done.<eos> Mother!<eos> If I shot you in the head right now, do you think anyone would care?
You just wanna be the momma I never had, give us both a second chance.<eos> Well, let me tell you something about my momma.<eos> I beat the shit out of her.<eos> I beat her to a bloody pulp.<eos> You think your son Bill hurt you?
I'm, uh... heading to Florida next week for my daughter's fifth birthday.<eos> I'm using my take to set up her college fund.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's awful sweet.<eos> And lucky to have you for a father.
Are you gonna bring him back to the house?<eos> - No.<eos> - All right.<eos> Have fun, bug.<eos> I love you.
I can't choose any of these topics.<eos> Then follow the rules, or you can leave.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this every week.<eos> Great choice.<eos> Hey. I was wondering if I could interview you for an article I'm writing about the auditions... for the school paper.
- I got it.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Yay!<eos> I knew you would.<eos> I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions.
I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions.<eos> For the school paper?<eos> It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.<eos> My old school had one, and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some kind of fringe thing or whatever.<eos> Well, look, I-I'm proud of you... uh, that you have spoken your mind.

Your friend looks pretty miserable over there.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Any suggestions?<eos> They tell me not to write about the mayor, I don't.<eos> I don't write about you and Healy, either.
If I was running things, we would have at least followed the rules.<eos> If you were running things, we never would have made it to Portland.<eos> Then I could similarly surmise that short people... are stupider than taller people, because you can't see as much as taller people, and they have smaller brain...<eos> Hey, you ain't that tall either, Solomon.<eos> - My brother's tall, and he hates you.

He has something.<eos> Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this<eos> - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.
Wait.<eos> Since when do you call me "Mel?"<eos> Since when do you use a nickname for anybody?<eos> You don't even use your own first name.<eos> Everybody calls you Argent.
You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.<eos> We're the ones that brought you back.
Where's my sister?<eos> Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.
So when the Wild Hunt moves on from Beacon Hills...<eos> I'll be like Lenore.<eos> Left behind.<eos> Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.
Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.<eos> You aren't still upset about the whole shooting thing, are you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.
There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.
Come on, guys.<eos> Look, I don't want in anyone's pack.<eos> I don't want anyone's power.<eos> I just wanna stay alive.<eos> How do we know if we let you out, you won't run?
Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.
You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.
I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> I love you.
But, when you finally closed your eyes,<eos> I was myself again.<eos> I knew you were gone.<eos> Liam, you and Lydia get to the bunker.<eos> The whip. It didn't take you.
You killed her, remember?<eos> I can help. I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> - Where's Stiles?<eos> - You remember Stiles?<eos> To not tear you in half right now.
So we should try anything we can to save him.<eos> Right?<eos> Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.
This is a mistake.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.
I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.
How did you know?<eos> There's a refraction of light around your silhouette that I can always see.<eos> I don't know, it probably has something to do with pheromones or some other chemical interaction.<eos> It's my only power.<eos> Finding you.
Not to reunite sentimental teenagers.<eos> You wanted us to know about Stiles.<eos> And Canaan.<eos> You were warning us.<eos> This is where we found you.
It's them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?<eos> For you to run.
And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?<eos> For you to run.<eos> You're leaving me?<eos> I'm saving you.
Go now.<eos> Malia, run!<eos> Go!<eos> Break the barrier.<eos> Break the barrier, or I'll rip you in two.
It was Mr. Douglas.<eos> He ate his brain.<eos> Scott was right.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I'm sending you back.
Give the boy some room.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I found you.
Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I found you.<eos> I can't believe I found you.
I'll hold them back.<eos> Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> When I kissed you...

Okay, how the hell do you "merge worlds?"<eos> Okay, nowhere in the manual does it say that werewolves can do that.<eos> And Scott and I pretty much wrote the manual.<eos> We can't even move between them, all right?<eos> Look what it took to break you out.
Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> I went through all this to keep you from being taken. You need a hand?
Mom?<eos> Stiles, that's not your mom.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice. No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.
Look at him. We...<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?
There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.
Zuruckkommen.<eos> Come back and kill them.<eos> Tote sie.<eos> Yeah, call your army back.<eos> Or don't they listen to you?
- Okay. Thanks.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Love you guys.<eos> Right. I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.
These aren't the keys to the Jeep. Well, that's one to your house, another to your room, uh, it's the master key to the school, Animal Clinic, key to the Sheriff's station.<eos> Just figured you should have all the copies I secretly made. So... Yeah.<eos> They still need us.<eos> They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I... I need you.
They still need us.<eos> They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I... I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.
They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I... I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.
And, you know, I... I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> No, really, I need you though, uh...
Hey, Ann.<eos> I gotta go to work.<eos> Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Hey, hon. I was hoping to catch you.
Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Hey, hon. I was hoping to catch you.<eos> It's my big test day, so wish me luck.<eos> Okay, love you.
Agent Castillo.<eos> I know, It's a bummer, right?<eos> Look at those guys.<eos> Whoa!<eos> I took you on vacation to the Bahamas with my family.
I figured you still owe me, even after the vacation and everything.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Your wife.<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Chacho!
Motherfucker!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, Chacho!<eos> I just gave her the attention you didn't, bro.<eos> You should've cuddled. You should've cuddled, bro.<eos> Chacho, I'll kill you!
They're on the ramp, TJ. Two bikes.<eos> Dispatch, this is EAGLE-6.<eos> We have four suspects on two black motorcycles heading eastbound toward Pennsylvania Ave.<eos> Shots fired, shots fired!<eos> Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.
One of you is gonna die.<eos> You choose, thief.<eos> Thief?<eos> Fuck does that mean?<eos> I let you on my crew, and you're gonna steal from me?
You know, I think I'm a little nervous 'cause it's my first day<eos> - and I have a lot riding on this.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm trying to salvage my marriage--<eos> Did I ask you about your failing marriage?
I'm an officer.<eos> That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.<eos> - What's up, bro?<eos> - Dude, that is awesome!<eos> You know, my cousin competed against you in freestyle.
- Christ.<eos> Fine!<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, I do need to warn you, though.
First at lunch and now here?<eos> I mean, I was friends with TJ.<eos> All right? We were friends and I thought we'd get along too. But if you're going to be up my ass, then I'll just keep it movin'.<eos> This is my partner's widow.<eos> I see you around this house again, I will be in your ass with a boot.
- Hey!<eos> - One second!<eos> - Turn down the music!<eos> - Please turn it down.<eos> If you keep ignoring me, I'm going to write you up for insubordination.
Most guys probably...<eos> It was my first day, so I thought you'd probably want to see what I look like.<eos> In all brown?<eos> It's great, Jon.<eos> Um... I thought maybe it would remind you of your dad.
Is it a chronic thing, or did you eat something dicey last night?<eos> Just drop it!<eos> Listen, okay...<eos> Don't pull away.<eos> I'm worried about you.
God damn it!<eos> Where'd they come from?<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.<eos> I tried to warn you.
Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.<eos> I tried to warn you.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, man, just, real quick, I wasn't trying to embarrass you.
Oh, my God! I knew you were gonna bring that up!<eos> Of course I brought it up!<eos> I saved your life, you won't even carry me!<eos> I'll do anything else!<eos> I'll clean this fucking pigsty, but I'm not gonna carry you.
I'll do anything else!<eos> I'll clean this fucking pigsty, but I'm not gonna carry you.<eos> You wouldn't be standing here! You can't lift me and take me to the tub?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll drag you there, but I'm not gonna cradle you like a newborn.
- Fine!<eos> You're such a homophobe.<eos> Stop calling me that!<eos> - You won't even look at me!<eos> - You'd have to be gay for me to be homophobic towards you!
There's no way he could afford it on a cop's salary.<eos> He had to have been dirty.<eos> We gotta go check it out.<eos> You get in this tub with me right now.<eos> I'm gonna wash you from head to toe, Ponch-y.
Don't you want that?<eos> So, you were just trying to keep TJ's pension?<eos> Somebody knew about TJ and Barton, and they were using that against him.<eos> We'll need your help to see who that could be.<eos> I see you around this house again, I will be in your ass with a boot.
I think it's 350.<eos> You guys kinda caught me in the middle of it.<eos> Why don't you come back in an hour and a half or so, when I'm gone?<eos> No, right now is good.<eos> We'll just shadow you.
I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...<eos> Wait, your partner.<eos> He did just before he got gunned down in front of you.<eos> Oh, so, you know something about me.<eos> I know something about you.
We'll be surfing, drinking Mai Tais.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?
I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love you, kiddo.
Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> I love you.
- Thanks for everything.<eos> - Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm watching you.
Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."<eos> Yeah, that's it.<eos> - We just wait now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?
Over and out!<eos> Shit.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hey, why is he chasing you?
- Can you manage?<eos> - Got it.<eos> Last one.<eos> So, what's the plan now, babe?<eos> The second Brian gets out of the hospital, you, Cooper, and Hansen, you head up to Big Bear.
Do you want to talk about him?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Maybe after I take care of your little boyfriend.<eos> So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> When I am healed, I am gonna physically destroy you.<eos> Get the fuck out of my room. Call Peterson.<eos> He's looking for you.
You torpedo the entire case, and you broke your phone.<eos> I didn't torpedo it.<eos> We have a suspect's head. That's a victory.<eos> Three officers and two agents are hospitalized, all for a severed head nobody can ID.<eos> That's a victory to you?
I didn't torpedo it.<eos> We have a suspect's head. That's a victory.<eos> Three officers and two agents are hospitalized, all for a severed head nobody can ID.<eos> That's a victory to you?<eos> Listen, I'm sorry that I shot you again.
I also have a catheter in and I didn't wanna be too sexy for the staff.<eos> Mmm-hmm, yeah.<eos> Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?<eos> I came to see you, dummy, and just wanted to brag about saving your life.
Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?<eos> I came to see you, dummy, and just wanted to brag about saving your life.<eos> You saved my life?<eos> I gave you CPR and I breathed life back into you.
Leave me a message.<eos> Oh!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, Ponch!<eos> Man, am I happy to see you!
Man, am I happy to see you!<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> I just got my phone working.<eos> I got all your messages.<eos> Dude, I'm so happy you're here.
I'm sorry about this.<eos> I just got my phone working.<eos> I got all your messages.<eos> Dude, I'm so happy you're here.<eos> - Good to see you, buddy.
Well, did someone pick him up?<eos> A police officer, female, super pretty.<eos> Plane leaves at Thursday at 3:00 p.m. out of Global Air in Van Nuys.<eos> There'll be a week's worth of provisions in the cabin.<eos> When should we expect you?
Oh, thank God!<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, I need your gun.<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
So, what's your point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I relate to the guy.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine not looking back at you.
Come on, Holt!<eos> Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.<eos> Just give us a second, Dad.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> Your mom, she really needs you right now.
The teacher's kind of a badass.<eos> That sounds cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not everything's cool, though.<eos> It's still, like, a whole week until I get to see you.
Wait.<eos> Do I still have a tail?<eos> Gabriel?<eos> Is someone still watching for me?<eos> I'm gonna find you someone, I promise you that.
A door.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's Gabriel.<eos> Holt, listen.<eos> I've got a tail for you.
Holt, listen.<eos> I've got a tail for you.<eos> It's not for me anymore.<eos> You know why I wasn't answering your calls, right?<eos> It was to protect you from this.
She disappeared.<eos> No clothes gone. No note.<eos> Just vanished.<eos> The priest.<eos> He kept you down here.
You're here.<eos> Julia?<eos> Here she is, Samara!<eos> This is what becomes of your savior!<eos> With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!
With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!<eos> Julia...<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> ...from sin!<eos> May the Lord save you!
They were hungry, of course, having made their way through their stores of dried meat and salt fish days ago, even though carefully, professionally rationed.<eos> To a man they were expert seamen, yet no expertise can surmount a sea that does not wish you to reach shore.
I don't believe in anything I can't see.<eos> I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.
Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.<eos> They'll do anything they can to keep you inside with them.<eos> I smell snow.<eos> Hello?<eos> I love you.
Robbie's coming by.<eos> We're planning your surprise party welcome home.<eos> A surprise party? Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.
We're planning your surprise party welcome home.<eos> A surprise party? Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.
A surprise party? Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.
Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too, baby.
I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you... I'm glad my kids forced me into getting on that stupid thing.<eos> You... like me?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I want to see you again.
Worship me.<eos> Pray to me like I'm your god. Your goddess.<eos> Don't know how.<eos> You feel so good.<eos> I could keep fucking you forever.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
Give me everything.<eos> All that I have!<eos> Everything!<eos> Gift me your body.<eos> I love you.
Heads.<eos> Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.
I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.<eos> You're a little creepy, and you're forward and familiar, and I don't like it.<eos> I don't like you.
Who he really is?<eos> Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.
Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.<eos> Jack Daniel's for me. And these are for you, Shadow Moon.
You drive where needs driving to.<eos> You take care of things generally on my behalf.<eos> And in an emergency, and in an emergency only, you kick the asses of those whose asses require kicking.<eos> And in the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil.<eos> He's hustling you.
Of course I do.<eos> Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.
Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.<eos> You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well, I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone for fun or profit.<eos> I'll work for you up to which point you start to piss me off, and then I'm gone.
I have preparations and communications to keep me busy enough, after which I will entertain myself.<eos> Now I'll tell you this once and once only ever.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> It's nice to see you.
Now I'll tell you this once and once only ever.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> Did you escape, or did they, they let you out?
They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.
We must have over 100 redundancies in place to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.<eos> And Pandora's Box can bypass all of them.<eos> With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications,<eos> corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.
Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?
If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.
I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!<eos> Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?<eos> My partner's the smartest guy in the room, and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.
- Don't you play fucking dumb with me!<eos> - I don't have it!<eos> - Really? - You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.
Fellas, this here is a local matter.<eos> It's a local crime committed by locals against locals.<eos> Shit, as I'm sure you're aware, one of the guys involved is my own goddamn brother.<eos> In high school, we all played on the same football team. We all know each other, so.<eos> I assure you, if anybody's capable of catching these guys, catching them before there's any further bloodshed, it's gonna be my partner and I.
Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.<eos> And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?<eos> We understand that what happened here last night is a very serious matter around these parts, but, as far as the Bureau's concerned, it's not exactly 9/11 part two.<eos> If it wasn't for the fact that the bank is federally insured, then we would not be down here messing around in your affairs.<eos> So, if you were expecting a couple of, uh. Grizzled FBI guys charging in here and giving you the high hat, well, you're gonna be happily mistaken.
All right. Sounds like we're gonna get along just fine.<eos> Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.
We got this. Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.<eos> All right, where were we, boys?<eos> - Evening, fellas.<eos> - Oh, Sheriff Sikes, my man!<eos> Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble to help us out once again.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, I know it's too early to know, but... I know.<eos> Well, I have a request.<eos> Don't call her Jo.<eos> I met you today and you think I'm gonna name my daughter after you?
Yes.<eos> What was her name?<eos> You spent time with Jakob this morning.<eos> Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?
You're mad.<eos> Yes. You said it yourself... Serious condition.<eos> I should have paid closer attention.<eos> Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell. Now you hear whatever you wish. - No.<eos> - Yes. Why would she speak to you and not to her husband?
What?<eos> Terran Squadron commander, stand down.<eos> That ship is protected.<eos> Unidentified vessel, do not interfere, we are under orders.<eos> I've just given you new orders.
I've just given you new orders.<eos> And who are you to issue orders to Squadron X?<eos> Captain Saber Raine, Terran special operations.<eos> Captain Raine?<eos> I must inform you, you are interfering with extermination orders from the rear admiral.
And who are you to issue orders to Squadron X?<eos> Captain Saber Raine, Terran special operations.<eos> Captain Raine?<eos> I must inform you, you are interfering with extermination orders from the rear admiral.<eos> And I'm telling you, Commander, that order is wrong.
My comfort is irrelevant.<eos> Where is my brother?<eos> He has been enjoying my hospitality.<eos> You will tell me what I want to know and with that knowledge I will conquer the universe.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.
And if he were to perish?<eos> No by the time the generator is operational I will have what I need from him.<eos> And your ships will have the power to unleash my wrath across the universe!<eos> We are an alliance.<eos> We do not serve you!
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me just grab a pager for you here, and we'll get you to sit with a banking professional as soon as one becomes available.
I'm sorry you're a casualty of a corrupt system that no longer serves the people.<eos> Yeah. I've been banking here for 40 years.<eos> You're just an account number.<eos> It's not much, but it's all yours.<eos> No, my friend. Not from you.
So, if you find the tattoo parlor, then you'll find the artist, and you've got yourself a bank robber.<eos> Sounds pretty standard to me.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, thanks a lot, old-timer.<eos> You know, we're going to get you an application.
Hey, Willie.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Partly cloudy, Doc.<eos> Partly cloudy.<eos> Well, I'm not going to lie to you.
Which I guess for you, isn't that long.<eos> But you better think, old man, and you better know.<eos> This is not sitting on a park bench playing bingo.<eos> Listen, fella.<eos> I don't have to take shit from you.
JOE:<eos> The truth is easy to remember.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was almost perfect.<eos> Except let me tell you a little something about criminals.
He's been neutered.<eos> All the papers are in the proper order.<eos> You take your cut?<eos> No.<eos> Not from you.
Please.<eos> We're all friends here.<eos> I understand you are anxious, here, in your enemy's territory.<eos> But I assure you that is precisely why you are safe.<eos> No one would dream of looking for you here, right under their noses.
No one would dream of looking for you here, right under their noses.<eos> Of course mistrust is healthy when conducting these sorts of transactions, but rest assured, gentlemen, nobody wants to die today.<eos> We are honest criminals.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
And remember, it takes courage to ask for help.<eos> The generosity you have shown my country has been overwhelming, and it will certainly help the healing process, but sadly, it's still not enough.<eos> Did you ever think that 2.5 billion dollarswouldnotbeenough?<eos> Well, that's why I'm here.<eos> I pledge to you, and your country, all of my talents.
It serves as a reminder, of a time long ago, when the world was very different.<eos> Less complicated.<eos> When good men banded together to fight for what was right.<eos> It motivates me to this day.<eos> It brought me here, to you.
I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.<eos> I almost gave it to him.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's pathetic, just like the man I took it from.<eos> You've kept it all these years, it must mean something to you.
Get on with it.<eos> Time's a-wasting.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Simon templar, you're the most peculiar thief I know.<eos> Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.
I might have been wrong about the beard.<eos> It makes you a little, dare I say... Older.<eos> Goodbye, darling.<eos> You, gentlemen, were the only ones who got perfect scores on your exams.<eos> I am most surprised at you, Mr. templar.
I'd rather not say.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need protection.<eos> For me and my family.<eos> Before I tell you anything.
We know that the fans are already blaming him for the charges of trying to leave out of town.<eos> All right, that's all we've got time for.<eos> Now moving to headline news at the top of the hour with our very own Fiona krinchauf.<eos> It's a helpless feeling, isn't it, Arnie?<eos> You take from me, i take from you.
I just need a little bit of time.<eos> While I've got all the time in the world, but, unfortunately, your daughter doesn't have that luxury.<eos> Please...<eos> We... her wellbeing is entirely in your hands.<eos> I tell you what.
As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.<eos> Have you got my money yet?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.
Have you got my money yet?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.<eos> How can I trust you?
- What did you find?<eos> Simon?<eos> This is a very thoughtful gift, Mr. valecross.<eos> I've been looking for my father's ring for a long time.<eos> May I show you something?
You're under arrest.<eos> Really, fernack?<eos> Three guns?<eos> You only have two hands.<eos> Enjoy this moment. 'Cause I'll be coming after you again.
- It's in the basement.<eos> You, black jacket.<eos> Wipe your nose, grab your gun, you come with me. - Yes, sir.<eos> - What about me?<eos> Yeah, what about you?
Were you gonna mention this?<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> You're gonna be okay, but you cannot make a sound, okay?<eos> -Okay. Let's get this off you.
Yes, this is my associate, agent dora Lee.<eos> Based just on what I've tapped into during his file transfers in the last half an hour, he's got enough connections to terror groups and suspect funds to keep homeland security busy for a long time.<eos> What are the charges?<eos> -What makes you think we're charging you with anything?<eos> The us government just wants to talk to you.
I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture.<eos> And if I don't go?<eos> If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.<eos> And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.<eos> It's up to you.
We have to clear the debris before we can assess the extent of the damage to the pipes.<eos> You wanna go faster, roll up your sleeves.<eos> Yeah, well, we're only here to distribute the water, so...<eos> But, hey, I got good news.<eos> We're gonna get you some workers, and we're gonna speed this up.
Come through.<eos> And we're gonna be here tomorrow at sunrise.<eos> We're gonna transfer every willing worker to the pump station.<eos> Get the fuck back.<eos> Help us help you.
Kadeer, please tell...<eos> This is your brother?<eos> Yes, Mr. Harper.<eos> My brother is an engineer.<eos> Here... here he... He is here to help you.
There's a convoy leaving at 1400.<eos> It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.<eos> I'm happy to waive my leave, sir.<eos> If it's all the same, I'll stay.<eos> The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son.
- Aye. Did you?<eos> - I felt it was more constructive...<eos> - Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?
Naturally, you'll have to lie to your wife.<eos> If you need inspiration, just imagine her reaction to that.<eos> Or how this might interest the pupils of that leading private school.<eos> I think they might enjoy the interlude with the strap-on. I know I did.<eos> I'm gonna text you the details of a bank account.
Mum said I wasn't supposed to move because it might be scary.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I cannot... thank you enough for your hospitality.
Well, you should learn to control your temper!<eos> Try to get some rest.<eos> Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?
That's your idea.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to put quarters in a romance card.<eos> Ray...<eos> I'm gonna have to let you go.
- I'll fold.<eos> - What was that?<eos> I'll fold.<eos> Fold what, cards?<eos> We have machines behind you that fold cards, Ray.
I can't ply my trade.<eos> And you can't write with the other fingers?<eos> You're gonna have to figure out a way to pay me.<eos> So?<eos> You want me to blow you?
And instead of using words like "my love" or "my wife," I need you to use the word... "girlfriend."<eos> Listen, I... I can't promise anything, you know.<eos> There's good money here for you.<eos> Here's an advance.<eos> I'll pay you triple freelance rate.
Your husband was the writer I always measured myself against.<eos> And I always came up short.<eos> Well... won me over with a card.<eos> I'm afraid I wasn't the greatest prize.<eos> Well, he talked about you.
Yeah. Tastes like it, too.<eos> I hope you don't mind watching me eat. I'm famished.<eos> Oh, liver and beets!<eos> Exquisite.<eos> Can I offer you a beer?
Napoleon gave it to his mother after she had a tumor removed from her ankle.<eos> It's French, and it translates into, "Feel better."<eos> She died two days after receiving it.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Wentworth, let's talk.<eos> You own AAAAA Greetings.
Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.<eos> So I write the card for her and I give it to you.
It's... it's gargled, but where'd you get it?<eos> O'Neill. he whispered it to Lulu.<eos> - He speaks Mandarin?<eos> - Not according to his profile.<eos> I'm sending this to you.
- Is that it?<eos> - Yeah, I think I can manage now.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean, if there is something else I can assist you with...
- Must be a break in the air seal somewhere.<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - It's going into the cargo hold.<eos> - That's suicide!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
"The higher a man stands on a social ladder the greater the number of people he's connected with."<eos> "War and Peace". Volume 2, Book 9.<eos> My mother is from the east Ukraine so I grew up learning Russian.<eos> To show off my learning abilities, she had me memorize classic literature. In Russian and recite it to people.<eos> - That makes sense for you, but why him?
I'm getting the same message every two hours.<eos> - You've sent our previous messages, right?<eos> - Yes! - Well, send them again, without encryption.<eos> Someone has to respond.<eos> Honestly, what is wrong with you?
"Nearly all men die of the remedies, and not of their illnesses." Molière. "The imaginary sickness", act 3, scene 3."<eos> -Overhead off.<eos> All your bio signs are normal.<eos> - Why am I having these emotional reactions?<eos> -There is nothing wrong with you.
-No.<eos> - How is this possible?<eos> - If only if she could answer that.<eos> - Take her back to Teleios. Go back to earth. It's your best chance.<eos> - What about you?
There are men after us.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.
It's $20,000.<eos> Here.<eos> Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.
Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.<eos> They will be waiting.<eos> They will give you anything.
You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.<eos> I'm not helping you.
My name is Gabriela López.<eos> I am a nurse.<eos> And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research in Mexico City.<eos> Transigen is owned by an American company.<eos> What I am about to show you is illegal... in the U.S. And Canada.
Shit.<eos> Knock yourselves out.<eos> I'll tell you what. Eight grand...<eos> I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires... mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.<eos> I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget the paperwork.
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.<eos> Easier?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!
My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.<eos> He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she's impure.
I agree.<eos> The Reavers were very ineffective.<eos> But I'm bringing new tools to bear.<eos> But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.<eos> No, I can't help you.
Uh-huh. That's a good description.<eos> He was there, too.<eos> Oh, yeah, no. Um... I got kicked out a few times.<eos> I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.
Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?<eos> Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right?
Come out here now, Munson.<eos> There's that asshole.<eos> Hello, asshole.<eos> Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> I don't know what Munson's paying you... but Canewood can start you out at five G.
It's got water.<eos> Shit!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.<eos> Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.
- No shit.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.
I think they thought it was a tip.<eos> And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Strickland? Huh?
Oh, I did. Yeah.<eos> Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this. I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.
So, then I went back to this. I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.
Yeah?<eos> I'll see you later, Mr. Campbell.<eos> Okay.<eos> What a day.<eos> How can I help you?
- Yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> And Mr. Strickland got in a lot of trouble because of you.<eos> Whew!<eos> You know this completely contradicts your statement, right, Campbell?
We'll do a drug deal.<eos> iPhone.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Look, maybe I deal, maybe I don't.<eos> I'll tell you for a new iPhone.
Really? I'm just a teacher?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.
I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.
In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.<eos> And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.<eos> And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school. So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip, I will walk right in here and I'll punch you right in the fucking teeth, Tyler.
- They look terrible.<eos> Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.<eos> You here to fire everybody again?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?
So, this is a tough one for me, you know? 'Cause I didn't leave on great terms and...<eos> Boy, it sucks when your job's in someone else's hands like this.<eos> Enough of your shit, okay?<eos> Are you gonna come back or not?<eos> Tell you what.
- Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.<eos> Why?<eos> But I'll tell you for an iPhone.
I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?
- What?<eos> - The son who was in Tibet.<eos> DNA all checks out.<eos> Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
Greg.<eos> It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened? John, you amaze me.<eos> You know what happened?<eos> Not a clue. It's just you normally say that at this point. Hmm.<eos> Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished. Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter.<eos> Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.<eos> The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.<eos> I... I thought you'd done something clever.<eos> Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?<eos> I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> - Who told you?<eos> - The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.<eos> - Have a good time.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- I think I'm dying.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right. Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.<eos> I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.<eos> Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
Yes, your little flat.<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.<eos> That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.<eos> Everything's hopeless.<eos> Irretrievable.<eos> I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
If I get a hint that you're here looking for vengeance for Marty, I'm gonna send your arse back to the States.<eos> - I can handle myself.<eos> - I don't give a shit.<eos> Your mind goes anywhere other than the moment at hand, you're a risk.<eos> I'm not getting my arse shot off 'cause you're pissed off about Marty.
He's a US Navy Seal sniper.<eos> Of course, I can't tell you his name, but I can tell you he was the highest scoring marksman in his unit five years in a row.<eos> Besides the camera, he has a DMR, semi-automatic, gas-operated, chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge.<eos> At 600 metres it's an easy shot.<eos> He looks like you.
- Mr Miller?<eos> Mr Thomas Miller?<eos> Indianapolis, Indiana?<eos> We'll get you cleaned up back at the embassy.<eos> Your captors do this to you before your release?
We don't have a day.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Bill Randa here to see Senator Willis.<eos> Of course, Mr. Randa.<eos> I left you a message this morning about rescheduling today's appointment.
Resources, medicine, the cure for cancer, geological discoveries.<eos> Possible alternate fuels. Senator, look just...<eos> Listen, to be honest, we don't know for sure what's there.<eos> Okay?<eos> But I will tell you what we do know.
Roger that.<eos> So what're you gonna do when you get back to the world, Chapman?<eos> Oh, I'm already set up with Eastern Air Lines.<eos> Grace and Billy all moved in in Atlanta, just waiting on me.<eos> What about you, Sir?
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)<eos> Mason Weaver, photographer.<eos> Mason Weaver is a woman?<eos> Last time I checked.<eos> Can I help you?
That's the package they come in.<eos> And you?<eos> Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.
And you?<eos> Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.<eos> Okay, Captain Conrad. What about you?
We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you? I hope you're worth it.
West highest mountain peak.<eos> Over.<eos> Fox Six confirm, we're at the Sea Stallion.<eos> Chapman, hold your position.<eos> We'll come to you.
Galleta, Saraf, and Hodges.<eos> Slivko and the rest are unknown.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Where's Randa?<eos> How you doing?
Why?<eos> 'Cause it sounds neat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I just made that name up.<eos> I'm trying to scare you.
What kind of music is that?<eos> What happened to swing?<eos> Benny Goodman?<eos> You're like a time-traveler, man.<eos> I'm telling you, this is the new sound.
(ALL PANTING)<eos> MARLOW:<eos> Now, look, Colonel.<eos> You may outrank me, but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.<eos> And I'm telling you that thing that just shredded us was only the first of them.
You need to listen to us!<eos> We're not at war, Colonel.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!
This is the edge of the island.<eos> Weaver, get up on those rocks and fire a flare.<eos> - With any luck, Brooks will see it.<eos> - (RUSTLING)<eos> We'll buy you time.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)<eos> CONRAD:<eos> You just gonna sit there?<eos> In the dark.<eos> You're enjoying this, right?
CONRAD:<eos> You just gonna sit there?<eos> In the dark.<eos> You're enjoying this, right?<eos> Is this fun for you?
- Anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> - What is wrong?<eos> - What's the matter with you?
Don't you dare make jokes.<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you?
Somebody else.<eos> Not me.<eos> Not now. Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken.<eos> But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?
Not me.<eos> Not now. Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken.<eos> But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson.
Get over yourself.<eos> You're not my first smack-head, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> That woman's out of control.<eos> I asked for a cup of tea.<eos> - How did you get him in the boot?
- It'll have to be a hug. - I know.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, we're everywhere.
Come on.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.<eos> Where are we going now?<eos> -I want to show you my favourite room.
I've played along with this joke.<eos> It's not funny any more.<eos> You know, look at him.<eos> Go ahead, look at him, Dr Watson.<eos> No, I'll lay it out for you.
I apologise.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic.<eos> Nineteen and a half minutes.<eos> The footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two. The third of course, will be the end of a walking cane.
You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.
Stop it! Stop it now!<eos> Is it true he's been treated in your hospital?<eos> It's not actually my hospital.<eos> Well, it is a little bit my hospital.<eos> But I can promise you this.
You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes.<eos> You're... Nicer.<eos> Culverton gave me Faith's original note.<eos> A mutual friend put us in touch.<eos> Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
If there's a queue, join it.<eos> For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.<eos> There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair. They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.
His family.<eos> You're going to cry.<eos> It's okay if you cry.<eos> I don't need to cry.<eos> I can help you cry.
- I remember Redbeard.<eos> - Do you, now?<eos> Tell me what I don't know.<eos> Touch the glass.<eos> I put my trust in you. My implicit trust, as governor of this institute.
- Big G.<eos> Big G means governor.<eos> Street speak. I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.<eos> I'm relatable that way.<eos> Do you like my boys?
- Not two people.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?
- Tim, there they are!<eos> - Mom, Dad!<eos> Imagine a puppy that never grows up... never gets old.<eos> A puppy that stays a puppy forever.<eos> I give you the only thing you'll ever love... the Forever Puppy!
Scott Hubbard, Aerospace Times.<eos> Miss Elliot, how does it feel to sacrifice the next four years of your life to Mars?<eos> It's not a sacrifice. It's an opportunity.<eos> I feel humbled, excited, and grateful for the chance to be a pioneer.<eos> Miss Elliot, aren't you scared, given the history, given the dangers?
Relax. It's a dead end.<eos> He changed.<eos> Okay, guys, check the loading dock.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have to talk to you.
He changed.<eos> Okay, guys, check the loading dock.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.
Kendra, thank you, but I am good.<eos> State police are helping with blockades.<eos> They've been told he needs a heart transplant and a donor's suddenly become available.<eos> I promise I will keep you updated.<eos> You claim to be concerned about Gardner's health, but I think you care more about keeping him secret.
I'm taking us into the stratosphere.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, don't worry.<eos> She can handle it.<eos> Although I warn you, one of you may need to take over.
And I love you.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Stable, for now.<eos> It should buy us the time we need.<eos> And you?
Welcome to my grandfather's old factory.<eos> Now, I know, we all know, that Grandpa Mirando was a terrible man.<eos> We know of the atrocities he committed in this space.<eos> We know these walls are stained with the blood of fine working men.<eos> But today, I reclaim this space... to tell you a beautiful story.
Right there.<eos> That's it.<eos> That image.<eos> We're dead.<eos> Lucy, may I ask you a question?
This is nothing, really.<eos> It's used on beef.<eos> I mean, live cows.<eos> To check their marbling.<eos> Hi, Dr. Johnny. Is Okja with you?
There it is!<eos> Hello, Lucy!<eos> Lucy, we love you!<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.
If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever.<eos> And you wouldn't want that, now would you?<eos> Now get me the mayor!<eos> Joker out!<eos> Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!
We can have a cup of tea. We can talk about this.<eos> Stage Deli's been closed for years.<eos> okay?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.
stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I... I'm good.<eos> I don't give a shit what you are.
And then... I woke up.<eos> I was in this huge snowdrift.<eos> I was hurt.<eos> It was snowing.<eos> You must have been cold.
Your name was on the list.<eos> look... I don't know the guy.<eos> But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?
I think Rand would be happy to set up a... neighborhood improvement donation... to be spent however you choose.<eos> How about this?<eos> simply say the man... acted unusually... made you feel uncomfortable.<eos> I just don't think...<eos> I'll give you some time to think about it.
She says she has a message from Danny.<eos> Show her in.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got no clue what I'm doing here.<eos> Danny asked me to give this to you.
I insist.<eos> what are you so afraid of?<eos> You should be a little more like dad.<eos> Yeah? Grow some balls.<eos> I was just going to see you.
The guy who says he's Danny Rand?<eos> - He escaped from a mental...<eos> - There's nobody here but me.<eos> And I can take care of myself.<eos> - If he does try to contact you...
the Yang Clan Company.<eos> - I need to have a word with them.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Why do you wanna mess around with Triads?<eos> can I help you?
I wanna tell you about this great new product.
- No.<eos> But I, uh... I do need to know when the next shipment arrives at the Red Hook Pier.<eos> - Could you tell me that?<eos> - No.<eos> Mmm. But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.
I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.<eos> You have the power to change things at this company.<eos> That's why I... I wanted to show you this.
You don't even have a choice.<eos> You can't go back to Gao.<eos> She killed the last guy who failed to defeat me.<eos> Turned his head into a mailbox.<eos> I'm giving you a new choice.
Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.<eos> What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen. I know this isn't what you wanted. Any of you.
Stop the car.<eos> You've refused to sell the Hand's heroin.<eos> They've taken your pier.<eos> Butchered your men.<eos> They've given you two choices, serve or die.
You've refused to sell the Hand's heroin.<eos> They've taken your pier.<eos> Butchered your men.<eos> They've given you two choices, serve or die.<eos> I'm here to give you a third.
And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me...<eos> but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.
I thought I did.<eos> I just...<eos> - I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.
- I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.
Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.
Yeah, I'm just tired.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's better than torture.<eos> Hey! What's your problem?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
- I...<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> It's exhausting, isn't it?<eos> You know, I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.
So what?<eos> That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.<eos> He spoke it to you many times.
Who the hell is Frank Robbins?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> What happened?<eos> I need to go home.<eos> I was relieved to hear from you, sir.
- Did you get everything?<eos> If I give her too much, she'll fall asleep.<eos> If I give her too little, she'll resist you.<eos> Not afraid of needles, are you?<eos> You are about to face something you are completely unprepared for.
- Shut up!<eos> - Voice mail.<eos> Hi, this is a friend of Colleen's.<eos> Uh, she's... she's been poisoned.<eos> She's asking for you.
This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.<eos> We're seeking to build character, discipline, educate young people in the same way.<eos> Did Colleen tell you everything about me?
I'm not surprised.<eos> You're still a child.<eos> Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I offer you freedom, was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.
What the hell is this?<eos> Sorry to interrupt your dinner, but, please eat. I... I don't mind.<eos> My name is Bakuto.<eos> I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.<eos> Danny told you about me.
- Let's get him patched up.<eos> - Come on.<eos> This young man is our future.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's my sad duty to inform you all that... Lawrence Wilkins committed suicide last night.
I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.<eos> - And when that happens...<eos> I would. but the Hand are just common criminals with good marketing skills.<eos> You take their money and they'll come running.
- Stacy.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> You... you know who I am, how much I'm worth, right?<eos> - Of course, Mr. Meachum.<eos> - Call me Ward. I will pay you whatever you earn in a year, if you unstrap me and get me out of here. Tonight.
Stay still, Joy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Everything'll be okay.<eos> Don't do this in front of Joy.<eos> I will get you anything you want.
Danny made a poor decision when he attacked the DEA agents.<eos> His life is in danger.<eos> I haven't had any contact with him.<eos> Good morning.<eos> May I help you?
Yeah.<eos> But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> I was asked to give you something.
Heavens no.<eos> I've been looking forward to this.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?
- No one.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> but... - But what?<eos> Harold was my father's best friend. He would never...<eos> He seems to have no problem hurting you now.
Isn't it true your world fell apart after his return?<eos> Things changed for me. he must be removed.<eos> Removed?<eos> Killed.<eos> I can help you with that.
-Hey. Go get 'em.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna get started.<eos> Hello, everyone, my name is Jane Young, and I'm the director of the science museum.<eos> First of all, I wanna thank you all so much for being here.
Mom, are you okay?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine.<eos> I still have one last wish granted to me.<eos> And I'm willing to make a deal.<eos> I'll agree to wish for you to have unlimited wishes, giving you complete control over the box.
My bad.<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Mr. Lucas?<eos> Mr. Cage?<eos> - Which do you prefer?
Is there anything that you can do?<eos> You know, I think it's my grandfather and he's senile and he might be trying to get a hold of me.<eos> Actually, I have a missing person's report.<eos> I have the number right in front of me.<eos> I can read it to you if you want.
I know damn well what is happening here.<eos> I know too much.<eos> And next, they'll come after my family.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?
I know too much.<eos> And next, they'll come after my family.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?<eos> I can't tell you. I...
- Then who were you chasing?<eos> Officer, unless you have a reason to hold me...<eos> Don't give me that "officer" bullshit.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.
Talk.<eos> Couple months ago, we were planning a vacation.<eos> He wanted to get away.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> I came to you.. for answers. And now...
What do you mean?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> None of this sounds like John.<eos> He wasn't this kind of person.<eos> And there's nothing I'm not telling you.
Midland Circle Financial.<eos> I remember that name.<eos> Ward gave us a list of places to cease doing business with.<eos> It must be the Hand.<eos> I'll get you the address from the directory.
- Mmm. How about any other architect in your firm?<eos> Just because it's really important for our brand that we're not only on the cutting edge, but we are the cutting edge.<eos> Yes, but... can you keep a secret?<eos> I am the face of discretion.<eos> I can show you our most recent work.
- Only doing what's needed.<eos> You know, you're the opposite from my son.<eos> He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.
- I just do.<eos> This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time... I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.
- No, I just...<eos> I just wanted to say, you might be right.<eos> So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.
And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.<eos> They will disappoint you.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.
Sit tight for now.<eos> We'll have more answers soon.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Colleen Wing?<eos> I'm told my uniforms confiscated something unusual from you.
He'd sit at the piano sometimes, but he wouldn't play.<eos> Not like he used to.<eos> He didn't do anything like he used to.<eos> I missed him.<eos> Long before my mom came to you.
What happened to the others?<eos> They're down the hall.<eos> - Are they okay?<eos> - Looks like it.<eos> Listen, I need you to realize we are on the same side.
"My kid."<eos> Did you notice that you just said "my kid"?<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, I...<eos> I've been thinking lately that maybe I want to start a family.<eos> What exactly is going on between you and Mickey right now?
With a pencil.<eos> I know. I've heard the story.<eos> With a fucking pencil!<eos> Who the fuck can do that?<eos> Well, I can assure you... that the stories you hear about this man,
How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.<eos> Shall I announce you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Stay.<eos> Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.
Excellent.<eos> Mr. Wick?<eos> Do enjoy your party.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Are you enjoying the party?
Do enjoy your party.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Are you enjoying the party?<eos> Mr. Akoni.<eos> Are you enjoying the festivities?
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.<eos> He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.
You gave me this.<eos> Gift from the Boogeyman.<eos> Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.
Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.
Whatever you'd like, John.<eos> Would you like a back rub with that, John?<eos> You're going to help me.<eos> Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> Because I'm the only one that can help you.
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.<eos> How much help does it look like I need?<eos> It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick, is who in this cruel world of ours, is going to help you?
He's at the museum.<eos> Earl will guide you.<eos> Do be careful on your way down.<eos> Oh, and remember... you owe me.<eos> You don't want me owing you.
You don't want me owing you.<eos> Welcome everyone.<eos> Let us toast to the future of the High Table, and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Mr. Akoni, how are you?
You, and you with me.<eos> You go.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.
So, did you forget something?<eos> No, no, um...<eos> This is really hard to say. Uh, and forgive me for the timing of this, but, in about 90 days, you're gonna lose everything here.<eos> What?<eos> You all have been in trouble for a very long time and jt did not have the heart to tell you.
What did you do? !<eos> This is 10 karats, how much time does that buy me?<eos> Not enough, honey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I help you with anything, miss Stella?
I need to know what he did right, what he did wrong and what around here is worth saving!<eos> - Now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> We lease this back pasture to a dairy farm for grazing, it brings in a little.<eos> Most of the workers have found jobs elsewhere, a handful have stayed loyal to you.
- No.<eos> - Well, it sure looks like it.<eos> Equine slavery's got to go! I can't believe her.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Because I'll tell you something, no breeder's gonna come within a hundred miles of you with this kind of press.
I am so underfunded and understaffed.<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> - Yeah. I was told that some of the horses were burned alive, and one of the inmates is a convicted arsonist.<eos> The horses are fine. They're right over there in that corral.<eos> I believe you, Ms. Davis, but unfortunately some folks above my pay grade feel that these horses are unsafe.
So you're gonna take these horses away so they can spend the rest of their lives stacked on top of each other? Because of bullshit allegations whispered into a politician's ear.<eos> I have orders.<eos> These men may spend the night in jail.<eos> There may be guards all over the place. But when they're with these horses, they are free. And you're gonna take that away from them.<eos> I promise you, I promise you, these men would never hurt the horses.
I want so much for you to feel better.<eos> Hey, Ms. Stella.<eos> Could I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah, yeah, George b's in here. We just have to keep him quarantined.<eos> - I'll come to you.
Sometimes it's the little things that matter the most.<eos> Well, then, lesson learned.<eos> Me and the boys have...<eos> No, we really appreciate it. The way you stood up for us the other day there.<eos> And since this is coming to an end, we wanted to give you something just to say thank you.
Thank you.<eos> It's the best present anyone's ever gotten me.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - To see Stella.<eos> I don't think she's gonna want to talk to you.
Hey!<eos> Get off my ranch!<eos> I come in peace.<eos> No cameras, no press, it's just me.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.
I would like to adopt your horses, all of them, and set them free on my property.<eos> It would complete your prison program.<eos> I can re-frame all of this.<eos> "Stella the grieving widow sets her horses free."<eos> Cameras flash, I forgive you, everybody loves you, they already love me.
Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.<eos> - I haven't said yes yet.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.
What are you doing here?<eos> They're tracks, they definitely came this way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mrs. Stella, that woman was here.<eos> She wanted to talk to you.
Sitting there acting like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> Come on!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Hey, don't be afraid. I would never hurt you more than it hurt him.
Mr. jt told me a story once.<eos> About how your great-grandmother named the double diamond, not 'cause diamonds are pretty but 'cause they're unbreakable.<eos> I was the one who told him that story.<eos> And I get it, toughen up, but I'm not in the mood for a lesson right now.<eos> I wasn't trying to give you a lesson, just tell you that whatever happens tomorrow, great-grandmother would be proud to call you her blood.
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.<eos> Ana, please, it's Jack.<eos> Tea, right?<eos> Weak, black.<eos> I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to get this for you, but thank you, Jack.
It's crazy, isn't it?<eos> Night, Ana.<eos> Good night, Hannah.<eos> You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you. Uh, about New York.
Unless you want me to compete with Christian grey for your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Your boyfriend has a reputation for being a little ruthless.<eos> Is that what you like?
Really?<eos> Online hits don't automatically translate to print sales.<eos> Well, but they could.<eos> His online audience is an 18-to-24 demographic, and those are exactly the readers that we should be chasing.<eos> Um, I mean, I can show you the stats.
I'm sorry to interrupt. Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, well, coming right up.<eos> I see you heeded our little talk.<eos> What makes you think i would ever listen to you?<eos> You don't care about Christian.
I know<eos> I'd love to play games.<eos> Beaten the bests alone<eos> I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...<eos> Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today<eos> Now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me<eos> Work for you?<eos> Well, I could have saved you a lot of time then
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway<eos> You're on your own<eos> This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out<eos> Let me tell you something
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out<eos> Let me tell you something<eos> The only thing that I love more than saving lives.. Is my daughter<eos> So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay
- Yup<eos> A pair for every occasion<eos> There's enough guns here to outfit a small army. Huh?<eos> Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom
- Toretto?<eos> - That's interesting you ask<eos> This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere<eos> Nice little stair for you<eos> Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Watch these two<eos> Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer<eos> Which we can reverse<eos> And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location<eos> Telling you, they got skills
He's still green<eos> Yes, like first baby shit<eos> Yes, we've tried those location... wanna mobilize<eos> Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.<eos> No one respects you, over
I got limited time. So won't take up too much of yours<eos> Oh no<eos> No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,<eos> What more could you possibly want?<eos> To give you something back
What's that?<eos> - Rule number three<eos> - Which is?<eos> There are no rules<eos> What did I told you, Luke?
- I'm done.<eos> I want my son<eos> - I'll tell you when you're done<eos> Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes and follow my instruction<eos> I got you covered, go
I hear it's very, um, clean, which I like.<eos> I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.<eos> Not that I like that.<eos> Yeah, I don't like that part. Good evening.<eos> Can I bring you something to drink?
Want to invite me in?<eos> Yeah. No, of course.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was just, getting some work done.<eos> She didn't tell you when we, broke up?
She's an attractive woman.<eos> - Okay? Deal with it.<eos> - Very attractive.<eos> So how did that work?<eos> Did she slip you her number...
- Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Gotta refuel, right? I mean, you must be starving.<eos> Let me buy you dinner.<eos> That's very nice of you.
But I think maybe she got a better job.<eos> - You know where?<eos> - I don't. But I can ask around.<eos> That'd be great. Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?<eos> I'm in procurement.<eos> Okay.<eos> Procurement.<eos> So what about you?
Megan. Megan.<eos> This girl is friends with my daughter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This isn't Ginnie, Mr. Gallo. She's not like this.<eos> Let me find you a shirt.
You know that prizewinning douchebag Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.<eos> She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.<eos> She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.<eos> She is out of my league.<eos> Well... Maybe she saw something you don't.
The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?<eos> I want to pull everyone out of their offices.<eos> I want to open this place up.<eos> I came in here to speak with you about that.
His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.<eos> Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.<eos> Andy.<eos> - Yes, sir? - Which Glen needed often.<eos> - How are you? - Pretty good, sir.
Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.<eos> Andy.<eos> - Yes, sir? - Which Glen needed often.<eos> - How are you? - Pretty good, sir.<eos> How are you doing?
- You sure?<eos> - You go.<eos> - I thought you were finished.<eos> - No.<eos> To that end... now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.<eos> New strong personality.<eos> New energy.<eos> New commitment.<eos> Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.<eos> There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.<eos> That's a reasonable number.<eos> Zero. I thought you understood that.<eos> Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.<eos> With all due respect, Madam Secretary, the election is a month away.<eos> I know it is but as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.<eos> It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.
- Why is that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm guessing he's very busy.<eos> Probably.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen? Are you out of your mind?
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.<eos> It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.<eos> As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.<eos> Right on.<eos> Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.<eos> A soldier leading soldiers.<eos> Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or however it is this thing ends.<eos> There's no street parade at the end of this one.<eos> It's good to talk.<eos> Everybody.<eos> How are you?
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> This is my wife, Jeanie.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.<eos> Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.<eos> General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.<eos> I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.<eos> But there were some very interesting people there today.<eos> If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
Thank you.<eos> Cory, where's Badi?<eos> I don't know, boss.<eos> He was here a minute ago.<eos> I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
Real progress.<eos> But challenges do remain.<eos> Yes, I understand all of that, General.<eos> And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.<eos> I have been listening to you here this morning, and... I believe you are a good man.
- Oh, General, please come in.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.<eos> I've been trying to contact you. Oh, yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> But did they not tell you this is urgent?
I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.<eos> You have my approval, General.<eos> We both know it was never really mine to give. But... I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.
We both know it was never really mine to give. But... I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?
- What are those, 2.5?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, give me one of those.<eos> My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay, give me one of those.<eos> My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.<eos> I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.<eos> But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.<eos> Only we can help you.
Only we can help you.<eos> We have a saying in America.<eos> You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.<eos> I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.<eos> But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
- Give me his phone number.<eos> - What?<eos> Whose phone number?<eos> This fucking Cullen fuck. Give me his fucking phone number!<eos> - I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
Oh, hello, Norman.<eos> Mrs. Claremont. Aww.<eos> Beautiful weather we're having, huh?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Can I help you?
I don't give quotes on my mother, Mr. Ferguson.<eos> - I assume that's what you're after.<eos> - Uh, sort of. I'm looking into your family's disappearance.<eos> Roy Collier call you?<eos> Let me give you some advice, Mr. Ferguson.
All my life... I just wanted one person somewhere, sometime, to understand me.<eos> And that person turned out to be you.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> From Hollywood, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.<eos> This is Ed McMahon along with Doc Severinsen and the NBC Orchestra inviting you to join Johnny and his guests...
Brothers, stay the F away from me!<eos> Watch your language.<eos> Don't provoke him, Joan.<eos> You threatening me, new woman?<eos> Yes, I'm threatening you.
Censoring it is like putting pants on Elmo so no one sees the nothing between his legs.<eos> Elmo doesn't wear pants?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Yeah, I'm threatening you.
What do you want?<eos> Uh, I want...<eos> I want your advice.<eos> Go away!<eos> I just want to talk to you.
So what do you want?<eos> I screwed up a lot of stuff, and now...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?
And a play was rewritten without the author's permission.<eos> Do you guys know anything about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is your guy.<eos> He'll tell you everything you need to know.
We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a Hellhound.<eos> You were tracking him.<eos> You lost his scent.<eos> I found him on you.
You lost his scent.<eos> I found him on you.<eos> Which tells me...<eos> Nothing.<eos> I can't help you.
Perhaps not everything.<eos> Jordan.<eos> If the Hellhound can open the rift, we all go together.<eos> You're the bad guy.<eos> I'm pretty sure helping you is a bad idea.
- Ah, I get it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, you can ride a motorcycle. I'll give you that.<eos> Yes, ma'am, like a motherfucker.<eos> Okay. I'mma level with you, Jon.
- You have nice eyes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You remind me of my husband.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell you what.
Fuck.<eos> Pull a fucking gun on me?<eos> - I didn't know it was you!<eos> - You're not gonna answer your phone?<eos> You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA to talk to you?
I didn't do it on purpose!<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I was trying to shoot Ray Kurtz.<eos> Well, you missed, and he's gone.<eos> You fucked up this whole case and when I called your captain to find out where you were, she told me she hadn't heard from you since you initiated a sexual exchange with her at 1:00 a.m.
- Thanks, boss.<eos> I speak Spanish, pervs.<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Hey, how'd you like to come back to Miami?<eos> I wanna give you your job back.
I have to go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Burke!<eos> It's Julia!<eos> I have to talk to you!
Are you nervous?<eos> Never flown before.<eos> Nothing to it.<eos> Just sit back and be a bird and drink up.<eos> I offer you the worm from my beak, and you look at me like I fucked your mom? Sorry.
- at my buddy's gym. - No you don't.<eos> I could use a fellow like you.<eos> There's always work for a big guy who's smart enough to know he's better off letting people think he's dumb. And by the way, did I mention the bonuses?<eos> Outstanding benefits.<eos> I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the fuck a pension is.
How you doin'? I'm kiddin'!<eos> You call me Dean.<eos> And you hug me, my man.<eos> How are ya?<eos> I'm good. How are you?
It's pretty eclectic.<eos> I'm a traveler and I can't help it. I keep bringing souvenirs back.<eos> It's such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture.<eos> - You know what I'm saying? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Oh, you're gonna love this.
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.<eos> That's okay.<eos> We're not judging.<eos> We're not. That's a nasty habit, though.<eos> You should have Missy take care of that for you.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, with my genetic makeup, shit gonna go down.<eos> I'm a beast. I'm a beast!<eos> Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?
Rat you out.<eos> Tattletale.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, don't you worry about that.<eos> I can assure you, I don't answer to anyone.
They treat us like family.<eos> This bitch is crazy.<eos> The bitch is crazy.<eos> Oh, hey, hang on.<eos> Chris. Chris, I wanna introduce you to some friends.
What are you doing here?<eos> Good morning Mr Falk.<eos> - Mornin'<eos> As of now we'll be working together.<eos> I'll help you round up your men.
I want to speak to him immediately.<eos> Mr von Gütersloh.<eos> What luck that you pass by today!<eos> I want my money!<eos> I've been chasing you for months.
Shit.<eos> Get on with it, damn it.<eos> Yes. Now.<eos> Another!<eos> Have you had an accident?
The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you...
Yes, you did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.<eos> And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.<eos> Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Isla.<eos> My name's Isla.<eos> I don't look like an Isla, though.<eos> Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...<eos> - What about you?
- What?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
Why would you make all that up?<eos> I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...<eos> lie.<eos> We lie to ourselves.<eos> You are so annoying. Has anyone ever told you that?
They just got me running rampant here.<eos> I'm doing the job of five people.<eos> Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can I give you a description... of Billy?
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.<eos> Maybe they moved or something.<eos> Should we see if they have the new address?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Can I help you?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.<eos> If he told you that, it's a lie.<eos> He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.<eos> This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?<eos> He told you about that?
- Downtown. Oh, yeah?<eos> Can I give you a ride?<eos> That... That is most appreciated.<eos> Sure. Here. It's a little chilly out there.<eos> Let me help you with it.
- Slovenia.<eos> - Slovenia.<eos> Slovenia.<eos> Slovenia.<eos> You see, when I say it, it sounds like the armpit of the universe, but not when you say it.
When the whole Sunny custody thing is happening... my ex had his lawyer, high-priced lawyer.<eos> I'm there, no lawyer... totally confused about the situation.<eos> I'm tatted.<eos> Judge is looking at what my line of work is.<eos> At one point, she put her papers down, looked me square in the eyes and said, you know, "What happened to you in your childhood"
Yeah, sure. Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Listen, Clay, I would like to talk to you sometime about Hannah Baker.
Yeah, commitment's hard for Alex.<eos> At least I have the ability to try something new in life.<eos> Is that why you did it, Alex?<eos> Mrs. Baker.<eos> Hi. I wasn't expecting you.
At home, Hannah was...<eos> Well, I mean... sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times... she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.<eos> - But nothing she did told us she was... capable of...<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.<eos> Now that lawyers are involved.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.
If you're going to do a memorial, I'm going to take pictures.<eos> Mrs. Baker. Hi.<eos> I'm Courtney Crimsen.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I hope you like it.
That's a heavy question.<eos> That's, like, existential.<eos> Alex.<eos> Why don't you come with me.<eos> I been wanting to talk to you.
Clay who tore the posters down?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Clay and I are pretty close.<eos> It's just not something he would do.<eos> Can you think of anyone else who might have wanted to act out like that, about suicide or Hannah Baker's suicide?
You do look familiar, though.<eos> You two worked together?<eos> Right.<eos> At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.
A special shout-out to Zach Dempsey, who crushed it with 28 points.<eos> In other athletic news, the Lady Tigers won their game by a score of 54-32.<eos> Thought you said this wasn't a test.<eos> 'Cause this looks like a test.<eos> It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.<eos> It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?<eos> Yes, Clay.<eos> How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker?
Well... duty calls.<eos> Hi, Clay.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you at work.<eos> I wanted to give you something.
Sit down, please.<eos> I already told you, it's not mine.<eos> Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?
Principal Bolan feels, given your spotless record and your role in the school community, that a three-day suspension will suffice, as long as you sign up for the drug deferral program at the police station.<eos> I don't believe this. You have no idea why this is happening.<eos> Okay, tell me.<eos> Why is this happening?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?
He misses her very much.<eos> That's nice.<eos> He seems like a good kid.<eos> He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?
He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?<eos> Mrs. Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having?<eos> My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> My name is Clay.<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> Your husband was in an accident. He's alive.<eos> The paramedics said an officer would come tell you, but your husband wanted you to know right away, so I came.
Hello, how are you!<eos> Hi, Mr. Cantrell.<eos> Hey, Sheri.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Let me help you to your chair.
Have a seat.<eos> What's going on, Sheri?<eos> I, um...<eos> I heard about people getting these subpoenas today for court, and...<eos> I just... I wanted to talk to you about...
Your dad must know something from the other deputies.<eos> My dad's more of a "sweep it under the rug" kind of guy.<eos> Works for me.<eos> I don't think he gives a shit about you.<eos> 9-1-1. How can I help you?
I'm giving life one last try.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Dempsey.<eos> Morning.<eos> My name is Dennis Vasquez, representing Andrew and Olivia Baker, and this is a deposition.<eos> I'll be asking you questions, and you must answer them truthfully... unless your attorney clearly instructs you otherwise.
- I do not.<eos> I need one more cassette for my project. Is it okay if I just grab it?<eos> Yeah, go ahead, sweetie.<eos> Anything you need. Just put it down on the inventory, which no one bothers to look at - when they call the distributor anyway.<eos> - I told you, they only allow for...
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.<eos> Hannah didn't take it seriously?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?
I guess. Sort of empty.<eos> Empty?<eos> Yeah, I don't feel anything.<eos> Like... I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?
So what's on your mind today?<eos> I wanted to talk about Hannah Baker.<eos> She pushed me away.<eos> I was thinking about how hurt I was, and I didn't even for a minute stop to think that... she was hurting too.<eos> Look, Clay... whatever happened to Hannah, between you and her, with other kids, she made that choice to take her own life.
The other night, I almost threw myself off a cliff.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> You may not feel that way in a minute.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Hannah Baker came to see you the day she died.
I didn't mean... that, I guess.<eos> So what happened, Hannah?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Just... one thing on top of another.<eos> If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.<eos> At a party.<eos> What happened at the party?<eos> She told you what happened to her.
At a party.<eos> What happened at the party?<eos> She told you what happened to her.<eos> Look, even if she did come to visit me... this is not something I can talk about.<eos> So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone?
You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.<eos> That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.
You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you embarrassed by what happened?
- Alcohol?<eos> - Yeah, but I wasn't drinking.<eos> Drugs?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Did he force himself on you?
Should we involve your parents or the police?<eos> No!<eos> Hannah, who's the boy?<eos> Who's the boy?<eos> She couldn't give you a name.
- I know you can't.<eos> So let's talk about a hypothetical student who says she was raped but won't say who did it, or can't.<eos> When a student is assaulted, I'm required to go to the police.<eos> But I need to know exactly what happened, and who did it.<eos> If I tell you... will you promise me that he'll go to jail?
- Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> But wouldn't you like to know what happened after Hannah left that day?<eos> Look, something happened, Hannah.<eos> And I believe you.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.<eos> And I added tape number 14... which I hope will help you make that decision.
Mrs. Baker.<eos> Tony, what...<eos> What are you... what is it?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I have to apologize for not telling you everything.
But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.<eos> There are 14 audio files on there.<eos> You should listen to them in order.<eos> I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.<eos> But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors... either they kill you or they own you.
Okay. I have these vegetables they told me to bring over, uh, and the basket's pretty heavy.<eos> For me, I mean.<eos> Probably not you.<eos> Uh, here.<eos> Load them in the truck, and, uh, if you meet me by the garden, - I can get you the rest...
Dr. Harlan Carson, correct?<eos> Do you need a checkup?<eos> Probably.<eos> It's been a few years, but I'm not here for that.<eos> We already gave you as much medicine as we could spare
Sir, I need you to wake up.<eos> Sir!<eos> Wake the fuck up!<eos> Hey!<eos> Sir, how you doing this morning?
Look at this?<eos> Jay, this isn't what we talked about.<eos> Well, I think a lot of times in real estate, it's about managing expectations.<eos> Now, this is the first time this house has been shown. This is the first showing.<eos> So, if you like it, we should write up an offer today.
Anyway, give me a call, and I can show it today.<eos> Um, and I just want to apologize about this morning.<eos> I was mortified, frankly. I was appalled.<eos> Um, so, give me a call at the office or on my cell.<eos> - Dan, sir, how you doing?
Do you think you could show me these pumps?<eos> Okay, so, this facility takes water from the delta below...<eos> Pumps it 200 feet uphill into the aqueduct... That runs into our valley.<eos> So... why were the pumps turned off?<eos> You ever heard of the delta smelt?
Oh, hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thanks so much for rescuing me the other day.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> What can I help you with?
If they need anything else, please... Just um, send me the bill?<eos> Emma Gardner.<eos> My condolences.<eos> I was your father's doctor.<eos> He talked about you all the time, very proud.
Get your hands off of me...<eos> What did you see? Nothing!<eos> Jesus!<eos> You've been following me since breakfast.<eos> I want to talk to you about my father.
Selling is the only way to salvage anything.<eos> The more people who sell, the bigger the profit.<eos> You and all your fancy degrees... You should know that more than anyone!<eos> Where were you the night my father died?<eos> Why would I tell you, you little snitch?
This doesn't make any sense.<eos> Go back to New York!<eos> Emma!<eos> So far, so good.<eos> How about you?
Okay, I want you to track it, and tell me what you find.<eos> Nico... you gotta trust me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Can I help you?
I trust you.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yes, I was wondering, do you have a list of all...<eos> The land sales in this area, say within the last 18 months?<eos> Yeah, I can get you that.
And someone's bought the property next door...<eos> And we're concerned with what they're planning to do with it.<eos> Things are hard enough as it is.<eos> There are rules.<eos> But I suppose I could let you borrow the files... For a couple of hours.
Emma?<eos> I promise.<eos> All right, I'll call you at the house.<eos> See ya'.<eos> Operator the number you have dialed... Has been disconnected.
Have a seat.<eos> I'm sorry the way things turned out.<eos> Don't apologize, city girl.<eos> You saved me.<eos> I owe you.
What, so you got drunk together.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we did, a last hurrah.<eos> A way to really bury the hatchet.<eos> You'll see, if you live long enough. There comes a time when you have no choice... But to forgive and let go.<eos> Why should I believe you?
I love you, buckaroo.<eos> I'll always love you.<eos> And I will see you on the other side.<eos> I don't want my mom or anybody to see this.<eos> I gave my word to Markus that I would show you... And only you, one day.
I'll always love you.<eos> And I will see you on the other side.<eos> I don't want my mom or anybody to see this.<eos> I gave my word to Markus that I would show you... And only you, one day.<eos> I had to trust you first.
You know what I mean?<eos> It's a job not complete. You win, you go out on your own terms. You lose... they push you the fuck out.<eos> Couldn't finish.<eos> What happens if you lose again?<eos> Where does that put you?
This is my business, man.<eos> All right, go home.<eos> You're done for the day.<eos> I'm taking you off the Culver house.<eos> We're gonna give you new listings tomorrow.
Who saved room for pill brûlée?<eos> Ooh!<eos> I can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant to represent your cerebellum.<eos> So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's.<eos> But admit it, Rick... you're going crazy cooped up in here.
- To be clear, you had a problem as you said last year.<eos> The real estate business, well this a bad business.<eos> So you tried the normal channels, the banks, but you're companies still failing so you come to us.<eos> - For a loan.<eos> - You never thought to ask why we might lend you one million dollars with no collateral required?
Properties, cash flow, so we can better disguise our activities.<eos> - Look, we just wanna pay the money back and you know, be on our way.<eos> - As I said, the first sum was an investment for you to keep.<eos> All future funds will be run through the front office, the same as other Stussy income.<eos> A few thousand a month, more or less, now I can get you the specs and instructions. We'll have to account for the comings and goings in your software.
You're just forgetting one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> Smile.<eos> Always smile.<eos> - I'm not sure if. - You've ever heard. - The name.
With batteries.<eos> Very nice. Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> I don't think that a ten-year loan would be prudent at this time. For our bank. With you.
There's how old you are, there's how many birthdays you have left...<eos> How much pubic hair you have left.<eos> See? No stopping her.<eos> Come on, Frankie, let's get out of here.<eos> I'm going to paint a very unflattering portrait of you.
But he's so nice.<eos> Thank you, Mom.<eos> Anytime, darling.<eos> You've always been like a daughter to me.<eos> So Grace, how are you?
It's all good.<eos> We're cool.<eos> I think now might be a good time to go over and say hi.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> So I should just stay here and talk to you?
Ni hao is the Chinese.<eos> The Corsicans use the simple salut.<eos> And guten Tag, if German's your thing.<eos> Is that...<eos> Are they with you?
No, it's perfectly fine.<eos> Mr. Stussy himself gave me permission.<eos> Who?<eos> Your employer.<eos> You do see the sign above which you stand, and how a man with a keener sense of reason might extrapolate a connection with the name I just mentioned.
Remember how I said we were expanding our IT department?<eos> No.<eos> Well, we are.<eos> Sorry, I was dealin' with the...<eos> Your... Did I tell you what I like about this place,
We're partners now.<eos> We are not partners.<eos> That... This...<eos> - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital. Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.
You see, that's the problem with you Americans.<eos> You watch too many movies, and you think the deal can always be changed, and it can't.<eos> We're partners now, and that's all there is to it.<eos> So, you might as well just lie back, as they say, and enjoy yourselves.<eos> Let me tell you what it is that attracts me to the parking lot business, yours in particular.
I'm Chief.<eos> Or I was Chief. Or, no, I still am.<eos> Anyway... I thought in the spirit of inter-collegial understanding...<eos> See, I'm in town looking into a homicide, and the victim spent some time here, back in the '70s.<eos> Right. Okay, I'll tell you what.
Viv!<eos> - Ms. Lord? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I'm Chief Burgle. Gloria.<eos> With the Eden Valley Police, up Minnesota.<eos> Okay if I ask you a few questions?
Doesn't that imply that...<eos> There you go.<eos> Using three-syllable words again for a one-syllable problem.<eos> First, that's a two-syllable word...<eos> Let me tell you what I saw in Fallujah.
We're moving offices, so I wrote the new number on the back.<eos> "Chief."<eos> Ignore that.<eos> We're doing some restructuring.<eos> They always find a way to screw you, don't they?
For the love of God, you can't send her back.<eos> You've got 10 minutes to clean out your desk.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> And you're gonna sign a paper saying that you're not gonna sue us for wrongful termination or whatever half-cocked scheme comes into your head once the shock wears off.
Just paid her wagon off, apparently.<eos> That sounds like an insurance matter.<eos> Yes, sir, except the driver in question left the scene of the accident at speed, and that's police.<eos> Well, like I said, am I talking to myself here, or...<eos> Soon as the girl's in tomorrow, I'll have her call up that info, and we'll get it over to you.
I'm already rich.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I wish you'd let us sit at the real table.<eos> In the dining room.<eos> I'll let you into a secret, madam.
The stamp.<eos> The famed Two-Penny Red U.S. misprint.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, the "2" was the wrong way around.<eos> How do you...<eos> It's all very Old Testament, really, this feud between you and Raymond.
Fudge, you were turning in.<eos> That's okay.<eos> You want some tea?<eos> Yeah, sounds good.<eos> So remember I was telling you about my hit-and-run?
Oh, you think the IRS won't...<eos> This is what they do.<eos> Catch cheats.<eos> Middle managers and movie stars, people who park their money in a Denver Wells Fargo under their mother-in-law's maiden name.<eos> But I assure you, the IRS could not unravel an intricate web of shell companies and loan-outs with secret accounts in Monaco, Luxembourg, and the Cook Islands, if you gave them the account numbers.
Yeah? You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.<eos> Bigger the bank, the safer the banker.<eos> So, the IRS?<eos> Section 41C of the US tax code affords my client the right to licensed representation in the face of any IRS inquiry.<eos> As counsel, I'm filing here with you an official protest to this baseless and cockeyed inquiry, and demand you withdraw immediately and file by mail the statutory-required 30-day notice listing the exact documents you require and personnel you wish to interview.
And, uh, Officer Lopez is from here in St. Cloud.<eos> I was in the other night talking to your Mr. Feltz about a traffic skirmish involving a company car.<eos> Well, I'm...<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, Sy's the man to help you there.
And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.<eos> The same first initial.<eos> Lived in towns with similar names.<eos> What are they...<eos> Is there some kind of feud between you and Ray?
Mere what?<eos> You see, in 1932 there were, what, 24 Hitlers in a German phone book.<eos> Now, are you suggesting that they were all responsible for the Final Solution?<eos> Twenty-four, exactly?<eos> Sir, was there some kind of disagreement over money between you and your brother?
- Reason we ask is...<eos> You're saying...<eos> My brother was trying to rob me?<eos> All right.<eos> I'd like to thank you for bringing all this to our attention. And to assure you that if anything fruitful comes to mind, any details that you might find illuminating, then we'll make sure to bring them to your attention, all right?
I'd like to thank you for bringing all this to our attention. And to assure you that if anything fruitful comes to mind, any details that you might find illuminating, then we'll make sure to bring them to your attention, all right?<eos> Are we leaving?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Come on.<eos> If you think of anything.
He'd been abusing her, you see?<eos> Beating her in places you don't show.<eos> And tonight she'd had enough, so she cut his throat.<eos> And watched him bleed.<eos> Now, the police will contact you tonight to inform you of his death.
Got some bruises.<eos> See, I'm a simple guy.<eos> When it snows, I put on boots.<eos> Sun comes out, I wear shades.<eos> I see a girl like you and a guy like that, I think... "Now, how's a working man with hillbilly hair and a beer belly "land Miss State Penitentiary 2010?"
Well, since I'm Chief of Eden Valley, couldn't I just, I don't know, approve myself?<eos> You can't do that. That's...<eos> Let me guess, against regulations?<eos> Darn right it's against regulations.<eos> You're gonna need to get Chief Muderlack's John Hancock on one of these babies, then I'll give you the yellow one, and then when that's filled, you get the blue.
You know, forensics is doing a test on the syringe.<eos> You ask me to place a bet?<eos> I think it takes a jury 10 minutes to convict you, nutbag with a syringe or no nutbag with a syringe.<eos> You like pie?<eos> I'm gonna visit you after the holiday, bring you some pie.
That's the nature of existence.<eos> Life is suffering.<eos> I think you're beginning to understand that.<eos> Amen.<eos> Can I show you something?
I'm just...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I need a minute.<eos> No problem, no problem.<eos> Have a drink, you'll feel better. No.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.<eos> So, you see, lives are changing for the better.<eos> And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yuri will show you to your new office.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.<eos> And then, I had a revelation of my own.<eos> Parking lots. The final piece to the storage triptych.<eos> People are always going to need a place to park.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
Parking lots. The final piece to the storage triptych.<eos> People are always going to need a place to park.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.<eos> At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.<eos> My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
No. Why?<eos> Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.<eos> Whatever past disagreements, bygones.<eos> You know?<eos> Think of Jesus, His actions. So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
About time.<eos> Mrs. Goldfarb?<eos> Thanks again for coming in.<eos> I was very clear with the other officer last time.<eos> You realize memories fade.
No?<eos> Well...<eos> You got it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have it, but I'd like to offer you something else instead.
Where are my things? Well, now, Willy Loman,<eos> I feel I ought to punish you for not doing what you were told.<eos> You...<eos> You can't win this game, you do realize that?<eos> I thought you didn't play games. I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?
I feel I ought to punish you for not doing what you were told.<eos> You...<eos> You can't win this game, you do realize that?<eos> I thought you didn't play games. I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?<eos> Because I wanna hurt you.
You...<eos> You can't win this game, you do realize that?<eos> I thought you didn't play games. I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?<eos> Because I wanna hurt you.<eos> I wanna look you in the face and rip out something you love.
We're fine.<eos> Not a parking lot, folks.<eos> - Side of the road.<eos> - I know. It's kind of a long story, but in the end of it, we all go home, so...<eos> Thanks for stopping, it's real Christian of you.
From Brussels?<eos> They got phones in Belgium, yeah? E-mail?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.
- That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.<eos> They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.<eos> They will be sad for a time, then they will find happiness again.<eos> Your Assaf will marry in a year and name his first daughter for you.
This is a Muslim home.<eos> Why does Anubis hold out his hand for me?<eos> It is my thanks.<eos> You were once a girl with your own Tita.<eos> Who taught you the ways of Egypt old, of when the Nile was full and flooding.
Why does Anubis hold out his hand for me?<eos> It is my thanks.<eos> You were once a girl with your own Tita.<eos> Who taught you the ways of Egypt old, of when the Nile was full and flooding.<eos> She told you stories of the Wolf and the Jackal, the Red Wind, and of the Child of Bast.
He beat me, and I would like not to see his world.<eos> Choose.<eos> You are a kind boy.<eos> You choose for me?<eos> Are you sure I do this with you?
If he escapes, the thing in the stars, the world is over.<eos> Like that.<eos> And people believe that?<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You're not cold?
You keep giving away your life.<eos> You don't much care if you live or die, do you?<eos> The world's not what I thought it would be.<eos> You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky.<eos> I can help you.
Don't lose this.<eos> Don't give it away.<eos> You've been given protection once.<eos> You had the sun itself.<eos> I can give you the moon.
Now having said that, a San Vicente police officer was killed.<eos> A devoted husband and loving father is no longer with us.<eos> Someone must pay for that.<eos> I have the utmost faith in our police department and in our district attorney that will happen.<eos> I guarantee you justice for Sam Caldwell and his family.
I'm not Solomon, I'm not anointed.<eos> But you are.<eos> I'm Pernell Fucking Harris.<eos> And I'm charged with murder.<eos> God talks right to you.
I gotta...<eos> Shit! Get the fuck off of me!<eos> Where were you going?<eos> Man, get the fuck off of me, man!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
He's my friend, your godfather. That's why.<eos> Go wash up.<eos> Val.<eos> Why are you empty handed?<eos> You know what, let's get you a glass of champagne?
I'm afraid I lose interest in most people fairly quickly.<eos> Hi, can I have water, please?<eos> Of course. I begin to tune them out and then the conversation falls apart.<eos> Very funny.<eos> So you're not interested in getting to know people face to face, but you want to collect every single bit of information about them behind their backs.
You either kill me or, well...<eos> You know.<eos> You give that back to Pernell.<eos> You tell him I'm not that guy anymore and I never will be again.<eos> I told you, Reverend Paul. You testify, you die.
You don't waste time.<eos> I like that.<eos> Ashna. Excuse me?<eos> Katsorti, Mohini, Savitri. Sir, only language I'm familiar with is American.<eos> Can I get you something else?
And if the video got erased somehow, I'm gonna feel personally responsible. And I'm gonna personally take it out on you.<eos> I'd have to go back and check my notes.<eos> Maybe I messed up the evidence tag.<eos> You've got 24 hours to figure it out.<eos> I know some of you are disappointed in me, but may I remind you of Isaiah 1:18.
Maybe we'll have a cancellation.<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir!<eos> I'm sorry to... Sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Yeah, can I help you?
I had to see you.<eos> Yeah, you want to see me, then make an appointment.<eos> I'm not leaving until you check me out.<eos> You may be the only person that can stop... what's happening with me.<eos> I give my time to you, that means I take it from someone else, and I'm not willing to do that because you bullied your way into my office.
Not by choice.<eos> I want to settle down. Hopefully, here.<eos> Well, what about your family, where are they now?<eos> I had a brother but he's gone.<eos> Let me help you, miss. - Yeah.
I want to settle down. Hopefully, here.<eos> Well, what about your family, where are they now?<eos> I had a brother but he's gone.<eos> Let me help you, miss. - Yeah.<eos> - Can I help you?
"Well, come on over here and suck Mama's dick."<eos> Fresh fish, ladies. Fresh fish.<eos> Tap your brakes, judge.<eos> Eating for two.<eos> Mr. Harris, you're being charged with violating Penal Code section 1210.7 for electronic monitoring.
You're like a piñata.<eos> They hit you with a stick, and you still shit candy.<eos> It doesn't matter. You're not getting your bail reinstated.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> They have pictures of you on the Bay Bridge.
Yeah. I know.<eos> I, um...<eos> I feel like I'm being watched.<eos> By who?<eos> By you, by Asa, by the mailman, my neighbors, my dog.
Good to see you.<eos> Hey.<eos> What a turnout. What a turnout.<eos> I want to thank all of you for coming. Thank you so much.<eos> Now, many of you know I'm a proud Harris High Dragon class of '86.
For you.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> You found me.<eos> You picked me up.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
- Fuck you.<eos> I said give me your hand!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You know, I heard the last thing PJ did before he swallowed that bullet was call your cell phone.<eos> What do you think he wanted to tell you?
Fuck you!<eos> You know, I heard the last thing PJ did before he swallowed that bullet was call your cell phone.<eos> What do you think he wanted to tell you?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> What did your pillow say to you?
- I believe.<eos> Do you love Him?<eos> I love Him!<eos> I love God!<eos> May the Lord be with you, Pernell.
I love God!<eos> May the Lord be with you, Pernell.<eos> Mike, we warned you, but you wanted to keep working.<eos> How'd the psycho find me?<eos> I think he may have tracked you from here.
It's kind of a bribe.<eos> Okay.<eos> This first piece is a bit of a secret.<eos> I'm having a baby.<eos> You don't look like it.
What?<eos> You shouldn't be blaming God.<eos> You should be asking yourself, how can this change you for the better?<eos> What apathy can your mother's death shake away?<eos> Because no matter why God did it, he's given you a chance to do something different.
But you can't, Keith.<eos> Not like this.<eos> You can barely stand up.<eos> Why would you even show up like this?<eos> 'Cause I know how important this house is to you, Miss, and you asked for my help.
Not like this.<eos> You can barely stand up.<eos> Why would you even show up like this?<eos> 'Cause I know how important this house is to you, Miss, and you asked for my help.<eos> You know what? That's really sweet.
I'll tell them you had to work.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss.<eos> Miss Graham!<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Browning!<eos> How are you?
You sure this is the kind of neighborhood you'd want to raise him in?<eos> This is exactly the kind of place we've always dreamed of.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - That how you feel, Keith?<eos> You understand, though, that everyone here is traditional...
'Cause tomorrow is gonna be different.<eos> No more sugarcoating.<eos> And no more hiding.<eos> It was on her finger. A gold engagement ring with three diamonds on it.<eos> - Well, I can assure you...
You would?<eos> Even with the little express lane camera snapping shots of you every 2 miles?<eos> There's a couple places he could have stopped.<eos> Mike Alcala said it was an older white guy with gray hair, goatee.<eos> That doesn't sound like you.
Welcome back, Bay Area.<eos> Well, the focus in the Shane Caldwell murder case has been all about privileged 1%-er Judge Pernell Harris, but I say enough about the alleged perpetrator.<eos> Let's talk about the family for once...<eos> Slain officer Shane Caldwell's family.<eos> Heather, how are you and the kids doing?
Special correspondent Yasmin Florenoy has a story that'll make you count down the days to the next municipal election.<eos> - You lied to me. - Jesus Christ.<eos> What the fuck are you doing in my house?<eos> What the fuck are you doing in my life?<eos> Someone took a shot at me because of you.
I'm looking for my son's program.<eos> Bathwater?<eos> Sure.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Anne Wu gave you that. Why?
Your stop.<eos> Do you remember me when I was the judge in your trial?<eos> Your lawyer said you had Lewy Body Dementia, that you were insane, but I didn't believe it.<eos> I think I might have the same thing.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
My life depends on it.<eos> I only talk to people who have been touched.<eos> You been touched?<eos> You have.<eos> He talks to you, doesn't He?
They make me take drugs.<eos> And these drugs, they...<eos> They make it go away.<eos> They say hell is the depravation of the presence of God, and they're right.<eos> What do they give you?
What do they give you?<eos> Quetiapine.<eos> You're a judge.<eos> Please make them stop.<eos> I... sincerely wish you the best of luck, Mr. Brody.
If it's too easy, it's gonna fuck up the chapter you want to write about me?<eos> No. I'm not going to write a chapter on you.<eos> I'm looking at a whole goddamn book.<eos> And the only thing in question is the ending.<eos> Do I actually find out what's wrong with you and solve your problem, or do I spit the words "I told you so"
Do you see?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> The hive takes care of itself.<eos> If even one of us is distracted, we all become vulnerable.<eos> How can I help you?
When Dr. Magic Pills is giving dire warnings, you know you shouldn't be taking this shit.<eos> He was shot in the head.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> You're the one who bought the paper.<eos> And he was the one asking for you while you were out gallivanting in Stockton.
He's corrupt.<eos> The whole force is corrupt.<eos> You must hate me.<eos> No.<eos> There's too much goodness in you.
And when it got to be too much, he tried to quit, but they wouldn't let him.<eos> Who wouldn't let him?<eos> Shane made a video recording.<eos> He thought it would help him get out of the life.<eos> Julio was bringing it to you.
He's using an IMEI generator.<eos> He could be right next door, but the call would look like it's coming from Spokane or wherever the fuck.<eos> There's even one from Yemen on here.<eos> Bitch-ass.<eos> You're running out of swear words.
God damn it.<eos> Okay, so Plan B. I just call him and I tell him...<eos> No. That's Plan Stupid.<eos> He's going to be expecting Anne Wu, and I haven't heard you do a British accent, but I bet it sucks.<eos> He won't believe you.
Okay, so Plan B. I just call him and I tell him...<eos> No. That's Plan Stupid.<eos> He's going to be expecting Anne Wu, and I haven't heard you do a British accent, but I bet it sucks.<eos> He won't believe you.<eos> Can I get you something?
According to California Evidence Code. Section 1034, clergy cannot be made to testify.<eos> Reverend Curtis doesn't have to say a thing.<eos> Is someone threatening you, Reverend?<eos> Do you need protection?<eos> We can help you.
Watch it.<eos> She's moaning about the name of some damn school.<eos> Not like her illiterate kids ever show up.<eos> We show up.<eos> And we shouldn't have to put up with racists like you when we do.
You just kept pushing till a few more bucks fell out of my pocket and then another push and another!<eos> You think this guy is a preacher?<eos> He's a fucking vampire.<eos> He'll suck out your soul, and then he'll sell it back to you for 50 grand a pop.<eos> Sir, you can turn your back on God, but He will never turn His back on you.
It isn't God that fails us.<eos> It's our faith in Him that fails us.<eos> What? God doesn't exist, asshole.<eos> If God doesn't exist, why are you so angry at Him?<eos> You're mad at God because He didn't give you what you wanted on your terms.
- What?<eos> - Crystal.<eos> I'm not exactly the guy you should be asking that question to.<eos> Come on, Nick. You know her. You talk to her.<eos> Love or not, she doesn't want to be with you.
As soon as a hallucination kicks in, we will see the activity here in your temporal lobe.<eos> Just relax.<eos> This is only a formality.<eos> But we have to do it to make the diagnosis official. All right?<eos> And then we will make you better.
Just relax.<eos> This is only a formality.<eos> But we have to do it to make the diagnosis official. All right?<eos> And then we will make you better.<eos> I'll take those for you.
You see, we've got this witness who saw Pernell Harris dump Shane Caldwell's body.<eos> He said that our friend was in a blue van with a bird on it.<eos> Now, I have to say that I'm ashamed to admit that we couldn't figure it out.<eos> And then I saw the video.<eos> Connecting you to the van that Pernell was driving throws preacher confidentiality out the window.
So you believe He exists.<eos> They proved the theorem, not the existence.<eos> I already know He doesn't exist.<eos> All right? So if you can't tell me what's wrong with me, at least tell me you know how to make it go away.<eos> I could give you drugs that will turn you into a zombie.
- Two more beers.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Okay.<eos> San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.<eos> It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here...
Some people deserve to die.<eos> There he is.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm glad you could make it, Dad.<eos> Can I start you guys off with some drinks?
Jocelyn and I... we're trying to have a baby.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> How about a "How are you?"
Just breathe.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> That never would have happened, Tessie, if you called me first.<eos> You're supposed to consult me before any large purchases.<eos> I will consult with you whenever I damn well please.
- How've you been?<eos> - Good.<eos> Better.<eos> What can I do for you Nathan?<eos> Well, I just came by to congratulate you and Pernell. Thank you.
Whatever you did to him, I don't wanna know.<eos> Well, it didn't come to that.<eos> God sent me visions through P.J.<eos> Took me down a whole other path.<eos> Let me show you something.
God sent me visions through P.J.<eos> Took me down a whole other path.<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> Get in.<eos> I want you to see how this works. How God is using me.
You were just trying to do what you thought was right.<eos> And with all the corruption out there, we need more people like you in this fuckin' city.<eos> - You need some help?<eos> - No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> No, please, let me give you a hand.
Maybe do you wanna... Do you wanna have a drink?<eos> Really? Yeah.<eos> Man, what am I, stupid?<eos> - Um... - So...<eos> It's really sweet of you, but, um...
How long do we have before I gotta call an ambulance?<eos> You're fucking crazy.<eos> That's what they say. - Call now.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you some questions first.
It's tough. It's tough. I considered killing you quick, so you could die thinking you'd won.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - Fuck you. Fuck you.<eos> Who's paying you?<eos> I could pay you more.
I mean, this is something.<eos> I mean, I've heard the stories about how crazy you are, but actually seeing it?<eos> Seeing it firsthand? I mean, it's truly astonishing.<eos> So...<eos> I'm gonna give you back that fancy tear catcher you gave me, 'cause you're gonna need it more than me.
Olegaria!<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> You'll eat well in this house.<eos> Look, some tasty haggis.<eos> I'll show you around.
You be rough and gentle at the same time.<eos> My husband did it every night.<eos> He loved Bellota more than anything.<eos> Only he could ride her.<eos> I'm sorry to deprive you of her.
Don't be shy.<eos> You like helping people, don't you?<eos> Yes, when I can.<eos> Could you help me?<eos> You?
Be quiet, and let the lieutenant explain.<eos> You just need to swear that you witnessed the wedding.<eos> I'm sure that if you do, you'll be rewarded.<eos> Do you think she might lower the rent?<eos> She might even give you the mill.
Why not?<eos> Don't tell me you did all this just to have me as a reward.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> I wish you well.<eos> Perhaps one day, I'll be able to help you or your son, like you helped mine.
Now go back to the village and forget this ever happened. And marry that woman.<eos> For the sake of your son.<eos> I didn't marry, on principle. But I recognised my son.<eos> Look at me! Not like that sod who turned his back on you.<eos> And thanks to you, that sod is now my husband.
Come close to the fire.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I once told you I would be prepared to help your son.<eos> I stand by what I said.<eos> I'll get you the antiserum, on one condition.
I am in the business of making eagles, and you... what you are, my friend, is just a shit bird.<eos> We live in an age of instant gratification.<eos> We're like junkies chasing validation.<eos> And as soon as you get that hit, we go chasing after the next one.<eos> But once you get grounded in who you are, those results will start coming to you, and you won't be able to stop them.
Recognize the name?<eos> No. I'm sorry.<eos> Your parole officer.<eos> Hi Mr. Bagwell.<eos> Are you aware we have a problem?
Yes, please.<eos> My God.<eos> There it is.<eos> Wow.<eos> Looks like Mr. Metzger left you quite the legacy there.
Well, I'm sorry about that. I have new responsibilities in a new job, and...<eos> Well, I'm sure you do.<eos> Well, then I don't see how I can say no, as much as I would like to.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That's very gracious of you.
And we're at the animal hospital right now. He's in surgery, but...<eos> Honey, I'm just telling the nice lady what happened.<eos> Anyways, I'm just wondering if there's, at all any chance for an appointment later this afternoon.<eos> Let me check his schedule.<eos> Thank you so much. Thank you.
For what?<eos> Can we just go to the fucking train station? - Okay! Okay!<eos> Fine!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How many times has this happened to you?
Where are you?<eos> - I'm, in bed.<eos> - What?<eos> It is fever, I didn't want to come into your office and get everybody sick.<eos> Yeah, well, that's, very considerate of you.
Nobody runs in your family.<eos> You were trying to escape.<eos> I was what?<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I help you?
Marius, you awake?<eos> Marius, I'm Mr. Bagwell.<eos> Hi, Mr. Bagwell.<eos> I don't want to shake your hand. Okay.<eos> I just came to check up on you.
I hope not.<eos> Otherwise, you should feel free to ask the Director for someone you're more comfortable with.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think I'll stick with you.
- Come on, Conlin.<eos> - You wanna finish your time?<eos> You know I don't.<eos> You gotta push him to meet Hafiz. I'm...<eos> I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
- What'd you say?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> Delete the recording.<eos> You're really something, Mathison.<eos> I gotta hand it to you.
That money was a loan to help pay for that.<eos> From whom?<eos> Sekou?<eos> From whom?<eos> If I tell you who gave me the money...
Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?<eos> No one is trying to saddle you with anything, Rob.
I understand you'd rather not go to the hospital.<eos> You want to tell me why?<eos> Because I'm fine.<eos> You just had a grand mal seizure.<eos> You're not fine.
I could be 40 years old before I get outta here!<eos> I will find a way to fix this.<eos> I need the transcript of a call placed between these two numbers within 24 hours of this date.<eos> You gotta push him to meet Hafiz.<eos> I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
Can you s... tell everyone I said goodbye?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> Mr. Hashem, you haven't eaten a thing. Here.<eos> Don't mind if I do.<eos> So Simone told me you got me my job back. - Yeah, we did.
What's up, man?<eos> - Good to see you home so soon.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Hey.<eos> We'll chat later. - Mr. Hashem, thank you.
Demanding that I come here, putting everything at risk?<eos> - It's already at risk.<eos> - This is not safe, Saul.<eos> Ten miles from the border?<eos> The Israelis catch you, they'll just ask you some awkward questions.
Is that why we're here?<eos> Goddamn it, Majid.<eos> Are you cheating on the deal or not?<eos> Last week Nafisi flew by private jet to Samjiyon airbase in North Korea.<eos> - He told you this?
I know you've been meeting with her. Yeah.<eos> Saul came to me with the same theory.<eos> Carrie, I'm not Saul.<eos> I know.<eos> You were introduced by Otto Duering in Berlin at the ambassador's residence.
I-I don't pretend to be anything more than that.<eos> Then stop the bad advice.<eos> How can you be so sure. Iran's not building a bomb in North Korea?<eos> I can't, but neither can you be so sure they are. And that's the point, isn't it?<eos> I came to you as a friend, Carrie, an admirer even, and I'm telling you this in the same spirit...
I don't think you understand how vulnerable you are.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> Mommy, can we go now?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, we can.<eos> Nice talking to you, Carrie.
At 4 in the morning? Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> Some activity in the area.<eos> I thought you might have noticed something.
Find out about Nafisi.<eos> Get me the real answer.<eos> His name is Saad Mahsud.<eos> He's working for the FBI.<eos> I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
The president is making speeches in Lower Manhattan.<eos> -I'm thinking it's safe.<eos> -I understand your frustration, but the concern here is continuity of government.<eos> Really?<eos> You really think that's what's going on? It doesn't strike you as extreme, my sequestration here?
-Conlin, wait.<eos> -That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?
Nothing just slips that woman's mind.<eos> Relax.<eos> There. I wouldn't be asking if I didn't absolutely have to know.<eos> You're right, sir.<eos> The chief was not... totally forthcoming with you.
-He confirmed it.<eos> That guy in the photo you sent me?<eos> Not an associate of Sekou Bah.<eos> I ran his photo through NGI.<eos> They came up empty, just like you.
I'm afraid not, ma'am.<eos> I'm done here.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I help you, ma'am?
I can't wait to get into the private sector.<eos> All that data they wouldn't let us touch.<eos> Can you believe the numbers they're throwing around here?<eos> I know.<eos> They say anything strange to you?
Kind of.<eos> "Kind of"? What's that?<eos> He was in bad shape.<eos> I made it worse.<eos> So, did he tell you anything?
I'm thinking we should discuss in person.<eos> Can you get out to my house?<eos> Sure.<eos> Head south on 95.<eos> I'll text you the address.
I'd at least like to know why you couldn't support me.<eos> -It doesn't matter.<eos> -Well, it matters to me.<eos> How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.
Oh, Quinn.<eos> Not this again.<eos> I need the transcript of a call placed between these two numbers within 24 hours of this date.<eos> You gotta push him to meet Hafiz.<eos> I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
And I am not alone.<eos> I am not alone.<eos> If you want a fight, and apparently you do--<eos> If you want a fight, you've got one from me. In spades.<eos> You've got the fight of your life.
- Yeah.<eos> Pretty much had to come from NSA.<eos> Unless the CIA has some monitoring program I don't know about.<eos> Answer me! Where did it come from?<eos> I told you, I can't say!
The press is all over them.<eos> Logistics are proving tricky.<eos> I can't even talk to them.<eos> Elevated security protocols, I know.<eos> That's why I brought you this.
It's me, again. Carrie. Don't hang up.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - I-I can't say.<eos> There's a whole bunch of things I can't say except in person, but you need to know something.<eos> About the recording I played you, that we were discussing earlier.
Marines?<eos> I served.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Good for you.<eos> What happened to you?
- What I found--<eos> - Shut up.<eos> People can be very sympathetic.<eos> We came in tactical 'cause that's our job.<eos> No one wants to hurt you.
Now, this woman has been telling us since she hit the campaign trail two years ago--<eos> "Don't over-react," and here she is, not even following her own advice.<eos> And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?<eos> I fight for my country.<eos> Well, I am with you there.
You are...<eos> I'm here. Everything's gonna be fine now.<eos> Oh, what's happening?<eos> Ugh. Nothing, nothing.<eos> You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.
And her trauma was deepened when you returned her to the site of the event only one day after it happened.<eos> We talked about going home.<eos> She was good with it.<eos> It's not safe psychologically for her to be there.<eos> Look, I d... I don't agree with you, but I-I can take her somewhere for a few days, to a hotel if you think that's best.
Very much so. He loved his country.<eos> He believed in the mission.<eos> He was... the light of my life, and I miss him every single moment of every day.<eos> What was he like? What can you tell us about him?<eos> Well, he never dreamed of being a soldier. I can tell you that.
Tell me about him.<eos> What's your connection?<eos> We're former colleagues.<eos> We worked together at the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Why is he living with you?
He believed that Franny was in danger, which, you know, she was, sh... from people throwing rocks, from the police.<eos> He was doing what he could to keep her safe.<eos> Do you think that Franny felt safe?<eos> W... I'm sure she was frightened, but she's a strong girl.<eos> There's something I want to share with you.
The main one was massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> Stroke.<eos> You think she's been taking care of you all these months out of love?<eos> Sounds a lot more like guilt if you ask me.<eos> I bought you this one chance.
I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello? It's Christine Lonas from ACS.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.
- Madame President-Elect.<eos> Rob.<eos> I know we had a briefing scheduled for tomorrow, but something's come up. Involving me?<eos> Rob, could we have the room?<eos> Ma'am, if I may, I feel I owe you an apology.
It's on me.<eos> They said it couldn't be done.<eos> The President-Elect could not be moved. That's what they said.<eos> But she has been, finally.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
- $45 million. - Mm.<eos> It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself. - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> I have a lot of people angry at me thanks to you.
Idon'tdisagree.<eos> Then call them off.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> I still have value to you, intelligence.
No!<eos> - No!<eos> No! No!<eos> - Hurry.<eos> I should have never trusted you!
Can't stand the politics.<eos> Especially now.<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?
He took it upon himself to travel off-book to the occupied territories to meet with an asset he placed years ago.<eos> That's the only reason any of us is here.<eos> It's the only reason we're not just being steamrolled by Dar and his fucking cabal. Excuse me.<eos> Carrie, I'm the newcomer here, but I'm already certain.<eos> An affidavit from you about what happened in Berlin, that's how we get Dar.
Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.<eos> At 3:00 PM.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much. Thank you.
- That would be huge.<eos> - Yeah, assuming I'm able to stand being in the same room with him.<eos> Dar.<eos> Madame President-Elect.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
- Let's go!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You okay back there? Yeah.
Enjoy.<eos> You're not at the lake.<eos> No.<eos> Want to tell me why?<eos> If you won't say what's bothering you, how am I supposed to help?
The guy you sent. - What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter. You know that.
- Where is he?<eos> - I raised you, Peter. - Stay there.<eos> - You are my child.<eos> More than that.<eos> I would never hurt you.
No.<eos> If you don't believe that, please, just pull the trigger.<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> You sound terrible.<eos> I told you to leave him alone.
You really--<eos> You really believe that?<eos> He was just in my house, you fucking moron.<eos> - What?<eos> - In my house looking for you.
It's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.<eos> So, these sock puppets they're just a bunch of fake users with online lives that you manage?<eos> Didn't O'Keefe tell you anything?<eos> George Pallis, meet Carrie Mathison.<eos> An affidavit from you about what happened in Berlin, that's how we get Dar.
The guy you sent. Where is he?<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> He was just in my house, you fucking moron.<eos> - What?<eos> - In my house looking for you.
My name is Steve Beverly.<eos> I'm the videographer with Manhattan Legal Support.<eos> Also present is Robert Emmons, Chief of Staff for the president-elect, and George Pallis, the Solicitor General of the United States.<eos> I will now swear in the witness.<eos> Ms. Mathison, do you affirm you will testify to the truth, to the best of your ability, or swear to it, so help you God?
But I have a constituency, too.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means don't go to war with your own national security establishment.<eos> Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.
Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.<eos> Two hundred and fifty years of movement toward the light in this country, towards justice...<eos> Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.<eos> And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.
A little ironic, maybe. Ironic?<eos> Considering how many times you've had me up to the Hill to testify about enhanced interrogation techniques.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Have you lost your fucking mind? I'm a United States Senator!<eos> And I'll tell you now as I told you then-- establishing trust, getting to know your prisoner is 10 times more effective than torture.
About debating O'Keefe?<eos> We were wrong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It's too soon to tell.<eos> I'm not sure that crowd down there would agree with you.
Gold Star mom?<eos> You are.<eos> You're a bad dream.<eos> A President of the United States who can't be controlled from within.<eos> What if I told you... I'm not ready for this, any of it?
Apparently he's developed a real hard-on for the President-elect.<eos> Has he?<eos> Don't give me that horseshit.<eos> You know damn well that's the story you're pushing out there.<eos> Is the Senator there with you?
- Right.<eos> I also saw a squad leave there this morning, and now, suddenly, there's a brand-new team under McClendon's command charged with protecting the President-elect?<eos> Look, I-I know how this sounds, believe me.<eos> I hate even saying the words.<eos> What about you, Saul?
You go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Keane.<eos> You sure?<eos> - What about Quinn?<eos> - Is he there, too-- with you now?
I still don't know what to tell my staff.<eos> Half of them are expecting to be fired - or arrested any minute.<eos> - Tell them they won't be.<eos> Tell them to stop listening to Brett O'Keefe.<eos> Look, most of you know me.
Now, go.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi. - Come in.<eos> - Oh, Thanks.<eos> Can I get you something-- coffee, tea?
Hi, I'm from the Administration for Children's Services.<eos> After my talk with Franny, I made a determination that she's at imminent risk for further harm.<eos> What?<eos> She's been taken, placed in a state-registered youth home.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.
Yes, sir.<eos> So what was he doing?<eos> He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting.<eos> - He ran past you?
I'm sorry, but I just got to ask.<eos> Is Saul so short of resources?<eos> - Is there no one else at the Agency that he trusts?<eos> Uh, no one who still actually works there?<eos> If you don't like it, I can pull over. You can get out, take your chances.
People died for it, in case you don't remember.<eos> You know, last year, I, uh, had his remains moved in secret from Kharavan cemetery to Behesht-e Zahra.<eos> It's the resting place of the martyrs.<eos> I picked a nice, shady spot in a forest of pine trees.<eos> Later, I can maybe draw you a map so you can find it easily.
Madam President-- That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you, you're here at great political risk, so thank you.
He told me exactly the opposite last night.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Saul is right.<eos> I did tell him differently last night, but only because I knew I wouldn't get this audience with you if I told him the truth.
- Yes, sir.<eos> So what was he doing?<eos> He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting.<eos> - He ran past you?
I was elected by the people of this country to be their next president.<eos> I will represent them.<eos> That's all.<eos> Have you heard veterans groups are threatening to boycott your inauguration?<eos> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
Just the end.<eos> And?<eos> Ugly business.<eos> Rob says you have something to tell me.<eos> The video of your son causing you so much grief--
How's Carrie?<eos> Fine.<eos> So you know who she is?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? - Did she tell you to get a job here?
Yeah.<eos> So? - Did she tell you to get a job here?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did she tell you to take that video of me?<eos> - I said I-- Did she tell you anything about me? - No.
That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.
It's happening right now in front of your faces.<eos> We have O'Keefe.<eos> We have a disinformation campaign designed to discredit the president-elect.<eos> And as of today, we have boots on the ground... like the protesters I had to wade through to get here.<eos> That seem familiar to any of you?
Because it does to me.<eos> It's what we did in Nicaragua, Chile, Congo, a dozen other places, all the way back to Iran in the '50s.<eos> And it does not end well for the elected regime.<eos> You're fighting for your lives here.<eos> Do you get that?
I've known him a very long time.<eos> He's developed quite an online presence recently-- a website-- which worries me.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> This is getting tiring, Max.<eos> If I wanted to hurt you, you'd be hurt by now.
It's not true.<eos> Not true.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> I have-- more than a dozen times.<eos> Perhaps I can remind you.
You're a government shill.<eos> - Now we are talking slander. - I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.
Everybody knew he got special treatment because his mama was a senator.<eos> It didn't keep him from getting killed.<eos> He was killed because he was a coward.<eos> He should be dug up out of Arlington because that's for real heroes.<eos> And I'll tell you something else, for free-- your son runs like a fucking girl.
He was trying to kill me. Quinn stopped him.<eos> Things got a little crazy. I guess so.<eos> He was choking me out.<eos> Quinn saved my life.<eos> It never occurred to either of you this guy could have been a major witness?
And I'll be honest-- I was afraid.<eos> Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.
'Cause you're about to throw me under the bus to get Dar? Yes.<eos> That and because I know how protective you are of the Agency.<eos> Whatever is going on here, it's not the Agency.<eos> Not mine, anyway.<eos> Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.
Leslie, can we talk?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> This is my company.<eos> What's the issue here?<eos> Leslie, these gentlemen want to talk to you.
You're welcome here at McMillan.<eos> We're honored to have you here at McMillan.<eos> But, Leslie, I'm afraid there'll be a ceiling for you, for good, Leslie, at McMillan.<eos> My mother-in-law holds you in the highest regard, but she has a responsibility to our shareholders.<eos> It's impossible, because of your conviction, to offer you a position greater than divisional.
I always do.<eos> Hey... I'm required to have a local access writ now.<eos> The INTERPOL Orange Writ of Coaction.<eos> Well, we prepared the Orange Writ. We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.<eos> Okay. Well, now I can mail the writ to you.
Thanks. You showed me.<eos> So I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now.<eos> I called Carlson.<eos> They said he went out to play racquetball five hours ago and never came back.<eos> I don't want to piss off my boss by handing you something he wanted me to mail later.
I'm sorry.<eos> John, what the fuck?<eos> That's rote, 101, man.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I was hired to run a division, and we employed you to help me, and you have serially failed to do that.
Nice try. I know that means Voldemort. Now I know he's single.<eos> Can you just make sure he's not tricking me or anything?<eos> Julian tried to sneak in a clause in our divorce agreement that said I could never remarry and had to die alone in a flea market.<eos> So how did he dump you?<eos> Did he write "it's over" on your forehead while you were asleep?
I got all dressed up thinking Winston was taking me to a fancy Italian restaurant. But then he was gone, gone forever!<eos> Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!
Me?<eos> Oh, no. No.<eos> No, I always hoped I would, but I'm married to the law, and you can't very well have book babies... now, can you?<eos> Well, you dodged a bullet.<eos> Let me tell you, those children are monsters.
Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.<eos> - I underestimated you.<eos> - It's all right, I get that a lot.<eos> Allow me to congratulate you.
The same is true for our ears.<eos> The music of Mozart was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.<eos> Why?<eos> Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.<eos> And I think that is because of people like you.
His eyes are looking to the future.<eos> And that's exactly where I'm looking.<eos> There's a strong group of us inside BPO.<eos> We believe we can change the present direction of the organization back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.<eos> What I want from you is time.
Looking good. Van Damn.<eos> So, first of all, Capheus, welcome to the show.<eos> Thank you, Miss Kihara.<eos> It is a very big honor for me to be here.<eos> Very kind of you to say, and "Kobi" is just fine.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
I have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> I prepared this.<eos> Food, some clothes, money.<eos> I do not know how to thank you.
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
- I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.<eos> And my karma has rewarded me with another opportunity to talk to you.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
All right.<eos> Mrs. Miller.<eos> - I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.
- I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.<eos> The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,<eos> - continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> - Tom...<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article.<eos> And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.<eos> I am sitting right here talking to you.
She was defending the mother online.<eos> - When?<eos> - This afternoon.<eos> The timing is not good on this.<eos> - I can show you.
The Masterson story.<eos> "War, what is it good for?"<eos> Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?<eos> If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.<eos> Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
She's the one they say you called a... you know.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.<eos> You're sort of a legend and...<eos> articles on the president?<eos> It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.<eos> I don't know why I say anything anymore.<eos> I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.
- But no, nothing like this.<eos> - But you saw what he did, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Would you like to see it?<eos> We can show it to you, if you like.
Out there, right now, as we speak.<eos> Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.<eos> They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.<eos> And I think you know it.
We are at war.<eos> And he is an enemy combatant.<eos> And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.<eos> So don't give me your pride or your position.<eos> Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.<eos> The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...
The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.<eos> I don't want to hear you.
Foreign or domestic?<eos> Ah, the ravishing Karolina.<eos> Have I told you the palace I would build for us in Mumbai? [chuckles]<eos> I saw a show last week made it seem like Mumbai is all billionaires and trash pickers.<eos> You say that like it's a bad thing. Well...
Shit!<eos> This was always your bread and butter, all right?<eos> Frank Winslow, Manhattan North,<eos> Narcotics and Vice Enforcement.<eos> How exactly can I help you?
What's he like, what's his name?<eos> Oh, excuse me, do you work here?<eos> I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.
What the hell is your husband doing?<eos> He's probably just trying to get us a table earlier.<eos> - Cabernet.<eos> - Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?
- Cabernet.<eos> - Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.<eos> What if I told you...
Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.<eos> What if I told you...<eos> To the keeper that Paul is.<eos> I could provide you with the most explosive sexual experience of your entire life.
Never say never.<eos> Excuse me sir, can I help you with something from the bar?<eos> Milk.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, we don't carry milk here.<eos> Can I offer you something else?
- Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that. I'll recover.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.
- Don't worry about that. I'll recover.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.<eos> But I think I can help you.
Have you been in the cellar?<eos> Have you seen the black room?<eos> Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.
You didn't.<eos> Our clients have an algorithm that pre-selects their clientele for them.<eos> And you happen to be the perfect man for the job.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You own two properties.
I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".<eos> Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard.<eos> FBI.<eos> Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.<eos> We're here to help you.
We should write this shit down.<eos> Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest... I hope you get everything you want.<eos> I've never been able to make a difference here.<eos> Maybe you'll have better luck.
Don't you miss anything?<eos> Don't you miss fresh water or birds or the trees?<eos> I like the hum up here.<eos> And the air.<eos> What you have achieved with Calvin is remarkable, Hugh.
How? Who's they?<eos> They shot the place up, Will.<eos> I... I saw it.<eos> - Are you sure the box was destroyed?<eos> - I'm sending you our coordinates.
"Little to no risk aversion."<eos> A similar view held by your flight-school instructors.<eos> Those... those assessments are classified.<eos> Wait. Is this... is this some kind of a job interview?<eos> 'Cause, you know, I appreciate the mystery flights and everything but I could've saved you all a lot of time and trouble.
Well... I have a number of obligations back in the United States. Personal ones.<eos> We are aware of your sister and nephew.<eos> And your new surrogate-father role.<eos> And the surrounding circumstances.<eos> It's very noble of you, Will.
Remain where you are.<eos> We have name listed as deceased.<eos> Take four steps forward and lie face-down, arms and legs spread.<eos> Wait! Wait! Wait!<eos> Let me prove it to you!
We have name listed as deceased.<eos> Take four steps forward and lie face-down, arms and legs spread.<eos> Wait! Wait! Wait!<eos> Let me prove it to you!<eos> Let me prove it to you.
Go! Go!<eos> Abby, come on!<eos> Clear!<eos> - This way! - Abby!<eos> Abby! I couldn't tell you about the box!
We gotta go down.<eos> Come on. Quick.<eos> Abby?<eos> Abby! What was I supposed to do?<eos> I couldn't tell you about the box once I knew I was in the echo!
Fuck you.<eos> We need your help, Will.<eos> - There is still time.<eos> - Time for what?<eos> You think I'd actually help you?
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let you touch the box.<eos> This world is already dying.<eos> This cannot be the end.<eos> Do you realize what you're doing?
I'm looking for you.<eos> Seems you found me.<eos> I imagine I have Tootsie to thank for that.<eos> Livye Hart, this is Lieutenant Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> How do you do?
I want this place to be a success for us.<eos> Okay. Let's go.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Someone close the door.<eos> Hey, can I help you?
How do I know you won't steal from me?<eos> What?<eos> How do I know you're not a thief?<eos> I'm not going to steal.<eos> I can even leave you my ID.
Would you like some more curry, Norma?<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can... can I help you?
Let me go.<eos> If you don't, Booth will find you, and when he does...<eos> Stop.<eos> I'd prefer you not talk about him.<eos> Zack, what has happened to you?
Right.<eos> And the box here. I'm assuming that this is Zack Addy's personal effects?<eos> Yes, I... thought you might want to see these.<eos> The photographs, some press clippings...<eos> As you can see, he was very fond of you, Dr. Brennan.
No. Aubrey's right.<eos> Zack wants you, which is the last thing that we should give him.<eos> Dr. Addy, hello.<eos> My name is Special Agent James Aubrey.<eos> As you can imagine, I've got quite a few questions to ask you.
Dr. Hodgins, please swab for particulate evidence.<eos> Dr. Hodgins?<eos> You're only now noticing he's not here, aren't you?<eos> We couldn't stop him from going.<eos> Zack, I've brought you some visitors.
Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when... when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions, that's all, Dr. Faulk.
Your husband, when... when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions, that's all, Dr. Faulk.<eos> Starting with your relationship with Dr. Zack Addy.<eos> You knew him, didn't you?<eos> Dr. Brennan, are you aware that the average murderer has an IQ of less than 90?
Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.<eos> Ooh, thank you, Agent Aubrey, for your enthusiasm-- you're a heck of a salesman.
I have proof.<eos> You... you have to trust me.<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Dr. Addy, you've had quite a trying day, haven't you?<eos> Allow me to give you something to help you relax.
You confessed.<eos> The evidence...<eos> Should be reexamined.<eos> I did not kill him.<eos> I believe you.
It-it just means that this rib doesn't belong to our victim.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> There must be at least 200 different sets of - It's like excavating a mass grave.<eos> No, Mr. Bray.<eos> I can assure you, this is nothing compared to a mass burial site.
I remember... how proud you were when your book was published, even though I found it to be rather mawkish.<eos> And I remember you teaching me how to chirp.<eos> Tweet.<eos> Tweet.<eos> And I remember.... fighting off attackers with you by my side.
Our bomber's DNA.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen to me, Mrs. Kovac, I'm only gonna ask you one last time.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I told you.
You know more than what you're telling us, and you're hiding someone. What?<eos> You're hiding someone.<eos> No!<eos> I am not!<eos> I swear to you.
Agent Booth, two months ago, I found out my husband's real identity.<eos> Listen to me, Jeannine.<eos> This is my last offer to make a deal.<eos> I leave this room, and it's over.<eos> I swear to you, I don't know anything about what Mark has done, or what he's planning to do next.
Do you understand me?<eos> I'm gonna go check on the kids.<eos> What-what is it?<eos> Uh, the fake waiter who stole Cam's pass-- we got an ID.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Agent Booth, It's all right.<eos> - Sit down. Lose the act.<eos> - what... what's happening?<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I told you I don't know where my husband is.
Not quite the concert I was thinking of, Bones.<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> - Who's a good boy? Yeah.<eos> - Sir?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
Could you all please stop yammering and just get on with it?<eos> I have to wash the blood from Gaston's coat before it sets.<eos> You need to be patient.<eos> Ma'am, please, we're trying to solve a murder here.<eos> If my dog's fur ends up pink, I promise you, there will be hell to pay.
Dr. Brennan, I've been meaning to ask, would it be okay if I put you down as a reference?<eos> Now that I've finally completed my PhD, I've applied for a job as lead forensic anthropologist at the NFL.<eos> Whoa, they need forensic anthropologists in pro football?<eos> I think the NFL Daisy's referring to is the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will be a reference, Dr. Wick, but I advise you not to get your hopes up.
All right.<eos> You Randy Stringer? Uh, yeah.<eos> But I didn't call an Uber.<eos> Oh, I'm not Uber. FBI.<eos> Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.
Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.<eos> We found your marijuana pipe.<eos> According to your record, you got picked up twice for selling LSD and once for assault with a deadly weapon. Nah, nah.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
According to your record, you got picked up twice for selling LSD and once for assault with a deadly weapon. Nah, nah.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> I was in the parking lot at a Phish show, cutting up some salami with my pocketknife, when the pigs nabbed me for dealing. Pigs?<eos> What is this, 1969?<eos> I'm telling you, man, the only thing I assaulted that day was some nice Soppresatta.
No, not in the slightest.<eos> I am simply focused on planning my party.<eos> It's not every day that one turns 40. Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry to bug you, Dr. B, but I wanted to show you three antemortem contusions I found hidden in the blunt force trauma on the back of the skull.
- Sorry, singularity?<eos> - Uh, singularity is when intelligent machines become indistinguishable from humans.<eos> So, did you notice anything unusual about Ian's behavior last Friday?<eos> Oh, unfortunately, I was out of town, delivering a speech.<eos> But I can give you his online calendar.
Am I the only one smelling barbecue here?<eos> Good nose, Aubrey.<eos> Matthew Coburn?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Uh, we'd like to have a word with you.
Well, I can't argue that.<eos> My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands.<eos> See, Booth? AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes. Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."
What'd they call it?<eos> "Excessive use of force."<eos> So, I had anger issues back then.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.
You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.<eos> - No, Booth, he will not.<eos> - Stop. Can we continue this somewhere else?<eos> An excellent idea.<eos> I could show you to Mr. Felbeck's room.
This is Mr. Felbeck's suite.<eos> As you can see, we provide very spacious accommodations for all of our residents... uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?<eos> An A.L.S. I'm looking for blood evidence.<eos> You didn't clean anything up, did you, Francis?<eos> I can assure you, the room is exactly how Mr. Felbeck left it.
We got to go find the orderly, come on.<eos> Excuse me, Sam?<eos> Sam Wadkins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.
Felbeck needed that medication.<eos> His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.
His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.<eos> He tell you why he needed that money? No.
Promise.<eos> Thank you so much for coming in.<eos> And since you knew Mr. Felbeck the best, we thought we could ask you some more questions.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Also, I just wanted you to know that your friend, Red, is gonna be all right.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're-you're right.<eos> I lied.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We know about you and the victim, how the two of you used to live together.
Yeah.<eos> We know about you and the victim, how the two of you used to live together.<eos> We also know that you were accused of running a scam at your previous retirement home.<eos> So, why don't you go ahead and tell us the truth about why you were selling his prescription medication?<eos> I told you the truth about that.
But there is one thing I am not.<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> What about Barbara Baker?<eos> You think there's a chance she found out about you two?
Did you find anything at all?<eos> What I have is an an inchoate, nebulous glimmering of a case, which involves secret societies, cannibalistic rituals, and a brilliant young forensic anthropologist who was coerced into a plot he didn't fully comprehend.<eos> Right. Okay, so you found nothing in Sweets' notebook?<eos> My dear fellows, that's what I'm endeavoring to ascertain.<eos> Why don't we endeavor to find you a new office? Shall we?
It shows that it was fired and that there was one bullet missing from the chamber.<eos> So between the car crash and the fact that Dustin fired his gun, that should help us to narrow down the list of possible robberies.<eos> I'll let Booth know right away.<eos> But before I do...<eos> I have a little something I'd like to give you.
Bam!<eos> That is absolutely barbaric. Okay, come on.<eos> Aubrey says there's one this weekend.<eos> What do you say, you want to tag along with me, Doc?<eos> I tell you what.
I didn't think you'd want to drive one of those cars, anyway.<eos> Why? Because I'm a woman?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no.<eos> On second thought, I order you both to participate.
You got a dent in your car.<eos> More bad news, you're under arrest, pal.<eos> All right, Ray.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.
This is just a big misunderstanding, okay?<eos> I mean, maybe I hit Dustin, but if he's saying that I heisted a bank...<eos> No. Dustin isn't saying anything, Ray.<eos> Dustin's dead.<eos> I don't believe you.
Really?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Mr. Dixon, take a look at the evidence.<eos> We found almost $40,000 in your trailer.<eos> I'm gonna tell you one more time-- I never killed him.
Everybody knows you're not supposed to say how much was stolen.<eos> You're supposed to say "an undisclosed amount."<eos> If he'd just done his st-stupid job...<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> I'm telling you, you should've come with us.
Wanda?<eos> Wanda's back.<eos> Oh, that's your-your nom de guerre, is it?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I have to thank you.
You were correct-- the derby was just what I needed.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> You see, I think it's very therapeutic every now and then, to-to get out of your proverbial skin, yeah?<eos> Right.<eos> What about you, huh?
I should let you get settled, right?<eos> Uh, is Dr. Beckham here?<eos> I'd like to just pop in before I go.<eos> He's only here in the morning and usually stops by after dinner.<eos> I just thought you should know about her tricks.
I didn't mean it.<eos> I mean, I didn't mean for my drawings to do what they did.<eos> - What?<eos> - On Tumblr.<eos> I know Susan told you what happened, and... it'll come up, I bet.
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I'm definitely getting a Holocaust vibe, doc.<eos> - It's okay, I promise.<eos> - I don't believe you.
It seemed like you and Luke had something good going.<eos> Whatever. He's totally gay.<eos> That would be easier, right?<eos> Then you could write him off.<eos> - Does he talk to you about me?
Oh, no, I just wanted the studies of, if this is true or, if it shows that.<eos> Any diet works.<eos> Any diet works if people follow it.<eos> But, if it's a diet that's not the proper diet, like if anyone follows a diet that they eat McDonald's...<eos> I can't tell you what a proper diet is.

And it's frustrating and very stressful.<eos> And I don't know how long my liver is gonna last taking all this stuff.<eos> Under conventional medical treatment, whether it be for autoimmune disease or even conditions like high blood pressure or, diabetes, you're told that you have to take drugs.<eos> And not just for a week or a month or, a year, you're told you have to take drugs forever.<eos> You're guaranteed that if you follow your doctor's advice, you'll be sick forever.
And where true health doesn't end with me, but begins with us.<eos> If people adopted a plant-based diet, the changes we would see in our individual health, in our national health situation and in this physical, environmental world we live in, would be so profound.<eos> Today, you can say, I'm not gonna eat that stuff anymore.<eos> It's the one thing that I can do myself personally to make a difference.<eos> It will give you a greater sense of well-being and happiness when you know that one, you're not destroying your health every time you sit down and eat, you're not promoting cruelty, and you're not damaging the Earth.
Don't be a silly.<eos> I only hope I didn't take too much of your time with all my dusty old photos.<eos> Goodness, no.<eos> Your... your grandson's wedding was gorgeous.<eos> When I come back, I'll show you my niece's confirmation.
I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.<eos> Captain, please. Why don't...<eos> Sit down.<eos> Take a load off. Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink?
Fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it.<eos> I-I think we just... we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...?

You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment.<eos> No, b-because you lied your way in.<eos> - Not how I remember it. - What happened...<eos> And I've got witnesses to back me up.<eos> Do you like being an Air Force Captain, huh?
I think I'm just gonna go home.<eos> Ol, it's not healthy to be alone right now.<eos> No, I...<eos> Actually, I think that's exactly what I need, so...<eos> Laurel thinks it was you.
- You need the best.<eos> We're under attack here.<eos> It has to be you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I showed you.
H-How does that make me a racist?<eos> I-I can understand a pervert, sure, but...<eos> Wes. Wes!<eos> This is my friend Wes.<eos> He'll tell you.
Aww.<eos> You look like a picture straight out of a Middleton brochure.<eos> You know, if they allowed killers in there.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I just like looking at you.
I said something stupid.<eos> Grief makes people do stupid things.<eos> How are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't even look at you right now.
'Cause our girl's rich, and she'll know if you cheap out.<eos> Your nurses are no joke.<eos> They won't give up the pain meds.<eos> Should I get ice chips?<eos> I could read you a ConLaw brief.
You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.<eos> I mean, what has coming here done for you?<eos> I mean, tell me!<eos> There's got to be something that you learned... something...<eos> Right, that you helps you to feel better... other than this whining.
- You mean you cut the gas line.<eos> - Laurel.<eos> - Oh, God, Laurel.<eos> - I swear I didn't do this!<eos> How are we supposed to believe you right now?
That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.<eos> You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're offering you a plea deal.
- I never killed anyone.<eos> - Neither have I!<eos> - You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay?<eos> ! We were all trying to help him and you.
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap<eos> - and we've all been trying to clean it up!<eos> - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.
- and we've all been trying to clean it up!<eos> - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.
Why are you hiding that?<eos> Please don't address the D.A.<eos> Why are you concealing how he died?<eos> ! Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo,<eos> I'm advising you to calm down.
After everything I've done to you, said to you...<eos> Still meeting me in cars, helping me...<eos> It's hard for me to believe you're not part of all this.<eos> You're being scapegoated, and I see it with my own eyes.<eos> That's why I'm helping you.
Mr. Gatwood.<eos> The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Texas.<eos> He wishes you a speedy recovery.
Ms. Wexler sends her apologies, Mr. Gatwood.<eos> And she feels terrible about this, but with her accident and the recovery... she's just not gonna be able to finish her work for you in time.<eos> Oh, of course, I'll tell her.<eos> And again, she is very sorry... and I know she'll be giving you a call herself soon.<eos> Well, yes. Ms. Wexler did ask me to tell you... she strongly recommends Schweikart Cokely.
Jimmy.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> Irene, as beautiful as ever.<eos> Why don't you come in?<eos> Can I get you some tea?
You can't let one little misunderstanding destroy years of friendship.<eos> Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<eos> She showed her true colors.<eos> When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<eos> It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.
From now on... there will be only one route over the border for our product.<eos> The chicken trucks.<eos> And that is final.<eos> But you must understand this is for efficiency only.<eos> There's no disrespect to you or your family.
Okey-dokey.<eos> Testing, testing.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I know that many of you were expecting Sandy for this morning's chair yoga... but her daughter has a cold.
And cow.<eos> And cat....<eos> Erin Brill!<eos> You're just in time for chair yoga.<eos> I need to talk to you.
You took advantage of Mrs. Landry.<eos> Does she know how much money you're gonna make?<eos> Nope.<eos> And again, I ask, so what?<eos> These people trusted you, Jimmy.
- No, it's okay.<eos> You just need to give it some time.<eos> You guys were in a very serious, co-dependent relationship.<eos> And it makes sense now that you feel like... you can't survive without her.<eos> Maybe it'll help if you go home, pack up her stuff and just put it in a box.
- Shit!<eos> - Shit, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - Man, you're an idiot.<eos> Let me get you another drink.
- You want?<eos> - I shouldn't.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> You are persuasive.<eos> - So, you liked the show? - Yeah.
It was this one thing that happened, and I went about my day, pretending all was cool.<eos> What happened to your dad?<eos> Supposedly in prison.<eos> I mean, I haven't seen him in ages, and I don't ever think about him, which I count to be my Christmas gift every year.<eos> But what about you?
What's the rush?<eos> Work.<eos> Deadlines.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> I really like talking to you.
I ate soufflé, drank scotch.<eos> I love soufflé.<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> Oh, yeah, please.<eos> Jean already thinks I spend too much time talking to you.
She barely answers her phone.<eos> So this weekend, when she canceled, I blew up!<eos> Why do you think she's avoiding me?<eos> It's impossible for me to speculate on Rebecca's life.<eos> I only have access to you.
Got a retired relative who's just not pulling her weight?<eos> Make a withdrawal from her wrist and turn her blood into cash!<eos> Rotten roommate late on rent?<eos> Deposit him down at Vlad's, and we'll squeeze the blood from your stoner.<eos> Give us a bagful of blood, and we'll give you a bagful of cash!
And I didn't need the Scar to tell me that.<eos> You don't know shit.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Let's see.<eos> First, you try pretending you don't care.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Let's see.<eos> First, you try pretending you don't care.<eos> But that never works.<eos> Now it seems you care too much.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Okay, oh, fuck.<eos> Sorry-sorry-sorry.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were hurt, man?<eos> I would have tried to help you.
This is my part.<eos> We at Heart found incredible resources in The Scar... unstable minerals, morally questionable fuel alternatives, unnatural gases, and deep wells of unidentifiable glowing goo with properties far beyond the realm of modern science.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - The world's ecological disaster was our economic windfall.<eos> And now we share with you, the newest member of Heart, the fruits of our labor.
Hi.<eos> That man, Skuttle... what job is he here for?<eos> Heart Enterprises.<eos> Please hold.<eos> I've asked you a question.
"Error"?<eos> Heavens, no.<eos> An opportunity.<eos> An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.
Heavens, no.<eos> An opportunity.<eos> An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.<eos> I have given you a show.
An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.<eos> I have given you a show.<eos> Arthur Bailey's of no concern.<eos> Why am I talking to you?
- Hello?<eos> - Hello!<eos> - It's Gary.<eos> - Gary!<eos> Hello, Jonathan, how are you?
That thing must guzzle.<eos> You're... not wrong.<eos> Okay. Look, look, look.<eos> I'm a racer who was forced to detour here, okay?<eos> I mean you no harm.
Oh, my God, they got inside.<eos> How did they get inside?<eos> When you snuck in here, did you secure the doors behind you?<eos> You put everyone at risk.<eos> My team's scattered all over the place out there, looking for you.
Grace, I believe her.<eos> Yeah, so do I.<eos> And it doesn't matter, okay?<eos> If we're dead either way, I'd rather take my chances on the road.<eos> Let me show you something.
Oh, Sexy Suzy doesn't run on gas.<eos> Well, now there's really too much Arthur and Grace.<eos> We really feel like we should see more of the other racers.<eos> I mean, what's The Gentleman doing in all of this?<eos> Give me more of a budget and I'll show you.
Ah, what the hell.<eos> The car runs on blood.<eos> See?<eos> Told you you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I believe you.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Put down the goddamn candy bar... - Easy, Grace.<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> Can you call Dr. Kleinfeld?<eos> I can draw you a map.
Shakespeare.<eos> The dead guy in England. Never mind.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Blood Enterprises.<eos> Can I help you?
Master of Ceremonies?<eos> Fine.<eos> God of the Stage?<eos> Sure, whatevs.<eos> But if you have just a modicum of the oily black soul that we think you do, well, when this show goes live to the whole world, you'll be the High Priest of Heart.
That's the cop's old partner.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> You'd have to ask the Aki unit in charge of him.<eos> The point is, nothing escapes me.<eos> But something has escaped you.
Care to join us?<eos> This is my room.<eos> You can watch, but... you have to get naked.<eos> What the hell are you doing here, Sergeant?<eos> You can't trust her. They brainwash you.
What have you done to me?<eos> Think about it, Officer.<eos> She's not human.<eos> She's a sex toy.<eos> I'm the one that did this to you.
Smoking and sunglasses.<eos> But there needs to be a story.<eos> Subtle, nuanced characterizations of love, betrayal, and...<eos> No one cares about story.<eos> We told you that.
- I could use some help. - Police help.<eos> - Oh, we'd love to.<eos> But like you said, we're really in a rush.<eos> Young lady, there's only one road and it runs right through Red River and I'm the Sheriff of Red River. Things starting to add up yet?<eos> Yes, either we help you out or we don't pass.
Yeah.<eos> That seems right.<eos> This way.<eos> Come on.<eos> So what happened between you and Sheriff Leon?
He said you were evil.<eos> And you believed him.<eos> Oh, you got the evil part right.<eos> You just blamed the wrong person.<eos> He sell you the story about The Scar changing people? - Yeah.
Arriving at destination.<eos> I want your eyeball.<eos> _<eos> This is ContraCrime.<eos> How can I help you?
Gower already doesn't like you.<eos> Don't make it worse.<eos> Hey, we make quota by Friday and drinks are on me.<eos> Hey, Saint Arthur...<eos> What about you?
Okay. You need coffee or water?<eos> You need to hit the head before things...<eos> - [PHONE RINGING] - Oh. There it goes.<eos> Offices of Jimmy McGill.<eos> How may I help you?
You betcha.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?
Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.
MAN #9: Sorry.<eos> I'm still trying to decide.<eos> MAN #1:<eos> Okay, just let me know when.<eos> MAN #10: Can I help you?
There it is.<eos> May I clean this for you?<eos> We have alcohol wipes.<eos> No, it's been in worse places.<eos> Thank you. That was very nice of you.
Trouble with Jimmy?<eos> No.<eos> HHM.<eos> I think I'm bound by confidentiality, maybe?<eos> I'm a little hazy on the legal points... but if I tell you what I heard and not Jimmy directly... like.... like we have a buffer...
KIM: Francesca, could you do me a favor?<eos> Can you go through the Mesa Verde files, in my office... and pull all the ones labeled "CRA evaluations"... and sort them by date?<eos> I need to make sure I have the most recent.<eos> - Absolutely. - Thank you.<eos> - I'll join you in a minute.
At least I came.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> We make an appointment, we agree on a time, and you show up.<eos> Okay, fine, I'm sorry I'm late, but...<eos> I came here to talk to you about some real shit.
There you go.<eos> Hey, Stacey, I'm sorry I'm so late.<eos> Oh, no worries.<eos> She had trouble sleeping. I'm sorry.<eos> She kept insisting on FaceTiming you and Michael.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.<eos> For those still present, good day.<eos> Mr. Graymark...<eos> I'm not leaving Jocelyn.<eos> Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...<eos> Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.<eos> Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.<eos> Do the math.<eos> There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
No.<eos> I want to find Clary.<eos> She was kidnapped by Dot.<eos> Valentine must be behind this.<eos> Why should we trust you?
My people.<eos> Don't make me stoop to Camille's level.<eos> Well, now that Simon's back, I think it's time I get going.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, I wish there was something I could do to thank you for everything.
It has nothing to do with my clan.<eos> Unfortunately, we've reached the limit on kicking the can down the road.<eos> If you want to prove your innocence, deliver Miss Belcourt to the Clave.<eos> You think I haven't been trying?<eos> I want to believe you, Mr. Santiago, but sadly... I'm not sure I do.
- Just look at me.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I know nothing makes sense right now.<eos> But I'm going to help you.
But we cannot allow any demonic impurities to pass.<eos> The adamas is too fragile.<eos> So, the heavenly energy in the water will help us determine if you may enter.<eos> It will destroy any contaminant upon contact.<eos> Your demon blood makes it impossible to trust you.
But you don't have the authority to kick me out, so you're making my life hell.<eos> And now you're trying to sabotage any shred of credibility I have left?<eos> If you choose to stay, I'll have no other choice but to show everyone who they're living with.<eos> Who they're fighting alongside.<eos> Sister Cleophas, I don't wanna scare you, but I'm worried.
A purity trial?<eos> - How did you fare?<eos> - I almost died!<eos> I'm sorry, Isabelle.<eos> I had no idea there'd be a purity trial, otherwise I never would have sent you.
You sure about this?<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Then I better get to work.<eos> Mr. Morgenstern.<eos> What can I help you with?
Looks like he's already tapping the energy supply.<eos> We need to get to that power core and shut it down.<eos> It'll be heavily guarded.<eos> We'll get to it via the rooftop. Hell if I'm gonna let that bastard destroy the entire downworld.<eos> What, suddenly you care about the downworld?
Make it stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> How long can you keep torturing him?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> If you want the truth, why not just use the soul sword?
It's time to send Raphael a message that if he can get to you, you can get to Rosa.<eos> Oh, see, um... yeah... my heart kinda goes out to the guy now, you know?<eos> Simon. Save your sweet side for someone who cares.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Noted. Um, Rosa, can I take a picture with you?
Alexander, what are you doing?<eos> Please, don't...<eos> Please, don't do this!<eos> Please!<eos> My son is dead because of you.
I've been talking to Snart.<eos> I've been seeing him lately.<eos> You... You've been having hallucinations of Leonard Snart?<eos> If you tell anyone, I'll kill you<eos> I believe you.
Mr. Rory, while I appreciate the thoroughness of insights, perhaps we could focus on the issue at hand.<eos> I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.<eos> I'm not a shr...<eos> You know, I think I've heard enough on that subject.<eos> Now, when did you first encounter the apparition?
- Hey, okay, hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Help! Help!<eos> Listen to me, all right?<eos> Calm down.<eos> We're here to help you.
- What's wrong?<eos> It's like I should have memories that aren't there, and I should understand what this is, but I don't.<eos> Yeah, I feel it, too, it's happening right now.<eos> I'm reading this book about "Santarion Long-inises," and it's just a bunch of words.<eos> How long have the two of you been feeling like this?
- Shut up.<eos> - They're up.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I don't think it's here.<eos> All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting to lose my patience with you.
Until you weren't.<eos> I hate when he does that.<eos> If you have something to say to me, Malcolm, I suggest you keep it to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
I will start you off with an easy question.<eos> Right eye or left eye? No, please.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> I'll do anything, I'll...<eos> I'll tell you anything you want to know. Even if I don't know it!
One that we can use to gain access to our objective.<eos> To not use him is foolish. Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I would have to defer to your superior expertise in foolishness.<eos> But if your plan goes south, it's not our speedster friend you need to worry about.<eos> One thing I hate more than taking orders from him... is being threatened by you.
Hey, I can be more useful.<eos> Ah, damn it.<eos> Security is gonna be on top of us at any moment.<eos> Might I suggest you kill them instead?<eos> Try and run, and I will find you and feed you your testicles.
It's just like the movie âThe Good, the Bad, and the Uglyâ<eos> Three bad guys. No one knows who to trust. So they all end up screwing each other over.<eos> It's an interesting theory.<eos> Which one are we?<eos> The point is that neither of you are Clint Eastwood and so neither of you end up going home with the gold.
Yes.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Your partners just left me here all tied up.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They... told me... Not to tell you.
What, like, stopping him biting his nails?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Can I help you with something, soldier?<eos> No, General Washington, I'm fine.<eos> You, on the other hand...
Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> No problem.<eos> I wanted to talk with you, as well.
Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> No problem.<eos> I wanted to talk with you, as well.<eos> Ok. The file that I sent you.
Getting the Judge Advocates to even to authorize me to pro hoc in would be a miracle.<eos> Sounds like a yes?<eos> More like a "God help me" and your friend.<eos> Hey.<eos> I will owe you one.
Hey, pumpkin.<eos> Hey.<eos> Kept my wrist straight.<eos> You turn me over, I'll be dead before you get back to your office.<eos> I believe you.
Follow me or die.<eos> Find out what's happening.<eos> Hello, Mr. Queen.<eos> My name is Talia.<eos> I've been looking for you.
Do you know what it's about?<eos> Maybe they figured out how prometheus faked Lyla's voice to get me out of the bunker and into here.<eos> I'm less concerned with how you got in here and more concerned with getting you out again.<eos> Gentlemen, sorry I'm late.<eos> How you holding up?
Or Emily, my ex before Sidney, one time, in Mexico, in this public hot tub.<eos> But they're always replaced by Sidney.<eos> It doesn't matter how the fantasy begins. It only ends with her.<eos> Sometimes when we try to avoid thinking about something, the more it gets into our head.<eos> So if I tell you not to think of a red apple, what do you think of?
Right, but it's a lot of pressure to put on anyone.<eos> After all, you didn't just lose a husband. Rebecca lost her dad.<eos> And I have a feeling that maybe... maybe there wasn't enough room for her grief with yours.<eos> Now, I know how complex the mother-daughter relationship can be, but as the mother, you sometimes have to take responsibility.<eos> You don't want it to get so bad that she doesn't return your calls or do anything real with you.
I don't necessarily mean that.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
I'm gonna go get a job, because it's so freakin' easy to get, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You look so stupid wheeling that thing.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?
Just interesting.<eos> It's like, I'm German, and I'm Catholic, I'm Midwestern.<eos> It's like a Neapolitan of repression.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I got to say, it is, like, so refreshing to be able to talk to you this way.
- Yeah, of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So are you in love with her?<eos> - Who, Mickey?<eos> I mean, if you feel uncomfortable with this, I don't need to press.
Anger.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I mean, it was nice chatting with you.
How's Uncle Tim?<eos> Still a fuck-up.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Marty, let me give you these.
No, I...<eos> - I spent most of my life in South Dakota.<eos> - I feel like a country mouse. - Country mouse?<eos> - That's...<eos> - Victor. Hey, I just wanted to tell you, I'm a huge fan of The Sorting Fields.
Yeah, Tommy, you, me, we were gonna all talk.<eos> Okay. Sorry to wake you up.<eos> Tommy told me to swing by so we could talk about the Arctic movie.<eos> Arctic movie?<eos> Yeah, and I just... I just wanted to go over some scheduling stuff with you.
I've never seen such a sad grown-up.<eos> - Can we get the check?<eos> - Oh, this is embarrassing.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> Man, I don't mean to dump everything out on you guys or...
Oh, that's okay.<eos> Man, I don't mean to dump everything out on you guys or...<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> I'll give you my address. You guys can come over and dump your feelings on me sometime.
It's a long process, and then it ain't, and by the looks of that assistant out there, you need me back bad.<eos> How about I give you guys a moment?<eos> It's all right, Ms. Williams.<eos> I wasn't planning on keeping my problems a secret.<eos> In fact, I wanted to talk with you about them, you know, on camera.
Not exactly, Hoss.<eos> What are you... what?<eos> Why aren't you in your office?<eos> Well, I came in here to work because everyone's been dropping by my office, asking how I am, and I don't need the attention, and by the way, I just got off the phone with Oliver, who says he's on the way to Russia, so what are you doing here?<eos> Oliver said I'm supposed to help you prep for your interview with Susan Williams and it was safer for me to be here than over there starting an international incident.

Don't make me ask you again.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Someone who needs access to your system's credentials.<eos> You work for Detralink.<eos> Not for long I won't if I gave you my sign-in materials.
I'm guessing those aren't fireworks.<eos> Recon, get those civilians clear.<eos> Backstop...<eos> Unh!<eos> I don't know who you gentlemen are, but I want to thank you for being so damn eager to find me!
What the hell is this?<eos> There's no way you're Argus or DOD.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> I'm not telling you anything.
As I enjoy my visits to mother Russia, have you ever considered relocating to Starling City?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Money?<eos> Drugs?<eos> I'll give you anything.
All right.<eos> I got transcripts of past interviews Williams has done with alkies and addicts...<eos> No offense.<eos> Is you being here really necessary?<eos> Oliver wanted me to help you prep for the interview, so how about some practice questions?
You cannot do that from here.<eos> Can I come in, or is it still no dogs allowed? Pfft.<eos> You really got a wiseass mouth on you, don't you?<eos> I'm not sure, but did you just say my mouth looks like ass?<eos> Look. I just came here to tell you that Susan Williams' producer called to confirm that 10 a.m. tomorrow still works for the interview.
There is a whole mess of angry Russian dudes outside.<eos> I have location for Walker and men to help in fight, but we have to leave now.<eos> Your strange friend's pronunciation is horrible.<eos> Yeah. I'll tutor him later.<eos> Hey. Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.
We don't know much.<eos> It was a single shooter, AR-15 assault rifle.<eos> And it-- it doesn't appear that I was his primary target because he just...<eos> Blasted his way through city hall.<eos> If he wasn't going after you, then there's a larger agenda here.
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.<eos> I owe it to them.<eos> I don't owe it to any of you.
I work for the deputy mayor.<eos> This is my assistant.<eos> In his dreams!<eos> Or, uh, I mean, yeah, kind of.<eos> Can we ask you some questions about James Edlund?
I want him to get that help.<eos> What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.
Why?<eos> Because I'm the mayor.<eos> A lot of firepower in this room.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We just have a couple questions for you, captain.
Leaving whether I agree with that aside, why should I believe whatever he says?<eos> Because you know as well as I do what he has done for this city.<eos> But what's the simpler answer?<eos> That the Green Arrow all of a sudden out of nowhere became a... a cop killer?<eos> Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath who has had all of us, you included, running in circles for months?
You're no better than me.<eos> I'm shot through with flaws, no question.<eos> But at least I'm not using other people's sins to justify my own.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Are you ok?
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
Apparently because of the impeachment hearing, I'm a criminal.<eos> You ok?<eos> Never felt better.<eos> Hey, so I made sure the Unis keep all the press behind the cordon.<eos> Trust me, you don't want them snapping shots of you in an ambulance.
- Not so fast.<eos> Look. I can't discharge you without a few more hours of observation.<eos> Dr. Schwartz...<eos> People can withstand only so much strain, and being both mayor and him, it's unsustainable.<eos> I assure you, my body can handle it.
Don't call them balls.<eos> You speak with Pollard?<eos> She won't call you to testify without Kullens' blessing...<eos> We're not gonna get that.<eos> And the council hearing directly from you is only one of two ways I can see us winning this thing.
You speak with Pollard?<eos> She won't call you to testify without Kullens' blessing...<eos> We're not gonna get that.<eos> And the council hearing directly from you is only one of two ways I can see us winning this thing.<eos> - What's the second way? - You won't like it.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> - Doris, please.<eos> You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.<eos> His real name is Simon Morrison.<eos> In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.<eos> That's one hell of an accusation.<eos> That's why I'm giving you that.
And if second chance doesn't work?<eos> Miss Venediktov...<eos> Eh, he's--he's fine.<eos> Well, he's unconscious, but he--look, I'm sorry that I scared you the other night.<eos> I just--I--I need to speak with you.
Confess.<eos> Oliver, we've been betrayed.<eos> Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.<eos> Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.
I'm saying that the details of an ongoing investigation are confidential.<eos> Yes?<eos> I spent the afternoon speaking with Gay Eked's father.<eos> What do you have to say to him and the families of all of Prometheus' victims?<eos> Well, I would say to them what I am saying to you.
Thank you.<eos> Very helpful, Curtis.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Grover, but the specifics of the investigation into Adrian Chase, they're just not open to the public.<eos> The mother of my children is dead, and you can't tell me anything.<eos> I can assure you that the SCPD and the mayor's office are doing everything in their power to apprehend him.
Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.<eos> I want to talk to you about...<eos> Yeah, your daughter.<eos> Yeah. I know her name, Hoss.<eos> I thought I told you I don't want to talk about her.
What's so important, Hoss?<eos> I was gonna call it a night.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> I told you.
Reportedly, you were the last person seen with councilman Goodwin.<eos> I'm sympathetic to your desire to identify a suspect who isn't your father, but...<eos> What's this?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I was asked to give it to you.
Why didn't you alert the SCPD?<eos> You've met him.<eos> You know why.<eos> The man is terrifying and smart.<eos> He said you'd seek me out and that when you did I should give you that.
And he was nowhere close to Chase's father.<eos> You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.<eos> You must know something about him, something about his son.<eos> Attorney-client confidentiality.<eos> I couldn't tell you anything even if I wanted to.
Our father.<eos> Based on further investigation, I can now state definitively that the allegations made against Robert Queen are true.<eos> My father is not here to defend himself.<eos> And I cannot find the words to defend his actions.<eos> What I can tell you is that nearly 10 years ago in a moment of... of immense courage...
We're gonna have to go back and find another way.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I should have killed you when I had the chance.<eos> I won't make that mistake again?<eos> I guess I should thank you.
I'm sort of half laughing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> That something's coming at us.<eos> I know you know where Burkhardt is.<eos> I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way, I'm coming for you next.
Good for you.<eos> Are you... taking her here?<eos> No. Not anymore.<eos> She's allergic to M.S.G.<eos> Look, first thing tomorrow, I'll help you out.
- No. I took your advice.<eos> I don't want people to think I'm crazy.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that, Ollie.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean you're sorry?
Okay.<eos> Well, let's do this then.<eos> Let's have our moment.<eos> I'm serious, John.<eos> If you want to say I told you so, now's your chance.
We tried.<eos> We failed.<eos> We moved on.<eos> You should put on that on the crest.<eos> If I make you the lead on this, I need to know that you're not gonna drift.
And that was about ten a.m.?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I spoke with your friend,<eos> Rosalyn this morning, Rosalyn Garret.<eos> She was with you the night before Billy died.
Seventeen.<eos> I'm wondering if there's any new information since?<eos> I see.<eos> So he was seen in St. John's?<eos> I'm gonna show you some pictures.
I'm so sorry for what you're going through.<eos> I've, um, I've come with a message from my fellow officers.<eos> I understand that you intend to give Katie a Christian service?<eos> That's right.<eos> On behalf of the police and the mayor's office, we'd like to offer you the use of the St. Francis church.
You gonna move down your list until you've cleared every missing person in the province?<eos> If this is real, we need to catch the guy and to catch the guy we need to act like it's real.<eos> The Chief is considering handing Katie Pine over to the OPD.<eos> - We've got a murdered indigenous girl who has slipped through the cracks. Everybody is watching.<eos> I am trying to give you a chance here but you are gonna have to work the case that is in front of you or you are going to lose it.
What's discussed in here can't leave these walls.<eos> Not to your Sergeant, not to your spouse.<eos> Not even to members of my team.<eos> We clear?<eos> You'll know the name Kyle Corbett,
I think you're getting way too ahead of yourself.<eos> I know something's wrong, and I've got the proof!<eos> Okay, but for all you know, she just wanted a better apartment.<eos> You don't lie when you're not doing something wrong.<eos> Rebecca texted you, though, right?
Thanks.<eos> Hey, if you ever want to come check out the space, I think that you should.<eos> We often have people come over for dinner.<eos> Well, I'm certainly curious.<eos> Let me just give you my info.
Hey, Sid.<eos> I actually can't.<eos> I'm actually with my therapist.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> She says she wants to talk to you.
Hey!<eos> Good luck with that bitch.<eos> Allison?<eos> Allison, it's Jean.<eos> I just want to talk to you.
Oh, that's easy, you just swipe right if you like someone.<eos> Thank you, Alexis.<eos> I understand the technology.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I'll spare you the countless dick pics.
Get my daughter a doctor!<eos> I will have you thrown out of here, mister, if you don't get your emotions under control.<eos> My emotions?<eos> You mean my love for my own child?<eos> Let me tell you something... "Beatrice."
Let me tell you something... "Beatrice."<eos> I don't know what country you're from, but I didn't die for five minutes on a Korean battlefield to come home and be disrespected by a woman like you.<eos> You think because I'm unemployed, you can just shove me and my family to the back of the line?<eos> Well, not on my watch!<eos> If you don't get her a doctor right now, before all these other low-life pieces of shit, then I will follow you to whatever home for dried-up old hags you live in, slap the cat food out of your mouth, grab you by your camel hump and put you through that fucking wall!
- Oh, of course not, you're a human being.<eos> But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it.<eos> Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?<eos> Nobody's eating garbage, princess!<eos> Now, let me tell you something, lady...
How so?<eos> Well, like I said, with work.<eos> Anything else?<eos> All right, um...<eos> I'm a little nervous to tell you this.
I'm a little nervous to tell you this.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> You can tell me anything, Sam.<eos> I spoke to Sidney.<eos> She'd called me back after I called her in front of you.
I'm gonna suggest you do what's called 90/90.<eos> 90 meetings in 90 days.<eos> 90 meetings?<eos> It's not as overwhelming as it sounds, I promise.<eos> Sorry, I know I still owe you from the last meetings.
Just call me if you need anything, okay?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> So, Allison, welcome.<eos> I wanted to share some information with you.
Left-right, left-right, go!<eos> - Breathe.<eos> - I will.<eos> Hi, Jean, this is Mrs. Finnegan.<eos> I wanted to go over Dolly's test scores with you and see if you gave any more thought to the medications.
I just never... you know, found the right...<eos> the right woman.<eos> You believe in that?<eos> I don't know, I mean... Used to.<eos> Well, I'm sure you have plenty of hot young women throwing themselves at you.
- Who am I even protecting anymore?<eos> She thinks I'm a worthless pushover, but that's not who I'm gonna be anymore.<eos> - No one's saying you're a worthless...<eos> - I'm sick of her controlling me, keeping me in the wings like I'm some bullshit fan she shits all over.<eos> I'm telling you, I could fucking kill her!
What did I say?<eos> What were you like then?<eos> It's not your turn, honey.<eos> - Hold that. - Oh.<eos> I'm telling you, it's still open.
You know, the whole "letting go" thing.<eos> And she has agreed to see me!<eos> That's great news.<eos> I'm really happy for you.<eos> Yeah, so I wanted to know how we could work out some time with you.
Right.<eos> It's just I'm not really, uh... an unbiased source anymore.<eos> I'm very much a part of your journey, your perspective, and...<eos> I wouldn't want Rebecca to feel attacked.<eos> I think it would be good for the two of you to see someone... that can be fair to both of you.
Apparently, there's a story going around that you... were intimate on the trip.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Look, Allen, I would tell you.
I mean, that happens to people all the time.<eos> Nothing... like that happened.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's a non-issue.<eos> Just wanted to hear from you.
She's out of town, so sometimes I check in on it.<eos> Diane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Expensive looking.<eos> You know, I'm trusting you here.
They say they care.<eos> They look you in the eye and tell you that your problems matter to them, but...<eos> Soon enough, they're back debating what to watch on TV, what restaurant to eat at.<eos> I just want you to have a real chance.<eos> I don't want you going back to drugs just because you don't have any options.
Hey. Things with Emily are really good.<eos> She's lost some weight and is actually more adventurous.<eos> I mean...<eos> Last night, in the middle of sex, she even slapped me.<eos> - How did you like it?
Right, but I'm over her.<eos> I don't want to talk about her with you.<eos> You seem a little angry.<eos> Was there any aggression?<eos> Did things ever get physical with you and Sidney?
This is an extenuating circumstance, don't you think?<eos> - Are you guys in touch?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> She's been living with me the last few months.<eos> - Living with you?
- What about Tom?<eos> - Who's Tom?<eos> It's a friend of hers she mentioned once.<eos> Well, we had a fight, much worse than usual.<eos> And I've been feeling incredibly guilty because she left, and I haven't heard from her, and I figured I've been giving her money to come see you four times a week, so you must know more than me.
Hey, don't analyze me right now, okay?<eos> Daddy, I'm brushed. Can you tuck me in?<eos> Yes, of course I can.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> I have something I wanted to show you.
I figured it out.<eos> - Sam...<eos> You want me to be hooked on Sidney.<eos> Keeps me sick and needing you.<eos> Makes you powerful.
Keeps me sick and needing you.<eos> Makes you powerful.<eos> Look, Sam, I, um...<eos> I know things ended on a strange note in our last session, but I was just pushing you to challenge your feelings.<eos> I mean, that's my job, to help you.
You know, I wanted to believe Sidney was a curse.<eos> This... virus, this terrible thing.<eos> But I've started to see things differently.<eos> She was a gift.<eos> In fact, without her, I never would have gotten to you.
Look, Mom and I got you flowers.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Jean, it's me, Allison.<eos> Please call me back. 646-555-0174.<eos> Please, I really need to talk to you. Soon, please.
I do know how to keep myself in check.<eos> How to catch myself... before I'm fully on the tightrope again.<eos> Jean, it's me, Allison.<eos> Please call me back, 646-555-0174.<eos> Please, I really need to talk to you.
And I'm certainly not breaking any professional boundaries.<eos> I heard you been looking for me.<eos> Yeah, I was, but it's nothing.<eos> Don't worry... No, no, no, no.<eos> See, now I want to talk to you.
I thought maybe you'd know something about it since you're all buddy-buddy with her now.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you?<eos> I might be an asshole, all right? But I'm not a fucking kidnapper.<eos> You gotta admit, though, she had you so focused on me, that you didn't even think that maybe she was the one who was fucking psychotic.<eos> I'm sure she fed you that bullshit about her mom's cancer, too, right?
I hope that's okay to say.<eos> Hey, this is Sam.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Sam, it's Jean again.<eos> Uh, I really need to speak to you.
Maybe I've changed.<eos> Excuse me, miss!<eos> Hey, are you Alexis Wright?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> How can I help you?
- Diane who?<eos> Hart.<eos> - Doesn't sound familiar...<eos> - She's saying that she wrote this.<eos> So either you're a plagiarist, or she is.
I don't know.<eos> I guess Howard's shining down on me, after all.<eos> You know, Claire...<eos> I think I've been preoccupied lately and perhaps not been present for you in the ways I want to be.<eos> So, I want to apologize if I've been hard on you.
Why?<eos> Are you really asking me that at this point?<eos> Thanks for coming, Sam.<eos> I'm happy to see you.<eos> I figured I owed you that, at least.
Neither am I.<eos> And look, if you want to process out of therapy, that's your choice.<eos> That's fine, of course.<eos> But...<eos> I do feel an obligation to share something with you.
I'll commit to you entirely.<eos> I'll give up everything.<eos> Please believe me, Michael.<eos> She's an active member of our community and our PTA, and she's also an expert on a subject that affects all of us.<eos> Some of you already know that I'm a cognitive behavioral therapist, and so I've been asked tonight to speak about how to prevent bullying in schools.
No one said you were.<eos> Are we being honest?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Is Travis dead?<eos> It would hurt you if he was.
I understand why you're afraid. I'm not.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> You don't know me. What you've seen of my family, I'd run.<eos> But we're building something back at home. Something with a future.<eos> Let me show you that.
The King in the North!<eos> Our uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.<eos> He murdered our father, and took the Salt Throne from Yara.<eos> He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.<eos> Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world.
Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?<eos> Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family.<eos> That's what I say!<eos> Yes!<eos> I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come.
No livestock.<eos> No smoke coming from the chimney.<eos> I don't like the look of it.<eos> For a big, hard man, you scare easy.<eos> I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...
I don't want to look in the damn flames.<eos> You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down.<eos> Don't you want to know what gave me the power?<eos> I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.<eos> We can't tell you.

This is not '80s Vegas.<eos> They won't just break your hands and let you walk away.<eos> They'll prosecute and push for maximum sentence.<eos> There's a camera there, camera there, over there.<eos> That old lady in the Terrapins sweatshirt behind you is not a grandma.

I got a goddamn fax on a machine hasn't been turned on in... I don't know... Since fax machines.<eos> And this fax gave us your precise location,<eos> GPS coordinates, make, model, mileage, even VIN number of your Caddy.<eos> So, much as I'd get accolades if we collar you two for the bank bullshit, it's nowhere near as big or as interesting as what is suggested by the details.<eos> Now, you help me unpack those, I may just help get you out of here.
Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Overdue.<eos> I have to start with an apology.<eos> I've been remiss.<eos> I should have reached out to you ages ago.
You may sit.<eos> You have something to say to the man.<eos> Ahem. Technology's evolving.<eos> We're all evolving.<eos> It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.
You have something to say to the man.<eos> Ahem. Technology's evolving.<eos> We're all evolving.<eos> It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.<eos> I can help you.
Ahem. Technology's evolving.<eos> We're all evolving.<eos> It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.<eos> I can help you.<eos> I want to help you...
It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.<eos> I can help you.<eos> I want to help you...<eos> Influence opinions, behaviors, beliefs like never before.<eos> We want to help you find your audience.
Oh, I'm a fine me.<eos> I just keep getting better every year.<eos> Of course you are, and that is the you that deserves to be seen incorporated.<eos> Everyone in the world gets their place.<eos> With you?
Go find your man.<eos> Your God, your jinn.<eos> You are an unpleasant creature.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I, uh, help you with something, ma'am?
She's the only thing that is good and decent... about my life.<eos> If anything happened to her, this town will run red with blood.<eos> Starting with yours.<eos> We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?
Well, she isn't.<eos> She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.<eos> One look, and you can see that.<eos> And she wants to be with him.<eos> No matter how scared she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, all that matters is, they're together.
No matter who's trying to stop you.<eos> That's clear to me now.<eos> I think you're being a little tough on your son.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.
I think you're being a little tough on your son.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.<eos> I mean, look at the way you're reacting.<eos> Maybe if you just listen and... and hear his reasons and try to see things from his point of view... maybe... maybe you'd understand why he didn't tell you... before now.
It's my home.<eos> It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt - I belong completely.
I can't think like that, sadly.<eos> As a doctor, every life has to be as important as the next.<eos> Even after everything that he's done?<eos> Well, whatever you feel about your brother's past...<eos> What if I told you that he caused seur parents' death?
You called me in after the fact, so nobody knows what you did on your own.<eos> You wanted him dead.<eos> - You tricked me.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I just wanted to see what you would do if I gave you the opportunity.
Candy wrappers and fast-food bags.<eos> Well, that doesn't help my existential crisis.<eos> I was driving through here last night with my brother.<eos> We got into a heated moment and threw something out the window.<eos> Maybe he should help you look for it, then.
She told me what happened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She said you didn't want to talk to her, and... she's hoping maybe you'll... talk to me?<eos> My apologies, Mr. Salvatore.<eos> You're free to go.
I spilled a little on myself.<eos> What the hell is happening to me?<eos> So what if you slept with Charlotte Richards?<eos> You slept with my...<eos> Whoa! He's different when he's with you.
They've drawn blood from the first victim and they're already working on an antidote.<eos> That's great if they find the girl.<eos> But what if they can't?<eos> They will find her.<eos> I promise you.
This is the other student that was poisoned?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't recognize him.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We just need to ask you these questions now that you're feeling better.
I was vilified for doing what anyone in my position would do.<eos> You went back for your computer.<eos> That's not about survival, that's about stuff.<eos> It was about instinct, but thank you for reminding me why I'm doing this and for helping me to improve upon my experiment.<eos> Truth is, Dr. Scott only mutilated her hand because she was being observed by you.
That's all.<eos> About Marcus.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You can have a seat. Right.<eos> Gwen, we're here today because we, we know what you told the police, that you feel like something... supernatural is after you.
No, I was, I was still in investigation mode.<eos> I was gonna inform you. And the winchesters?<eos> Making some progress.<eos> Come in, Mr. rawlings.<eos> You are aware that lady bevell feels that they are hopeless.
Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.<eos> You give them an order, and they obey.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> So tell me, do they?<eos> Do they obey you?
It is the order by which we all live.<eos> No.<eos> The code is what makes a young boy kill his best friend.<eos> When I was a child, I had nothing.<eos> I owed you everything, and I obeyed.
I have sources, Mary.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> After you died, your beloved John was a man slowly going mad, searching for revenge.<eos> What?<eos> Your boys didn't tell you?
I'm sorry, were you expecting a pat on the head, your highness?<eos> I would never expect civility from you.<eos> Psychopath.<eos> You two are such fun together.<eos> Of course, she may be reporting to you.
You'll be fine.<eos> I mean, here you are, watching this woman suffer.<eos> And only days ago, you were sleeping with her.<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Once the U.S. hunters are gone, I'm seriously considering putting you in charge.
Trust me.<eos> The cream always rises to the top.<eos> I agree.<eos> Mr. ketch?<eos> The prisoner is asking for you.
She will shoot you.<eos> Mary.<eos> God, please.<eos> I need help.<eos> I'm trying to help you, ma'am.
- Get an offer!<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Get an offer. - That's what realtors do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Come on, I'll show you your office.
[moans and sighs] [Joel] Honey, you okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We are gonna call a crew and immediately get that cleaned up.<eos> [sighs] Maybe we should reschedule.<eos> Great idea. I could run you up to that Cape Cod on Barnhill.
So how are you feeling? I heard about your afternoon.<eos> - Much better, thank you.<eos> - Oh, these are for you. And I made sure the cleaning crew got in there okay.<eos> They took care of everything so don't worry about that.<eos> - Thank you, Gary.
- No.<eos> - Neither am I. So let's not dishonor that profession, which takes eight years of intense training, by thinking we can give medical opinions, okay?<eos> Fine, then let's just stick to facts.<eos> The homeowners came by, they didn't like what they saw.<eos> So they don't want to work with you anymore. They'll be working with me now.
I can't feel it.<eos> [sighs] I love your hair.<eos> Yeah. Like that.<eos> Bingo. [exhales]<eos> - Can I help you?
- Who?<eos> - A creeper. - What's a creeper?<eos> The kind of a nerd who specializes in disturbing, weird or gruesome shit.<eos> No pupillary response.<eos> Have you noticed any deteriorating flesh?
And I don't care what Consumer Reports says, that car is hot.<eos> She wants to have fun, Joel. And doesn't care what Consumer Reports says.<eos> I heard her, Gary.<eos> - Sheila?<eos> You know, 15 years ago, I would have punched you, once.
At this point in my life,<eos> - I'm not gonna be the kind of person...<eos> - Who wins a bar fight.<eos> - God fuck, what's the matter with you?<eos> - You are. I'm trying to explain a very simple concept.
Kimmy, we're aware that you've been through a lot.<eos> Trigger warning, I'm about to say "bunker."<eos> Is it okay if I say "bunker," Kimmy?<eos> Bunker!<eos> In light of that, Columbia would like to present you with this honorary degree.
I see us getting stoned and watching The Muppets Take Manhattan together.<eos> Oh, I'd be down.<eos> And I want to bring you home and have you organize my closets.<eos> Well, I'm very good at that.<eos> But I can't help you.
And in my important actual consulting expertise business, the phrase "closest living relative" can mean only one thing...<eos> "whoever lives nearby." Really?<eos> You think so?<eos> I would stake my fortune on it.<eos> Or my name's not whatever it is I told you it was.
Yes. Uh, well, enjoy the show, ma'am.<eos> - [ticket seller] Dr. Montgomery!<eos> - Hello, old chap!<eos> Two adults, three minors.<eos> I'm giving you the Verified Film Discount.
You two, create a perimeter.<eos> No one goes in or out of the house until the reptile is caught.<eos> You two, get that body in the van and back to the ME for some TLC before it's DOA.<eos> But you said no one could leave the house.<eos> (OLAF SIGHS) I meant, uh, no one except you.
Thank you. Plea... Please, take your seats.<eos> I wish I were here to simply talk to you about my returning to the white house and expressing my gratitude to the medical staff at the George Washington university hospital and to the American people for their incredible support.<eos> But unfortunately, I have a more somber and serious obligation.<eos> There has been a great deal of speculation surrounding the police activity at Arlington national cemetery from last night until this morning.<eos> I am here to tell you that tragically, at 10:38 p.m., vice president peter MacLeish was shot and killed by his wife, Beth MacLeish.
john 8:32...<eos> That's what you quoted to MacLeish right before he was shot.<eos> So what is the truth, corporal Joyner?<eos> Tell me about the mission to Kunar...<eos> November 14, 2005. I ain't talking to you.
- If it makes it any easier, drinks are on you.<eos> All right. I can do one drink.<eos> All right.<eos> I can't believe Callie braved the flight from New York all the way down to D.C.<eos> Mr. President, what I'm about to tell you came straight - from corporal Joyner himself.
Somewhere.<eos> You know, - it's like Jason used to say, we only have to be lucky once.<eos> They have to be lucky all the time.<eos> Hello?<eos> Jason, - I came to check on you guys.
Due to recent events, we live in a time of uncertainty, leaving us with more questions than answers.<eos> Tonight, I hope to put us back on the path to confidence and strength.<eos> I do not believe that we can survive as a nation without transparency.<eos> Without truth, there can be no trust.<eos> As your president, I assure you that I and my administration will be honest and open on all matters, regardless of how the truth reflects upon me.
They've been trying to get me fired since I started.<eos> And sometimes it seems like you want them to succeed.<eos> Maine state law requires sexual education. But local boards decide which topics.<eos> And the topics they don't want covered, do we imagine they just disappear if we ignore them?<eos> I may personally agree with you, but when you teach topics that aren't covered by the board, you're telling them about stuff that we've decided they're too young to know about. These kids know how to Google.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now can you tell us, have you done any drugs lately?<eos> I'm not doing any drugs, man. What the...?<eos> Okay, I'm telling you, something... something killed your dog, yeah.
We gotta get guns. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Stay down! - No.<eos> I'm telling you...
I guarantee that.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Why do you talk to me as if I did it?<eos> I'm just saying... You're not going to jail.<eos> I thought I told you to get out of here.
I'm just saying... You're not going to jail.<eos> I thought I told you to get out of here.<eos> Just let me... this is private property.<eos> You got no business being here.<eos> Hey, I'm not here to hurt you.
She did something bad.<eos> Not to anyone good.<eos> Unlike me, you're a nice guy, and you're never gonna be able to live with yourself if you leave us behind, 'cause, if you do, we die, and you know it.<eos> Besides, if there's something out there, how are you gonna survive taking care of a scared little freak on your own?<eos> Get us out, and we'll help you.
The police will help us.<eos> Dad'll get here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> We're safe.<eos> I trust you.
What, they got Manga?<eos> The Japanese comic books that no grown man should expect to read without looking like a creep?<eos> I'll wait out here.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Can I help you find something?
Sometimes somebody knows they're being followed, the go into a building so they can skip out back.<eos> Leaving whosever tailing them out front thumb up their ass.<eos> Come on, get in the truck.<eos> Come on!<eos> And I'm telling you I can't.
Just call someone and have them run it over.<eos> I don't... I'm here by myself. I'm here for the podiatrist convention.<eos> I mean, I could, you know, what about this?<eos> I could, uh...<eos> Why don't you keep my watch until I come back?
How much would you give me for this?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oyster.<eos> It's worth 27.<eos> I could give you 20 if it wasn't piece of shit fake.
Bill Caldwell.<eos> Billy was my friend.<eos> And I just wish he'd-- he'd... worked the steps.<eos> Hi, Phil.<eos> I was out of line, the way I spoke to you last night.
You hurt his business, his pride.<eos> Quite effectively.<eos> And if you were to hurt him in the same manner again, I would not stand in your way.<eos> You want me to rob another truck.<eos> If you feel so inclined.
_<eos> _<eos> Mr. Clark?<eos> The doctor is ready.<eos> And how may I help you today, Mr. Clark?
If it's the right plea. I'm not perfect.<eos> Made mistakes.<eos> I'm willing to own up to them in a way that is satisfying to both myself and the state.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> "Good luck with that" as in, "I wish you well,"
Adding more product will threaten the reliability of the entire operation.<eos> May I ask... did Don Eladio approve this?<eos> Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?<eos> I would, uh, I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who, yesterday, had to endure the behavior of those men.
Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?<eos> I would, uh, I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who, yesterday, had to endure the behavior of those men.<eos> It was unacceptable. Despite the difficult circumstances, you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.<eos> That said, if any of you wish to seek counseling due to lingering trauma, speak with me privately, and it will be arranged.

Here, those men have no power. And when they saw that I had no fear of them, they ran like the cowards they are.<eos> Back across the border.<eos> They will not return.<eos> We will move on from this.<eos> My friends, I promise you... that together, we will prosper.
Let's get down to it.<eos> We are here to finalize the Pre-Prosecution Diversion for James Morgan McGill.<eos> Representing the divertee, Ms. Kimberly Wexler.<eos> Mr. James McGill has signed a contract waiving his rights to a speedy trial and presentment of his case within the statute of limitations.<eos> The terms of the deal are for you, James, to report to your Pre-Prosecution Service Officer at the Albuquerque District Attorney's Office on the second Monday of every month for the next 12 months.
I describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.<eos> It's not a common condition, is it? I know it sounds strange.<eos> I do.<eos> But 30 years ago, no one had heard of peanut allergies.<eos> But you admit that no one -- uh, no doctor -- has ever diagnosed you.
It comes down to this -- in order to understand what I was thinking, you need to see Chuck through my eyes.<eos> You need to know if I believed that tape was evidence.<eos> And I say it was evidence of only one thing -- my brother hates me.<eos> Now, he claims that he lied to me to get me to tell the truth.<eos> And I'm telling you I lied to my brother to make him feel better.
When was the last time you two saw each other? Objection.<eos> This is not family court.<eos> We're not here to re-litigate the witness' divorce.<eos> I can't see what purpose this serves. I can.<eos> I'll tell you why my brother brought my ex-wife to this hearing.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I want to start by sincerely thanking you for your patience through this long and emotional proceeding.
Next. Next!<eos> Next.<eos> Next! Yes, Mrs. Pressman, I still have the document.<eos> I'm including the calico.<eos> Now I don't wanna get down into the weeds on this with you, sir.
Were you the pilot of the B-29?<eos> 32 missions?<eos> Holy...<eos> Well, c-can I just say, sir, that you are one of the people who made the greatest generation so damn great?<eos> I salute you.
I know.<eos> You're thinking it's too good to be true.<eos> I mean, "TV's too expensive.<eos> We can't afford that."<eos> Well, I'm telling you, you can.
Uh, that's why we have our, uh, "Toe-in-the-Water" package.<eos> That's, uh, one commercial, flat rate, $849.95.<eos> Beauty part again... free airtime.<eos> And when this thing runs, you're gonna get calls...<eos> I can promise you that.
I promise, as soon as you see the first one, you're gonna want the whole package.<eos> Um, take about an hour.<eos> Um, so, I'll bring the whole team down there.<eos> We'll be there 12:30 sharp.<eos> I'm gonna turn you into a star.
You heard me right... tomorrow!<eos> Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!<eos> I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!<eos> Call me, Saul Goodman!<eos> The world needs to know about you and your business!
Have a couple of volunteers here who want to help.<eos> Well, thanks, but I think I'm good.<eos> Please, we can't let you do it all by yourself.<eos> Certainly not after you bought all the supplies.<eos> At least let the church reimburse you.
I mean, the shipment gets here in two days.<eos> He knows.<eos> Then make up an excuse.<eos> Fine. $3,000.<eos> - I'll give you $3,000.
- We're having second thoughts. - Yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> That's just nerves.<eos> Just stage fright.<eos> Uh, tell you what... we got cue cards, and with the magic of editing, we're gonna make you guys look like...
And then, if someone were to try to sue me... which they won't... then we just, uh, kick that ol' policy back into gear?<eos> I understand your situation.<eos> I do.<eos> But there are rules preventing us from stopping and starting coverage.<eos> And I regret to inform you that... when your license is reinstated next year, because of the suspension, your premiums are going to... go up.
Looks like roughly... 150%.<eos> God.<eos> Mr. McGill?<eos> Mr. McGill, I'm sorry.<eos> I wish we could help you, but we just can't.
You sure?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's you.<eos> Well, uh, I gotta say...<eos> I can't blame you for getting mixed up with all this.
The insurance industry is heavily regulated.<eos> I can think of a dozen infractions - right here off the top of my head.<eos> - Mr. McGill...<eos> You're hoping we'll either find another carrier or cut you an enormous check.<eos> Win-win for you! I assure you, neither is going to happen.
This is very impressive, Charles. And look at the trend!<eos> Day one, pain of 7 and 8, even 8.5.<eos> Day three, nothing higher than five and a quarter.<eos> And now... it's all 3s and 4s.<eos> Later in the session, I'd like to give you some exercises and strategies that might help even more.
Okay.<eos> Lookin' good!<eos> We about ready?<eos> - Just about.<eos> - I gotta hand it to you.
What... what's to stop us from paying the station to just keep running the one we have?<eos> That's not what we agreed to.<eos> How about that for starters?<eos> He did give us the first one for free. Yeah, I know.<eos> Okay, how about this... how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?

Yeah, I know.<eos> Okay, how about this... how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?<eos> Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial... it doesn't actually belong to you.
- Yes. - ...and then run that<eos> - How about that? Guys.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Now, you wouldn't even be thinking about a commercial if it wasn't for me!<eos> Okay, we are not gonna pay you $6,500 for something that we can do ourselves. - You got it? - Seriously?
- Seriously.<eos> - Th...<eos> - Excuse us.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Anything we can help you with?
Seems like just yesterday she was logging hours in doc review.<eos> Always a pleasure to see one of our protégées spread her wings and leave the nest.<eos> Well, I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Best of luck to all of you.<eos> You, too, Howard.
What the hell is this?<eos> I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<eos> Look, Howard, you were very generous when I left HHM, but it never sat right with me that you covered my law-school loans.<eos> It seemed to sit right at the time.<eos> I appreciate the gift, but now that I'm able to afford it, - I want to pay you back.
But you're not gettin' credit.<eos> C'mon, can I just go and come right back?<eos> I have to get my hours done this week.<eos> Judge says so.<eos> Judge told you, huh?
C'mon, can I just go and come right back?<eos> I have to get my hours done this week.<eos> Judge says so.<eos> Judge told you, huh?<eos> Sounds like that's on you.
Judge says so.<eos> Judge told you, huh?<eos> Sounds like that's on you.<eos> Hey, buddy, you wanna get outta here?<eos> - How much is it worth to you?
No judgments, all right?<eos> Man's gotta make a living.<eos> I'm just saying the way you make yours... rhymes with "mug mealer."<eos> Yeah. What are you... a narc?<eos> I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here - and let you keep your hours.
Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> In order to find out, we gotta do some math.<eos> Let's see. A lawyer's gonna cost you about 90 bucks an hour.<eos> You're looking at 8 to 12 months of litigation, minimum.
- Smithers!<eos> Oh, you are a sight for sore eyes.<eos> - How was the ride?<eos> - No traffic, thank God.<eos> Smithers, I'd like to introduce you to my daughter, Veronica.
Every corpse has as tale to tell.<eos> Step closer to the body.<eos> There are several morbid details you should find relevant to your article.<eos> What details, Dr. Curdle?<eos> What sticks out to you?
Penelope?<eos> Clifford?<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> How do you think?<eos> My son is dead, and neither of you have done anything to catch his killer, except, of course, harass my daughter.
I'd love to stay, but I got to shake down an evil Adventure Scout. See you.<eos> ♪ 'Cause it ain't for you, no, it's all for me ♪<eos> ♪ Had a lot of people say they'd try to help ♪<eos> ♪ But they don't know the story, they just try to... ♪<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, you can, and you will.<eos> You'll be standing right beside me and your father, a united front against the holiest of backdrops.<eos> Let's see the Blossoms try to smear us then.<eos> There's been a swirl of rumors today about our daughter, Polly.<eos> And we're standing here to tell you that they're all false.
No, it's all right.<eos> You know, I got a big day tomorrow anyway.<eos> Hey, Mr. Jones, before you go,<eos> - can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yeah. Earlier tonight, you said my dad owed you.
How about you tell me your whereabouts on the week of July 11th?<eos> This is crazy. You think I...<eos> Jughead. A kid like you, raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a deadbeat dad, bullied by kids like Jason Blossom.<eos> Who wouldn't want to lash out at that?<eos> I'm not talking to you anymore.
Do you think that you can just waltz in here, with a bedbug-infested Trojan Horse, wave a blank check around and steal my daughter?<eos> I didn't think you wanted her, else why would she have been exiled like some pariah?<eos> To keep her away from your family.<eos> And not because you're ashamed?<eos> Why is your own daughter not living with you?
Why is your own daughter not living with you?<eos> She's not going to set foot in that twisted, poisonous house of yours.<eos> She should be so lucky.<eos> Cheryl, that's not helping.<eos> She'd do a lot better there than with you.
I want my daughter back, you bastard!<eos> Mom!<eos> Black piping for the velvet, of course.<eos> I'll take measurements for the pants.<eos> Uh, before we do that... Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?
You kicked me out of the Whyte Wyrm.<eos> Good times.<eos> Joaquin... You wanna show me where the can is?<eos> - Yeah, it's right...<eos> - Yeah, um... I'll show you.
Mrs. Cooper?<eos> Yes?<eos> I understand why Betty doesn't want to get in the middle of this. But I don't feel the same loyalty for the Jones family that she does.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> -Helping you find out the truth about FP will help me find out the truth about my dad.
I don't like this, Mother.<eos> Mother?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Norman, it's Sheriff Greene here.<eos> Sheriff, how are you?
Sheriff, how are you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'd like you to come down to the station.<eos> Of course.<eos> Everything okay? I'd just like to talk to you about something.
You got into a physical fight, threats were made.<eos> Yes, I just didn't want him there.<eos> Why not?<eos> I felt that he had been bad for my mother and that he was part of the reason she took her own life.<eos> Some people are saying he blamed you for her death.
No, no, not since I... Not since I started the medicine.<eos> Where are you getting your prescriptions?<eos> They haven't called me for a refill in a year and a half.<eos> I just started going to a closer psychiatrist.<eos> It was too far to go to you, but I'm...
Do you remember that?<eos> You don't have to handle this alone, Norman.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> Do you have your mother still?<eos> Do you remember what I told you about her?
I... appreciate the chat, but I've just gotta be getting back to my motel.<eos> Be well.<eos> Hey, it's Sam Loomis.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> I'll get right back to you.
You must've been in a hurry. No, I...<eos> I always do dumb stuff like that.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> San Diego, surprising my boyfriend.<eos> Well, it was nice of you to let me know about my coat, but really it's... Doesn't matter.
Hello, norman.<eos> Pretty night, isn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, sheriff.<eos> Isn't it just?<eos> So, w-what can I help you with tonight?
That'll be...<eos> Well, would $60 be okay?<eos> It's our special, off-season, stormy, "Middle of the night" rate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's very sweet of you.
Yeah, I did.<eos> I-I'm not much of a camper.<eos> But, you know, the things we do for love.<eos> Yes, I do, indeed.<eos> And if you need any recommendations for hikes or things to see, I'll be more than happy to help you.

A bite to eat?<eos> Gosh, at this hour?<eos> White Pine Bay's a very small town.<eos> Okay.<eos> But if you'd like, I could m-make you a ham sandwich.
Gosh, at this hour?<eos> White Pine Bay's a very small town.<eos> Okay.<eos> But if you'd like, I could m-make you a ham sandwich.<eos> I couldn't ask you to do that. No, honestly, it...
And I want to go check on him to make sure he's okay, but I don't know his actual address.<eos> So I was wondering if you could give it to me from the registry?<eos> It's not in the registry.<eos> I think maybe you should just go and try calling him again.<eos> Look, I can give you his address.
So you went to his house?<eos> You were right.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> Is there...<eos> Any way I could help you with anything?
Is there...<eos> Any way I could help you with anything?<eos> Don't be nice to me right now.<eos> It's just gonna make me cry all over again, and I'll never stop.<eos> I was gonna bring you the key 'cause I'm checking out.
I'm gonna take you down to the station.<eos> And my medication.<eos> Right, I'm gonna have Deputy Baker get your medication from your brother, and he'll be right behind us.<eos> But you and I need to start talking.<eos> I'll tell you everything.
No, no...<eos> Norman.<eos> Deary, deary me.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Can I help you?
You might wanna walk a little bit faster.<eos> You two seem pretty familiar.<eos> I'm this building's least favorite nuisance.<eos> Julia Ramos, your brother hired me on retainer.<eos> What did Dylan tell you about me?
- The bare minimum. - Horseshit.<eos> Let's be clear...<eos> Julia.<eos> If we do this, you work for me.<eos> Now, I don't know what he told you, but I'm... guessing it's something about how I must be nuts, how I need to be medicated,
Yes, but... we're friendly.<eos> Last night he called the station and said he killed your husband.<eos> We have no evidence to suggest that your husband's dead, but he does appear to be missing.<eos> I wish I had more conclusive information, but...<eos> I felt an obligation to tell you what I know.
I thought... you'd wanna be the one to tell your wife.<eos> No, you just wanted to tell me first so you could gauge my reaction.<eos> I understand loyalty.<eos> I understand the instinct to protect your brother.<eos> But I've seen family members destroyed over much less than what you're facing now.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna go home where it's normal.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Can I help you?
Oh, I don't know what she thought would happen, waltzing around the Algonquin in that fucking frock.<eos> - Girl reeks of antebellum. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Zelda, there you are.<eos> - Here I am.<eos> I need more time with you.
Scott told me that you came to town with a trunk full of clothes from Montgomery, that's all.<eos> And when he suggested that you might want to pick up a few new things,<eos> I jumped at the chance to take you on your first trip to Ladies Mile. How sweet of you.<eos> Not half as sweet as Scott.<eos> You should have heard him go on about what styles would suit you best.
Just these Montgomery dresses and that godforsaken suit.<eos> If you wore this... you'd be the snazziest bird at the Ritz.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much.<eos> I know you're an author, not an actor.<eos> Good God, Ober, is that the best you got.
Oh, you're going to be just fine.<eos> Look at you. You certainly have the eyes for it. Yes.<eos> They're even bigger than yours.<eos> - Zelda clips them all. - She's making a book.<eos> Glad one of you is.
See, this is the rub.<eos> The truly rich never have to worry about it all getting away from them.<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, Goofo.<eos> You're the best selling author of the year, and no one's taking that away from you.<eos> Lawrence, tell us what you like most about Scott's book.
Oh, uh, no.<eos> I believe we're all here.<eos> There's a baseball game this afternoon.<eos> I wrote.<eos> I wrote this novel. But it's not a book that any of you will ever assign or value. Or even understand.
There's a baseball game this afternoon.<eos> I wrote.<eos> I wrote this novel. But it's not a book that any of you will ever assign or value. Or even understand.<eos> No book of mine will ever be.<eos> And all the writing I've done, and will do, is in spite of you.
To prop up literature that is long dead, and to curry favor with the wealthiest students just so that you can indulge in the fantasy that you belong to their world.<eos> You don't.<eos> He never really fit in here, did he?<eos> Not like he wanted to.<eos> You're not a part of anyone's success.
When my daddy gets out of the bathroom, the least you can do is offer him a drink.<eos> Mrs. Sayre, please, come this way.<eos> Borrow this towel?<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> I will make you some tea.
Oh, my goodness, those are two of our finest writers.<eos> I certainly enjoyed "The Portrait of a Lady"<eos> and Henry James, he is a genius.<eos> - Some of my favorites. - Ah, Vincent.<eos> Here, let me introduce you to my father-in-law.
He's been moved out of the zone.<eos> The Factory?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All it says is he's in transit.<eos> I showed you my documentation already!
- Here it is, look!<eos> So sorry. We are out.<eos> We will open up tomorrow at 8:00 AM.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Your new boss wants to see you.
My job is to catch Broussard and his fellow terrorists.<eos> We also must recover an object that belongs to our Hosts, which means I need officers I can trust.<eos> If you give me the chance, you'll see what I can bring to the team.<eos> I understand the value of continuity, so you will get the chance to prove yourself.<eos> Otherwise, you'll be assigned to duties more appropriate to your skill set.
Yeah, I'm with Homeland.<eos> This is my house.<eos> What is this?<eos> I work for Homeland!<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
Lots of it.<eos> Please lower your voice.<eos> Will basically admitted it, you know, before he went through the Wall or whatever the hell he did.<eos> Drink that.<eos> What is it with you and Will and the whiskey?
Why can't you drink something that doesn't taste like lighter fluid?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Broussard.<eos> I have no contact with him.<eos> I don't believe you.
I've made mistakes.<eos> God knows.<eos> Right now, I just want to be a mother to the one child I have left.<eos> I know that you and Will were friends.<eos> I know he trusted you.
Grace, you said you were gonna sue me, but I never heard from you.<eos> What's a guy got to do to get your attention?<eos> You're suing me so you can see me?<eos> I'm being proactive, one of the things you like about me.<eos> There is nothing I like about you.
And it was just starting to take off.<eos> And not filling orders is not good for business.<eos> And if you think that I'm going down without a fight, you're not as smart as you look.<eos> - You think I look smart?<eos> - What is wrong with you?
So you actually own all the kayaks you rent out?<eos> Yeah, the whole fleet! The sunset on the water will blow your mind.<eos> - I'd love to see it sometime.<eos> - Boom, check it out.<eos> - Yeah. You're really passionate about San Diego tourism.
- We run a clean shop.<eos> - Clean?<eos> Other than the $100 million in drug money that you and your father collect and transport to these two gentlemen to launder?<eos> Clean to you.<eos> Listen, Del. Wh... Whatever money you're missing,
That's why I got this brochure.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Hang on, one second.<eos> I got this brochure last week, scouting businesses, and I brought it back to talk to Bruce about it.<eos> And I was gonna talk to you, because I wanna put the house on the market, and I wanna move down there with the family, and I wanna do what we do down there.
It's all going out the window. Just give it to me.<eos> I want more than just the ten percent.<eos> I want it all.<eos> And I wanna take it down there. Okay?<eos> What did these guys take from you?
What did these guys take from you?<eos> Was it eight?<eos> Is that what they said? I'll get you that. I'll put that together.<eos> You call it earnest money, okay?<eos> I give that to you... but then I take me and my family and we go down to the Ozarks, just like I planned.
One of your kids will get online sloppy.<eos> Twitter, Instagram...<eos> Your wife has one Lemon Drop too many with her new best friend, wants to share.<eos> If you have a legal problem I'm not aware of, don't tell me if you do, you could keep your identity, leave the country, go somewhere with no extradition to the US.<eos> Depends on who's looking for you, how much money they have.
Mr. Rosenberg Naturally wants to make up. For the curtailment of his conference. I.E. Be compensated for it.<eos> And mr. Franke, who isn't listening, Was yesterday Wearing his donator hat.<eos> A 20,000 euro bar tab.<eos> That really hurts me.<eos> How about you?
Emergency evac.<eos> Get the chopper now.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Arias.<eos> Thanks to you, I'll have to move my business somewhere else.
Animality Virus, professor.<eos> A-Virus, for short.<eos> Your B.O.W.s can tell who they're supposed to attack.<eos> That's a good selling point for a weapon.<eos> Engineering them with that trait must have been difficult for you.
A-Virus, for short.<eos> Your B.O.W.s can tell who they're supposed to attack.<eos> That's a good selling point for a weapon.<eos> Engineering them with that trait must have been difficult for you.<eos> But I know how you did it.
But I know how you did it.<eos> There are three strains of the virus.<eos> One infects them.<eos> A second acts as a trigger.<eos> The third gives you the option of choosing who your target will be.
It's fate.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> I'm redoing the wedding.<eos> This time with you.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Redfield.<eos> Arias.<eos> Thanks to Professor Chambers, we made the virus much stronger.<eos> If you can stick around for, oh, another 20 minutes you'll see how strong.<eos> I can't wait for you to meet the new and improved Rebecca.
Jake! Jake!<eos> Captain ain't gonna like this.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, Ana.<eos> How you doing?
Lost all my family heirlooms, photos of my kids and grandkids.<eos> - Sorry to hear that.<eos> - Why, thank you.<eos> And I managed to lose all the paperwork on the investment property, too.<eos> I can get you a copy of the deed.
I understand his concern.<eos> I lost my kids.<eos> And I would do anything to protect my grandkids.<eos> [sigh] Chayton, I've heard from, um... a reliable source that the case against you is strong.<eos> You may be having to spend some time in jail.
You may be having to spend some time in jail.<eos> When I think of Kwahu and what that might do to him... Why are you telling me this?<eos> I know some people... for a small price, could safely get you to a reserve in Canada and then get you overseas.<eos> So you think I should run.<eos> I'm just trying to be straight with you here, son.
Now get back.<eos> No, no. No. Please don't do that.<eos> Please. Just let me explain.<eos> 30 seconds.<eos> Yesterday when I came in here and I told you about that nurse who was stealing from my grandma...
Okay, badass.<eos> Love you, too, baby.<eos> My girl is researching real estate, looking into school districts and shit.<eos> You must be confident you will get custody.<eos> - What can I get you?
I know why.<eos> Really?<eos> You think I'm a piece of shit.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> So what happened between you and Letty?
Really?<eos> You think I'm a piece of shit.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> So what happened between you and Letty?<eos> She didn't tell you?
Yes.<eos> We can get started.<eos> Actually, I'd like to start with Jacob.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why? Because I'll speak with Jacob alone, and then I'll speak with the rest of you.
I don't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's okay that you don't know.<eos> My client hopes that you consider what a significant loss it's been for him to be robbed of the opportunity to know his son.<eos> I would hope your conversation with Jacob granted you some insight into how important Ms. Raines is to her son.
All you have to do is give us his handle, then we'll offer him a job.<eos> I can't do that. I think you can.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I'm asking nicely, so I can see why you think you have a little room to wiggle, but let me be clear with you.
Maybe I'm crossing the line by asking, but where on earth is that man of yours?<eos> He's not my man.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> If I were you, I would go find him and apologize for whatever it is you did.<eos> What can I get you?
- Okay.<eos> - I'm docking you that sandwich.<eos> I'm telling everyone I quit.<eos> Hey, I quit, okay? I quit.<eos> She can help you.
Hey!<eos> - You know you're in a Dumpster?<eos> - Ain't no shame in this game.<eos> Hi, ma'am.<eos> I can help you with that.
I'm going to work.<eos> For as long as we still have a business.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We're gonna get your money back.<eos> Chayton, how are you?
Amanda.<eos> I told her to be out front.<eos> It's fine, I'll get her.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I... I need to talk to you.
- He's not a good guy.<eos> - We don't know where he's at.<eos> - Your wife does.<eos> - No, she doesn't. She takes me to him, I am a memory.<eos> I can get you his address.
- You can take my word, because there's only one lying' asshole on this call.<eos> Listen. Listen, I want to make a deal.<eos> Call me Monty Fuckin' Hall.<eos> You can have me.<eos> I'll even come to you.
Nah. Trust me.<eos> I'll get my money.<eos> _<eos> Mr. Mukherjee.<eos> How are you?
Previously on "Colony"...<eos> You have been assigned to one of the authority's labor camps and distribution centers.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
Come on, let's go.<eos> Move it. Stop there.<eos> You collaborate, you die.<eos> This doesn't... This doesn't look good.<eos> Gonna hang this on you.
Good job.<eos> Enlightenment. I have to go handle something at the yonk.<eos> Can you... Can you watch Gracie?<eos> Of course, Mrs. Bowman.<eos> May I have a word with you first?
You two, over there!<eos> This way. Take your stations.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What happened to your boots, kid?<eos> Find anything you like?
What happened to your boots, kid?<eos> Find anything you like?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You know what I want.<eos> I already told you that I can't give you broussard.
What?<eos> A tiny drone that looks like a bee.<eos> That's how they got all their intelligence for their operations.<eos> - A bee?<eos> - That's all I can give you.
It's okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> We fumigated our office like you suggested, but I talked to my boss... It's not enough.<eos> I can't hold them off anymore.<eos> I'm ready to give you what you want.
Like I said, i want to get out of here too, and that's not happening unless I run a clean camp.<eos> No stealing, no resistance, no nonsense.<eos> But I can't do that without information.<eos> You want me to be your spy.<eos> If I help you, I get to go home?
I need broussard.<eos> I told you I cannot get him for you.<eos> I wasn't lying.<eos> You know, after the arrival, I was horrified by how easily people gave up their freedom, without even a real fight, just to keep some semblance of their normal life.<eos> Right now, I'd give you anything for one day with my husband and my kids in our old house.
You think that you can manipulate me... Because I'm weak.<eos> I don't think you're weak.<eos> I... I think you have a conscience.<eos> Do you have a conscience?<eos> Do you ever think of the people who are dead because of you?
Every day.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't stop this anymore.<eos> It's bigger than just me now.<eos> I won't blame you.
I can't stop this anymore.<eos> It's bigger than just me now.<eos> I won't blame you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I won't blame you.
Surprise.<eos> Okay, what is happening here?<eos> We're back together.<eos> Well, it's... it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.<eos> We've heard so much about you.
Fuck you, Cole.<eos> Dr. Parry?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, no, yeah, I-I'm doing great.<eos> It's so nice to hear from you.
If you shut me down now, I'm screwed.<eos> I'm sorry, with all the new construction in town, we really must enforce the rules.<eos> All right, Timothy, I know that you're new here.<eos> This is a small town. We take care of each other.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Lockhart.
All right, Timothy, I know that you're new here.<eos> This is a small town. We take care of each other.<eos> I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> Heard that you're an upstanding member of this community and someone people really look up to.<eos> I would think it'd be important to you to continue to do things the proper way.
It sucks having to drive all the way out here again just to ask the same question twice, but here goes... where were you the night that Noah Solloway was attacked?<eos> - I already told you.<eos> - Your home, right.<eos> Except you didn't tell us, your wife did.<eos> Why do we have a picture of you at a tollbooth right after the George Washington Bridge, the evening of the stabbing?
Very good, Detective Rice. Very good.<eos> You're looking at everything from all angles.<eos> All right, let's take a look at the board, shall we?<eos> What do you see?<eos> What does your gut tell you?
I get it.<eos> Your dog has had a tragic history.<eos> But don't let her shit on my lawn.<eos> Go.<eos> -Can I help you?
But don't let her shit on my lawn.<eos> Go.<eos> -Can I help you?<eos> -Hi. I'm your neighbor, Gene Handsome.<eos> I thought I'd come and welcome you to the neighborhood by, uh, bringing you and your daughter some cookies.
I know, Jerpis.<eos> Go ahead. What do you got?<eos> This is a drive-by, plain and simple.<eos> - How do you get that?<eos> - I'll show you, sir.
In my opinion.<eos> Tell me about last night.<eos> What did you see?<eos> What happened?<eos> You may have saw or heard something that you're not even aware of.
Who wouldn't want a real detective as their babysitter?<eos> Guess you.<eos> You're the one who doesn't.<eos> I'm really good at dancing.<eos> You're gonna love the show that I have planned for you.
And by the way, my tubes are tied.<eos> You gotta fix this door.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> It's a booming, sparkling morning.<eos> Can I help you?
No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. She's... she's an old family friend from back east.<eos> The kid of my parents' friends.<eos> Uh, she moved out here recently and, um, I was helping her get set up.<eos> So you guys aren't a thing?
-So you're single? -Yeah.<eos> I'm single.<eos> -He's single.<eos> -I was asking!<eos> Okay, she'd be calling you regularly for?
Uh, no. No one comes to mind.<eos> Wow. Mr. Vander...<eos> Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> My one o'clock is here.<eos> Um, but, hey, let me give you my card.
We're in the midst of a custody battle.<eos> And Heather would tell me things Nora would forget to do, like get Carys her flu shot.<eos> She told me the crap that Nora was feeding my kid. She told me what would stress Nora out.<eos> Besides me and my lawyer.<eos> Look, I'm gonna ask you a few questions, and, uh, Handsome over here's gonna know if you're telling the truth or not.
Uh... Did Heather turn on you and threaten to give you up to your wife?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, was Heather blackmailing you for even more money?<eos> No.<eos> Did you like that move I did yesterday where I made your dick bend all the way to the right?
Do you have any other doors like this in your house?<eos> -Why, yes! Off the balcony in my bedroom. -Mmm.<eos> By the way, there's no ice in there.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> After you.
As a matter of fact, I've got a half-wit theory about it.<eos> I think you met Heather at the Lalalime party.<eos> I think when she was denied a Silky Lamb gift bag, she went looking for a celebrity.<eos> And she found you.<eos> She came home with you.
Anyway, back to what I was saying before.<eos> I cannot believe you have done this for me. I really can't.<eos> Well, if a person can make someone else happy, they ought to do it, right?<eos> Right.<eos> I can tell it makes you a little uncomfortable to be thanked, so I'll stop.
I don't know that I would go calling me an angel. Yeah.<eos> And like an angel, it's better for you to just stay at a distance.<eos> Observe from the clouds.<eos> You don't want me calling you and sticking around in your life.<eos> I know you would not be comfortable with an arrangement like that, so I'll save you from the pressure.
No, I don't.<eos> She ran.<eos> Where does she go when she runs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, I believe you.
Good news is I'm not here for you.<eos> Who you here for?<eos> - This one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He mean anything to you?
- Yeah.<eos> - He mean anything to you?<eos> - No, I just met him.<eos> You expect me to believe you're not a part of this? You believe whatever you want to believe.<eos> I'm offering you a choice.
The only way this ends is if we can find a way for you to open the safe without telling them that you were lying when you said you couldn't.<eos> You got the combo written down somewhere?<eos> I want my money, Otto.<eos> You say you can't get to it, but I need to know for sure.<eos> Man is gonna cut off your ears, your nose, your tongue, maybe pop your eyes out of your skull, and if the safe is still not open, then we owe you an apology.
All I want is Marius.<eos> You think I'd give you my grandson?<eos> And by the way, his name is Pete.<eos> Here's my deal.<eos> You tell me where he's going, I let you ride inside.
The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.<eos> And I trust you know who I am? I do.<eos> But what do I call you?<eos> Mother will do.<eos> And so, you do know who I am, but you don't care? What?
Whose hobby is dissolving people in acid?<eos> Oh, now, Trexler doesn't do the actual dissolving.<eos> That would be his enforcer, Dutch Dylan.<eos> I don't care who does the dissolving.<eos> But if you help me, I can help you.
Close.<eos> I'm a private investigator.<eos> I'm doing some work for your boss.<eos> And apparently doing it with a fresh new take on the word "private."<eos> Can I buy you a drink?
Or 12.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> Guess.<eos> I-I was just coming to see you.
The sensational tone that the battle's been receiving in the media.<eos> Oh, I don't know how I can do that.<eos> People are finally starting to fight. Finally starting to stand up.<eos> Supergirl doesn't want anyone showing up and getting hurt.<eos> And I don't know anyone who cares more about the people than you do, Ms. Grant.
- Sniper?<eos> Don't you find that story A little absurd?<eos> Isn't that your job?<eos> To find out what is absurd And what isn't?<eos> Did you see the red dot too?
Look, he was... He was depressed.<eos> And he committed...<eos> Look, he took his own life.<eos> But that was a long time ago.<eos> - Did the Meyerist Movement do that to you? Mr. Lane?
Listen. I'm concerned that Cal is gonna run circles around this woman.<eos> - How you feeling, Agent Gaines?<eos> - I'm solid.<eos> - We've been investigating the Meyerist Movement.<eos> Regardless of how they may have helped you in the past, you understand they're threatening you to get what they want, and that's illegal, and a god-awful way to treat someone that's come to you for help.
- How you feeling, Agent Gaines?<eos> - I'm solid.<eos> - We've been investigating the Meyerist Movement.<eos> Regardless of how they may have helped you in the past, you understand they're threatening you to get what they want, and that's illegal, and a god-awful way to treat someone that's come to you for help.<eos> And it's probably not just you.
This may not look like much, but... it's a modern listening device.<eos> You could be a great asset to us.<eos> But I want to be crystal clear; this is voluntary.<eos> If you want to help us, I need you to say out loud that you're willing to do so.<eos> - I'll help you.
Of course.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Oh, sure!<eos> It's just we've been running around today because we overscheduled ourselves.<eos> Plus, we wanted you to see our headquarters and our wonderful wares.
No, sir, officer.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Get outta here, creepy little shit.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Something we should show you.
Look, why is everybody so eager to lump BB's murder with the rest of these boys?<eos> And don't you say it's a black thing.<eos> Yeah, are you seriously gonna let Hanson just brush this under the carpet?<eos> Charlie, you came to see me about the shoes.<eos> Do you remember?
- What are jelly rings? - Those.<eos> - I hate those things.<eos> Probably gonna sniff his fingers and play with himself later.<eos> I think I'm gonna throw up.<eos> So... you fellas enjoy baseball practice?
I think we can finish up things around here.<eos> Illium Moon was Chester's associate, not Leonard.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> So, why haven't you?<eos> Because Illium is afraid to talk to you.
Ow.<eos> Ow.<eos> You're makin' a big mistake. Yeah, probably.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanna tell you a story, Judge. I want you to pay attention.
- Everybody!<eos> What the hell is that about?<eos> Uh, it's semi-not related to any of this, but I think I know a temp fix.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get back to you.
I couldn't have you infecting my students then and I certainly won't now.<eos> You fucking prick.<eos> - Where am I supposed to go?<eos> - You can keep your memories.<eos> I hope that whatever you've learned here will help keep you safe.
This is...<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, I'll see you when I see you.<eos> See you.<eos> I owe you for real.
I owe you for real.<eos> Good.<eos> Now this is going to take just a few minutes to fully power up.<eos> You all are going to need something strong to hold off The Beast.<eos> Step one... is for all of you to get very, very drunk.
Step one... is for all of you to get very, very drunk.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Chug-a-lug.<eos> As you grow, your name will become an important part of you.
This is a Cacodemon.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - They'll grow much bigger.<eos> Unleash these and believe me, they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.<eos> Each of you will be given a special word to command your Cacodemon to attack.
Say something!<eos> - Say something, God damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> You sorry?
Now I know where Bud gets it from.<eos> I think I had to make a few less notes and corrections this week.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> Is he doing okay otherwise?<eos> Sol, let me tell you something.
- Thank you.<eos> Oh... I'll swing it this way.<eos> Grace... Now I gotta say that I always knew that you would be back in the game someday.<eos> Well, here I am.<eos> Did she ever tell you about that conference in Denver?
No, I mean when are you retiring?<eos> I...<eos> I'm not retiring.<eos> Bud still needs me.<eos> Sol, can I show you something?
Oh, get in line.<eos> Am I right, Keith?<eos> Actually, sir, we asked you not to come into these meetings.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> What did I steal from you?
Okay...<eos> Sounds good to me. Can I go now?<eos> - Don't you want to know what's going on?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> Well, you pulled me out of an Ed Sheeran concert, so I feel like I kind of owe you.
But what does that mean?<eos> You're a candidate for another stroke.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What does she do now?<eos> Well, I'm going to put her on some blood thinners and some statins, and before you leave, I'm gonna give you information about Transient Ischemic Attacks and some recommended lifestyle changes.
That way she'll forget the invasion feeling.<eos> Doug!<eos> She is really irritating.<eos> So, Tammy.<eos> I'm gonna do something to you.
- Well, I noticed you.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> Well, most people when don't understand something, they frown.<eos> You... smile.<eos> I'll tell you what I don't understand.
Ooh, I found that at the back of the cupboard with all your old stuff.<eos> Just photographs of your mum.<eos> I didn't know we had 'em.<eos> Happy new term!<eos> With you in a moment.
You're dead.<eos> You're dead.<eos> Hello, Bill.<eos> What's that?<eos> I'll tell you what it isn't.
What's that?<eos> I'll tell you what it isn't.<eos> It isn't a freak optical effect... and it's following me.<eos> No, no, what are you doing?<eos> I'll tell you what, let's just pop into my box.
- My God!<eos> Have we travelled in time?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> We've travelled to Australia.<eos> - How are you doing?
Listen, please, just listen to him.<eos> Don't, don't!<eos> Bill, let go!<eos> Bill, listen to me.<eos> Whatever she's showing you, whatever she's letting you see.
Just one night.<eos> Come on, let me have some good dreams for once.<eos> OK.<eos> Do what you've got to do.<eos> But imagine... just imagine how it would feel if someone did this to you.
[crowing] Maybe you should go next door, see what that's about.<eos> Check out that very live bird.<eos> Mmm. I'll do that because I, too, would like to find a simple solution to this problem.<eos> The owners have had a few offers fall through, so they're very motivated.<eos> I'm taking you to the kitchen and I mean it this time.
I'm taking you to dinner.<eos> - This place is creepy.<eos> - Yeah, well, so are we.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm just gonna give you $100, and that's just for opening the door.
Sometimes, Captain, you have to sacrifice<eos> - for the good of the pe...<eos> Let's get one thing straight here:<eos> I'm in charge of this precinct.<eos> Any of you get out of line again, you will be outta here.
Oh, he'd be very sorry.<eos> Yes, he would.<eos> Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!<eos> My baby.<eos> Can't tell you how grateful we are.
See what happens when I don't do what I must.<eos> Kenneth Slater?<eos> He's one of the victims that was kidnapped on the case I was looking into.<eos> But he was returned alive.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
Let's tone this down.<eos> I think you guys need to leave our house right now.<eos> No, you need to cool it.<eos> Unless you want to leave this house with us.<eos> Maybe you don't care if everybody thinks my wife's crazy, but I do.
No, he'll come for me!<eos> He'll come for you!<eos> He won't let you sleep!<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you.
It's important that we talk, now that Bonaparte is dead, and you've killed your political career.<eos> Look, I told you.<eos> The Grimm was responsible.<eos> You also told us you can handle the Grimm.<eos> Instead he seems to have handled you quite well.
What exactly does that mean?<eos> Our goals have not changed.<eos> We want you to pick up where we left off.<eos> You mean with everyone dead?<eos> Except you.
How do you know this?<eos> Were you there?<eos> I was there.<eos> The Grimm should be dead, but he's not.<eos> Like I told you, he's being protected by something very powerful.
The President gave him a medal.<eos> That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.<eos> Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple backflip on a BMX bike before? All of you?
I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple backflip on a BMX bike before? All of you?<eos> No.<eos> We don't play on bikes.<eos> You don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?
Now, this is a team I can work with.<eos> I'll make this easy for you.<eos> These four assholes, very bad guys.<eos> Pandora's Box, very bad thing.<eos> We'll land in Manila and you will requisition your own transportation to the island.
That's not gonna come off, you know that, right?<eos> I'll have to replace the goddamn screen.<eos> I've been saying the director of the CIA has been trying to destroy the world for years.<eos> Okay, we have carte blanche to track this son of a bitch down.<eos> Do any of you know how to do it?
Back on the plane.<eos> I want wheels up in 20.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> We recovered Pandora's Box.<eos> They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.
Who knows what that girl will do to herself?<eos> We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?
I'm not actually a successful businessman.<eos> I was in prison because I stole $125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.
You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nobody knows what happens after you die.<eos> You are Romeo and Juliet and we all wish you the same happy ending.
So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.
Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?
Did he not study with Mordred himself?<eos> What are you implying?<eos> I was sent to study with him by my father as a token of diplomacy.<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> We would only seek to remind Your Majesty that it was a Mage, Merlin, who gave you the great sword.
I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> (VORTIGERN BREATHING HEAVILY)<eos> Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?
Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.<eos> I owe you everything.
You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> (EAGLE CALLS)<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?
You're good with animals, aren't you?<eos> They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.
I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> And have a beard.<eos> You do know I can see through this?
And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to get me to do something razzle-dazzle with that sword.<eos> I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm not gettin' drawn into this mess.
In order to stand a chance, we are going to need at least some of their support.<eos> We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.
I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.
What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> MERCIA: 10,000 boys.<eos> All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
- How would he know?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maybe he knows she's working for us.<eos> I am telling you. That is not the king.
A single jewel, a relic acquired centuries ago on a xenoarcheological dig on the planet Phobos.<eos> Valuable?<eos> Insignificant, an information storage device.<eos> He's more concerned with the treasure than with the lives of our people.<eos> I'm surprised your planet only dispatched the three of you.
But you'll have to sweeten the pot.<eos> Say one power cylinder.<eos> I've heard many tales in my line of work and the stories of the Aresian power cylinder have always intrigued me.<eos> Just stories.<eos> Then I'm afraid I can't help you.
These are friends.<eos> I'm here on a secret mission.<eos> A mission you can now assist me with.<eos> Something's not right, Princess.<eos> Those who stand beside you are friends to no one.
Those who stand beside you are friends to no one.<eos> Where is Prince Tyr?<eos> The prince is dead.<eos> And you have sworn loyalty to the crown. To me.<eos> I'm ordering you to put your weapons on the ground and stand down.
Please do not interfere.<eos> Your voice is kind but your intentions remain unclear.<eos> Let me spell it out for you.<eos> I see.<eos> We have been searching for you.
One at a time. One at a time.<eos> Please. Please.<eos> - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.
No way!<eos> - But, Papa, but...<eos> - Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going. Do you understand that?
It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.
It's never gonna stop.<eos> Make the log stop spinning.<eos> This river is killing me.<eos> Look out!<eos> I love you two.
It's you.<eos> You're a girl.<eos> She's a girl.<eos> This is her.<eos> This is the Smurf I was telling you about.
- Look.<eos> - Hey, watch it!<eos> - Brainy's log, day two.<eos> We've encountered a rare new life-form.<eos> Are there more like you?
What?<eos> Smurfette, is that true?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> She was made to help him find Smurfs.<eos> Smurfette came here to help you.
Where are the boys?<eos> - 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.
What?<eos> What is all this talk about Garga...<eos> Gargamel!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I scare you?
- No, Gargamel.<eos> No.<eos> - Quiet down.<eos> You'll all get your turn.<eos> In you go!
(APPLAUSE)<eos> No U.S. operations, no fiscal responsibility for Semtech.<eos> The pension fund is being dissolved.<eos> (ALL CLAMORING)<eos> With all due respect, Donald, thirty years of hard work means shit to you people!
But if you do steal, don't steal from Value Town.<eos> Yeah, couple of great friends I got.<eos> You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.<eos> We never asked you to do anything.<eos> I drive you there. I drive you back.
But, what do you want from me, man?<eos> We have this project, and we're looking for help.<eos> What kind of project?<eos> Oh, well, we'd rather not say.<eos> Well, that makes it harder for me to help you.
I've got 20 days before I lose my house.<eos> JESUS:<eos> Robbing a bank is an art form.<eos> Ten different people will take the same place ten different ways.<eos> You need to come up with a plan that is special for you.
We are volunteering, Milton.<eos> All right.<eos> JESUS:<eos> Each teller's drawer is equipped with dye packs and tracing devices.<eos> Now, they'll give you one if they can, but they will never endanger lives to do it.
I thought you had 'em!<eos> I decided we should use blanks.<eos> No one needs to get hurt by accident.<eos> Well, it's just us now, kids.<eos> Fellas, it's been a real hell of a time planning a heist with you.
This is an actual robbery.<eos> Kiss the ground.<eos> Don't breathe.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't touch the silent alarm unless you like bullets flying around your head.
She's a terrific person.<eos> I mean, she's sexy, we get it on.<eos> She's a great cook. She likes me the way I am.<eos> I don't even like me the way I am.<eos> Everything is terrific, but I got to tell you, I'm experiencing this very odd feeling.
Burton!<eos> - You in on this?<eos> - No. I'm good.<eos> All right, this is happening.<eos> - Whoo! - I'm glad I'm not even watching you guys.
"I love you.<eos> "I love Fergus more than anything.<eos> "But I'm finished, Gail.<eos> "I'm sorry.<eos> "Love you both.
Trainspotting?<eos> In Leith Central?<eos> "He says, laughing.<eos> "I noticed Begbie seemed strangely subdued and uncomfortable."<eos> They fucking turn it on for you.
- Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.
- Knick-knacks.<eos> Lightly-used houseware.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> We become rubbish.<eos> I want to help you.
You care for her, don't you?<eos> Well, then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight.<eos> Yes, and when the moment's just right...<eos> Well, how will I know?<eos> You will feel slightly nauseous.
Turn back into a clock.<eos> Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> Oh! It's so good to see you.
Sarayu.<eos> It means "wind blow".<eos> Right.<eos> So...<eos> Which one of you is...
That's good.<eos> The best meal I ever had. In life.<eos> Dreaming or not.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let me ask you something.
The best meal I ever had. In life.<eos> Dreaming or not.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> I told you all about Josh, Kate, and Nan.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.<eos> I would like this.<eos> Thanks for letting me see Missy.<eos> The pleasure was all mine.<eos> I can not describe The joy I felt when I saw you two together.
He said that you said that it was your best card ever.<eos> So, tell it!<eos> Ask the woman.<eos> She saw it.<eos> I'm never gonna tell you.
Quiet...<eos> Quiet, please. Shh!<eos> Thank... Shh! Hush!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, for this morning's thought of the day, we will be discussing with you future planning.
Thank... Shh! Hush!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, for this morning's thought of the day, we will be discussing with you future planning.<eos> Now, as you know, many of the top here will be, uh, taking their exams soon.<eos> Much sooner than many of them would like. - Hey, yo, that's you.
So, for this morning's thought of the day, we will be discussing with you future planning.<eos> Now, as you know, many of the top here will be, uh, taking their exams soon.<eos> Much sooner than many of them would like. - Hey, yo, that's you.<eos> - But it's always at this...<eos> It's always at this time of year, as we prepare to say bye-bye to some of you, that my thoughts turn to... to what lies ahead of us on the road to...
Get on your knees, all of you.<eos> - Lucy, Lucy...<eos> - Lucy, you don't have to do this, please.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what happened to you.
Okay, what if I could put together $45,000 cash right now?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Morning.<eos> "I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus.
Shit!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.<eos> There's so few of you left.
That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up. You're moving on.<eos> For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.
Messing with the TV with your goddamn computer telephone?<eos> No, I'm not the one doing it.<eos> I'mma show you what's funny.<eos> Everybody,<eos> I want you to hashtag L-M-F-A...
During the Iraq War, Strickland killed them.<eos> You're dead.<eos> You're dead.<eos> Game's over, boys.<eos> I'll save you some next time.
Tea time.<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerising."<eos> "The entire neighbourhood is crazy for you."<eos> Get lost, wastrels!<eos> One slap will put you in your place!
And the rest in ten years.<eos> You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years ls ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive I guarantee you.<eos> This is my neighbourhood, you are my people.<eos> You own your house from the very first day.
You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years ls ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive I guarantee you.<eos> This is my neighbourhood, you are my people.<eos> You own your house from the very first day.<eos> All of you will get the deeds of agreement. I guarantee you that.
Listen.<eos> This is for Dulari's baby.<eos> Deliver the bottle of milk to her right away.<eos> Distribute the meals in police vans.<eos> - Raees sends food for all of you.
And to prove that, you should live lf you don't escape, they will... kill you!<eos> Sadiq is right.<eos> - Get out of here, please!<eos> - No!<eos> If I escape, the cops will make life miserable for you.
- Hello?<eos> - Doctor, let me speak to Sadiq lt's Raees.<eos> - Sadiq here.<eos> - l've set everything right, Sadiq.<eos> Are you all right?
Automatic pump time is set to pause in 20 seconds.<eos> In 15...<eos> In five, four, three...<eos> Spot on, Aggy.<eos> The junction is 500m ahead of you.
30 seconds out, Stratton.<eos> Hold on. Come on. Hold it tight.<eos> Get up.<eos> Get them!<eos> I'll cover you!
And I think we both know that it wasn't destroyed but stolen and transported from Iran.<eos> Look, here's what I think. If you were going to arrest me, I would already be on a transport to an American pit where they would pour water down my throat, but here I am, so why don't you just get to the point?<eos> We need information.<eos> You were hired to build a biological weapon recently.<eos> Look, I am not gonna bullshit you.
And in the end the question of our context is inconsequential.<eos> If there is a design we are foregone to fit within it.<eos> And if there is no design, we are alone in our keep and no ground will hold us.<eos> It's time to wake up.<eos> Do you want me to make you guys some tea?
There's no tactical precedence.<eos> We did the best we could in the situation.<eos> PACKARD:<eos> Griffin Co.!<eos> Thank God you guys are okay!
You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.<eos> But you're real.<eos> Right?<eos> I told you.<eos> Didn't I tell you?
Which one?<eos> MARLOW:<eos> Uh-huh. That makes sense.<eos> This is all hallowed ground to them.<eos> So if you like your hands, don't touch anything.
Moving out in 10.<eos> MARLOW:<eos> This is a good group of boys.<eos> We're all gonna die together out here.<eos> You're a good group of boys to die with, I'll tell you that much.
All I'm doing, Faith dear... - ...is getting something off my chest. Without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you. But... You will forget it.<eos> If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your blood streams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.
If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your blood streams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.<eos> I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be... corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now.
I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal. And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.
But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.<eos> - Ignorance is bliss.<eos> - What's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

- Ignorance is bliss.<eos> - What's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.<eos> Please, be aware that one of you is a high ranking police officer.<eos> One of you is a member of the judiciary.
Some of you know each other and some of you don't.<eos> Please, be aware that one of you is a high ranking police officer.<eos> One of you is a member of the judiciary.<eos> One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.<eos> Two of you work for me. And one of you of course, is my lovely daughter. Faith.
- Yes.<eos> Yes! Absolutely, yes!<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself but rather, the iron chain of reasoning from cause to effect, that reveals, step-by-step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence, as they were available to me.
The demons beneath the road, this is where we trap them.<eos> Sherrinford is more than a prison, or an asylum.<eos> It is a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.<eos> Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.<eos> But I can give you a map reference for hell.
Please continue with your deductions.<eos> I'm now focussing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make.<eos> Why should we bother?<eos> What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister?<eos> I have, if you remember, provided you with some motivation.
I was trying to be kind.<eos> Kind?<eos> Kind?<eos> You've told us that our daughter was dead.<eos> Better that than tell you what she had become.
You were always the grownup.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Uh, yeah. I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S. I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.
- Oh, no!<eos> - That's awful!<eos> - Horrible!<eos> What is it?<eos> It's simpler if I just show you.
You better start packing.<eos> What?<eos> You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.<eos> I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
As you can see, I've switched off the seat belt sign.<eos> What are you two boys doi ng up here?<eos> We're Captain Ross's kids.<eos> He told us to sit here.<eos> Well, can I get you special guys anything?
Just a little longer.<eos> Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's time to leave.<eos> Go and live your peasant lives.<eos> Be gone with you!
But they're worth thousands of units apiece... which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.<eos> Careful what you say around these folks.<eos> They're easily offended.<eos> The cost of transgression is death.<eos> We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.
Yay. I understand she is your sister.<eos> She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.<eos> Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.<eos> Do with her as you please.<eos> We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
It's so much worse.<eos> You son of a...<eos> Hey! - I've had it with you!<eos> - No!<eos> Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?<eos> You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.<eos> That was when Daddy was paying my bills.<eos> The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.<eos> And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.<eos> I assure you... I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick... or a talking woodland beast.
I help him sleep.<eos> What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.<eos> Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
You maniac.<eos> The whole ship's gonna blow.<eos> Not the whole ship.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.
I don't even like the type of thing you are.<eos> Hey! There's no need to get personal.<eos> Listen!<eos> Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.<eos> I should have told you earlier.
You are wasting a lot of time here!<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> Rear thrusters are out again!<eos> We're done for without that generator!<eos> Guardians... perhaps it will provide you solace... that your deaths are not without purpose.
Yeah.<eos> He's gonna love you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I help you?
Animal Magic!<eos> He's the "very healthy" guy!<eos> All the other super pigs were on flat land, accessible by car.<eos> Japan's one was five minutes from the airport.<eos> And you... I notice that you had to leave the fucking mountaintop super pig till the end, because you knew that the climb would rile me.
Nice to meet you.<eos> We're not terrorists!<eos> What?<eos> We don't like violence!<eos> We don't want to hurt you!
I don't think he gets it!<eos> Buckle! Buckle!<eos> Put on your seat belt!<eos> 'Cause we're gonna come on board now, right?<eos> But we're not gonna hurt you.
Here is Alfonso!<eos> Where is he?<eos> I got a special treat for Lucy's star super pig.<eos> Chop, chop!<eos> Let me introduce you to someone.
- Kaboom!<eos> - I got a sippy cup!<eos> - Kaboom!<eos> - I got a Batarang!<eos> And the rest of you get Bat Bucks.
Whoo!<eos> Let's hear it for Batman!<eos> Who I wish was here right now.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's listening.<eos> I'd like to ask all of you a question.
Are you fed up with crime?<eos> - Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.<eos> - Yeah, we're sick of it.<eos> Then let's talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime.<eos> I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
Push the Bat-Signal?<eos> Good call.<eos> I like your instincts.<eos> I've got a surprise for you guys.<eos> And it's gonna make you smile.
My...<eos> Okay, Batman.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> All of you have the right to remain silent.
- You're boring.<eos> - He looks delicious.<eos> Let's eat this guy.<eos> Stop with the violence for just a second!<eos> What if I told you I could get you outta here?
We got a giant sea monster, 12 o'clock!<eos> Got it.<eos> - We've got his attention.<eos> - He's tracking us.<eos> I've got you now.
- Are you okay?<eos> I've got you.<eos> Joker!<eos> Please, help us!<eos> No! I'm not gonna help you.
You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll just end up crying.<eos> guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you so... do better.
And that requires candlelight?<eos> This was my dad's favorite place.<eos> It's the only takeout I know.<eos> Smells good.<eos> You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the rest of my session just joining the two of you.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.
Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know...
Camera.<eos> They're getting the lay of the land.<eos> Shit!<eos> - Surround Gao!<eos> Claire, Colleen, you okay?
And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.
So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.
I need to talk to him.<eos> I don't know that he wants to talk to you.<eos> please.<eos> They killed friends of mine and you knew that.<eos> And that is why I couldn't tell you. Either of you.
I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?<eos> Like the Ear?<eos> Or the Arm?<eos> I didn't want to hurt you.
No problem.<eos> -See ya.<eos> I think this has just been one big, unfortunate misunderstanding.<eos> Why don't we take this opportunity to start fresh?<eos> Can I offer you a complimentary package of Pez?
I work for an agency called the international artifact society.<eos> recovering lost, precious relics and ensuring they do not fall into the wrong hands.<eos> In fact, we did a lot of work with your grandfather.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Someone you know thought that maybe we should meet.
I said I'd bring him back.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Hand attacked us.<eos> They took Luke.<eos> How do you know they didn't follow you here?
- What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?<eos> Nothing you can do can make me serve you. Do you understand?
- What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.<eos> The woman on the radio.<eos> They'll come for them next.<eos> How many mice must drown with you?
Where's Jessica?<eos> They're digging up info on Midland Circle.<eos> We think that's where it all started.<eos> "We"?<eos> As in the rest of you who worked against me?
Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.<eos> Our Jessica?<eos> Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?
Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.<eos> I brought you the Iron Fist.
Because from now on, nothing will stand in my way.<eos> Not even death.<eos> - You guys okay?<eos> - I'll live.<eos> I don't suppose either of you snuck a flask in here.
That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.<eos> Once we're out of the hole, hit the charge, get out.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I am going down with you.
It's hard to tell.<eos> The more I think about it, the less I like our odds.<eos> Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...
- Drug trafficking.<eos> Really?<eos> You know that for sure?<eos> No.<eos> But I guarantee you it's drug trafficking.
- All right. Let me at him!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Welcome back, man. - Love you, man.<eos> Hey, guys. Thanks for coming over.<eos> - It was good to see you. - Great to see you.
Have you heard from Christian?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He sent me flowers.<eos> To wish me luck.<eos> Sweetheart, are you ever gonna tell me what happened between you?
Excuse us.<eos> Surely.<eos> She's fantastic.<eos> Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.<eos> I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.
As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.<eos> And something like that reminds us of what really matters and how important it is to seize the day.<eos> We should Cherish the people we care about and who care about us.<eos> Mom, dad, I know I haven't always been the perfect son.<eos> But I owe everything to you both, so thank you.
Gosh, big mouth once,<eos> And how often did you kill your old friend?<eos> Hey, I taught the movement,<eos> You should try other moves,<eos> I was the one who taught the gesture, Then you teach him,
Me and you? There's a problem<eos> I am asking the real question right now<eos> Is it gonna be... "The Revenge of Nerds" or "The Dark Knight"?<eos> To be honest I like both of you<eos> But just before we get into all of that, Let me ask you one question
I wanted to thank you<eos> No need<eos> Cipher's still on the loose<eos> There's been some reports she's in Athens But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon<eos> Thanks to you guys
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe<eos> Who will never give up on me<eos> He's beatiful<eos> You've heard me say. "That you never turn your back on family"<eos> And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me
- You sure you're okay to drive?<eos> - You sound like my ex.<eos> "The searchers!" "The searchers." That's it.<eos> Man, that's an awesome movie.<eos> Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
Do you hear that, you motherfucker? ! I have a gun!<eos> You motherfucker, I will... What do we do?<eos> - No way.<eos> No way! - Come on.<eos> Fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.<eos> Smallpox butchered me down to the bone and, yes, I have other business than pissing.<eos> You know, in all of London, only your father believed you were still alive.<eos> It was a symptom of his madness.<eos> But he would talk to you, stand on the north bank of the river and call out to you on the other side.
Just rocks and Indians.<eos> The land in your father's will is not only useless, it is dangerous to any who owns it.<eos> They're my rocks now.<eos> James... I can arrange the immediate transfer of this particular asset.<eos> I'll send you a formal proposition in writing.
You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.<eos> I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> James...<eos> You could have written to your father just once.<eos> In the end, he was calling for you.
In the end, he was calling for you.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd say, "Come on, come in.<eos> Before the tide gets your shoes."<eos> And he would light these fires on the shore, call out your name and talk to you.
No. No, no, James.<eos> Your mother came from Naples.<eos> He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> And he bought them both for gunpowder.<eos> He told me never to speak to you of buying her.
When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like... It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.
What do you want?<eos> You think your father's kid feeds himself.<eos> I heard you done a lot of evil over there.<eos> Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.
If it wasn't for us, that kid would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.<eos> Mr. Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're a liar just like your father.<eos> Tell you what... You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.
I would say heavy doses over a short period, and, yes, it would have affected his mind in the later stages.<eos> You want him reburied?<eos> Yes, and sewn back up into one piece.<eos> I would recommend they dig a bit deeper this time.<eos> If this body is used for any other purpose, I will find you and I will kill you.
- Indeed.<eos> Let us not pretend--<eos> - No, do not pretend.<eos> I wonder if Mr. Appleby might be allowed to finish a sentence?<eos> We are told that in your father's will, you were bequeathed a piece of territory which lies just here.
You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?<eos> On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> They will walk you along a tightrope. A line between life and death.<eos> I will give you all the information that you request.
Well, you go and bring the doctor, then.<eos> And we can all pray to God that we haven't completely fried his brain.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Out!<eos> The rest of you, out now!
The East India Company?<eos> Is that the truth, little boy?<eos> You know what happens to little boys that lie, don't you?<eos> I swear, it's the truth.<eos> James is offering you a new start.
Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?
Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?<eos> Ladies, I will be back before the sandwiches.<eos> How dull life was before Musgrove.<eos> What the fuck are you doing? Coming to my house and talking of powder?
I will squash your balls myself and make you eat the paste.<eos> You promised to give me those names.<eos> Did I?<eos> I must've lied.<eos> I will tell you one thing, though.
Mr Chichester, how goes your investigation?<eos> THIS will not stand.<eos> Oh, but it will!<eos> It always does.<eos> Delaney would not make a deal with you.
You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.<eos> You have people with you?<eos> Mr Delaney, I'm sure that you're probably expecting me to hand you your letter of safe passage.
And have you spoken about all this with God?<eos> Well, I discuss things with my wife, in bed.<eos> I talk to God. I spoke to Him just now.<eos> And what did God say?<eos> Conversations between monarchs and God are private, but I will give you the gist of it.
Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.<eos> Now, go home.<eos> Everything belongs to you now.
March where?<eos> For what bloody purpose?<eos> For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.<eos> What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?
One can only imagine.<eos> Solomon Coop, your Highness.<eos> How is your TOE this morning?<eos> My toe is the first item of business.<eos> You evidently don't read the papers.
Why are you following me?<eos> To save your life.<eos> Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.
Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.<eos> Tell me about this man with the silver tooth...<eos> Winter.<eos> I can show you where he's moored, if you want.
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
Hurry up! At least he's sorting his father's debts.<eos> What I'm owed isn't in that pile of coins... since I'm not listed on the final division notice.<eos> You see?<eos> The old skinflint didn't even pay for his whores!<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
It may take a little time to validate.<eos> I can wait.<eos> But Mr Delaney's son knew nothing of any marriage.<eos> How would he?<eos> He was in Africa. But he often spoke of you.
The assassin we sent to kill Delaney is dead.<eos> The British want you dead.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
Exposed as you are, in this hell. You're weak.<eos> Men of all kinds.<eos> Your hands shackled.<eos> A key and a pen are your only weapons.<eos> So, you take this pen in your hand, you sign your name and I turn the key and you dress and you leave... with £1,000 for your trouble.
Where he leads, I will follow.<eos> Where the fuck are we?<eos> My new factory.<eos> I flagged him down at St Pancras.<eos> I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.
Except, they're not selling, at the moment.<eos> War going on. Two wars, actually.<eos> Or have we already won one of them?<eos> You're hired, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> And as for your saltpetre, I will get it for you.
There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.<eos> Miss Lorna Bow.<eos> Mrs. Lorna Delaney. And Mr. James Delaney.<eos> Judging by the horror on the faces of the ladies, you are known.<eos> Yes, and judging by the shame on the face of some of the men, so are you.
You can have her as part of the deal. Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.
I've only not known James a little while.<eos> But I have the feeling you've not known him a little longer.<eos> - We were children... - Oh!<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I were to have intentions regarding James, would I need to be wary of you?
The Gypsy woman owns this island between two parishes.<eos> It is tradition she offers duellists a little token of good luck.<eos> Three shillings each for heather and goose feathers.<eos> This is not a fairground.<eos> Gentlemen, a slight has been perceived and one of you seeks satisfaction.
Lick.<eos> Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal,<eos> I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.
Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal,<eos> I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> I know which one of you it is.
Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.
Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.<eos> Everybody's scared of you.
They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.<eos> How do they know so much?<eos> Get the chlorate.<eos> Yes?<eos> I will get you men.
For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.
Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.<eos> Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...
Offer him "full and unfettered co-operation" on behalf of the Honourable East India.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.
No, no, no.<eos> "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.
Accept what?<eos> Nootka landing ground in return for the tea trade to Canton.<eos> And safe passage through your blockade.<eos> But you must assign the treaty before you leave London.<eos> Well, that would require me to trust you.
She was deranged, James!<eos> That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam. To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.
She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
That golden age.<eos> You want to know where he is?<eos> My dear, the whole of London wants to know where he is.<eos> His Majesty's Government wants to know where he is.<eos> I'm afraid we cannot help you.
You stink of cow shit.<eos> It's horse shit, actually.<eos> We thought you might have left for good.<eos> And would that be good?<eos> I visited your sister to ask where you were.
And would that be good?<eos> I visited your sister to ask where you were.<eos> Three days and not a word?<eos> Did you think it would go unnoticed?<eos> The Company have men in every tavern asking where you are.
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
I have done much worse things than... stealing diamonds.<eos> Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account, naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading of the Cornwallis with slaves... bound for a sugar plantation in Jumby Bay, Antigua... owned by his own brother.
Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account, naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading of the Cornwallis with slaves... bound for a sugar plantation in Jumby Bay, Antigua... owned by his own brother.<eos> In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.
This is the Prince's house.<eos> You should have dragged them out on their arses.<eos> Stuart Strange is a Knight of the Realm, I could not lay<eos> - a hand on him.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?
And an element of strategy.<eos> So get to it.<eos> Arrest the bastard.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Mr. Chichester, this is the man I told you about...
All right?<eos> Now, you can do that, can't you?<eos> Right. Right.<eos> We're good. Mr. Godfrey has decided he will do the honourable thing.<eos> Your testimony will be with you within the week.
Oh, here he comes.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Me.<eos> Right.<eos> I suggest that you leave very quickly... and very, very quietly... or you can stay... for the extreme violence that is coming your way.
Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope.<eos> A line between life... and death.<eos> We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.
The places you met. Code names, signals.<eos> The location of the powder you gave them.<eos> Now, if you can give me all that and what you tell us is corroborated, then... then these people won't be needed and you will await trial in the same cell that Thomas Moore occupied, with not an unpleasant view of the River Thames.<eos> So...?<eos> I will give you all the information that you request... but in return, I will need a single meeting with
Look, do you mind? I've got a shot to make.<eos> So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.
My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...<eos> I've told you, I have nothing to say to you.
Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
Well, you don't appear to be swaggering now.<eos> I need to speak to Carlsbad himself.<eos> I need him to take a message to Thomas Jefferson and the President of the United States.<eos> In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.
So, when the carpenter comes, tell him I want all the windows boarded up and that river hatch, I want that closed too.<eos> So... we are besieged.<eos> I suppose I can use the same carpenter to board up the windows that your father used when he was under siege and he can put the same old nails in the same old holes.<eos> You can sit there with the same old gun cocked on your lap.<eos> And when you sit there with that same look of defiance on your face, I will ask you the same old question...
Splash.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.
West of Michigan, the line of the border will be determined by lawyers, which means almost certainly that Delaney can give us Vancouver.<eos> And, in return, you would sell out the East India?<eos> Settle your dispute with the King regarding Bombay and we can talk.<eos> It all seems rather neat and terribly simple to me.<eos> You do realise this whole business is about revenge.
Is that your lawyer?<eos> My lawyer assures me that, as Horace Delaney's widow, by natural law of the land, this house is therefore half mine.<eos> - It's a copy.<eos> - It's now kindling.<eos> My servant wants to shoot you in the face.
The only people who would benefit from your death are the Americans, but you're already in negotiations with the Americans, so surely once the boards have gone we could put curtains up.<eos> You seem to know such a lot for somebody who knows so very little.<eos> You should know that I am a very dangerous man.<eos> I was told that, too.<eos> And who keeps telling you all this shit?
The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.<eos> So, as you can see, it's a very simple swap, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your half of the house for my half of a piece of land that I have no interest in or use for.<eos> I also have a trunk full of your father's belongings, letters to you, to your father from your mother.
It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.
Do you drink wine?<eos> - Not before a performance.<eos> - There'll be no performance tonight.<eos> There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.
But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.<eos> - Oranges, madam.<eos> - She doesn't want fucking oranges!<eos> We all know what she wants.<eos> How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.
Very well.<eos> Your manager sold me the costume you wore when you played The Little Princess.<eos> You will wear it for me tonight.<eos> There appears to have been a misunderstanding.<eos> Somebody has given you the wrong name.
- Jesus H. Christ.<eos> - Just dial the number again.<eos> I'll talk.<eos> - Right. Copy.<eos> Thanks, Bernie. Let's assume this is happening. I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
This will get ugly.<eos> We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?<eos> All right.<eos> All right. We're gonna head to that house over there at two o'clock.<eos> All right? We're gonna work this shit out.<eos> Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?
A million dollars.<eos> For fuck's sake...<eos> - It's not a fucking joke, lady.<eos> - Uh, listen...<eos> I don't know what this guy's told you, but my organization is a nonprofit organization.
I'm sorry.<eos> You're right. I...<eos> I understand.<eos> Probably very frightening for you, and we shouldn't have dragged Robin and Susan through all this.<eos> When we get down to LA, I'm gonna get you a really nice hotel suite.
Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.
What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?<eos> You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.
You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.<eos> You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.<eos> I love you two.
I can't believe we have visitors.<eos> Oh, Caleb will be so happy to see you.<eos> It's been such a long time since he's had anyone to play with.<eos> Oh, you must be thirsty.<eos> Come on in and have a seat while I get you something to drink.
And we like him.<eos> But we need to help our town.<eos> People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.<eos> No one can help you.
They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.
Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.<eos> I'm gonna kill all of you.
It's called, "run like hell."<eos> So, leave in five?<eos> You promised you'd help us.<eos> We still need to find the rift.<eos> I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.
Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.<eos> I know where to find one and I can show you how it works.
Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.<eos> I know where to find one and I can show you how it works.<eos> I'll tell you if Malia promises not to kill me.
I can't.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.
This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.<eos> I told you how it works.
Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> He's got David.<eos> - Who's David?<eos> One of you is gonna die.
And I did.<eos> But the cops don't deal in such ambiguities.<eos> My research.<eos> Everything that's known about the tape is in there.<eos> It'll be more of a help to you than I can be.
Cash only.<eos> Checkout's at noon.<eos> It's an old house.<eos> Walls are thin.<eos> Hope you don't mind the cats.
You know what to do.<eos> Holt, it's Gabriel.<eos> I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.<eos> It's braille.<eos> I'm gonna come find you guys.
You're free, Samara.<eos> Holt. It's Gabriel.<eos> I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.<eos> It's braille.<eos> I'm gonna come find you guys.
There's far too many secret societies out there.<eos> They have no loyalty and no love.<eos> They range from barely competent to deeply dangerous.<eos> You don't sound like one of us.<eos> I'm not one of you.
Okay, that was my fault.<eos> You were one of my favorites.<eos> "You hear that, Chris?<eos> Huh?" "You're one of her favorites. Chris?"<eos> "Hey, it's Chris." "I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.
Huh?" "You're one of her favorites. Chris?"<eos> "Hey, it's Chris." "I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.<eos> Peace."<eos> Chris!<eos> "Hey, it's Chris." "I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you.
Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...<eos> Let me paint a picture of what's waiting for you on the shore.
I like him.<eos> He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Comp Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.
He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Comp Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.<eos> He is telling you there isn't one goddamn reason you shouldn't go up there right now and slit the throats of every last one of these Dutch motherfuckers and set fire to this ship!
She's dead.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Because of my dad.<eos> Let us come back into this moment.<eos> I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
Well, hello to you all.<eos> As always, it's a pleasure.<eos> When you all first got here, you... You used this, uh, piece of equipment.<eos> The questionnaire.<eos> And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.
Just listen for a second. I'm sorry.<eos> I... I don't really understand.<eos> What?<eos> You need some money?<eos> I'm here, Marius, because I heard that you were taking down a cheater.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
I had maybe done, like, two anal scenes in my entire life.<eos> So I said I would do an anal scene.<eos> But I'm not a pro at this.<eos> God bless all of the men out there that think that, you know, there's not a lot of preparation that goes into this.<eos> Let me tell you something, there... there needs to be.
In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.<eos> I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.<eos> In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
Where the hell is Justin?<eos> I don't know, Jess.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.<eos> Did he ride with you guys today?
But what happened to Justin?<eos> Why isn't he here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Porter pulled him in yesterday, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.<eos> Is everything okay with you guys?
Yeah.<eos> Females!<eos> Male!<eos> I have concluded that this school sucks!<eos> Except for you guys.
Okay.<eos> Clay, honey... I need to discuss something with you.<eos> Oh, shit, I gotta go.<eos> I'm meeting someone at Monet's for a school project.<eos> Love you guys.
- That picture's all over school.<eos> - Yeah. That can happen, can't it?<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> Anything.<eos> I'm trying to do something, anything, which is more than any of you did.
It's true.<eos> I never looked so lovely for a dance.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Hannah... you are the most beautiful woman in this family.<eos> I'd agree, but I'd be in trouble with both of you.
Yeah, see? I lost my shit.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Goddamn it, hey!<eos> Watch your language!<eos> I'm taking some fucking responsibility. Since you guys can't.
Clay.<eos> Right, right. Moving on.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Right. The auditorium.<eos> Oh, oh, but before we go... I want to show you something super cool.
Clay!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Dude, you're leaving?<eos> Uh, yeah, I kind of am.<eos> Looked like shit was happening for you in there.
So any arrangement we had is now done...<eos> Null and void.<eos> We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends. And we never met.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I owe you nothing.
Come outside.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey.<eos> So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.
Hey.<eos> So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.<eos> A bunch of us do.<eos> Enid says that you want Gregory to get us to fight the Saviors with you.
Not yet.<eos> It's one of theirs, long range.<eos> We can listen in, keep track of them.<eos> So, if we're not going back, what are we doing, then?<eos> I think it's time we introduced you to Ezekiel.
This is...<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I forgot to mention that... Yeah, a tiger.<eos> This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.
And then when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it.<eos> All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.<eos> They deserved to have their life changed for the good.... forever.<eos> I invite you all to sup with us and stay till the morrow.
It was lives, arms, legs.<eos> The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy, but it is peace.<eos> I have to hold on to it.<eos> I have to try.<eos> Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire, the King is sympathetic to your plight.
You can change his mind, but you won't.<eos> Then you can stay.<eos> We can talk.<eos> How many people do we have? To fight?<eos> I'll go with you.
So do you, I guess.<eos> Tick-tock. Chop-chop.<eos> And, Rick... if Daryl does turn up here two days from now, two months from now... hell, two years from now, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.<eos> Keep that hatchet handy.<eos> You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.
Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.<eos> Away from Tamiel.<eos> Your words now.<eos> If you join us and we beat them together, you can have much of what's theirs.<eos> Fighting with us, you'll be rewarded, more than you can imagine.
Rick... can do anything.<eos> This group?<eos> They found me... here, so far from our home.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Just tell us... we'll get it for you.

Do you want a massage?<eos> Negan loves them.<eos> And I was a licensed therapist.<eos> You know, before.<eos> Mm. While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.

While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.
You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.
I'm fine where I am.<eos> Shiva likes you.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Tell me what you found.<eos> You're not gonna like it.
I like waiting to hear bad news less.<eos> We got a little problem that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.<eos> Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.<eos> We have to cut and burn everything before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.<eos> I know the royal garden is important to you.
It's possible.<eos> It's real.<eos> It's happening now.<eos> And the problems have to end...now.<eos> You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.
It's happening now.<eos> And the problems have to end...now.<eos> You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> We'll get you twice the tribute in an hour.
Benjamin, get your gun up.<eos> It was supposed to be me.<eos> That's what Gavin said -- that I'd be first.<eos> I was trying to stop it.<eos> I was gonna give my life to show you!
He blocked the road yesterday, made us late.<eos> And we had your offering when we left -- had it all.<eos> He took one from the cargo, and he hid it -- when we stopped.<eos> He wanted to get something started between the Kingdom and the Saviors.<eos> Wanted to show you...

Shit you not.<eos> Oh! Almost forgot.<eos> Set that down.<eos> Well, fair is fair.<eos> We're not leaving you high and dry when it comes to medical solutions.
Eugene, get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> Eugene!<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead".<eos> Get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Just talk to them, okay?<eos> It's not over!<eos> They've forgotten.<eos> You've all forgotten.<eos> Some of you actually want to fight them?
Everyone, shots within 10 feet of the line.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now!<eos> No.<eos> We're not fighting them with you.
Yeah, we do.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.
But I trust Daryl.<eos> Negan's coming soon.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Three trucks probably. 20 saviors and him.<eos> I can slow them down, bring some trees down in the road, buy a little time for you guys to get ready.
But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours. And after what he did...<eos> He stepped up.<eos> You people...<eos> Are animals. Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
And that started it all... From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm, to the prison, to here... to this moment now...<eos> Not as strangers...<eos> As family... because Glenn chose to be there for you that day a long time ago.<eos> That was the decision that changed everything.<eos> It started with both of you, and it just grew... To all of us...
- I got a...<eos> - Do not fucking move!<eos> I got a fucking permit for the gun! - Alvey Kulina.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> I fucking train you guys.
- Shut up.<eos> I fucking train you guys.<eos> Look in my wallet.<eos> Do not speak unless I ask you to.<eos> - I train you guys.
Sorry about the gun.<eos> You know, it's dangerous.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Why don't you guys come down to the gym?<eos> I'll give you a... give you some training for free, yeah?
But listen.<eos> No... No... No disrespect.<eos> II've enjoyed my time here.<eos> Thank you guys so much.<eos> It's been a privilege and an honor to fight in front of you.
Oh, I don't know, mom...<eos> Why someone might Chuck a rock through our window?<eos> I could explain, but why?<eos> So you could tell your big city friends what a terrible place... It is where you grew up?<eos> Not one of you cares where a carrot comes from. Or how much work goes into those cold-pressed drinks... That you pay 20 bucks for.
Emmita, Que Alegría Verte.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, uh, it's time for dinner.<eos> I think your mom is expecting you.<eos> Come on, guys, I'll walk you home.
! It stinks of Rick.<eos> No!<eos> Why? !<eos> Why would you do that? !<eos> W-W-What is the matter with you people?
This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.<eos> For everybody.<eos> I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out.<eos> I will leave you two to your adventures.
And that's the car dealership.<eos> Haven't you left her a million messages already?<eos> Has she answered one?<eos> Not with words.<eos> Oh, for heaven sakes, how do you kids feel about the house?
Oh, for heaven sakes, how do you kids feel about the house?<eos> - It's great.<eos> - Nice windows.<eos> It's really open. The feng shui is all right.<eos> But more importantly, do you like it?
Nobody's buying any paintings.<eos> I don't mean "nobody," I mean you people.<eos> No family can buy art.<eos> I don't want any part of your pity ponchos or your pity purchases.<eos> If you love a piece, I will give it to you free of charge.
Allison's great.<eos> Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.<eos> Oh, we know, she told us about that condition.<eos> Fuck you all.<eos> I like her more than I like you people right now.
She had everything. Now she has to work so hard to prove she didn't end up like this.<eos> Yeah, it's a real shame.<eos> Poor Grace.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> I'm so glad you're enjoying Frankie's art, but if you could perhaps keep the cruelty to a minimum.
We are not partners.<eos> That... This...<eos> - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital. Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.
This isn't that.<eos> I'm sorry. Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> He said pretty girls should only open their mouths - when they see a dick. - Oh.<eos> And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick? Enough.
If there was a God, I'd thank him for that.<eos> There is a God, and he shines.<eos> If there was a God, my son would still be alive.<eos> I'll call you when I get a name.<eos> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.

Quetiapine.<eos> You're a judge.<eos> Please make them stop.<eos> I... sincerely wish you the best of luck, Mr. Brody.<eos> And the spirit I will put within you will take away the stony heart out of your flesh.
Drags you down in the morning...<eos> That ravenous hole in your heart.<eos> Is it loneliness? Is it sadness? Is it lust?<eos> Jesus said, "Blessed are those" "who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."<eos> When you find Jesus, Those empty places inside you will be filled with His love.
You got a platoon full of fucking kids, and I got a dead son.<eos> They're already lining up the firing squad for me.<eos> The future of my entire family is at stake, and now you want me to disavow my past?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You got Harris Park, the Harris Building, half the streets in this city.
Which agency?<eos> I can't say that here in an open hearing, sir.<eos> You saved me. Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> It's these same criminals that cozied up to the Chinese communists and armed the most radical jihadis and turned our borders into Swiss cheese and committed every sin you can think of, like spreading hepatitis C and protecting the big banks
You saved me. Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> It's these same criminals that cozied up to the Chinese communists and armed the most radical jihadis and turned our borders into Swiss cheese and committed every sin you can think of, like spreading hepatitis C and protecting the big banks<eos> and starting all these illegal black-ops wars that have killed millions of people!<eos> These same criminal elements have now doubled-down on Zika virus and other diseases, hawking this dirty blood like... Like they did with AIDS, this tainted blood, so they can turn around and sell you a cure for 50 grand!
Nobody wants to be a whistle-blower.<eos> Whatever you give us, we use only as a threat.<eos> Keep him in line.<eos> You threaten, you have to be ready to follow through.<eos> Plus whatever I tell you, Saul Berenson gets caught in the crossfire.
Dar Adal.<eos> That's who got Javadi to change his story in the first place.<eos> Dar Adal.<eos> You know, he sat right there earlier today and lied to me about this all over again, that obsequious little shit!<eos> What is it with you people?
And how is um-- how is Shaw and-- and Dario?<eos> They haven't been in here, either-- not for the longest time.<eos> - I'm not in, uh... anymore...<eos> No?<eos> Well, it has not been the same around here without you guys.
For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.<eos> Just don't expect to change his.<eos> Whatever happened to government of the people, by the people, for the people?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
In time, Lord.<eos> - Freedom would be my first choice. - Who do you serve?<eos> The brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.<eos> They've gone to fight the Scots.<eos> I beg you, Lord, he will be my income.
And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.<eos> You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?<eos> We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.
You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?<eos> We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.<eos> We will give you food and shelter and thanks, Lord Uhtred.
Then he would be prepared to raise an army against Kjartan?<eos> He would be an ally, I'm sure.<eos> As I'm sure Uhtred is, but one man, against many...<eos> No, no, Uhtred is more than just one man, and he is here for a reason.<eos> I have come to wish you goodnight, Lord.
This one. One of my best.<eos> You like him?<eos> He's very strong.<eos> Very young.<eos> Something for you, huh?
If they're not men, what are they?<eos> Please, to speak of them may summon them.<eos> From where?<eos> - You tell me nothing.<eos> - Can we not simply give you the silver and be on our way, Lord, please?
Odin would forgive me, I'm sure of it.<eos> I will be a changed man. I...<eos> You will never change!<eos> - You cannot change! - Lord!<eos> Lord, I beg you.
That he fears you is enough.<eos> Let him take that fear to Kjartan.<eos> May we free the prisoners, Lord, search the pens for a friend, the king?<eos> You may.<eos> I have no business with you.
Guthred!<eos> Guthred!<eos> We are looking for Guthred of Cumbraland, - son of Harthacnut.<eos> - I am Guthred.<eos> - How can I help you? - Lord...
Who is there?<eos> Name yourself.<eos> If you are on this land, you will know who I am.<eos> You will know not to harm me.<eos> The priest tells me it is you I must thank for my freedom.
- Then you owe me.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.<eos> Serve me.<eos> - Serve you?
Oh, last night I was still a slave.<eos> Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.<eos> But also the brothers and the man who stole my land.<eos> My own uncle!<eos> That, I owe you...
Beocca, they love me!<eos> Because they have no idea what a fool you are!<eos> Be careful, priest, or he will have your head.<eos> Not before he feels my boot!<eos> And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!
It is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert appeared in a dream, a glorious dream.<eos> - Abbot, please...<eos> - He showed me your face... and he called you King.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you sure... that it was not this face here that you saw?
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian, I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
No, I don't even really know him that well.<eos> He's... he's just my neighbor.<eos> His house is over there.<eos> That's strange.<eos> He said specifically he was waiting very eagerly to get his hands on you.
Goodbye, Violet.<eos> Goodbye, Klaus.<eos> Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here.<eos> I'll still check in on you occasionally.
Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here.<eos> I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.<eos> Well, children, before I give you a tour of your new home, aren't you going to say "How do you do?" to your new guardian?
Really?<eos> Did you help around the house?<eos> That's great.<eos> Well, welcome to your lucky life.<eos> Come with me, and I'll show you the delightful features of your home.
Baudelaires.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> We meant to come sooner.<eos> We've been cleaning.<eos> Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.
If you might use my library.<eos> Is there any book you're looking for in particular?<eos> A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.
But there is a local open-air market and gin distillery.<eos> Thanks again for taking us.<eos> I don't know what we would have done without you.<eos> Oh, you're resourceful children.<eos> I daresay you would have thought of something.
Or maybe, just maybe, you were supposed to get out.<eos> He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.<eos> I've seen more than my fair share of snares.<eos> You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind.<eos> Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you, I suspect we'll be seeing each other again soon enough.
Free advice:<eos> if you bump into one of our kind, assume that they are BPO collaborators.<eos> Be particularly suspicious if you hear about their daring escape from The Rock in Iceland, while also appearing live on stage at an underground EDM concert.<eos> He doesn't trust us either.<eos> - Can you blame me?
I know sometimes I say things I shouldn't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I would ask the same thing.<eos> You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.
I never understood the word "presence" until we were together.<eos> And if you're wondering about the sex... no matter what I say, it won't be enough.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> And what about now?<eos> What's it like when one of you is in pain?
- Hey.<eos> - Mommy, guess what.<eos> Daddy Lance missed us so much, he even made us pancakes on his way to work.<eos> Isn't that nice of him?<eos> I said I came to see you.
Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...<eos> Katie, no.<eos> If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?<eos> Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy.<eos> As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.
What are you doing here?<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> We gotta go. Why?<eos> It's just a power outage.<eos> Your father called and he asked me to pick you kids up.
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Thank you, Commander.<eos> - Thank you, guys.<eos> - She's beautiful, Sho.<eos> Thank you!
- Honored to oblige.<eos> Just as soon as you pass the test.<eos> - Of course there's a test.<eos> - As you know, only a child of earth can wear the crown of the high king.<eos> I will ask you a series of questions designed to root out all pretenders to the throne.
See?<eos> We're gonna have so much to talk about.<eos> Let's... Why don't we say tonight?<eos> Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
- No, that's disgusting!<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> If you haven't screwed a 40-year-old, you haven't screwed.<eos> Your turn, Lola.<eos> What will I tell you?
You have to tell us something real.<eos> Come on, tell us something.<eos> Come on, tell us.<eos> Something heavy.<eos> I did something you couldn't imagine.
Zack, you okay?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> I couldn't kill him.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just wanted to give you guys the good news.
It's not a baby alligator.<eos> It's not gonna bite ya.<eos> - I said don't rush me.<eos> - Oh, don't rush her, it's comin' on Christmas.<eos> Oh, my Lord, will you look at that?
So we're just supposed - to give up on her?<eos> - I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.
Brennan the beetle,<eos> Cam the caterpillar.<eos> Yeah, we're all in it.<eos> It's-it's about us.<eos> Cam has something to tell you both.
Yeah, we're all in it.<eos> It's-it's about us.<eos> Cam has something to tell you both.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... I haven't been completely honest with you guys, because it wasn't official, but, um...
- Randy, please.<eos> - I really don't like what's happening.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You are so in your head right now.<eos> What's happening to you is irrelevant to me.
Not to mention the fact that Ian owned a 55% stake in their company, so he didn't need Kate's permission to sell. Ugh.<eos> What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.<eos> And even if the NFL doesn't hire me, I love being at the Jeffersonian.<eos> And working with all of you.
It's what gives it its luster.<eos> - Mayonnaise.<eos> - Now don't judge.<eos> It sounds tasty.<eos> Now I'm gonna give you some advice. Does it involve condiments?
I had a friend once, Cami.<eos> She, uh... she believed with all her heart that you had some good left in you.<eos> And I don't understand why it is you are so hell-bent on proving her wrong.<eos> You let me go.<eos> I gave you people what you wanted.
No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Almost there.<eos> We'll give you guns and show you how to use them.
You said his lungs were fine.<eos> No.<eos> I said I thought so.<eos> It's possible a bone fragment could've lodged in the tissue.<eos> I'll give you time to decide.
Now I need you to honor your promise to protect my people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was before your people shot me and killed my Commander.<eos> We just saved your damn life.<eos> Roan, your people are hungry for you to lead them.
You haven't been home in more than 3 years.<eos> You act as if that was my choice.<eos> Of course it wasn't.<eos> You were a bargaining chip.<eos> It almost broke your mother to send you away.
It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.<eos> Then I'll get new war chiefs.<eos> The army is loyal to them, not you.
Then I'll get new war chiefs.<eos> The army is loyal to them, not you.<eos> And who are you loyal to... Spy?<eos> I'm loyal to my clan, to my king.<eos> Let me serve you.
The army is loyal to them, not you.<eos> And who are you loyal to... Spy?<eos> I'm loyal to my clan, to my king.<eos> Let me serve you.<eos> I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.
Welcome back to the coalition.<eos> Time to go.<eos> We'll do our best to keep the king on his throne.<eos> We'll find a way to beat the radiation.<eos> If either of you screw this up, we die.
And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric, like a drug addict or an alcoholic.<eos> It's not about "thin enough," right?<eos> There's no "thin enough." It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.<eos> And we give you a lot of rope here.
Women generally wanna spend time with somebody they date.<eos> Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.<eos> Yeah, I guess it does.<eos> Lobo also tells me that you and Luke aren't speaking.<eos> It seemed like you and Luke had something good going.
I'm... I'm FBI. Okay?<eos> This man is a federal witness under my protection. I just sent a distress code to the FBI field office.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> My head is spinning right now.<eos> Marius, is this... is this part of the plan, or are you just making this shit up as you go along?
The real kicker was Joseph discovering that Mukherjee was a federal informant and his bodyguard is FBI.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Otto: It's too late.<eos> The money's gone.<eos> I'll take you home.
This is Atwood's Wi-Fi password.<eos> Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.<eos> Well, you got her password.<eos> That saves me about an hour.<eos> The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...
Whom did you say they were going to replace?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Skuttle, they're ready for you.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> What can I get you folks?
Well it's a cross-country blood race with no racing.<eos> It's a mood piece.<eos> Let all compromise within you see inside of you.<eos> All choice lies within your own consciousness.<eos> It's entirely up to you.
You're good as new.<eos> Here.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Say hello to Christopher 2.0.<eos> Tell you what, let me do my job, and I'll pretend this little interrogation never happened.
What are you going to do about it, hmm?<eos> Ooh, right where it all began.<eos> So what?<eos> Your little town was boring.<eos> You ask me, I gave you a clean slate.
Ooh... ah! They're coming!<eos> They're coming...<eos> Get in there.<eos> Look, uh, I used to resist all my urges too, but... not anymore.<eos> It's dangerous, you know, 'cause these... these urges, they keep growing inside you.
It's dangerous, you know, 'cause these... these urges, they keep growing inside you.<eos> Swelling... until you can't control them anymore.<eos> You don't know us at all.<eos> But I do.<eos> I know that you think you're destined to be alone, but don't you see that special person is standing right beside you.
But I do.<eos> I know that you think you're destined to be alone, but don't you see that special person is standing right beside you.<eos> Ahh... And there's no... no one judging here.<eos> I see how you look at each other.<eos> All you have to do is just get close and then...
I don't mind at all.<eos> Exactly how stupid... do you think I am?<eos> Pretty fuckin' stupid.<eos> This is what happens when you double-cross me.<eos> I might not be able to blow you up, but let's see what happens if I fry your brains for an hour or so.
Sort of the way a left-brain, right-brain work together. You know, you're tough and street-smart, and sort of, uh... a murderer.<eos> Good morning, Blood Drivers.<eos> Forgive my absence.<eos> Last night's excitement left me in a sticky situation.<eos> Pretty sure that some of you out there might just be able to relate, but this morning we begin with the most frightening words in all of Blood Drive:
- Yeah, got it.<eos> Um, all right, well, thanks for the wash and wax, but I have places to be, so where's Arthur?<eos> Is Arthur your male?<eos> No, he is not my male.<eos> He is my partner, and we have a rehab facility to get to, so if you ladies don't mind...
Never seen tech like this.<eos> Hey, be careful with those.<eos> If they power back up, they can explode.<eos> These things are right against your spine.<eos> Who did this to you?
You saved my life.<eos> When were you in danger?<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> Besides... this town needs a new sheriff.<eos> Good luck, you two.
How many more people will they kill while we wait?<eos> Make the call.<eos> I got to get a better view.<eos> Now, if the racers would please line up at the front of the stage...<eos> As some of you know, we had a few quitters last year.
You don't want to touch me.<eos> Encanto.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Encanto.<eos> It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
Join me and my son!<eos> Jace Wayland is a traitor.<eos> You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement.<eos> Encanto.<eos> It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
- None of this is your fault.<eos> Alec, he's stressed out.<eos> With his parabatai gone, he's like a different person.<eos> Alec's right.<eos> I'm not one of you.
You go on.<eos> I have a few things Camille never returned after one of our many breakups. I wanna find them.<eos> So you're not going to help me find her?<eos> I Portaled you to India.<eos> The rest of your sire squabble is all on you.
Why aren't you getting ready?<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I'm not going through with it.<eos> That's hysterical.<eos> Whatever happened between you two, why don't you just kiss and make up?
What do you mean he won't be here?<eos> He's tied up with the Valentine task force in Idris.<eos> I can't believe Dad would miss this.<eos> He doesn't have a choice.<eos> We're all on high alert, especially after what that demon did to both of you and Jocelyn.
Why Izzy?<eos> What does a Greater Demon want with her?<eos> I'm not sure...<eos> I think I know who we could ask.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about... but it's so nice to see the both of you.
Come on.<eos> He's a Daylighter.<eos> Damn right I am.<eos> Okay, open.<eos> I kind of booked a show for you.
That's what they think.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I can help you track him.<eos> Take her out.<eos> I told you not to engage!
Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable Intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.<eos> I told you.
- One more thing.<eos> - Yeah. What's up?<eos> You put your hands on me like that one more time, and I'll kick your ass.<eos> Good talk.<eos> Ooh! This is why I usually leave the punching to you guys.
I'm sorry, Tina.<eos> Aw, so sweet.<eos> I thought you two were just Cop buddies, but... you can tell me, Vin.<eos> You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?<eos> I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.
Yes.<eos> We're gonna talk about that.<eos> Right now, we need to focus on finding the others.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I wish I knew so I could tell you to go screw yourselves.
Feels like a lifetime ago.<eos> For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for Nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?
One of my goals is to take a more active role in decorating our apartment, if that's cool with you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I mean, mi casa es su casa.<eos> It's kind of Randy's casa now too, huh? Since he's there all the time.<eos> How's it going with you guys?
I know what's going on. I know you're getting a divorce.<eos> God damn it, Gus. Really?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> He didn't tell me!<eos> I can hear you guys!
Are you serious?<eos> He didn't tell me!<eos> I can hear you guys!<eos> I'm not stupid!<eos> I heard you. I heard both of you.
Right.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Hi, guys!<eos> - Hey!<eos> So good to see the two of you together... still.
Like, you send crickets or something?<eos> No, you brought up crickets, and I had brought up the three days, and that was the connection.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> No, I thought it maybe was an Australian thing or something.<eos> When I heard we were merging with you guys at Subzero, I was so excited, 'cause you bring that real East Coast energy to the table,
Poll time.<eos> Sucking on a woman's tits.<eos> Is it for guy's pleasure? Or is it for the woman?<eos> I think both, but tweet at me with your thoughts and feelings.<eos> Also, I'm not getting nearly enough stories from you guys about hooking up in Ubers, and I'm really disappointed.
Oh, yeah, no, I won't... I won't take up much of your time.<eos> Guys, I just, um...<eos> Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how things kinda got ugly there.<eos> And I just also wanted to say thank you so much for listening to my ideas on the Arctic movie.<eos> So, um, just wanted to give you this, uh, map of the North Pole... - just in case it inspires anything for your movie.
Yeah, get back to it.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> Yeah... What's going on, Gus?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Before I go, I just wanted to let you know I was actually able to rejigger some of my schedule, and I think I'll be able to go to New York now.
Hi. Hi, Quentin.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you today.<eos> Well, you know, that's the thing about rehab.<eos> It's a long process, and then it ain't, and by the looks of that assistant out there, you need me back bad.<eos> How about I give you guys a moment?
We're looking for a U.S. general that has gone rogue.<eos> We have reason to believe he's trying to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.<eos> What concern is that of yours?<eos> Are you gonna help me find this man or not?<eos> After business with Leonov, just me sitting with you squares us with Gregor, yes?
How do we think the council's gonna vote?<eos> It's... it's a pretty even split with Kullens as the swing vote.<eos> Hold on!<eos> My target's the mayor and his corruption.<eos> He surrenders, I'll let the rest of you live.
- Curtis' balls.<eos> They're something really fascinating of my own personal invention.<eos> I realized that quantum computation could be used to harness the...<eos> Ok. Look.<eos> Forget I asked. I'll bring you guys the visor, ok?
Hey, stop.<eos> Mr. Queen, you do not have floor.<eos> Just give me 10 seconds.<eos> Listen to what I have to say.<eos> If you don't like it, shoot me.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
Uh, no.<eos> You're right.<eos> Ok.<eos> So quid pro quo.<eos> I help you, you help me.
And he just told me that his operation was nearly compromised by my team.<eos> Well, I said, "that's impossible.<eos> The team no longer exists."<eos> The hell it doesn't!<eos> When I told you to stand down, I meant it.
Yeah, with right medicine, yes, but even Bratva cannot buy for them, not in quantities needed.<eos> All we can do is pay for funerals.<eos> Anatoly, is this how we're planning on spending my last two days in Russia?<eos> I thought, what better way to cap off your time here than a good old-fashioned heist?<eos> If Diggle's the new Oliver and I'm, obviously, the new Felicity... don't hate... Which one of you guys is the new Diggle?
John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the... The Bratva was the best option, but John insists that as a team, we can find another way to bring Chase to justice.<eos> You've put your faith in me, and I'm putting my faith in you now.
And we'd be going in completely blind.<eos> We have a greater chance of success if we let Helix come to us.<eos> Wait, Lyla.<eos> You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.
You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.<eos> This is our chance to take them down.<eos> This is happening with or without your help.<eos> I'll let you boys wrap your head around that.
You have spent a decade dealing with horrors that most people don't even realize exist, and the fact that that didn't turn you into a monster proves exactly the kind of person that you are.<eos> I don't know what kind of person I am.<eos> Hey.<eos> Curtis? Not just Curtis.<eos> Are you guys ok?
Oliver, Oliver.<eos> Curtis, Oliver's down.<eos> We need your help!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Coming to you.
- Club soda.<eos> - All right.<eos> You got it.<eos> Look at you with the nice wrapping. Thank you.<eos> Thank you all so much for doing this.
You know the Catholics consider purgatory to be... The immediate state following physical death?<eos> Konstantin, when I kill you this time,<eos> I'm gonna make sure you're dead.<eos> When we're done, the only person you'd want to kill is yourself.<eos> I'm just saying you could've taken a big knife and cut the tension between you two.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll warn the others.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You too.
Yeah, yeah, I heard.<eos> I kind of got a little problem.<eos> What kind of problem?<eos> I think I had a break-in in my repair shop.<eos> You don't suppose you and Sergeant Wu could come over and check things out?
It's our lives, not some game!<eos> Best to be completely honest, don't you think?<eos> There's nothing honest about that.<eos> Your highness, are we free to go?<eos> Oh yes. It seems one of you already has.
I know. It was just a one-time thing.<eos> I went out with a couple of friends - and got a little carried away.<eos> - It's understandable.<eos> Clary told me what happened.<eos> Listen, I just want you to know, whatever's going on between you two, I'm always here for you.
That's not true...<eos> I sent you to Edom because you were out of control.<eos> - I was out of control.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So you were saying that Luke introduced the two of you?
OK.<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> You told Magnus about the Soul Sword. Didn't you?<eos> That bad.<eos> Milady, I now present to you Magnus Bane and Lucian Greymark.
The job is too big to go alone.<eos> We need to ask for help.<eos> From who, Alec?<eos> From everyone.<eos> After the night is through, you're gonna wish you had these.
Sorry, it was a long night with the new cubs.<eos> Where is Meliorn?<eos> The Queen will be attending this very special meeting in his place.<eos> And exactly how do you know that? She told me.<eos> And I'd suggest you both cozy up to her, sooner rather than later.
No.<eos> No, not at all. That's all water under the b...<eos> Your Highness, I'm here on business.<eos> That whole moving out against the Clave thing that could lead to war.<eos> I ask that you please reconsider.
Where is the Queen? !<eos> Her Majesty will be along shortly, just as soon as she's dealt with a more pressing matter.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> So good to see you once again.
And how do you know that?<eos> My eyes and ears are everywhere.<eos> But there are certain things only a girlfriend would know.<eos> The Downworld is on the brink of annihilation if Valentine gets to that lake.<eos> As much as I would love to talk to you about Simon, I really need to get back.
You're my squeaky wheel.<eos> And you were magnificent.<eos> Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.<eos> And a man feeds his family!<eos> I'm taking you all to dinner!
Oh, we're fine, Sue.<eos> This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!<eos> - Ooh, can we eat there?<eos> - No, that's a titty bar now, Bill.<eos> Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
Did we order something already?<eos> I invited a few friends to celebrate with us. Oh.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> How crude we'd be if we didn't. Hey-hey!<eos> Congratulations, both of you.
And a fetching one at that.<eos> I dare say Scott was the prettiest chorus girl the Triangle Club has ever had.<eos> Prettier than I am?<eos> I was as pretty as you are, and you're as handsome as me.<eos> We're two of a kind. Yes, although only one of you was propositioned by a pair of Princeton linemen.
Look at you.<eos> - Oh, please, stop.<eos> You sure you don't wanna stay?<eos> I can't. I have a psych thing to go to.<eos> You guys have fun, though.
With each breath, you are letting go of the stress.<eos> The chaos of the day.<eos> Any negativity.<eos> Now breathe deeply.<eos> Feel your body beneath you.
No, I'd love to.<eos> Well, first, I'd like to say thank you for having me.<eos> You've all made me feel so welcome and included.<eos> When the truth is I often feel outside things in my normal life.<eos> I'd like to say thank you for this incredible space. And your energy.
I feel more like myself than I felt in a long time.<eos> Because I can be honest and there's no judgment or expectation.<eos> ♪ I swear that I ♪ You guys don't know my stories, my past.<eos> All the history.<eos> So I get to be me in this room, with you, all of you.
This is not who I want to be, Jean.<eos> Look, I can't lose you... or Dolly.<eos> It doesn't compare, nothing compares.<eos> And I promise, I'm gonna be all in.<eos> I'll commit to you entirely.
And I...<eos> I don't get lost much anyway.<eos> So, what happens to us after we're processed?<eos> Oh, well,<eos> I mean, I don't wanna send you ladies out to slaughter, but, I mean, you get this squared away, you get supplied, and off you go.
But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Cheer.<eos> Brave men, all of you.
No.<eos> We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.<eos> If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.<eos> With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.<eos> I never properly thanked you for that.

If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.<eos> Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.<eos> But if you let me live, I will serve you well.<eos> I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.<eos> Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.<eos> As King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy.<eos> He sounds like quite a man.<eos> Summon Jon Snow.<eos> Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
- No, too dangerous.<eos> - But?<eos> But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?<eos> If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she'll destroy the realm as we know it.<eos> Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.
Maester Cressen discovered. Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.<eos> This is quite advanced.<eos> And beyond our skills, ser.<eos> Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.<eos> As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.
This is quite advanced.<eos> And beyond our skills, ser.<eos> Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.<eos> As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.<eos> How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.<eos> The city will fall within a day.<eos> If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.<eos> It's called war.<eos> You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.
The nobles loved her.<eos> And what is left of her now?<eos> Ashes.<eos> Commoners, nobles, they're all just children, really.<eos> They won't obey you unless they fear you.
And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.<eos> Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.<eos> Do I have your support?<eos> You have mine.<eos> Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?<eos> I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.<eos> But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.
I never asked for it.<eos> But I accepted it because the North is my home.<eos> It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.<eos> But the odds are against us.<eos> None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.
You don't belong down here.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> We haven't ever talked... properly.<eos> I wanted to remedy that.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.
Not even "thank you"?<eos> If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.<eos> You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.<eos> I love Sansa, as I loved her mother.<eos> Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.
Father got careless.<eos> That's what Mama says.<eos> Will you shut up about Mama?<eos> "Mama, Mama, Mama."<eos> Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.
A boy in every port?<eos> A boy, a girl.<eos> Depends on the port.<eos> Could we get some more?<eos> I thought it wasn't for you.
Whatever my queen commands.<eos> He'll be my advisor, my protector.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Your protector.<eos> So, if someone gets too close to you...
Maybe it wasn't the same sentence.<eos> It was the same breath.<eos> Might have been a runon sentence.<eos> God, you know, I should thank you.<eos> I should thank both of you.
Stay as long as you like.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'.<eos> Nonsense. Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.
I know that man out there;<eos> I've seen the aftermath of what he's capable of.<eos> If we wanna have any chance of surviving this, we need to get our heads on straight and start working together.<eos> I say we do some recon and we figure a way outta here.<eos> Unless you got any better ideas?
I know you think I'm crazy.<eos> I'm not by the way, but this guy is.<eos> Whatcha doing, bud?<eos> Whoever's out there, I want to talk.<eos> Six of you did all of this?
You're a virtual tour guide.<eos> That falls under the umbrella of not wanting to be a tour guide.<eos> - On we go.<eos> - My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.
- On we go.<eos> - My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.<eos> It was my love of science that allowed me to overcome my tough upbringing and join S.T.A.R. Labs, before our beautiful and handsome founder, Harrison Wells, stepped down.<eos> I hope my love of science will inspire some among you to join the scientific community.
So that gives us four months to figure out how to stop Savitar.<eos> I swear, on both my parents' lives, I will protect you.<eos> We can't do this alone, Barry.<eos> Hey, guys, um...<eos> Iris and I, um... we have something we need to tell you.
My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you, but after years of hard work and studying, I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> - I hope my love of science...<eos> - Should we go talk to him?<eos> Will inspire some among you to join the scientific community as we strive to reach a new age for humanity.
You know that, right?<eos> I know.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> I got you guys a plant.
That's like a standard housewarming gift, right?<eos> - Yes, perfect.<eos> - Not on my Earth.<eos> - On my Earth, we get reptiles. - Whoa.<eos> I present to you McSnurtle... the turtle.
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> - How are you gonna tell Dad?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> If you guys got something going on, I hope you know you can talk to me.
Get him to Iron Heights.<eos> Stone...<eos> - Who's Stone?<eos> - Stone... that was the other cop.<eos> And let me tell you, she loves her perp walks.
How?<eos> As soon as the team lost contact with you, Cisco came to my Earth and told me what was happening.<eos> I came here to help.<eos> Let's get Wally.<eos> 'Fraid I can't let you do that.
This is exciting.<eos> It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.<eos> What do you want with Supergirl?<eos> Same thing that I want with both of you.
It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.<eos> What do you want with Supergirl?<eos> Same thing that I want with both of you.<eos> To teach you all a lesson.
And, you, all those rainy nights watching Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra with Mom.<eos> Well, where else would we be?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Swing and a miss.<eos> I didn't tell you.
- Millie.<eos> - Millie, right.<eos> Yeah, she's in there, all right.<eos> Now, you two listen to me.<eos> Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.
Now, you two listen to me.<eos> Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.<eos> Oh, yeah, we promise.<eos> Word to the wise.<eos> You go digging around in this dirt... you might not like what you find.
You got a problem with that?<eos> No.<eos> I love musicals, so...<eos> Okay...<eos> Look, Dads, there's something that... I need to tell you.
♪ And the strong arms ♪ ♪ To carry you away ♪<eos> ♪ Away ♪<eos> ♪ And the strong arms ♪ ♪ To carry you... ♪ ♪ Away ♪<eos> Thanks for telling us the truth, baby.<eos> I love you both so much.
is that strong enough to save them?<eos> You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in, you can go get them yourselves.<eos> You have that power.<eos> How?<eos> Ah, I can't tell you.
You have that power.<eos> How?<eos> Ah, I can't tell you.<eos> Sorry, you gotta figure it out yourself.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna just chill in this wonderfully decorated little cell of yours.
Cisco, do you really think that cell is gonna just, like, hold me?<eos> No, I'm sorry... what's going on?<eos> Why did you do this to us?<eos> I did it because I believe in the good guys.<eos> I told you when we first met.
No, I'm sorry... what's going on?<eos> Why did you do this to us?<eos> I did it because I believe in the good guys.<eos> I told you when we first met.<eos> It was to teach all of you a lesson.
Love, Supergirl.<eos> Love is about... letting yourself be saved.<eos> It's not just about saving other people.<eos> Even if you are superheroes.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.
Well, her name is Supergirl.<eos> It's kind of implied, right?<eos> Well, we better be getting going.<eos> I promised Kara's sister we'd get her back in one piece.<eos> We couldn't have done this without you. - Thank you.
Yeah, we're interested.<eos> When?<eos> First weekend in July.<eos> Um, July.<eos> Y... does that not work for you guys?
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.<eos> As in hocus pocus?<eos> He's certainly got a lot of tricks.<eos> Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.<eos> Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.<eos> Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.<eos> To do the same thing?<eos> Why? He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.<eos> Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here, I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
You can't go after him alone.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?<eos> Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.<eos> I don't trust you guys anymore.
You hadn't visited Iris in years.<eos> Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all. I mean...
And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all. I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
I heard what you said.<eos> And you were right.<eos> Iris wouldn't have wanted this.<eos> She would have wanted us to stay a family.<eos> I broke that promise to her... to all of you.
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.<eos> I never loved any of you.
Hello.<eos> Harry.<eos> Kid, Joe.<eos> Iris.<eos> What brings you folk to this section of the multiverse?
It won't fail.<eos> It's ready.<eos> You didn't have that the last time, - so we have the upper hand now.<eos> - Mm-hmm. All right.<eos> You guys figure out what your plan is.
Matt, look out!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You finished your assignment.<eos> Sybil's done with all of you now.
I need you to tell me what this is.<eos> It's a cipher device used for code-breaking.<eos> When the door between this world and Cade's gets cracked open, it wipes out everything.<eos> All you got to do is make sure that bell rings 12 times.<eos> The task I gave both of you was kill 100 people or kill your brother's girl.
Ah. Admit it.<eos> I did pretty good.<eos> Now... you got to have a bottle of bourbon stashed in here somewhere. I say we grab that, exchange a few half-assed apologies for all the crappy things we've done to each other... and make a plan to kill the devil.<eos> Yeah, sorry to interrupt.<eos> But what if I told you I had a better idea?
You were in hell?<eos> Yeah, you killed me.<eos> I think I'm on the wait list for heaven, but they're not returning my calls.<eos> You said you had a better idea than killing Cade with this dagger.<eos> Find a way to get me out of hell, all the way, and then I'll help you kill Cade.
I love this dress.<eos> We look so pretty.<eos> How did you...?<eos> These could've fallen on you.<eos> What have I been telling you?
You felt that way about Elena.<eos> I need Stefan just as much as she needed you.<eos> And Lizzie and Josie need him, too.<eos> Enough about Stefan already.<eos> What you guys need is someone who can explain to you what's going on with your Gemini coven twins. I feel like there's someone around here who could help you with that, but I just can't quite put my finger on it.
Cade, take me.<eos> Enough from the angel on his shoulder.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, Damon.<eos> This exact choice has defined your life since the moment you and your brother first laid eyes on Elena.<eos> Being torn between the two has only brought both of you an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering.
I put some champagne on ice.<eos> Bon, what's wrong?<eos> I just spoke to Kai.<eos> You didn't destroy hell.<eos> In fact, thanks to you killing Cade, hell's never been in better hands.
Interesting choice of venue.<eos> My, my, how the tide has turned. What's this, celestial enemies' night out? Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.<eos> There's something that we need to tell you.<eos> Ooh, some sort of supernatural intervention, is it?<eos> Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans you two have got cooking up, 'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy for you to spoil things.
Plenty of seats.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> As most of you know, Phase One of Project V is nearly complete.
You're here to recruit us.<eos> You already got Mary playing your game.<eos> You want me.<eos> And Sam.<eos> Well, I don't, but the old lads have taken quite a shine to you.
Headmistress.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Timothy,<eos> Michael, you have both conquered many trials here at kendricks, either through natural talent or good old-fashioned hard work.<eos> But today, today we'll learn which of you matriculates to the next level of training.
But today, today we'll learn which of you matriculates to the next level of training.<eos> This organization does important work, gentlemen...<eos> Work which allows millions of people to sleep safely in their beds at night.<eos> But in order to do this work, to protect those people, we need cadets who will employ their skills and execute orders without question.<eos> And so... only one of you will be leaving this room.
We can go to my father.<eos> He'll close the door, Timothy.<eos> We need cadets who will execute orders without question.<eos> Mick, we have to go.<eos> Only one of you will be leaving this room.
Nice.<eos> He gave me her phone number.<eos> Yeah, nice.<eos> My loyal... Ish subjects, these troubled times, I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.<eos> Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him... Because he scares you or engorges you.
He gave me her phone number.<eos> Yeah, nice.<eos> My loyal... Ish subjects, these troubled times, I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.<eos> Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him... Because he scares you or engorges you.<eos> Just the chance that Lucifer could come back, the rumor, would've been enough to keep some of you working against me, undermining me, being a royal pain in my... Pert, royal ass.
Right.<eos> This is Eileen leahy.<eos> The banshee girl.<eos> We have a file.<eos> From what Mick tells me, neither of you have any formal training. Fascinating.
Again and again.<eos> When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn't find you.<eos> And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn't find her.<eos> And I just wanted...<eos> I needed to come back here with a win for you.
And if you find her again?<eos> Sam's working on it.<eos> Of course, he's hell-bent on finding something that doesn't mean killing her or her kid. Right.<eos> And if he doesn't find something?<eos> If you run out of time, could either of you kill an innocent?
This can work.<eos> I'm going with Castiel.<eos> No, Kelly, if you go with Cass, you die.<eos> Your baby dies.<eos> I go with you, you take away the thing that makes him special.
It's a bit cozy for my taste.<eos> I hope you don't expect me to spare your friends.<eos> That completes my examination.<eos> Okay, drexel, as much as I enjoy playing doctor with you day after day, I need to blow this joint now.<eos> I beg you to be patient.
Scared of what?<eos> "I know they're following me, watching me.<eos> "They tapped my phone.<eos> I found a microphone in my room."<eos> "I hate to be all girly, but I could bunk with you guys for a days until I sort this out?"
The old iron works off the interstate.<eos> Tomorrow night at 9:00. He says park off the road by the warehouse.<eos> All right.<eos> The timing of your escape is crucial, my lord.<eos> If the device isn't sufficiently impaired, the king's hold on you will only increase.
Do not tell me it's powering up.<eos> It's powering up... I asked you not to tell me that.<eos> But in the opposite direction.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> As it's powering down in you, the polarity is somehow reversing.
But in the opposite direction.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> As it's powering down in you, the polarity is somehow reversing.<eos> English, drexel.<eos> The ability to control is transferring from crowley to you.
Mummy always was a talented hunter.<eos> Just somewhat... Confused about obeying orders.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Lady bevell cleared up that...<eos> Confusion. And I suspect she told you that the American hunters are a dying breed.
I called you here because people... um, our people, are being slaughtered.<eos> And we're next.<eos> The British Men of Letters, they came here because they thought they could do our job better than we could.<eos> And they hooked us with their flashy gear and their tech.<eos> Most of you had the good sense to turn 'em down.
It'll be okay.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> Since I've been back, I know... I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...
Since I've been back, I know... I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...<eos> I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... being here with you was too hard.
Hey, if he shows, can you flame on again?<eos> Can you torch Lucifer like you did Dagon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, that wasn't me. That was the child.<eos> And in case you haven't noticed, he's a little busy.
Awesome.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Are you all right?
Don't worry.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Remember -- paradise,.<eos> this is a fun surprise.<eos> I gotta hand it to you guys.
Lord Aelfric, you will have gathered by now that my brother is part fool.<eos> You should have nothing more to do with him.<eos> My sister has humour... and a tongue!<eos> - We leave tomorrow.<eos> - Lord, I beg you...
My sister has humour... and a tongue!<eos> - We leave tomorrow.<eos> - Lord, I beg you...<eos> My business here is over.<eos> Goodbye, Lord Aelfric, so nice to meet you.
Rest, please, here, by all means...<eos> You will tell me the name of the man who took Uhtred.<eos> I... I need to gather my thoughts.<eos> Lord, I wish to know the name of the slaver.<eos> If you are truly sorry, you will tell me and where to find him.
And between that time he sails where?<eos> His ships plough the roughest sea.<eos> - He could be any place.<eos> - You tell us nothing.<eos> I tell you what I know to be true.
A cup of water?<eos> I think perhaps a hole in the ground.<eos> He has... passed, Lord.<eos> Our, erm...<eos> Our deepest sympathies are with all of you.
Our deepest sympathies are with all of you.<eos> Be assured that I and the priests of Wessex shall pray for Lord Ceolwulf's soul.<eos> I pray eternal light will shine upon him.<eos> We shall adjourn.<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?
Be ready.<eos> Hear that, Halig?<eos> I love land.<eos> _<eos> So in place of the head of Osbert, you offer me a bride... by your own admission... you have misplaced.
And I know she must be very fond of me, to hide herself away like this.<eos> Lord, she would not be the first reluctant bride.<eos> True.<eos> It is also a truth that she was very fond of your nephew.<eos> I have a duty to tell you, there was talk of marriage.
He has earned it.<eos> Swear.<eos> I, Uhtred of Bebban...<eos> It is the custom to kneel.<eos> I, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, pledge my sword to you, Alfred of Wessex.
Tomorrow, you're my errands man.<eos> Father Beocca? Uhtred!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come to make your peace with God?<eos> Come to find you.
One... may be overpowered.<eos> Two can defend themselves.<eos> A cord of three is not so quickly broken<eos> Now that you are bound together,<eos> Uhtred and Gisela... I can declare you man and wife.
This is where we part.<eos> We will show ourselves only when we know the east door has been opened.<eos> We will attack... then it's up to you to save us.<eos> We will be theirs to slaughter.<eos> Lord, may the gods be with you.
Well, good for you. [sobs]<eos> For both of you.<eos> That's so funny that you'll be on the Mets cruise, because Titus is performing at that event.<eos> So I guess we'll see you there.<eos> The peacock is our gift to you.
She would think it was pity, and she doesn't do pity.<eos> True dat.<eos> You're really going to give us the money?<eos> Ooh, "give" is a strong word.<eos> I am going to heroically loan you the money for purely selfish reasons.
[Klaus and Violet] Thank you.<eos> Aren't raspberries delicious?<eos> They were my favorite berry when I was your age.<eos> But we're all different ages.<eos> I want to talk to you about something.
I'd hate to disgrace your good name and the name of Al Funcoot.<eos> Plus, I'll be very busy the next few weeks working on my inventions.<eos> And learning how to prepare roast beef.<eos> You will participate in my theatrical performance!<eos> I would prefer it if you participate voluntarily, but as I believe Mr. Poe has explained to you, I can act loco parentheses.
Prisoners.<eos> Listen to us.<eos> Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.
Listen to us.<eos> Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:
I was in my room all night, and I know what you're up to.<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Let me give you a piece of advice.<eos> If you use fancy-pants words first thing in the morning, you're going to end up a very lonely man.<eos> I figured out your scheme. You're not going to marry Violet figuratively. You're going to marry her literally.
Anything? Would you, for instance, consider marrying me during tomorrow night's performance?<eos> I would never, ever marry you.<eos> Hmm. Children... your sister is like a stick behind a stubborn mule.<eos> My sister's not a stick.<eos> Any animal owner will tell you that a stubborn mule will move toward the carrot because it wants the reward of food... and away from the stick because it wants to avoid the punishment of rump pain.
Come now.<eos> Would it be so terrible to be my bride, to live in my house for the rest of your life?<eos> You're such a lovely girl.<eos> After the wedding, I wouldn't dispose of you like your brother and sister.<eos> [sighs] If you let Sunny go... - I will marry you.
Bambini?<eos> Bambini.<eos> It's Italian for "children."<eos> [chuckles] Why, I'm so giddy having you here that I might as well be talking gibberish.<eos> Now, Baudelaires, I am about to show you one of the most important scientific collections in the history of the world.
- [Violet] You're laughing?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, children.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But the incredibly deadly viper is one of the friendliest and least dangerous animals in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> Sunny will come to no harm and neither will you.
You know, I always wanted to have a family of my own.<eos> But... time flies like a winged lizard.<eos> Now... I know... that a few dangerous reptiles can make you skeptical of the entire species.<eos> But, if you give them a chance... and you get to know them well enough to tell the dangerous from the good...<eos> I promise you... no harm will come to you in the Reptile Room.
There is a type of situation which occurs all too often in the story of the Baudelaire orphans, called dramatic irony.<eos> Simply put, dramatic irony is when a person makes a remark, and someone who hears it knows something, which makes the remark have a different, usually unpleasant, meaning.<eos> Uh, for example, if I were to say, "I can't wait to eat this almond cookie," but there were people around that knew the almond cookie was poisoned, that would be dramatic irony.<eos> For that reason, when we hear Uncle Monty tell the children...<eos> [Monty] I promise you, no harm will come to you in the Reptile Room.
[heavy accent] Good morning.<eos> I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon.<eos> And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.
And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.<eos> The ride along that smelly road was dull and unpleasant, and Stephano is very tired.<eos> You're Count Olaf, and if anyone ever deserved to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.<eos> We will not help you with your luggage and we will not let you in this house.
- [grunts] - [Klaus] Run!<eos> Blast!<eos> Furnaces of hell!<eos> - Baudelaires! - [pounding on door]<eos> [chuckles] I've brought you a present.
Well, I'm sure they'll be glad to hear that.<eos> Are those suitcases alligator skin?<eos> I really love reptiles.<eos> - Is that you, Dr. Montgomery? - [Monty] Yes!<eos> Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!
[Monty] Yeah, and then just keep... Get in.<eos> All right.<eos> We don't know what you're up to, but we will find out.<eos> If anything happens to my sisters or me, you'll never get your hands on the Baudelaire fortune.<eos> [normal voice] If I wanted to harm you, orphan, your blood would be streaming out of this car like a waterfall.
[Gerta] You'll always be in my heart... and in this snow bank.<eos> Per favore.<eos> - Butter?<eos> - Salt?<eos> [normal voice] I'd thank you... - ...for coming on such short notice, but I'm not in the habit of coddling my henchpeople.
- Monty!<eos> - You're here.<eos> [Monty] Hello, children.<eos> It's been a long night and we have a very busy day tomorrow.<eos> - Did you enjoy the movie?
There's no time for chitchat.<eos> We have a ship to catch and I'd like to board in time to have a bottle of wine before lunch.<eos> Peru.<eos> We're going to Peru.<eos> We wouldn't go to the end of the driveway with you, much less international waters.
Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?<eos> Maybe the children should wait outside.<eos> Being in a room with a dead body could be very traumatic.<eos> We've already been in a room with a dead body thanks to you.
He was more than that.<eos> He was much, much more than appropriate.<eos> Please don't let him be our new guardian.<eos> Oh, don't be silly, children.<eos> It is quite shocking that Dr. Montgomery has died, but I'm not going to simply just hand you and your fortune over to his assistant.
- It was.<eos> - Oh, how clever.<eos> But I bet you're not clever enough for this.<eos> I have four tickets with me to Peru right now. I was going to take you and your siblings, because that's just the kind of guardian I am.<eos> But I'll settle for one of you.
I killed Monty.<eos> I also killed his assistant, Gustav.<eos> I drowned him in the reflecting pond.<eos> The question is... what are you going to do about it?<eos> I'm going to send you to jail for a very long time.
And the toads...<eos> Probably a small earthquake.<eos> The police had a few more questions for her, and then you can go home.<eos> She should see a therapist as soon as possible.<eos> From you, she needs stability, safety,
It's okay. We're inside.<eos> No! Don't!<eos> There's something out there.<eos> - What? - I don't know, but...<eos> I'm so fed up with you people and your need for attention.
We were playing football, and then it... And then it turned into wrestling.<eos> Only because you said I didn't tag you, and I... I, clearly, I did.<eos> Yeah, but who's... who's the one who got the worst of it?<eos> Not me.<eos> I just can't wait until at least one of you acts like you're not 12 years old.
It's great.<eos> Kaylee loves her new school.<eos> The neighborhood's friendly. We feel safe.<eos> That's good.<eos> Mike, I don't know how to thank you.
How long has it been? Ah.<eos> You're here to help. Because all this is so stressful for me.<eos> Is that what Jimmy told you?<eos> He's worried about you, Chuck.<eos> In spite of everything that's happened between the two of you, he -- he cares.
- Oh, thank you!<eos> - And I'll see you later.<eos> Thank you so much, Jimmy!<eos> ... Right hand, friends...<eos> the hand of love. Now, watch, and I'll show you the story of life.
Because of what happened to Jason.<eos> They're gonna tell us at the assembly.<eos> Who's Jason and what happened to him?<eos> Thank you for that moment of silence.<eos> Many of you were lucky enough to have known my brother personally.
They're gonna tell us at the assembly.<eos> Who's Jason and what happened to him?<eos> Thank you for that moment of silence.<eos> Many of you were lucky enough to have known my brother personally.<eos> Each and every one of you meant the world to Jason.
Jason wouldn't want us to spend the year mourning.<eos> Jason would want us to move on with our lives.<eos> Which is why I've asked the School Board not to cancel the Back-to-School semiformal.<eos> But rather, to let us use it as a way to heal, collectively, and celebrate my brother's too, too short life on this mortal coil.<eos> Thank you all.
He was shot.<eos> That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious. What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.
To be discussed, over many burgers, and many days.<eos> Oh, my God, Arch. Your eye.<eos> Now to kickoff this pep rally, I'd like to hand it over to our very own Mayor McCoy.<eos> Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.<eos> It is heartening to see so many of you here, even in weather like this.
They comfort us, but life is infinitely more complex than that.<eos> If you publish a story saying I fired that gun, my life will be ruined.<eos> I'll be banished from the Adventure Scouts, and charged with a misdemeanor.<eos> So, what if I have a better story?<eos> If I tell you what I know, promise me the gunshot stays between us.
Please, Mom, she really needs our help.<eos> Fred.<eos> You try to hire my crew on the first day of construction?<eos> Opportunity knocks when it knocks.<eos> Nothing personal. Yeah, it never is with you guys. So what is it?
Because of this hate. This pointless, stupid fighting.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, don't touch me.<eos> We were supposed to be together.<eos> And you didn't let us have that, neither of you.
Scatter, my Vixens.<eos> Yes, Betty?<eos> What is it?<eos> Polly.<eos> Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm syndrome spell you've cast on her, but I want to talk to my sister.
Think carefully about your next move, Veronica.<eos> The rest of your life, and your mother's, will be decided by it."<eos> Hey, I was talking to Kevin. He told me that you and Chuck had some scene in the cafeteria yesterday.<eos> It wasn't a big deal.<eos> What exactly happened between you guys that night?
- We can get, um...<eos> - General Tso's chicken, scallion pancakes, vegetable dumplings, family-style.<eos> What's wrong, son?<eos> Huh?<eos> Nothing. I'm just... I'm not used to coming home and seeing you guys together.
Pop... Jughead hasn't been by, has he? Nope.<eos> You're not the only one who's come looking for him.<eos> Betty...<eos> - Thank goodness. - We were gonna call you.<eos> I'm not talking to you, either of you, ever again.
I have been noodling and hieing my capital eyes on this success of yours, Fitzgerald. - I'm sure you have.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I have a brilliant idea.<eos> We turn Paradise into a picture show.<eos> Starring you and Zelda.
We have a problem with... gay people.<eos> What is going on?<eos> A kiss-in, which we're staging until you give us back our office.<eos> This is the prayer room now.<eos> Uh, we gave you a different office.
They think that ten weeks is a long time to be in a coma at this level.<eos> It's the school year, honey.<eos> Maybe you should get back to your friends.<eos> No, he needs me.<eos> I'll leave you two alone.
Zig, that girl is crazy.<eos> Okay, look... I couldn't say no to her this morning, all right?<eos> You gotta understand.<eos> There's a whole situation.<eos> Yeah, but it's not like you two haven't had all the sex.
Don't be nervous. You'll be great.<eos> Lola, why don't you go wait with Rasha?<eos> - Are you hooking up with her?<eos> - What?<eos> No! Because there's some serious tension between you two.
It might not be everyone's choice, but it was mine.<eos> And I'm not ashamed.<eos> My hair looks so flat in that video.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> But you were so judgey about the sex.
What did you do?<eos> Went under the Wall.<eos> Listen up!<eos> We're removing your cuffs.<eos> Stay seated until you're ordered off the bus.
Let's go!<eos> You have been assigned to one of the Authority's labor camps and distribution centers.<eos> We are responsible for making sure supplies reach their correct destination.<eos> If you break a rule, if you steal anything...<eos> I will hurt you.
Come on, keep moving.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you want to come eat with my friends?<eos> Sure.<eos> This is the guy I was telling you about.
We're not... We're gonna consider it.<eos> - We're not taking it yet.<eos> Sometimes, we don't think we're gonna like something, but then you try it, and then suddenly you realize that you're having fun.<eos> Think about your trampoline. I mean, your father and I fought about getting that for years.<eos> And then, all of a sudden, what happened? Next thing you knew, the two of us were doing backflips out there with you.
That dude that gave me a black eye is at Lola's.<eos> - Give me my shirt.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> At least one of you has to stay.
It's a very hard career.<eos> Miles?<eos> Do you really think you're good enough?<eos> Well, I was good enough to get this opportunity.<eos> Hey, uh, would you guys remove armpit hair from a photo of you?
See?<eos> Look at this versus this.<eos> - That, that, that.<eos> - So that's how you win every time, hmm?<eos> Um, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from the prom committee, effective immediately.
I'm just gonna be here.<eos> I'll still be around.<eos> You wouldn't mind hanging out with a complete failure?<eos> Not in the slightest.<eos> I used to think I needed a boyfriend to be happy, but hanging out with you guys has been some of the best times I've had in a while.
Tonight's gonna be amazing.<eos> I thought we could go get the food before lunch ends.<eos> - What's tonight?<eos> - Yeah, what's tonight, Zig?<eos> Oh, so you didn't tell your girlfriends about our camping trip?
An acquaintance?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What about me?<eos> - Me, too?<eos> I love you guys, but it's not the same.
Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive.<eos> He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms-- My father...<eos> was an evil man.<eos> On behalf of House Targaryen... I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.<eos> And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.
They did for me.<eos> I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms, and I will.<eos> You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.<eos> The war against my sister has already begun.<eos> You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting whatever you saw beyond the Wall.
It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom, you are in open rebellion.<eos> You must forgive my manners.<eos> You'll both be tired after your long journey.<eos> We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
Did you see Little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?<eos> "Oh, no!"<eos> What a twat.<eos> My queen, please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.<eos> I give you what no other man could give-- justice.
He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.<eos> But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?<eos> Now he's buried somewhere.<eos> And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.<eos> That must be difficult for you.
I imagine she's your favorite.<eos> I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites, but still, we're only human.<eos> We love whom we love.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't understand you.<eos> That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.
That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.<eos> It must be frustrating.<eos> We all make our choices.<eos> You chose to murder my daughter.<eos> You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money, but Lannisters always pay their debts.<eos> Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?<eos> Your father's daughter, indeed.<eos> Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.<eos> And when you return to Braavos, I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.
You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.<eos> Except to my ship.<eos> You took my ship.<eos> I wouldn't say we took your ship.<eos> I'm not playing word games with you.
You don't have to believe him.<eos> Let him mine the dragonglass.<eos> If he's wrong, it's worthless.<eos> You didn't even know it was here.<eos> It's nothing to you.
I never expected that you would.<eos> And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to that throne.<eos> I haven't either.<eos> I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.<eos> Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.
Once the real cold comes?<eos> They should, indeed.<eos> Pardon me, my lady.<eos> You there, why isn't there leather on these?<eos> Command suits you.
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.<eos> I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.<eos> Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.<eos> The only place for me is back with her.<eos> I owe her my life. Her and you.
You really do love her.<eos> You poor fool.<eos> She'll be the end of you.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?
She'll be the end of you.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?<eos> What better person to discuss it with?<eos> What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?
Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?<eos> What better person to discuss it with?<eos> What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?<eos> But perhaps you're right.<eos> If she's driven you this far, it's gone beyond your control.
You will, too.<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> How will it happen?<eos> Cersei had several ideas.<eos> Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.
I think we're done here.<eos> How will it happen?<eos> Cersei had several ideas.<eos> Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.<eos> Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.
Hold that wagon!<eos> You've just won the biggest prize in the world.<eos> What could you possibly have to be upset about?<eos> Come on, you can tell me.<eos> Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.<eos> There is no more High Septon.<eos> No, there isn't, is there?<eos> There is still the question of my prize.<eos> That's a lot of money I just gave you.
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.<eos> Besides, think of the upkeep.<eos> The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.<eos> Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?<eos> All your new riches weighing you down?
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.<eos> We pay our debts.<eos> Right, just not to me.<eos> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of... whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold, complaining about not getting paid.<eos> When we win this war, all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from, with no one left to take them away from you.
Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.<eos> Do you know who this belonged to?<eos> No.<eos> That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.<eos> In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.
Your Grace.<eos> I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> All we'll ever need.<eos> There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.
I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.<eos> The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.
It's been a while since I trained.<eos> I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.<eos> He didn't beat the Hound.<eos> You did.<eos> I want to train with you.
I want to train with you.<eos> You swore to serve both my mother's daughters, didn't you?<eos> Move aside, Podrick.<eos> You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.<eos> I won't cut you. Don't worry.
Move aside, Podrick.<eos> You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.<eos> I won't cut you. Don't worry.<eos> I'll try not to.<eos> Who taught you how to do that?
You could've killed me.<eos> The fuck were you doing back there?<eos> Ending the war. Killing her.<eos> You saw the dragon between you and her?
Ending the war. Killing her.<eos> You saw the dragon between you and her?<eos> - And?<eos> Listen to me, cunt.<eos> Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you, you don't get to kill you, only I get to kill you.
Dragons are where our partnership ends.<eos> I'm not gonna be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.<eos> I have to tell Cersei.<eos> May as well jump back in that river.<eos> I know what Cersei has told you.
I know what Cersei has told you.<eos> That I've come to destroy your cities, burn down your homes, murder you, and orphan your children.<eos> That's Cersei Lannister, not me.<eos> I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.<eos> I offer you a choice...
He was a great man.<eos> You look strong.<eos> You found a cure?<eos> I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.<eos> I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.
Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.<eos> Fair point.<eos> How do you propose to find one?<eos> With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.<eos> You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.
Fair point.<eos> How do you propose to find one?<eos> With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.<eos> You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.<eos> Allow me to serve you.
You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.<eos> You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.<eos> I'm the only one here who's fought them.<eos> I'm the only one here who knows them.<eos> I haven't given you permission to leave.
With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.<eos> I am a king.<eos> And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.<eos> I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.<eos> Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger... because it's our best chance.
Best hurry.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We should be preparing the city for a siege.<eos> The Dothraki are coming.<eos> All the more reason for you to train.
You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei...<eos> - This is Gendry.<eos> He'll do.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I could give you something.
- A priestess.<eos> I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.<eos> We're fighting a great war.<eos> - Wars cost money.<eos> - I wanted to be one of you.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.<eos> But you are back.<eos> And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
I brought shame onto my house.<eos> I broke my father's heart.<eos> I forfeited the right to claim his sword.<eos> It's yours.<eos> May it serve you well.
I broke my father's heart.<eos> I forfeited the right to claim his sword.<eos> It's yours.<eos> May it serve you well.<eos> And your children after you.
With your help.<eos> What?<eos> That's your pretty handwriting.<eos> Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles 'cause I couldn't write as well as you.<eos> Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.
- I remember.<eos> - Father has been charged with treason.<eos> He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.<eos> The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.<eos> I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark
Where did you find it?<eos> You're scared, aren't you?<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> You didn't commit any crimes.<eos> No one's going to hang you.
- You know her?<eos> - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?
That's what I saw in the fire.<eos> A mountain like an arrow head.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Do you know what I like about you?
Jon Snow...<eos> They all fell in love with you.<eos> Jon Snow is not in love with me.<eos> Oh, my mistake.<eos> I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.<eos> He did.<eos> But you once spoke to me about breaking the wheel.<eos> Aegon built the wheel.<eos> If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?
But any one of them could have found your heart and end...<eos> You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?<eos> Is this one of the items you've discussed<eos> - with your brother in King's Landing?<eos> - I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
The King chose you to rule in his absence.<eos> And rule you have.<eos> Wisely.<eos> Ably.<eos> They say that, they respect you.
Perhaps Lady Brienne can help.<eos> She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls.<eos> Did she not?<eos> She is.<eos> And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way, wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.<eos> I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.<eos> And you trust their loyalty?<eos> You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back?<eos> Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.
- In Braavos, while I was training to be a faceless man.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was I game I used to play. The game of faces.<eos> It's simple:<eos> I ask you a question about yourself and you try to make a lie sound like the truth.
Alright.<eos> Not Dany.<eos> How about "My Queen"?<eos> I'd... bend the knee but...<eos> What about those who swore allegiance to you?
With everything that's going on, you just sit here and feel sorry for yourself.<eos> And you?<eos> You're letting a grudge get the better of you.<eos> God.<eos> - I cannot believe how alike you two are.
But until we find out how Arias triggers the virus who knows if it'll work the same for everyone else.<eos> My blood holds the answers.<eos> If I die, get this to a lab you trust.<eos> I can't imagine what you two have been through.<eos> But I know that neither one of you are the type of person who would sit here and argue while the world dies.
274, report immediately.<eos> Open it up and tell them you're okay.<eos> I don't have the key.<eos> Come on, you guys.<eos> I need you to check in.
We are done.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's a dark day for our club.<eos> But justice has been dealt.<eos> I congratulate you.
Fucking haunted houses!<eos> Got you.<eos> Gunner?<eos> The jarhead's not here, it's a decoy.<eos> He's gotta be where you are.
Jarhead just killed me.<eos> He's taken all my guns.<eos> You killed my partner in cold blood.<eos> So here's the deal.<eos> Gonna make it real simple for you.
So here's the deal.<eos> Gonna make it real simple for you.<eos> I've already taken down four of your guys with my bare hands.<eos> Now, I got some firepower.<eos> And unlike you idiots, I actually know how to use it.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. That's fine.<eos> I think I can manage by myself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I have to say, uh, last night, I didn't think that much of Bridgeport, but after meeting you two, uh, all that's turned around.<eos> - So thank you so much.
Hey, you're not just a single-o. You're a goddamn cannon.<eos> You got to pass the bone, man, lay out how you do that.<eos> I need a favor from you guys.<eos> What kind of favor?<eos> Do you guys have a car you can get around in?
Swag I got from a cruise Rob took me on.<eos> How long are you gonna be mad at me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you remember how many times I asked you that same question... you gave me that same answer?<eos> You two are so the same it's scary.
This is just wonderful.<eos> First my wife tells me that she's lost everything, now my grandson is telling me that he's nothing but a common crook.<eos> Is that why you brought that safecracker in, to rob us?<eos> No.<eos> I was trying to help you.
I might have slashed your tire.<eos> That's shitty, but it's what I did.<eos> What I didn't do was make you beat the piss out of that kid.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
Eddie, don't... Can you...<eos> I got to go.<eos> You were in there a while, Eddie.<eos> I was just...<eos> I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
- I need your head right before dealing to Mukherjee. Tomorrow night, all right? - All right, yeah.<eos> - You feel okay? Yeah. I...<eos> I'm depending on you.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, come on, the rest of you, let's go.
We're so excited to hear what all of you think about it.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> If you all will take a seat, make yourselves comfortable, we can get started.<eos> Frankie and I really appreciate your coming out here today.<eos> We just can't wait to tell you what we've been up to.
I just want you to stop being a dick about my kids.<eos> And if you can't, I don't want you around them. Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Enjoy your lunch.<eos> Well, I'd like to tell you a little something about myself and how this whole thing got started.
Grace, could we just pass these out right now?<eos> Get this show on the road!<eos> All right.<eos> All of you just, um...<eos> reach down into the bag, and you'll find a little goodie in there that might make you feel... born again.
Frankie?<eos> - Frankie?<eos> - Get out of the house, Grace!<eos> Take to the water!<eos> Are you sure you guys are okay?
Solomon has business partners.<eos> As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us.<eos> We'd better go, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm coming with you.
Sure, sweetheart.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Jesus, Stevie! Why do you always have to be such a dick?<eos> Either of you remember a-a guy named Gunther?
I'm gonna hang on to this for safety.<eos> - Come on, don't...<eos> Dad, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Either of you remember a-a guy named Gunther?
Sure.<eos> So why'd you have the affair?<eos> I mean, you had everything.<eos> You're, like, out of armpit Pennsylvania and you go straight into some fancy college and meet a hot chick.<eos> She's rich. Her daddy buys you a house. I mean, hell...
I saw him leave last night, out my window. Wait.<eos> Dad was in the house?<eos> - You didn't tell us.<eos> - Our house?<eos> I was going to tell you. I really was...
Okay. Right.<eos> Yeah, I think we want two Jamesons on the rocks.<eos> - Are you even sorry? - Am I sorry?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Well, I-I don't think that I'm solely responsible, but I don't like knowing that my actions caused you or anyone else pain.
What is going on?<eos> P.T. has something to tell us.<eos> What?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am humbled to have pierced the veil and to address you on behalf of Mr Westmoreland.
You want to be awake. You don't want the fog.<eos> You want to roll the dice. And if you roll threes, you want to move 12, right?<eos> Yeah, you want control and clarity.<eos> You want to be the master of your fate.<eos> And you can do it, because you have that much power inside of you.
Oh.<eos> I freaked out.<eos> - I don't know anything about anyone following you.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> It's what you guys do over there, isn't it?
Mom's not gonna eat cupcakes that have clearly been fingered by tiny hands.<eos> They're for me.<eos> It's stressful being the buffer between you two.
Like a real gun or like an emotional kind of...<eos> Uh, right now, in this moment, is there something that I need to do?<eos> - Because if not...<eos> - Yes. No.<eos> Yes. Look, team, I will tell you everything in a moment, but I'm beat.
Come, my love.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Go, Mom!<eos> It's still not working.<eos> No, I told you the pot doesn't work on me.
You are.<eos> You are.<eos> See, Mom? Don't you want this with Frankie?<eos> Why?<eos> I have it with you.
I don't know whether I need absolution or if I should check myself into a psych ward.<eos> I'm sure whatever's going on with you can be explained.<eos> How about them Chargers? !<eos> Every time I come out here you're huddled in some secret conversation!<eos> What the hell is going on between you two?
That really shakes everything up.<eos> - You're welcome?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, my sweet goyishe boy.<eos> You two have nothing to worry about. You'll both be remembered well.
- Oh, my God.<eos> Now, remember, to lift with your legs, not with your back.<eos> And bend your knees like so.<eos> - Knees are shot, I'll leverage my ankles. - That's not gonna work.<eos> Will one of you geezers help me up off this flipping floor?
I took it when Leonard was just a-a wee slip of a boy.<eos> He talked about you a lot, 'specially near the end.<eos> Bet there was a whole lotta cursing involved.<eos> He was proud of you, Leonard, for serving your country.<eos> Kinda sad and sorry the way things went down between you two.
Nah, it's all right.<eos> We don't need a parade or nothin'. Speak for yourself.<eos> Parade wouldn't have been bad idea.<eos> Don't think those women don't know who found their boys.<eos> I mean, everyone knows the truth. Thanks to you, those ladies have closure now.
Just tell us what happened to the red shoes.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm already on administrative leave for shootin' that boy.<eos> Half salary.<eos> Hanson catch me talkin' to you, I'll be a rent-a-cop faster'n I can burn these hamburgers.
Uh, we're looking for this.<eos> See, uh... the dead boy who was found under the house? We think he may have been tied to that gate. I've seen this.<eos> You have?<eos> Where?<eos> I'll show you.
I'm your wife.<eos> I want to be obedient.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Nobody wants to be obedient.<eos> I do want to serve you and Fillory, but...
It's coming back and if it all comes back, I'm pretty sure I'll know exactly what to do.<eos> - That's wonderful.<eos> - On a planet with no Zoloft.<eos> Now you sound like my king.<eos> So then, if I just needed one little thing from you to... to ease my agony?
Could you spell your last name again?<eos> I would, but... you're asleep.<eos> You said anything.<eos> But this is... this is...<eos> Am I not enough for you?
Am I not enough for you?<eos> You're great.<eos> For... who you are.<eos> It's just...<eos> I already told you. My life was different before.
For... who you are.<eos> It's just...<eos> I already told you. My life was different before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll help you make a new life.
No, no.<eos> Thank the hell that was my childhood.<eos> Oh, well, perfect timing, for once.<eos> Your High King has agricultural tales to tell.<eos> I give you the reign of...
- Oh, Joe.<eos> Your heart bleeds the way only a vagina should.<eos> Get a picture!<eos> We love you, Flaritza!<eos> We saw what they did to you!
- Yo. You could fucking sue them.<eos> Damn.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We're together.<eos> - You can write letters. - No.
Brianna and Mallory read it, too.<eos> Pretty impressive, huh?<eos> Wasn't that a fun way to have our company drop into the world?<eos> Yeah, it's fun. Fun, fun, fun.<eos> Uh, it made a big impression on all of us. Uh... In fact, we got you both a gift.
You and I both know this, Grace.<eos> You know, sex is... young.<eos> But we're... older.<eos> Not anymore we're not.<eos> Let me just explain to you how this could work.
- But Grace...<eos> Yeah, no. Let them finish, Frankie.<eos> Yeah, the most important thing is we can get this out quickly.<eos> Now we can help you realize every dream you have for this product.<eos> We want to make the two of you the Ben Jerry of vaginal stimulation.
Have you unpacked your stuff with Jacob?<eos> Well, no, I wanted to do it with you first.<eos> I can't help you there, Frankie.<eos> If I tell you to leave, you're gonna think I don't care.<eos> If I tell you to stay, you're gonna resent me for keeping you from your boyfriend.
And Santa Fe is just a plane, train or automobile away.<eos> I can't afford any of those, but I bet there's a bus.<eos> The bus makes you so sick.<eos> That's me.<eos> Oh, I knew it was one of you.
Yeah.<eos> Now I think he's crazy.<eos> Tammy, your hand's shaking.<eos> I think maybe you saw God, too.<eos> Well, on account of Mike and that cage that saved my life, I'll tell you this much.
First time it's for the girls.<eos> And if they come back, it's for one girl in particular.<eos> He fell in love?<eos> With who?<eos> I told you what I was gonna tell you, now get the hell out of here.
Am I going to have to break every bone in his body?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> You need to keep your eye on men.<eos> Men aren't where I keep my eye, actually.<eos> Imagine if time all happened at once... every moment of your life laid out around you... like a city.
I don't think so. - I'll go see what's up.<eos> - Are you okay, sweetheart?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm 16. I can deal with shit.<eos> By the way, I'm gonna be swearing in front of you guys now.
Yeah, me too.<eos> I thought I was gonna go crazy without you.<eos> - Welcome back, guys. Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Thank you. - Hey. - Look at that.
All we got now is an accident.<eos> We need to catch this Alpe in the act.<eos> So, we think the Alpe is using the Englewood Hotel as its own personal cafeteria.<eos> We need someone to spend one night in there, so that we can catch it the next time it strikes.<eos> Right, and it can't be either of you guys, since you've both been there as cops, which is why you're looking at me.
Or if he is, he's the scorched soul kind.<eos> Well, whatever this is, it certainly doesn't - have any prongs.<eos> - Mm, looks more like a staff.<eos> Yeah, this is all really interesting. I don't think it's helping us get to where he is.<eos> I think I know how to do that, but you're not gonna like it.
He could've killed us, but he didn't.<eos> No, he needed you there to open the way from his side so he could cross over with you.<eos> This day was predicted from all the symbols on the cloth.<eos> We think that everything is supposed to happen today, March 24th.<eos> Wait, did he follow you here?
Congratulations, you've succeeded.<eos> Now we'll all lose our jobs.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That wasn't my intention.<eos> -Now that Lidia has told you, I'm sorry.
We don't need your help.<eos> I understand why you're angry, but I need you to listen to me.<eos> If you're not interested in what I have to say... I promise I'll never bother you again.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> Something that none of you know about me.
To steal?<eos> Why?<eos> The men who were threatening me made me steal for them.<eos> I was supposed to steal the rotary blueprints next.<eos> I owe you a lot, and I'd never forgive myself if I abandoned you.
Mitzi!<eos> Hey, I get carsick in the back, man.<eos> How about if I drive?<eos> Keep fucking moving.<eos> I need you all in one place.
- Why not?<eos> - Because I'm not.<eos> In that case, maybe you're ready to talk about a merger.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> Jessica didn't tell you?
- Because I'm not.<eos> In that case, maybe you're ready to talk about a merger.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> Jessica didn't tell you?<eos> Before she left, I offered her a lifeline, and now I'm gonna offer the same thing to you.
The only thing the world's gonna know is, Jessica had such confidence in our abilities that she decided to move on to another phase of her career.<eos> I don't care how you want to spin it.<eos> Even if you manage to keep your clients, you've got a boulder headed your way, and you know it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Which one of you two is gonna take.
Class of '09...<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Zero.<eos> Look it up.<eos> None of you are ever going to make partner because there is no room at the top.
Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.<eos> I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.
- Watch yourself, Harvey.<eos> - Robert...<eos> I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.<eos> But as my partner told you before, we don't need your charity.<eos> Then I'll stop giving it to you.
What?<eos> When?<eos> I went over to the college.<eos> She's having an art opening tonight for her students, so we're gonna have dinner here tomorrow night.<eos> Well, then I will get you a table.
Yeah. I was saying it for her.<eos> Thanks for making me stay over, Marcus.<eos> Well, maybe after tomorrow night, you can do it more often.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Thank you all for coming.
You want me to lie for you?<eos> Marcus, she had the nerve to say that I owed her an apology.<eos> If that's her, you tell her I've got nothing more to say.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> You can tell her yourself, because I'm doing being in the middle of you two.
Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, everyone, can you listen up for a sec?<eos> Marissa... this won't take long.<eos> When Nathan introduced me, he told you that I used to work at Pearson Specter Litt.
Great.<eos> Hey, everyone, can you listen up for a sec?<eos> Marissa... this won't take long.<eos> When Nathan introduced me, he told you that I used to work at Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> What he didn't tell you is why I don't work there anymore.
But not being a lawyer isn't the only reason I didn't belong there.<eos> You see, the whole reason that I wanted to be a lawyer in the first place was so that I could help the kind of people that come into this clinic every single day.<eos> Now, I thought you all knew this, but it's clear to me now that you don't.<eos> Nathan wanted to protect me, but... I'd rather have you respect me.<eos> If any of you have any questions at all, please come talk to me about it.
This is what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> No one can fix this.<eos> You're better off without me.<eos> Rocky, he's better if I'm gone.<eos> This is the only thing that I can do to help. You shut up.
You've done it my whole life.<eos> I shouldn't take it personally.<eos> You've done it to me, to Meg.<eos> - You did it to Danny.<eos> - I don't feel like I'm better than you.
He's part of the family. You can't blame him for not being as comfortable around all this as you are.<eos> It's no surprise he's not as... well adjusted to this as you.<eos> He's better adjusted than everyone thinks.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I wanted to talk to the three of you together, but I'll just have to talk to Nolan another time.
- Not yet.<eos> No, I didn't want him to try to talk me out of it.<eos> But I'll tell him. I'll tell him.<eos> And I won't change my mind.<eos> This money belongs to you, just you.
You need some sleep.<eos> You're done.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm done, all right?<eos> Oh, I was done the moment I had you boys.
- Yes, I am.<eos> Before we get in, though, what's your name and what are you hauling?<eos> My name's George, and the trucker's code dictates that you never tell, but it rhymes with "frozen hamburger tatties."<eos> Look, look, look, there are lowlifes everywhere.<eos> I just wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that maybe the wrong guy picked up you defenseless little girls.
And I still owe you lunch from those three times.<eos> I'm a little worried about him, but not enough to step in.<eos> Bid.<eos> Bid.<eos> I command you to bid.
Basically, they're saying I'm long, lean, have nice bone structure, run really fast.<eos> Lay the dopest eggs.<eos> I don't care. I can't have these dick licks putting neggy vibes out there about me. It affects my business.<eos> Oh! Sorry, vintage fashion nerds.<eos> Get out your aloe vera 'cause you about to get hit with a third-degree burn!
Remember me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I'm just pooping.<eos> Thank you, Los Angeles, I love you.
It doesn't have my emotional intelligence yet but I thought I'd have a little fun with it in the meantime.<eos> Do you have your emotional intelligence yet?<eos> When it can top that, you might have something.<eos> Loser.<eos> Okay, which one of you said that?
The math ain't that hard.<eos> What's with the boxes, Louis?<eos> This is everything the firm has ever done for Couture Apparel.<eos> You're taking us to your annual meeting?<eos> I'm not just taking you.
I guess that means you're in the home stretch, huh?<eos> Guess I am.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> But I was telling Nathan the truth.<eos> I'm not looking to come back here with these guys instead of working with you.
- Yeah, but I'm not the one who had the least experienced lawyer I've ever met put this thing over the goal line.<eos> Come on, I thought I was the least experienced lawyer you've ever met.<eos> No, you were the least experienced dickhead I ever met.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Because that kid may be green, but he's the only one of you two that actually went to law school.
- Will you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Worth a try.<eos> - Okay, we have some time.<eos> So I'll meet you both back here in an hour.
So you were lying to Nathan, only not about what he thought.<eos> - Listen to me--<eos> - I'm not gonna listen and you need to tell him what's going on.<eos> I can't do that and I wasn't lying to him when I said I'm not going back to my old firm.<eos> I wasn't lying to him when I said these people's lives matter to me and I wasn't lying to either one of you when I said I care about what kind of lawyer you're gonna be.
Harelik?<eos> No idea.<eos> What on earth do you mean, gunth? Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me show you this Cuban guy...
Who was behind this?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Voices on a phone, right?<eos> Great.<eos> I'll tell you this much, though...
Is that a Jewish thing?<eos> It's a human being thing.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.
Well, thanks for waiting and not just, you know, killing him.<eos> We're only monsters by necessity, Joshua.<eos> Besides, we just ate.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> I was gonna offer you some
We're not killing him.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> For some reason, he's of value to Marcel.<eos> - Kol, would you...?<eos> - Happy to stay and have a drink and eviscerate anyone who tries to follow you.
Promise me that.<eos> No, listen to me, okay, please.<eos> I know that this is tough for you, but you're gonna have to trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> You shouldn't have come back... none of you.
Hell, that's what you would do.<eos> You've destroyed more people, taken more lives, ended more families than anyone who's ever lived.<eos> All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.
But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.<eos> And now you can live the rest of your lives knowing that the only reason that you exist is because I am showing you mercy.
Not this time, not without us.<eos> I, king Roan of Azgeda, let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all.<eos> We'll do our best to keep the king on his throne.<eos> We'll find a way to beat the radiation.<eos> If either of you screw this up, we die.
Let him come.<eos> With respect, you're still recovering.<eos> The law says you could pick someone to fight in your place.<eos> The clans will never accept a leader who hides behind the law or another warrior's blood.<eos> You'll lose. Lexa kicked your ass without a bullet hole in your chest.
Soon, Praimfaya will once again destroy everything.<eos> Skaikru's trying to stop it.<eos> My King, they're lying to you.<eos> They'd say anything to save themselves.<eos> Let me prove it to you.
Heh. You see, Ilian?<eos> The king can't fight, or his minions wouldn't be here trying to stop us.<eos> If the king wasn't hurt, do you think this coward would give a crap about your family?<eos> Since you landed here, your people have done nothing but rip our world apart.<eos> Rafel, I urge you...
Every single one of us will survive on this ship.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Raven needs volunteers if we're gonna get it ready in time.<eos> It'll be a lot of work, but now you understand why we need to do it.<eos> If we stick together, I give you my word, we won't just survive.
We can't risk having any of its contents in her memory.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Makes sense, although does seem a little bit unfair to Aida, considering how many lives she just saved.<eos> Okay. First of all, that thing is not a "she"... it's a damn robot.<eos> And second of all, what's the matter with you two chuckleheads?
You don't know me. Mm.<eos> I've been inside your brain.<eos> I know what you want, or, rather... whom.<eos> See? You do know.<eos> I've seen the closeness between you.
He's breathing, but barely.<eos> Jeffrey, where's May?<eos> Where are they keeping her?<eos> We got to get him out of here.<eos> I've been looking forward to facing one of you, readying myself.
We've been trying to reach you.<eos> He needs medical attention.<eos> We have to get him out of here.<eos> Finally.<eos> I've been looking for you guys everywhere.
I don't care.<eos> Now get up.<eos> Really?<eos> Not even winded?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.
Hope Mackenzie.<eos> Hope...<eos> - You're the Hope that he lost.<eos> - He didn't lose me.<eos> I was taken by you people.
No. It can't be.<eos> Hello, again, traitor.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> None of you.
They call this rehab?<eos> Let's get them out.<eos> Okay, time to go.<eos> Thought I was done for.<eos> It's good to see you guys.
come on.<eos> drop your weapons!<eos> Now!<eos> agent may, interesting.<eos> no matter the circumstance, none of you can escape your true nature.
- No, sorry.<eos> - She went to find Alistair Fitz.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you come and tell me?<eos> Because I don't answer to you, not here or any other fantasy world you two might have cooked up.
So you can bring me out here on some wild goose chase?<eos> - Daisy was only trying to help.<eos> - How?<eos> By taking me away from my kid?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
My father's son.<eos> I thought his presence is what you'd have wished for.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just programmed to make you happy.<eos> To make all of you happy.
This is what happens when you piss off your creator.<eos> Are you laughing at me?<eos> To see a creature of logic and calculation now consumed with rage and hate...<eos> It's... Sweet.<eos> Call me "sweet" one more time, and I'll rip the titanium spines out of all of you tin cans.
A constant pain.<eos> I don't know your story. But I know pain.<eos> Pain either alienates people or binds them together forever.<eos> Deniz recognizes a person in pain.<eos> He was aware of the bond between you.
People and what they love don't always intersect. People and their compulsions do.<eos> And John, well, he's compelled toward you.<eos> He's crazy about you.<eos> And if this woman learns that and follows you to your impending point of intersection, well, then that's the end of all of it, honey.<eos> So, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you two to intersect.
- More marshmallow? - No, no.<eos> Let's let the diabetes take its own time, shall we?<eos> Or the cryptofascists Lara told me about.<eos> The men in the white suits.<eos> I'm telling you now, when it comes to cryptofascists, the Reptilians, they're gonna be way more likely.
No.<eos> No, no, it's all right. You go.<eos> Go!<eos> Run, run, run!<eos> Run, run! I'll be right behind you.
Where do your hands belong?<eos> Girls.<eos> I know this must feel very strange.<eos> But "ordinary" is just what you're used to.<eos> This may not seem ordinary to you right now, but after a time, it will.
Now, girls, up.<eos> Wings.<eos> You may come forward and form a circle.<eos> You all know the rules for a particicution.<eos> When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you.
Y'all should be sorry.<eos> That wasn't my boyfriend.<eos> And he wasn't dead. We came in here, played y'all for the idiots y'all are... Took your money, and drank your beer.<eos> So put your goddamn hats back on.<eos> And tell me which one of you banjo-diddling little bitches has got the balls to earn your money back.
Yours?<eos> Good.<eos> - Did anything interesting happen?<eos> - Not really.<eos> You?
Worst bucket list ever.<eos> It's going to be good, Eric.<eos> It's gonna force a confrontation.<eos> Oh, I love those.<eos> Look, what I mean is, what you have now obviously isn't working.
Wha...?<eos> - Where did you get that?<eos> - Oh, this? Took it from my stepdad's stash.<eos> And you've just been carrying it around waiting for a cool time to pull it out?<eos> Well, yesterday at the froyo place I gave the girl an $89 tip but neither of you were looking.
- Who cares what you want?<eos> What your daddy is trying to say is that we don't care what you want.<eos> - Obviously, we're upset.<eos> - We're upset.<eos> I forgive you.
- All right.<eos> I was just trying to teach my daughter a lesson about doing the right thing but having experienced you, I think you should give her the money back.<eos> Now.<eos> Fine. Fuck it.<eos> I'll get it for you.
♪ Baby beluga, oh... ♪<eos> 1950s... the government secretly detonates nukes over Bikini Atoll, poisoning thousands.<eos> 1960s, the CIA secretly tests its MKUltra mind control project.<eos> 2012, a man in Florida eats another man's face and they want you to think that he's high on bath salts?<eos> If you believe that, I got a Japanese sex doll to sell you, unused.
Well, you know what they say.<eos> You don't pay the plumber for banging on the pipes.<eos> You pay him for knowing where to bang.<eos> Yahtzee.<eos> And I'm telling you, where I'm banging, a whole lot of shit's gonna fall out.
So, in college, did you and Moira ever...<eos> Did we ever what?<eos> You know, did you ever...<eos> What, do you think all girls just go through a gay phase?<eos> No, look, it's just you two are very close and you're both very attractive and, in my experience, these things sometimes happen.
You got that? Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah I got it. Got it.<eos> I'll make a run to Canada to get you some passports and I'll be back post haste. No.
US passport doesn't mean shit anymore. Bud.<eos> That's over.<eos> So, we just wait? Yup.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> And then we will get you all safe and sound to the magical land of the north.
Yeah. Look at you.<eos> You're all cold.<eos> We better get you in.<eos> You said, "shit." I did say "shit." Yeah, I did.<eos> I got you in some trouble, there.
Don't move.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> You guys are from Boston. I heard it on my scanner.<eos> They're looking for you.
No worries.<eos> This is pretty fucked up.<eos> Come on.<eos> May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah.<eos> He has not forgotten any of you.
I could translate.<eos> Brazil has the fourth largest transport field in the world.<eos> It's my primary field. I could do it.<eos> I don't want them to see you.<eos> Either of you.
We can do it from my room. Charles Ambrose.<eos> It's adjoining with yours.<eos> It is?<eos> Yeah. I requested it.<eos> The reason you're all still living... And the reason we're offering any sum of money at all...
Take this money.<eos> Take your brother.<eos> Leave.<eos> Say nothing.<eos> Or I'll take you one by one, just like I took him.
"Amsterdam Time Out" called their music an earnest and effortless blending of two voices that form one sound.<eos> Tyhmens and Saperstein.<eos> I'm Tyhmens and Saperstein, and, I'm going to start with something from "Circles of Resonance."<eos> It's called "Superself."<eos> And you should imagine that there's another, higher voice coming in at... at that time... at the same time.
- These are tight.<eos> Gun!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Get it!<eos> Which one of you jalapeño hookers grabbed my boob?
She already dead!<eos> And this... this Pagan bullshit ain't gonna bring her back!<eos> There ain't no heaven, and there ain't no ghosts, man!<eos> When you dead... you dead.<eos> We promised you the best of the bubble.
Shut your mouth!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Ladies, I know you're angry.<eos> And I'm angry, too.<eos> I'm pleading with you to just stop this.
No pants.<eos> And no flat-ass fucking hair.<eos> I mean, Jesus H...<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, tits-on-a-stick Stacey.<eos> I don't care if you have to stand in front of a mirror for three hours teasing the shit out of it!
This doesn't look like your prison anymore, does it, Boss?<eos> Not that it ever was.<eos> The way you let these animals walk all over us.<eos> Oh, this is my fault?<eos> Huh? Which one of you geniuses brought in a fucking gun?
Excuse me!<eos> Everyone!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now all you bitches quiet down so my Muslim friend here can talk a little bit.<eos> Um... yeah. So we been talking, and we have a plan we'd like to run by all of you concerning the demands.
The knob could shatter into a million pieces and hit your eyes!<eos> Lake Lachrymose.<eos> I know every island in its waters and every cave along its shores.<eos> But now I can only stand to look at it from far away.<eos> That's why I couldn't meet you on the docks.
It is grammatically incorrect to end a sentence with the word "and," but I get so upset when I think about Ike.<eos> - We're sorry we asked about him.<eos> - We didn't mean to upset you. Aunt Josephine, you said you had answers for us.<eos> Yes! Thank you for reminding me.<eos> As soon as Sunny said what she said, I knew you were missing some crucial information.
But today I realized, with my hands full of limes, you can't be terrified forever.<eos> I think I am ready to be fierce and formidable again.<eos> - And I think we can do it together.<eos> - That sounds wonderful.<eos> So, can I leave you children alone a few more hours?
Business cards aren't proof of anything.<eos> Anyone can go to a print shop and have cards made that say anything they like.<eos> Well, you're just a heap of facts, aren't you, Klaus?<eos> Facts and facts and facts and facts!<eos> But none of them do you any good.
Young people shouldn't wander around this time of night.<eos> There are dangerous people lurking about.<eos> - Go back in the house.<eos> - Where it's safer.<eos> And strangers can't get you.
Um... No, it's me, Clem.<eos> Abe said you weren't returning his calls.<eos> Why?<eos> Clem, I... Uh, it's a long story.<eos> Whatever happened between you guys, it doesn't matter, okay?
You were going to sneak off without us.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You and Dariela have a home here.<eos> You have Isaac.<eos> He needs you more than I do.
We promise, we are not here to hurt you.<eos> We just...<eos> We want to help this girl.<eos> They brought her through portal.<eos> They took her to the Red Fortress where they sell carbon forms like you.
You can just knock down the walls.<eos> You're gonna get us all home!<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't have my powers on this planet.<eos> But I will help you. All of you.
Agent Schott, she wasn't asking you.<eos> - That's an order.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> Winn.<eos> I'm not gonna be of any help to you out there. I mean...
I'd rather die than surrender.<eos> Then you are an idiot.<eos> You're not going to run me through.<eos> No.<eos> We have something else in mind for you, Your Majesty.
Oh, well... A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.<eos> - Sara.<eos> - It's okay, Ray, come in.<eos> And a thousand thanks for your service to the realm.<eos> If ever your travels bring you back, there will always be a seat at the Round Table for Sir Raymond of the Palms.
It's a cool suit.<eos> Yours?<eos> I was going to tell you.<eos> I told him to tell you last night.<eos> I told you both weeks ago.
They're telling me.<eos> - Psychically.<eos> - Then you have to remain here.<eos> If you go outside, you're vulnerable.<eos> I can't put you all in danger.
- Yes, she was.<eos> She's the White Martian.<eos> Now you really better put that away.<eos> But it could be her.<eos> It could be any of you.
- But this is off the charts... - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm not jealous. Okay?<eos> I'm angry, because you have an unfair double standard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you,
Dad, the uh, the damage to your hand is...<eos> It's extensive. It's a punishment for helping Mon-El and Kara escape.<eos> But I would do it again, in a heartbeat.<eos> I'm so lucky you found me.<eos> I'm so lucky to be back with you two.
No, sweetie. If I'm going to move forward, I can't ignore my past.<eos> Cadmus...<eos> Changed me, they tried to break me.<eos> But in the process, they made me dangerous.<eos> I know their weaknesses, and I'm here... To work with all of you to make our planet safer.
If you do it... I'll understand.<eos> You are always the best part of me.<eos> No, the green wire attaches to the other green wire.<eos> No, the other green...<eos> I... I'm gonna head over to you.
- Not yet.<eos> Now, I have to go check down on the mainframe and then once we get the systems back online, I can run a diagnostic...<eos> Quick as you can. I want to know what we're up against.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How are you both?
Winn, you know what you need right now?<eos> If you say "a drink", I swear, I...<eos> Oh, I was going to say "deep breath", but that is a much better idea.<eos> 'Cause Zakarian Ale always takes the edge off. I'm gonna go get a bottle.<eos> Like I said to the other guy that came in to talk to me, I got nothing to say to you people.
She's been involved in a string of art thefts.<eos> I've never heard of her.<eos> -Come on, blonde hair, blue eyes.<eos> The chin of a serial backstabber.<eos> Even if I did know something, why would I tell you?
-No! Mother, that woman is the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> The best thing I know.<eos> And whether we're together or not, being near her, it makes me a better person.<eos> It makes me the person that I want to be.<eos> I wish you no ill will, but you should leave this planet and never return.
That's lovely.<eos> Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.<eos> You know what was us?<eos> You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?
I'm not going to let you get in my way now.<eos> Your family awaits you.<eos> No!<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll go with you.
Oh, you use half this much gusto in springing my dad, you'll have your sister back for game night.<eos> Kara!<eos> We're done here.<eos> Hey. You know what'll be fun?<eos> Finding out which one of you loves her more.
I'm going to make a society worthy of you.<eos> So get comfortable, Lena.<eos> You are where you belong, beside me, presiding over this new world that we will create together.<eos> People of Earth, do not be afraid.<eos> We have crossed a sea of stars in order to bring you a new way.
The Prince, and his beautiful, brilliant bride-to-be.<eos> Finally, all is right with our worlds.<eos> I'm insane to even try to get through to you, Mother, but here goes.<eos> Lena and I are not getting married.<eos> You can make this easy, or you can make this hard. But there will be a wedding, and you will produce an heir...
So good.<eos> You know what I just realized?<eos> The first time we met was when the President got attacked.<eos> Makes this kind of a full circle thing for us.<eos> Though there are many stars in our celestial kingdom, only one will lead you down the correct path.

- That's my girl.<eos> - I can lead us.<eos> And I can punch.<eos> Let's go.<eos> As your Prince, I order you to lay down your weapons and let us go.
Ooh! Sorry, bit nervous.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah, so, I just wanted to say that...<eos> Well, we all loved Mr Humphries.<eos> I'm sure some of you are troubled by the fact that he took his own...
Yeah, so, I just wanted to say that...<eos> Well, we all loved Mr Humphries.<eos> I'm sure some of you are troubled by the fact that he took his own...<eos> What he did. Um, and,<eos> I don't think I'll be do my job as head of upper juniors if I didn't say that if any of you are thinking of... doing something like he did, then, you know, don't.
- She wants an amicable divorce. - That's nice.<eos> Ah, when your life falls apart it's nice to keep things nice.<eos> I'm going to give her half of everything.<eos> Including Geoffrey.<eos> What's happening with you and Sharon?
They'd know their way around a woman's body.<eos> Stop saying stuff like that and looking over at Wallace!<eos> What do you think of it?<eos> Well, if you have to move it seems like as good a place as any.<eos> Could Rob just not save you both all this grief and go back to his job?
Oh, yeah.<eos> I mean, you know, for me, it's yes.<eos> I don't want to speak on Sharon's behalf, but...<eos> Right, yeah, I mean, for me, it's, erm...<eos> But I just think out of respect for the question and for you guys, it's something, you know, we should discuss at home.
You spent half a decade as Marcel's prisoner, now let me take Hope.<eos> Hayley is distraught, stay and comfort her.<eos> If this is indeed a trap, if Marcel is intent on killing us... your daughter needs a father.<eos> We're all going.<eos> She needs me, I need both of you.
I did terrible things to find my family, Elijah.<eos> And when I did, they were already dead.<eos> And now I find out that the same people who killed them are... the ones who hurt Hope.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I will not let anything happen to you.
Why help a Mikaelson?<eos> Your brother murdered us.<eos> I am not my brother.<eos> I have been a friend to witches for centuries. I...<eos> I even taught you lot how to make these things.
You Mikaelsons, you're the oldest family in the whole world.<eos> You're the oldest family of all time. You've seen empires rise.<eos> You've seen empires fall.<eos> You've seen ages begin and end.<eos> And yet somehow, despite every single thing you have seen with your own eyes, you fail... you fail to see the obvious. You don't get the takeaway.
Tonight, we celebrate an alliance between our family and Marcel Gerard.<eos> Unfortunately, as is his custom, Marcel is unfashionably late.<eos> So until such a time as he graces us with his presence, let us all raise a glass and salute the glorious city of New Orleans.<eos> But, before we do, my brother and I wish to acknowledge a painful truth.<eos> Our relationship with this city, and indeed with most of you, has been long and complicated.
It prefers the power channeled by the death of someone like you.<eos> Old, ancient, imbued with magic.<eos> But it needn't feed on you, your brother or niece or anyone else you care about.<eos> Marcel Gerard will do nicely.<eos> Why would I give you Marcel Gerard?
It left me with absolutely nothing.<eos> Now, I hate vampires.<eos> I hate Klaus Mikaelson more than any of them.<eos> And I'm willing... to stand beside him against that thing that you call your master.<eos> Now, that right there should show you just how bad your master actually is.
Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we have here an errand boy of the Hollow.<eos> A disciple of the very darkness that threatens to devour our city, your loved ones... and mine.<eos> Now, whether or not you despise us, my family will do everything in its power... to remove this scourge from New Orleans.<eos> I recommend you do the same... or else.
And should any of her suitors fail to meet my expectations, I'll compel them to the priesthood.<eos> Oh, look, Harvest Girls.<eos> I assume you speak on behalf of your Ancestors.<eos> Provided that you've come in peace.<eos> Well, that depends on you, doesn't it?
If you want answers, we have to guide you to the Ancestors.<eos> - But since you aren't witches...<eos> - We need to bend the rules.<eos> - How? - Simple loophole. You're both bound by blood to a New Orleans witch.<eos> We can use the link to your child to cast a spell and link you to an audience with the dead.
I wasn't sure you were gonna show up.<eos> Well, I'm full of surprises.<eos> I hope you intend to make our trip worth the effort.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> And you are gonna listen to every single word I have to say, because right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and the Hollow.
And how long, exactly, am I to play battery?<eos> You still don't get it, do you, Klaus?<eos> You're not a battery.<eos> You're a sacrifice.<eos> Tell me, which of you will die to stop me?
She still blames the Mikaelsons for what happened.<eos> You'll just make it worse.<eos> Davina.<eos> Don't try to stop me, Marcel.<eos> If I don't kill Klaus, if I don't put down the Hollow, she'll come for all of you.
That's Jews.<eos> Yeah, maybe you didn't hear her.<eos> We taking the bitch, so excuse us.<eos> Oh, so this is communism now?<eos> We give you whatever for free?
All morning, "I gotta go, I gotta go."<eos> Need to go to the bathroom!<eos> I think he gotta go big bathroom.<eos> I think that you need to shut the fuck up.<eos> We gave you a bucket.
No, wait.<eos> No, you guys, I don't want to steal your thunder or your lightning.<eos> I just wanna see justice.<eos> All right, I'll...<eos> I'll cover you guys from behind, then.
That is your job. Everything we have of value is in that room.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're not gonna be honest with us?<eos> Either of you?
And, technically, I'm only responsible for it.<eos> Whose money is it?<eos> Technically?<eos> His name is Omar Navarro.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?
Does that mean anything to you?<eos> - No.<eos> Who the fuck is a Omar Navarro?<eos> - Well, it should.<eos> - He's a guy you need to worry about.
- What do you mean, technically?<eos> - Checking. Technically, it's not my money.<eos> It's his and I'm... responsible for it.<eos> - Oh, fuck me.<eos> - So you need to think this through.
Guy who runs a drug cartel's a smart man.<eos> He wouldn't trust damn near $3 million to someone like you.<eos> Oh, he trusted me with eight.<eos> There's five more million under the bed at that motel in a couple of duffel bags and a suitcase.<eos> You guys need to know how big this mistake you're making is.
The only question you guys need to be asking is are you murderers?<eos> You steal that money, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> 'Cause there's another man who works for Mr. Navarro, a very serious man... and he's gonna come to town.<eos> He's gonna ask me where that money is. And if I'm still alive, I'm gonna have to tell him that the Langmores stole it.<eos> At which point he's gonna find someone with your last name and start removing their skin until he locates the rest of you.
- They have wrists?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sort of. Well, I... I didn't know you were gonna be up.<eos> I know you told me not to call.<eos> I was just... I was gonna leave a message saying that I'm okay and I hope you guys are okay. I...
- In my experience, a lecture.<eos> You brought the Vardy here, microbots to make your life so easy.<eos> But like every slave class in history, the Vardy are beginning to have ideas of their own.<eos> They wanted to eliminate unhappiness, but to a robot that meant eliminating unhappy people.<eos> They gave you monitors, badges, so they'd know when you were too unhappy to live.
You'd best make friends with them because there's loads of them, and they're the only ones who know how anything works.<eos> They killed our people.<eos> Well, look, they have forgotten about that.<eos> They've forgotten about you, they've forgotten that you even made them in the first place.<eos> Now, since they have absolute power over this city, and since I'm assuming you all don't want to sleep rough tonight, I have a suggestion for you...
I can't.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Do something... and save him.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend, but the danger isn't over yet.<eos> There must be more of you living rough here - tell me where.
Are you still fighting now?<eos> No.<eos> I moved on.<eos> I'm wondering why the Frost Fair's on this part of the river.<eos> I bet that at least one of you knows who paid Kitty to take people out on the ice.
- The ice is melting!<eos> - The ice!<eos> It's a mistake!<eos> The ice isn't melting.<eos> I swear to you, there's no thaw!
Can you hear that?<eos> Harry, look!<eos> No pinching anything, you hear me?<eos> And no staring like gapeseeds when the lady talks peculiar.<eos> Get a load of you lot.
I've been clear on this since college.<eos> Most people have that opinion in college and then they grow out of it.<eos> Stop trying to make me you, okay?<eos> I've chosen this life and I like it!<eos> You two need to find a new place now.
- No, thank you.<eos> Drinking is basic AF.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I guess.<eos> I'll get you some waters.
Right at your sides.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, close your eyes.<eos> I want you to imagine that you're on the beach.
It ended because you...<eos> What?<eos> All right, everybody, listen up.<eos> This is Tasha.<eos> Tasha is an actress, and she's gonna teach you guys an improv game.
This is Tasha.<eos> Tasha is an actress, and she's gonna teach you guys an improv game.<eos> Thank you so much, Jess, for that amazing introduction.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, as was mentioned five seconds earlier, I'm Tasha and I'm going to teach you an improv game called, "Yes, And..."
And on top of being very attractive, they also have really, really great brains.<eos> Yes. They have great brains.<eos> And I can tell because I just so happen to be a brain-eating zombie who loves kids' brains.<eos> Yes. I knew that.<eos> And I have something to tell you.
And your parents have already been stretching their money to make sure that they can pay for your college education.<eos> You don't know any of this yet because you're just a kid and they work really hard to shield you from that stuff.<eos> But, unfortunately, this creates a lot of tension between them.<eos> Sometimes, you hear them yelling at each other late at night when they think you're asleep.<eos> And it really scares you.

You're driving the car and you look in the rear-view mirror, and you see your kid with this big dopey smile on her face.<eos> I don't have a dopey smile.<eos> You're right, you have a beautiful smile.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, imagine that you're the mom.
[Natalia] That is like a big blooming...<eos> -[Lizanne] Rhino horn.<eos> -...rhino horn.<eos> I can't believe I'm leaving. I can't believe this day has come.<eos> I've built a really special bond with each of you.
That's why we picked him.<eos> He knows how to have fun. Mm.<eos> So what's the gossip?<eos> What really happened with Gemma Kensington?<eos> You know, her mother was just mortified. When it didn't work out between you two.
Now, you'll want to pick the gayest handkerchief you can find, since this will serve as your doll's head.
- Both.<eos> What?<eos> All for Helen.<eos> News flash, ladies.<eos> Those boys don't wanna fuck any of you.
You got chargers?<eos> We got no power, pendeja.<eos> Use 'em till they die.<eos> Well, that was pretty exciting, huh?<eos> I can't hear you!
Oh, shit, his dick's hard.<eos> Oh! That happens when I get scared.<eos> Or turned on.<eos> Please.<eos> I gave you tampons.
They don't know what they're doing.<eos> You don't know them like I do.<eos> That is one gay table.<eos> Look how the napkins match the little gingerbread houses exactly.<eos> If you like Christmas in Vienna, wait till you see Arabian Fantasy.
You should maybe check your iron.<eos> What if Caputo doesn't wanna come with us?<eos> Dude used to be a boxer or some shit.<eos> So, then you point the gun at his head and he'll change his mind.<eos> If I tell you something, will you promise not to tell Maria?
- Me, too.<eos> It's not too painful as deaths go.<eos> Except the part where your lungs deflate like an old condom.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Of course, I'd be happy to mix you some antidote if I wasn't trapped in this closet with two cue balls and a dirty mop.
Yeah, that's kind of the deal.<eos> Well, maybe she's right.<eos> You don't want it to lose its impact or whatever.<eos> Either you take 'em off or we cut 'em off.<eos> Would you look at those bloomers!
What's the point?<eos> And then what?<eos> So you'd have another hostage. Whee!<eos> And then, another strike on your record.<eos> You know what you'd be doing, actually?
- We'll get back to you.<eos> - That means no, doesn't it?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna disrespect Poussey with some 2,000 Leagues Under the Vajayjay shit.<eos> Thank you for your effort.<eos> I... I was already up here, but I really think hair dolls can work, you guys.
Like everybody coming together to create something beautiful and memorable.<eos> And what would that look like, O visionary warrior?<eos> You want to grunt an actual idea, maybe?<eos> So as you can see, it's, like... way less crowded out here than it is in the dorms.<eos> And also, we have a thriving artistic community, which I know is so important to you gays.
Hey, uh, let me test the echo in your love cave.<eos> I promise, you'll only like it a lot.<eos> Nichols!<eos> Oh, what's the matter?<eos> I'm not white enough for you?
- Didn't my assistant fill you in? - Mmm-mmm.<eos> The segment is called "Riot Girls."<eos> Although, I'm still pitching for "Litchfield of Dreams."<eos> We're on in ten, nine, eight, seven...<eos> I'm telling you, this where it's at.
Ay!<eos> Come on.<eos> That yellow brick road ain't leading no place but Max.<eos> The stars, ladies...<eos> I'm telling you.
-I might've dated a black guy once.<eos> They're gonna, like, revoke your Boston asshole card.<eos> I believe the term you're looking for is "Masshole."<eos> Hey, we all gotta experiment!<eos> You got Rumspringa...
I respect that, but this ain't no freebie.<eos> We need your help.<eos> You punched me.<eos> You took me hostage.<eos> Why would I ever, ever help you?
Nah.<eos> It's probably The Purge.<eos> Congratulations, Red.<eos> You got me.<eos> Oh, did Mommy not tell you about her secret plan?
I swear to God, if one more of these bitches tries to fuck me, I'm--<eos> -Nobody wants to fuck you, asshole.<eos> -All right, back off, boys.<eos> Yeah, simmer down, Anthrax.<eos> I'm gonna help you, okay?
You want a turn?<eos> I mean, we loosened him up real good.<eos> Everybody knows that puto loves to fuck for cash or whatever you got laying around.<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> Either one of you comes towards me, I will skin you alive.
It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.<eos> Oh, you're gonna have to do better than a pushpin.<eos> Teamwork!<eos> Ah, how do you like that, Fruit Brute?<eos> I will skin you alive.
- Dying is very, very bad. - Oh. Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?<eos> You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!<eos> You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.
You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!<eos> You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.<eos> But we're not gonna let them do that, are we?<eos> Because there is nothing wrong with you.
Here, let's put him in the chair.<eos> - One, two, three!<eos> - Two, three.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you, girls.
You, with the boobs.<eos> You, too.<eos> - Me?<eos> - No, her.<eos> One of you has an opinion, the rest of you are gonna suffer for it.
- She ain't wrong.<eos> We were just sitting here, minding our own business...<eos> Selfishly hoarding all of these supplies.<eos> It's not our fault we're enjoyable company... and Frieda invited us.<eos> There's also that part where the two of you made us look like radical Islamic terrorists on the news. Remember that?
Okay.<eos> If you just listen to me, I promise you, I promise you, I will tell you the truth, okay?<eos> Okay, it's...<eos> Whoa!<eos> Jesus, come on! What is wrong with you?
The MCC cunt.<eos> The one who every day, in every way, makes this shithole a whole lot shittier.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> But now that I'm in here, I realize how fucked up it is to treat people like... like variables affecting our net income gains.<eos> But I see you now.
Please don't... Ah!<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Gather the fuck round, bitches.<eos> I'd like to take a moment to introduce you to Miss Linda Ferguson.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> If it's not, I'll make the list... ok?<eos> Yeah, but if he's right, we don't need a patch.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be like this.<eos> There is a way out of the darkness.<eos> I can show it to you.
We'll get going.<eos> You're not up to it, Aunty.<eos> I'm not sitting around here using up supplies these buggers need.<eos> Besides, Nerida and Alinta are out there.<eos> I'll bring you whatever I can find.
Diaz reporting from the site of a raid by subhumans in which several courageous. Containment Authority officers lost their lives.<eos> This was clearly a planned attack rather than an opportunistic one.<eos> Pressure is mounting on the government to crack down on these violent creatures who continue to prey on innocent humans.<eos> Taylor Diaz, Channel 12 News.<eos> This shows that the streets aren't safe for any of you.
- Something's broken.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I can't heal right anymore.<eos> This is Waruu, isn't it?<eos> I messed both you boys up.
Get it?<eos> Girl on girl.<eos> - What?<eos> - So, like, Hulk Hogan?<eos> If one of you turns out to be Hulk Hogan, I've hit the fucking jackpot.
That move that looks like a catfight, but fancy.<eos> Did I say cunt punches?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> So, if any of you have a problem with, uh, doing a wrestling show... I suggest you leave now.
We bought a resort called the Blue Cat.<eos> And while I'm there today doing my job, your job is to get your boxes up into your rooms.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - What's Wendy's job? Getting groceries.<eos> If you don't like your jobs, you're free to go find a real job and help out the family.
How? - Technology.<eos> - I'll give you a ride.<eos> - No, thanks, I can Uber.<eos> Wendy, you know, you can borrow the minivan for the groceries, and I can use Buddy's car out back.<eos> - Do either of you want anything?
I know. I...<eos> I know.<eos> Linda, I have to call you back. Let me call you back.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Either of you, you fuck with my daughter, you come near my house again, it'll be you the vultures are picking at.
You or dad?<eos> You think I'm weird, don't you?<eos> - No. No.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Why should I believe anything you say when you've been lying to me my entire life?
- That's right. - The right to self-respect.<eos> Not to mention the respect of the customers, the respect of the employers, myself included.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah? I'm just...<eos> I'm happy to say that, uh, things are changing around here. All for the better.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Uh, in short... none of you are... are ever gonna have to give another blowjob again.
What kind of poppies?<eos> Now, why do I get the feeling that, right in the middle of my employee soirée, I'm being interrogated?<eos> I can't preach on the water for you anymore.<eos> - For me?<eos> - I'm gonna get you boys some lemonade.
Did you not hear what Marty Byrde said about it?<eos> He complimented it.<eos> So, he's a smart man.<eos> - He could teach you a few things.<eos> - I introduced you two.
We're leaving for a fishing trip after we drop off your table.<eos> Thank you for getting him out of the house. Oh.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> My mathlete son.<eos> I mean, you do realize you have to stand in a river for hours in rubber coveralls?
Get over here.<eos> Thought you had the afternoon shift.<eos> Gotta go to the store first.<eos> Come on over here a sec.<eos> Need to talk to you.
And you start packing.<eos> Just a few things, shit you can't live without.<eos> Leave the fucking Xbox.<eos> We'll get you another one.<eos> And do not open your mouths when you're in there.
I will call you when I get more information.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Yeah, I'd like to report an accident, please.<eos> Okay. You guys go brush your teeth.
I'll put these in some water.<eos> Ruth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're good.<eos> I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your father and your uncle.
I know I'm only two years older than you, but... And you're way fuckin' smarter than me...<eos> - No, I'm...<eos> - No, no, just fuckin' listen.<eos> I was thinking that... maybe I could call Social Services and see if they'd let me be your guardian.<eos> Not to, like, you know, give you rules and shit, but... more just so nothing can ever split us apart.
Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Hey, I went to bat for you guys.
I appreciate it. - No, man. I don't want your business.<eos> All right, man. I'll... I'll think about it.<eos> You want change?<eos> I just wanna say a big thank you to those of you who came out to the funeral last Wednesday of my dog, Pinot.<eos> It really meant a lot to me to have a lot of you there, especially so soon after the loss of my other dog, Noir.
Raven...<eos> - I like the beach.<eos> - Stay under the trees.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> The rest of you do the same.
Put down the gun. No!<eos> Team want to celebrate tonight.<eos> Do you want to come?<eos> Alex is not old enough for a party.<eos> I'm gonna get you guys a drink.
- Those are our orders.<eos> I will not allow my king to be assassinated.<eos> He doesn't have to be.<eos> I know Riley.<eos> Let me come with you.
Clarke.<eos> How'd you get here?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were coming?<eos> Honey...<eos> You're running out of time, Mom.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... thought maybe it'd help.<eos> It wasn't true.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Don't you think I would've told you that by now?
You are a lucky girl.<eos> - "Girl?"<eos> - Oh, jeez.<eos> Twenty-three years, I still can't get away with anything with you.<eos> You guys seem like you're doing good.
Okay.<eos> - Yes. You know this family's never gonna let you on the inside.<eos> - They're my family too at this point.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Best thing you can do for John... is for you guys to get as far away from here as possible.
Please call me back.<eos> I really need you to call me back.<eos> All right. Bye.<eos> Okay, here's the situation.<eos> I cannot reach Roy, but I'm telling you, I cannot go any lower than that.
You paid that last time because we took a total loss last time.<eos> - We did that to show good faith to you.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Fuck. Okay, here's what I can offer you.
- He changes the time,<eos> - now he changes the place?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Would you go with you?
- [cell phone buzzes] - Not a thing.<eos> [woman] I'm learning how to enjoy a decadent McRib.<eos> Miss Updike told me to cut it into fourths and count my chews.<eos> Thirty, by the way. [Sam] I can't with you, and what's more, I won't.<eos> - [woman chuckles] - Look. For those of you who thought our ivory tower was immune to this type of shit...
Out. - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, excuse me.<eos> [exhales sharply] Dear white people, wow.<eos> Y'all really trying it.<eos> I get that being reduced to a race-based generalization is a new and devastating experience for some of you, but here's the difference.
He's talking nonsense.<eos> Why do they need a teacher?<eos> We all will have an affair with the teacher.<eos> Grandpa Ali, please show us the right way as an elder person.<eos> What shall I show you?
We all will have an affair with the teacher.<eos> Grandpa Ali, please show us the right way as an elder person.<eos> What shall I show you?<eos> God forgive me.<eos> If only I had the strength... I'd know what to do with you.
We are the best.<eos> We have never missed any of them until now.<eos> No matter who you send there, they will eventually mess things up.<eos> Guys, show a little respect.<eos> I don't know who told you this, but there is no such thing.
Be quiet.<eos> He's here.<eos> -Guys, give us your blessings.<eos> -They are yours, pasha.<eos> I wish we could go with you.
-Guys, give us your blessings.<eos> -They are yours, pasha.<eos> I wish we could go with you.<eos> Today, I'm feeling kind of blue.<eos> I wish we could set off with you.
You can only shit with those fat asses!<eos> By the way, Zerafet, yours is actually not that bad.<eos> Here you go, ladies.<eos> The magistrate told me to send the news immediately.<eos> This is not an issue that concerns you.
Let's go quick and hear the news.<eos> My God, please end this suffering.<eos> "We have assigned six warriors for you.<eos> The warriors have set off.<eos> May God's greetings be upon you."
We know that you're a pasha.<eos> Or are you a secret pasha?<eos> You were sitting on the back of that carriage like a sultan.<eos> Was that all a lie?<eos> Guys, would I come with you if I were a pasha?
Guys, I've just told you that I'm not a pasha.<eos> Well, we got used to calling you pasha.<eos> We can no longer call you anything else, right?<eos> Now, hear me out and listen to me carefully, guys.<eos> Our state put each of you on salary from the treasury.
Come on.<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Pasha, may God give you a long life.<eos> We'd like to ask you something.
Pashas never joke or lie.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> I'll be angry with you.<eos> You should take this seriously.<eos> Look, I'll give you very important and great news.
Guys, what are you doing?<eos> You said "lift", pasha.<eos> -Put me down. Put me down!<eos> -Put the pasha down.<eos> God knows what to do with you.
I'm not...<eos> -My pasha!<eos> I...<eos> These women would like to learn the orders of our vizier from you.<eos> Sir, you are given the whole authority by our vizier.
Otherwise, I'll stick you up the pasha's ass.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This might be unexpected luck.<eos> This pasha might assign me as the minister of the district.<eos> They won't find someone better than you.
-Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do!<eos> Ministers, do you accept to marry these women sitting next to you by approving the declared prices and with your free will?
The wedding night is soon.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> You can't chug that.<eos> Women are just like soil.<eos> If you cultivate her well, she will offer you lust in one hand, and compassion in the other.
So he poked you and ran away?<eos> Why? He poked you, but why not me?<eos> Tell me, who had a finger in this pie?<eos> Ministers! Ministers!<eos> I brought you Vizier's Finger.
I didn't do anything.<eos> Vizier's Finger is a kind of dessert.<eos> You'll eat it to get stronger.<eos> Pasha, people are talking about the wars you won and the lands you conquered.<eos> It's an honor to meet a warrior like you.
Especially, chubby or ugly women.<eos> The sultan's foreign women are slim, elegant, well-groomed and beautiful.<eos> And look at our women.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm not talking about you.
But, sweetheart with an exceptional face...<eos> Screw that sweetheart!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Keep this in your mind.<eos> I don't have anything to offer you.
Flirty Sadiye.<eos> I'll die for all of you, Sadiye.<eos> My prince, my prince.<eos> My handsome prince.<eos> We'll die for you, my prince.
We have work to do!<eos> Pasha, I have never spent a night like last night.<eos> I don't remember how many times I fainted and came to myself again.<eos> May God bless you.<eos> Thanks to you, we have everything.
No, that's better.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> There might be male djinns around me. Then, I'll fall into sin.<eos> The rest depends on my fate.<eos> If I marry the magistrate soon, maybe I will send you all to Hejaz.
I haven't seen any of our women.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They must be at the stream to wash.<eos> I really wonder how was their wedding night.<eos> Girls, how are you?
No, I'm meeting with Jameson on Monday. He controls the final shares.<eos> No, Swope has no clue.<eos> He's too focused on this tragedy they call a wedding.<eos> Look, if I was this poor Anderson guy, I'd get as far away from him as possible.<eos> So how do you guys make it work?
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.<eos> Fine, it's a beer, but it's a beer that we can use - to kill The Beast.<eos> - Meanwhile, Penny comes back with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.<eos> Yeah, super cool how they keep me from killing myself.<eos> And then Dean Fogg gives you all matching tramp stamps?
Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now?<eos> I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...<eos> The Beast can wait for five minutes.<eos> You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.<eos> Well, almost all of you.
- Don't touch me.<eos> - Sweetie?<eos> You kind of sound insane.<eos> Do I?<eos> Because I promise you... I will not go down easily.
So apparently, he left curses behind.<eos> Here, actually.<eos> So you think Eliot might be cursed?<eos> I mean, she was vague, but I mean...<eos> Did either of you notice that Eliot started acting strangely once he took a drink from the goblet?
Hey, can you still do this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What choice do we have?<eos> Okay, we should send El and Margo for help.<eos> Wait, you don't want us on the suicide mission with you?
Do you want to taste me?<eos> Yeah, he wants to taste you.<eos> Well, he's just gonna have to earn it, isn't he?<eos> What's he gonna have to do, baby?<eos> I want to see the two of you together.
But when I have an answer to your question, you'll be the first to know.<eos> Ah, Nancy!<eos> Well, I guess I'll see you around, Mr. President.<eos> Students should leave Winchester with more than just a degree and a beer belly.<eos> If you were a cat owner and only all cats were dying in America, if someone said to you, "All pets matter,"
I nicknamed my vibrator Idris.<eos> [Sam] Dear white people, having a black vibrator does not count as an interracial relationship.<eos> [laughs] "Dear white people," dating a black guy to piss off your parents doesn't make you down-- it makes you an asshole.<eos> [laughs] Dear white people, no, you cannot take me home to meet your parents for Thanksgiving.<eos> If you need a prop to prove how cultured you've become, get a handbag.
I told you about Assata Shakur.<eos> And what would she say about you overdrawing your bank account for a weave?<eos> You have a rat's nest on your head with a comb sticking out of it, running around campus trying to be Miss Blackety Black-Black.<eos> I wanted an avant-garde look, like Solange-- something that says, "I'm woke, but I'll also kick your ass in an elevator."<eos> Dear white people, let me tell you about yourselves when I don't even know who the hell I am.
- No, they won't. - Footballers like Ferraris.<eos> Yeah, and Bentleys and Range Rovers. - And Aston Martins.<eos> - Not this thing.<eos> To prove them wrong again, I decided to head for the nearby Chelsea training ground.<eos> These are people who understand cars, not like you two.
It would be... You probably know her.<eos> It's probably the same as her saying, "I hate cakes!"<eos> Yes.<eos> Mary Berry would agree with me, because if she made a cake that had been developed on the Nürburgring, someone would put fried onions on the top and completely ruin it.<eos> You'd have a Victoria sponge with onion on the top for no reason!
Stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> God.<eos> The French Secret Service didn't do a job as good as this.<eos> I'm not talking to any of you.
Bloody Nora!<eos> That is just... fabulous!<eos> I could have buzzed around this amazing machine all day, but there was still important environmental work to do.<eos> So, reluctantly, I broke off to rejoin my stranded colleagues.<eos> - Are you all right?
I don't mean to be hurtful or disrespectful, but erm...<eos> - Go on, spit it out.<eos> - Well, it's... just because we've been here, doesn't mean we necessarily have to go on to Wedding.<eos> Aw!<eos> It's me, it's not you.
That's faster than your car will go.<eos> In order to put a stop to this nonsense, I made us pull in at the next service station.<eos> Right, small cameras. We fix these to the dash where they can see the speedo, and then there's no cheating.<eos> Why have you got a dog?<eos> I shall show you.
I don't know yet.<eos> Friends, would you gather, please?<eos> - Mrs. Raven?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.
Friends, would you gather, please?<eos> - Mrs. Raven?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.<eos> Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families.
- Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.<eos> Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families.<eos> We know each other too well for me to... preach.<eos> Instead, I will talk to you here.
Get your hands off me!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck all of you!<eos> I know that my actions today appeared cold and callous, but I beg of you to understand that they are the opposite, that they are an act of charity, of helping a lost soul find her way to Heaven.
It's all right, Seiku. Best we stay out of sight for now.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> All set?<eos> Locked and loaded. I do, however, feel the need to reiterate:<eos> you're about to drive the last 10 barrels of hydrazine known to man, a cargo which Raven needs every last drop of, through hostile territory packed with warring clans, over uneven roads where one serious bump could cause an explosion that would not only kill all of you
Oh.<eos> No, no.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Consider this offering an act of solidarity.<eos> We're with you.
Or is this different back in Angel City?<eos> Front door was open.<eos> What do you need, Madison?<eos> Reassurance.<eos> You took us in and I thank you for that, but...
To be clear, Daddy's dead.<eos> Discuss.<eos> Here's the file on your death.<eos> And... the one on your father's.<eos> I want to say, Your Majesty, it's an absolute honor to have you back.
I want to say, Your Majesty, it's an absolute honor to have you back.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hill.<eos> What's on this disk is a little graphic, I must warn you.<eos> But if you... feel you need to see it...<eos> I'll let you have some time on your own, then.
And no need to any more, 'cause I've got you back.<eos> Right, I'll leave you to get some rest and then we'll get some more food into you.<eos> You are too thin, darling.<eos> I've been on the Paleo diet.<eos> I took a solemn oath to serve you all by calling to abolish the monarchy.
He's giving me the silent treatment and not responding to my texts.<eos> - Oh, for shit's sake! - I know.<eos> As impossible as it is to imagine your supremely eloquent emoji texts going unanswered, the palace private cameras are not a messaging service for you two.<eos> But could you tell him though?<eos> Is there something Liam's security detail - can help you with? - Don't be like that.
Go and lie back down.<eos> I'll be over shortly.<eos> Nice to have you back, old friend.<eos> I'm back, bitch.<eos> What about you, Princess Eleanor?
To be able to make a profit, selling this food.<eos> PARENTS ARE THE PILLARS OF A CHILD'S EDUCATION<eos> Now I am on this, I am going to say some words for all women who are going to watch this.<eos> I am going to send a message for all... all who are in the world, now that I can come out and say it here.<eos> I tell you, anything that you are going through, any test in life, any difficult situation you are going through, only be strong. Grasp the hand of God.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> Too much has been sacrificed...<eos> I know what's been sacrificed, boy.<eos> That's why you'll leave.<eos> Or I'll feed every goddamn one of you to the crows.
And right now, it is... teetering.<eos> And the only thing that can save it is us.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna draw a line on the floor.<eos> I'm not asking whether you're with me.<eos> You are with me, all of you.
Come on, come on!<eos> Congratulations, you just declared war on Walker's nation.<eos> Joe, call the patrols!<eos> Watch for perimeter breaches!<eos> They could be right behind you.
Action at the gate.<eos> - White flag, hold up.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> Hold your fire, Coop!<eos> Walker thought I gave you information that got you onto the reservation when you took Alicia.
I knew that was something I'd have to carry.<eos> I'd do it again.<eos> I'd live with the look.<eos> I'd do it a thousand times to protect her.<eos> To protect you.
- I don't smoke anymore.<eos> - I just... just in case.<eos> - It's all good.<eos> - This is why we source.<eos> "To uncover that which you hide from yourself."
- This is a family matter, Cal.<eos> Sarah, just get in the car.<eos> We're gonna go help Hawk.<eos> - Tell me what you need me to do, all right?<eos> I want to help you take care of this.
- What?<eos> - Get out of my ring.<eos> De-fucking-lighted.<eos> Ladies, get out your autograph books.<eos> I want you to meet the new star of GLOW,
Sometimes I'm a real klutz.<eos> A strange way to finally meet Mario.<eos> -Uh, Mario? -Mm-hmm.<eos> My husband.<eos> I hadn't had the chance to introduce you, but this is Carlota and Marga.
What are you doing here?<eos> You left it pretty clear how you felt about us this morning.<eos> Carlota, she apologized.<eos> Yes...<eos> I took it out on you when it wasn't your fault, so I'm sorry.
We won't get kicked out?<eos> No, Lola's bark is worse than her bite.<eos> Relax.<eos> When she goes to sleep, you can go home.<eos> Girls... could I stay here with you?
I see it as a king would see it.<eos> - Yet, King Alfred has other plans.<eos> - I'm to be married?<eos> A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?
You will need to be the same.<eos> Go back to your village, take care of your dead.<eos> Finan, hang three of the dead from the trees visible from the river!<eos> Lord.<eos> Take back what belongs to you.
Lord Uhtred is at the fortress, the burh.<eos> Will you fetch him, Finan? We'll be waiting in the hall.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> The man must have a priest for each day of the year.<eos> God be with you.
Are you aware of this?<eos> I'm not.<eos> When Aethelwold was here, he mentioned nothing of crossing into Daneland.<eos> What did he mention?<eos> He mentioned you, Lord, and how you took his crown.
My man saw warriors aboard your ship.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Three men only, Lord.<eos> It is a Northman.<eos> He wishes to speak with you, alone.
Uhtred, as always, it begins as a joy to see you.<eos> And you, Father Beocca.<eos> You look well. I am well.<eos> I would like you to meet Father Pyrlig.<eos> Lord Uhtred, I have heard much about you.
- I am sharing your joy!<eos> There is no joy!<eos> I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.<eos> Thyra will not go to Ragnar.<eos> She is happy here in Winchester with you.
Who is he?<eos> A thief, Lord.<eos> I serve Erik...<eos> Sigefrid's brother.<eos> He sends you good wishes.
Forgive me for not being awake to greet you, Lord.<eos> Bjorn has given me little rest these recent times.<eos> We understand.<eos> The gods are wanting true men.<eos> So, I thank you for being here, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Alfred sent a priest to negotiate with the Northmen...<eos> Father Pyrlig was once a warrior himself.<eos> While continuing his mission to be king of all of the English.<eos> I'm to be married?<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?
No, but I... I wish to join you, lord.<eos> Be by your side as my uncle was.<eos> No, we have no need of a monk.<eos> As a warrior.<eos> Lord, I wish to serve you as a warrior.
I would speak with the King often...<eos> You're of Mercia now.<eos> You are my queen.<eos> And you think you're a king?<eos> I call you queen because you mean that much to me.
You will lie on your belly.<eos> What's this?<eos> Disobedience?<eos> It's confusion, lord.<eos> Should I hand you back to Wessex?
Hear that, Boltan?<eos> He plans to kill you!<eos> Beware.<eos> I am afraid, lord.<eos> Spare me this trial, I beg you.
Finish him!<eos> Now I do not wish to kill this idiot, as I'm sure his mother loves him.<eos> But do I have your word, as warriors, that I am now a free man?<eos> You have my word, priest.<eos> If all your men fight like this, Alfred will have no trouble throwing you out of Lunden.
Out.<eos> All of you, out.<eos> You have the palest of skin.<eos> Unblemished.<eos> My touch offends you?
Am I not the first?<eos> You will not insult me...<eos> And you will not offer me lessons on how to plough a field!<eos> That is not what I was doing.<eos> Who is it that you've been with?
Do not, never... raise your shrill voice to me!<eos> You will see a priest and we shall find the truth of this.<eos> This is not love, that is the truth of it.<eos> You will see a priest!<eos> Father Beocca! I would like to speak with you.
Oh, dear...<eos> You are with us?<eos> Why would I not be?<eos> I am an Ealdorman of Wessex.<eos> Alfred has decided to give you this one last chance.
What we need now is a man.<eos> That's what the ladies want, and that's what the mama in your heart wants.<eos> I've been an author, psychic,<eos> Yelp reviewer, bus driver, former Yelp reviewer who got banned for using too many obscenities in a review for a children's theater, and a reader of half of one of Iyanla Vanzant's books.<eos> I've done the work, and for some reason, these people have given me a show to help you do yours.
Sure, you're definitely upset exclusively about that and not about that video of Sam and Gabe.<eos> Shit just popped up.<eos> Couldn't give a fuck what they thinkin'.<eos> So we're all cool with Sam dating a Abercrombie model?<eos> I mean, you two practically share panties, Jo.
Try having the same two options since 2000.<eos> All I got is The Joy Luck Club and Crouching Tiger.<eos> And kind of Kung Fu Panda.<eos> I like you, but fuck you.<eos> You do realize all we do is complain about things.
- And I can see why you would be. - Oh, yeah?<eos> I mean, you don't think I'm being unreasonable?<eos> I mean, no..<eos> I mean...<eos> Because not only did I pay a lot of money for those magical disappearing whores, I also paid you a lot of money.
No one's going anywhere in this storm.<eos> Then we wait for it to pass.<eos> When it does, there may not be anyone left to hunt for.<eos> Hunting for someone else to kill.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
Awesome.<eos> Wait up.<eos> - This really is such a nice surprise. - Hi.<eos> They needed to see you.<eos> No more than I needed to see all of you.
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...<eos> My sources say MacLeish overrode the FBI, preventing them from taking Lozano alive.<eos> I mean, why would he go out of his way to silence the man who attempted to murder the president?<eos> I brought this to show the White House that any effort to interfere in the Second Amendment rights will fail.<eos> I know you're facing an uphill climb.
I-I accept that I have no...<eos> I had no control over my mother or her love.<eos> And I-I let her go.<eos> And I surround myself with people who do love me.<eos> Loving begins with you.
I had no control over my mother or her love.<eos> And I-I let her go.<eos> And I surround myself with people who do love me.<eos> Loving begins with you.<eos> Love begins with you, but it rarely ends with you.
Don't you give a damn about family?<eos> Bea.<eos> Look, we hit enough of these houses.<eos> You ain't gotta live like animals no more.<eos> But if you give up now, you are exactly what they say you are...
Right!<eos> Just imagine it's like.<eos> Keeping a blackmailer on the line for 60 seconds so the cops can locate him.<eos> It's kind of like that.<eos> Do any of you play "Dreadnought"?
Well it's not an access code.<eos> How should I know?<eos> Maybe it's a reference.<eos> Sounds like serious mathematics.<eos> How are you two connected?
Those are my actual medals.<eos> She seemed more all-American.<eos> Just... We're...<eos> We got a different part for you. It's a big juicy part.<eos> Why don't I believe you?
- Ooh, I want an accent.<eos> - Me, too, but not British. Another one.<eos> All right, come on. We need to start thinking about the show.<eos> The gimmicks, the matches, who fights who, what props are you guys gonna be throwing around.<eos> I can't film you doing the hugging move for 20 minutes.
- My gosh, that's fabulous.<eos> - Ron, isn't that fabulous?<eos> - Very nice.<eos> Come over here, honey, have a seat.<eos> I would love to stay and catch up with you, but, you know, uh, actually, I... came in to check the time, and I gotta run to rehearsal.
- For who?<eos> For me.<eos> Self-esteem, hello?<eos> I can't look at you anymore.<eos> Any of you.
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!<eos> - Hi, it's Justine.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - I wanted to see if you'd split a pizza.
No. No demos, no talking.<eos> It's a formality. You guys are just window dressing or... patio furniture dressing.<eos> Oh, here we actually go.<eos> Sam!<eos> Girls, I'd like to introduce you to the CEO and paterfamilias of this whole operation,
This way you can see what she can do.<eos> All right? Just watch, Debbie. Watch.<eos> So, I've been working on these opening moves called<eos> "the hammer and sickle."<eos> I'll just show you. I'll just show you.
And trust and thrift.<eos> Oh, my God. You sound like a Protestant.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> If any of you have any information about the whereabouts of my video camera, or if any of you happened to steal it, bring it the fuck back now.
- You're lucky Dad's on the road.<eos> I'm not here to apologize to him.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We need your help.<eos> We came to train with you, the Lumberjacksons.
Um, does anybody know how to play piano or keyboards?<eos> I do.<eos> Good.<eos> I have a job for you.<eos> Uh, also, I guess I should try to bolster you all.
We can settle the whole matter over brunch. Brunch? Yes, it's a word for the combination of breakfast and lunch.<eos> We know what brunch means.<eos> Oh, good, then you'll have an easy time with the menu.<eos> Captain Sham's invited us all to a restaurant to talk this over.<eos> You've already spoken with Captain Sham?
Josephine jumped out of the window of her own home late last night.<eos> Didn't you hear? I didn't realize this was a sad occasion.<eos> In that case, allow me to recommend the Cheer-Up Cheeseburgers.<eos> The pickles, mustard and ketchup make a little smiley face on top of the burger, which is guaranteed to get ya smiling', too.<eos> So make sure you look inside before you eat it.
Good point, Poe. - He isn't Captain Sham.<eos> - He's Count Olaf.<eos> I understand that losing your parents and your home has had an emotional effect, as I imagine it would have on many people.<eos> I've done the best I can to find a suitable home for you, but nothing I do seems to be good enough.<eos> And now, faced with a perfectly legal last will and testament that will place you in the care of a sailor you met yesterday, you start to spout these wild, McCarthyesque accusations.

And the parents I remember would've wanted us to help.<eos> Then we go back.<eos> Trying to run away, are ya?<eos> SIR: I'm not an idiot.<eos> I've been trying to figure out what to do with you since you caused that accident that crushed a man's debarker dispenser.
That glib attitude will get you nowhere.<eos> Now, you wanna hear the good news or the bad news first?<eos> The... the bad news.<eos> There's a local receptionist who wants children of her own.<eos> You make one more mistake, and I'm gonna be forced to sack you and send you to live with her.
The name Paltryville was a misnomer.<eos> And then one day, the whole town burned down in a terrible fire.<eos> Luckily, the lumbermill survived... and the eye-shaped building, which actually belongs to...<eos> Oh, look, here we are.<eos> Uh, children, I'd like you to meet...
No rules, no curfews.<eos> (SIR OVER PA) Lights out.<eos> But it's only six o'clock.<eos> Oh, boy, more time for dreaming.<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'm Phil, and I am excited to work with you kids.
- They'll believe that.<eos> They've seen you dance.<eos> I don't know what's going on here, but we need to... (FLACUTONO OVER PA) Baude-liars!<eos> - We need to...<eos> - I'm talking to you, lumber brats.
Go to the very fancy door.<eos> You have visitors.<eos> Ah, there you are, children.<eos> Now, I know your time here hasn't been peachy, but your luck is about to change.<eos> Because I brought you... this peach. (CHUCKLES)
Maybe I can provide some insight.<eos> -Uh, actually I--<eos> -Lionel wants to do this alone.<eos> Will you excuse us, sweets? Sure.<eos> Take all the time you need.
No, she's not when she's with me.<eos> -What about Coco?<eos> -What about Coco?<eos> Look, am I here with Coco, or am I here with you?<eos> I dare any of you motherfuckers to be on the wall during this jam.
Set it on purpose, Marilla!<eos> And they nearly burned to a crisp in their beds!<eos> Now, if you would've asked for my advice on this matter,<eos> - which you didn't do... - Sugar?<eos> ...I would've told you, for mercy's sake, not to think of such a thing, that's what!
There is a way out now.<eos> When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.
Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.<eos> If not, there's the door.<eos> No one here will judge you if you leave.
No more drugs.<eos> Harper, are you ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> None of you are.
You call this justice?<eos> I call this making things right, thanks to my brother.<eos> You let this happen.<eos> How many of us have to die?<eos> You're lucky it's not all of you.
No one wanted this.<eos> Want's got nothing to do with this.<eos> Skaikru gets 100 beds, same as everybody else.<eos> Bellamy gets one of them.<eos> The rest is up to you.
Something's coming, a wave of radiation that will kill everything in its path.<eos> What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands?
Mom, look, Raven needs our help.<eos> I know the way to the island.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> Well, you be safe.<eos> There'll be a place for both of you when you get back.
At these radiation levels, any amount of exposure is harmful.<eos> Keep the suit sealed at all times.<eos> You have 23 hours until the death wave hits.<eos> On a good day, it takes 10 hours to get to the island and 10 hours to get back.<eos> That doesn't leave you much room for error.
Octavia, please.<eos> You got to stop this.<eos> You're Skaikru.<eos> You're one of us.<eos> I'm one of you?
- And I'll join you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mom, Raven needs our help.<eos> You have 23 hours until the death wave hits.<eos> That doesn't leave you much room for error.
This is it.<eos> We are all that remains of the human race.<eos> I won't lie to you.<eos> The next 5 years won't be easy.<eos> There will be days when we wish we were out there right now, but I promise you, if we stand together, if we are wonkru, then... _
It's probably a bad idea to drop the thing that's gonna save our lives, huh?<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> Focus on me.<eos> Tell me about Harper.<eos> Hey, you guys seem pretty serious.
Clarke's not back yet?<eos> By now she should be on her way.<eos> Everybody, refill your O2 tanks and load up.<eos> Remember, we'll have an hour each.<eos> Don't turn them on till I tell you, and after that, breathe easy.
Look, every one of these surgeries is tied to a timed shot.<eos> I have another couple who took a shot at 22:00 tonight, another at 22:30, another who did it at 23:00,<eos> 23:30 and so on...<eos> We follow.<eos> And if I reschedule with you, it means another couple loses their chance.
That's your big complaint in life?<eos> You know what it is about these fatties?<eos> Do you know what it really is?<eos> They have no respect for the amount of sacrifice and dedication it takes to truly get in, like, magazine-level shape, which is the...<eos> You ever try to get abs? You ever tried to get all the abs down here? You ever tried to do it?
He just knew, "I'm gonna take my fucking shirt off.<eos> I don't want to get trashed."<eos> He was shredded.<eos> Yeah, go be a fucking postman.<eos> I mean, I don't know what to tell you.
We did that breakfast thing as a favor.<eos> We were just trying to freak out IHOP.<eos> 'Oh, we're doing it, too!<eos> We're doing it, too! '<eos> Your own mother won't make you pancakes at three o'clock in the afternoon, okay?
Like, "What are all these people doing in my road?<eos> They must be eliminated!"<eos> I don't know. Like, how do you not fucking bring it up?<eos> It's 'cause it would freak everybody out, you know, that you have to start maybe taking some measures... to start thinning out the herd.<eos> Do you feel that?
Can I write that number on this piece of paper?<eos> All right, tell me where to go."<eos> I'm telling you, if you guys could just get past the humanity of what I am suggesting...<eos> If you could just get past it and maybe lose a couple of friends here or there...<eos> I am telling you, you wouldn't miss them.
It has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world, and mine, right?<eos> Just let it go. I don't give a fuck if you watched every episode of McHale's Navy.<eos> This is still not about you.<eos> It's not a military issue.<eos> I'm telling you, you wouldn't fucking miss 'em.
You're bringing it up in the Ryman.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> It's the Grand Ole Opry, man!<eos> It's not MTV Raps!"<eos> But I'm stereotyping you. I'm acting like 'cause you're from the South, you're racists, like all the racists are just down here.
People aren't seeing what I'm saying.<eos> I wore a country shirt.<eos> Things are getting a little off the rails here."<eos> Can I get back to Kanye West?<eos> Half of you have probably downloaded his shit. All right? All right, here we go.
"My biggest regret is I'll never get to see myself perform live."<eos> Dude, you put that ego in a white dude, then it's...<eos> "and the blitzkrieg, and the superior race!"<eos> "Vienna will return to Deutschland first!"<eos> No, I'm telling you.
Or maybe it just hit the back legs and it tried to crawl away, but it was... it was, like, stuck to the road, and it was... it was meowing out and it could see its breath.<eos> And right before it lost consciousness, the rats came in, and it was... it was just screaming, and in such...<eos> Cute little paws, it was like little socks, trying to get up.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> But you seemed so fucking concerned about this kitten... I figured I'd throw out a couple of theories.
Get in the car and fucking get out of here.<eos> Take the kids, drive down the street.<eos> Go see Lord Of The Rings a couple of times, and leave your man in the stunned silence of what you just did.<eos> If you ever want to see your guy get emotional, to see a man get emotional, you make him a fucking sandwich that he didn't ask for.<eos> I'm telling you, he's gonna have to dry the tears with the bread.
Without it, we lose our bearings. And we can even lose our minds.<eos> The truth is, we can't always count on light to be there for us, to soften the corners of our dangerous world.<eos> But tonight, the big secret of the AL is finally out.<eos> Tonight, on the darkest night of the year, the dead moon,<eos> I will need your matches, your flashlights, your lanterns, your candles, anything you might have brought with you to give you warmth or light, to ease your journey.

Oh, he's VideoChatting... Aah!<eos> Aah! You're okay.<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> Hi. It's Dr. Robbins.<eos> Hey, yeah, um, we're about eight blocks away from you guys.
Is he the one you like?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What? Look at him.<eos> Ma, okay.<eos> Everyone, thank you.
Once we remove that met that's obstructing her bile duct, her liver enzymes will go down, and she's in.<eos> Um, Meredith doesn't feel that surgery is wise.<eos> Meredith is no longer on the case.<eos> And now that I know about this trial, there is even more reason to do the surgery.<eos> And I'd like one of you to do it.
A wake that... fades into the distance and disappears.<eos> Vanishes altogether.<eos> - Can you picture this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Now let me ask you a question.
- You know that's not what I meant.<eos> But thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> I'm not into her, man.<eos> I got London, remember?<eos> Is everything okay between you two?
You're gonna make my gun go off by "akskident."<eos> [Kimmy growls and barks] -Who is it?<eos> -[Wendy] Hello?<eos> I'm Wendy Hebert.<eos> Which one of you is Kimberly?
- What song?<eos> - The song I hate almost as much as I hate these hypocrites, like God Johnson.<eos> Hypocrite?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I see some similarities between the two of you.
That man is not my father.<eos> Well, good thing, 'cause he might be our killer.<eos> Whaaat?<eos> My God, Ella, how do you know that?<eos> I'll tell you how I know that, because our victim was bald.
I'll do nothing of the sort.<eos> Fine. I'll show you out, if you insist.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> But the detective and I have got everything handled now.<eos> This is far too important to leave to just the two of you.
Were you drunk this time?<eos> - No. - Me neither.<eos> My November rent.<eos> Only fair, 'cause I didn't give you any notice.<eos> No. Hope it works out for you, rebound girl.
- Don't do this.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - Don't pause it.<eos> Okay, could everybody... raise their glasses? Drinks up.<eos> We have some very exciting news we want to share with you because, really, we're more like family than neighbors.
You know, maybe -- maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but real God damn soon.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> You know, unemployed polygamists?<eos> Oh, yeah. You should just shave your heads and get, like, crazy tribal face tattoos.
I'm sorry for making you feel like the odd man out.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And I'm sorry for keeping the "girl-girl-girl" thing from you.<eos> I know that's a big part of what you're feeling.<eos> Well, I'm sorry if I "subtextually" acted out instead of just talking to you guys about it.
Chardonnay. This shit is a revelation.<eos> So beautifully complex.<eos> I feel ashamed about any prejudice that I brought to this experience.<eos> - It is good. - It's good.<eos> Not sure I'm getting quite as much out of it as you, but...
You sound like Izzy. Okay.<eos> Once more, I am not the one who had the emotional affair.<eos> - I am not the one who...<eos> - Hey, I know I'm probably, uh, risking some peril wading in here, but, um, I just got to ask one question.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you Trakarskys?
Whoa.<eos> Okay. There's the peril.<eos> I see it. I'm out.<eos> Let me put it a little more delicately.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you Trakarskys?
Let me put it a little more delicately.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you Trakarskys?<eos> Izzy and I had a firm agreement that Jack has to come crawling back on his hands and knees and grovel for forgiveness.<eos> Is that followed by the ritual castration, head shaving, and walk of shame?<eos> You might want to consider morable terms for his surrender.
- Let's do this thing.<eos> - I'm ready. - I'm gonna end you.<eos> You want to go?<eos> - Yeah, I'm ready to go. - You think you're so tough?<eos> I feel so comfortable with you two already.
"Boo-yah, motherfuckers!" [Laughs] Love it!<eos> You are a crack-up!<eos> You love it?<eos> She's a crack-up?<eos> I'm 30-whatever and I still say "fudge" around you.
- Wellness center.<eos> There's the Hal I know.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Honey, you take care of yourself.<eos> I love you guys.
You guys were studying each other's... yeah, this... that's not going anywhere good, so, let's do some cramming.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> Hey, uh... girlfriend.<eos> Hey, boyfriend.<eos> I can hear you.
Someone drove him here.<eos> The Lord helps those who help themselves.<eos> So, um... my tumor's still in there.<eos> I'm so sorry, Holly.<eos> Oh, God, what did I tell you guys?
Finally, in order for this program to be effective, the American people all join in it.<eos> [announcer] Brooklyn, give it up for the Lucas Brothers!<eos> - Sorry for walking around you.<eos> - No, it's all good.<eos> - How are you guys doing?
But all drugs aren't created equal.<eos> We did shrooms a year ago for the very first time.<eos> And here's a rule of thumb:<eos> You should never do shrooms with a dude who looks like you.<eos> I'm telling you.
- All the teachers. - Yes.<eos> Then we would bring them to a room like this.<eos> Like this.<eos> And we would be, like, "Teachers of America,"<eos> we know you guys have suffered, "so we are going to pay you $100 million."
So, we're, like, "We're gonna write them a letter expressing our discontent."<eos> So, we're gonna share that letter with y'all today.<eos> "Dear Republicans,"<eos> what's good?<eos> We recently saw you on the TV making a defense for guns.
I really, really do.<eos> However, while you may hate waiting for a weed dealer, the consequences of a world without the War on Drugs are far worse for you.<eos> Dude, that's insane.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> I would like to show you a world without the War on Drugs.
I want to go back home.<eos> [Keith] We can't take this anymore.<eos> Can you take us back home, dude?<eos> All right.<eos> All right. I'll take you back.
Tell that to her beach house.<eos> I got to run upstairs for a second. Can you cover me?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Damn it, Flo.<eos> Which one of you is the smart one?
Huh?<eos> That's a lot of money!<eos> I told you we shouldn't go to that club. No, you didn't.<eos> You're the one who said we should go.<eos> Man, I'm never going out with you guys again.
All those who read the pamphlets came down with a mysterious illness.<eos> Whilst many turned their backs on the afflicted, fearing cholera, Master Jennings and the rest of the White House staff flung open their doors and vowed to conquer this epidemic by any means necessary.<eos> With symptoms ranging from high fevers to pulsing hot rashes, Master Jennings labeled the sickness<eos> "Influenza Incendium," or "Fire Flu."<eos> I must join you.
I must join you.<eos> Be still, let us tend to you.<eos> Mother of mercy.<eos> (demonic voice):<eos> I will join you. I will join you in the flames!
What farm?<eos> It's where the Internet happens.<eos> Big place for the Djinn to spread its infection.<eos> Hey, if this thing takes control of me, you get Alex out, no matter what.<eos> We will get both of you out. No.
Top of that list were you and Molly.<eos> - Mitch, I... - Nope.<eos> Before you say anything, just know that I think you're an amazing mom.<eos> I respect how hard you've had to work, and I don't want to mess that up.<eos> I just want to... want to take you out for pizza now and then.
We've had no contact with Malcolm for days, and serious decisions need to be made, so...<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> And here's my first decision.<eos> I've come to believe<eos> I don't need any of you anymore.
Malcolm, we'll get help.<eos> Well, thank you, Helen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't need your help.<eos> What I really need most of all is for each and every one of you to get out.
People suck.<eos> What I'm saying is, Koreatown has both a rich complex history and unique political challenges.<eos> That's what you've been saying, and saying.<eos> And, look, I could listen to you talk about redistricting all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us, it's not gonna track down itself, so if we could just...<eos> Point is, I requested some help for you guys, and it just came through.
You know, II've always been able to to see things.<eos> You know, visions.<eos> But I have no control over when or how I see them.<eos> Like, I don't know what happens next, Or how all of this is going to end.<eos> I guess why I'm telling you all this is because... like, I don't know if I'm "the one."
Get off my friend!<eos> All right guys, time out, come on.<eos> Come on, look. I know this may sound crazy, but doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this world?<eos> Yeah. Rory sold out the boss.<eos> To throw in with you losers.
I hate my family, and I hate that stupid crest.<eos> -What are you doing? -You could get kicked out of school!<eos> -If I'm lucky.<eos> [glass shatters] [sighs] Xanthippe!<eos> Look, either explain to me how this is part of a healthy sex life, or you two are in a lot of trouble.
I'm not gonna share any secrets I'm not supposed to, but those drugs were planted on him.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> But there's something bigger in play.<eos> That's why he crossed the border and kept it a secret.<eos> There's something he didn't want to share with any of you.
Uh... uh, let's see.<eos> She specializes in experimental drugs that reverse brain degeneration.<eos> Have you got a photo?<eos> Yep.<eos> Sending it to you guys right now.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's only because there are other people around.<eos> It's ok.<eos> We know you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I should have told you guys I was going there.
And then?<eos> A ship?<eos> A cage?<eos> I'm still to decide.<eos> I have given up Lunden for you.
As she should.<eos> She is our pathway to glory.<eos> What will you say to Alfred?<eos> What can I tell him but the truth?<eos> He will ask why she was with you.
What of her?<eos> We fear that she has been... taken.<eos> We pray that is the outcome, Lord.<eos> By the Northmen?<eos> Aethelflaed was with you?
Yes, he did, Lord.<eos> And yet this good man here will let you join him for one reason only.<eos> To embarrass Alfred.<eos> It's true.<eos> That may be the reason you allow me to join you, Lord, but I will give you reason to let me stay.
You have a bowl, you have water.<eos> I would like to bathe! I would like to breathe cool air.<eos> I am beginning to feel sickly.<eos> My brother suggested you bathe inside a barrel in full view of all men.<eos> Lady I will arrange for you to bathe with privacy, but in return you must eat the food we provide.
But Mani is chased each night across the sky by Hati the wolf.<eos> My mother did not want me to be chased by wolves.<eos> I saw the moon, the clear sky and I wanted to share it.<eos> I'm glad you thought of me.<eos> It was either share it with you or with my brother.
My husband does not see me.<eos> Then, he's blind or stupid.<eos> He is not blind.<eos> And he is not gentle, I would guess.<eos> He is the one who mistreats you?
You!<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> Odda, you are drunk.<eos> I sincerely hope so, I can barely see.<eos> At your age, it is not good for you.
But what is it we want?<eos> Alfred wants his daughter, that is plain, but is that best for Mercia?<eos> Is that best for Aethelred,<eos> Lord of Mercia, and Lunden, and more, perhaps?<eos> My advice to you, Lord, is rescue her by all means, but not at a price that will cut our throats.
We will not.<eos> We have come here in peace and as equals.<eos> You've made us walk a good distance to meet you. That is respect enough.<eos> You should have joined me, Uhtred.<eos> If you wished me to join you, why have a dead man tell a prophecy?
I have arranged your release.<eos> You will soon be coming home.<eos> Have you spoken with Erik?<eos> I have.<eos> What has he told you?
There will be no rest.<eos> None.<eos> A life with Erik is what I want.<eos> It is best for me and it is best for Wessex.<eos> I can say this to no-one but you.
I can ask no-one but you.<eos> Will you help us escape?<eos> Lady, I am sworn to your father.<eos> If I help you and succeed, he'll have me killed, but more than that, you are asking me to sanction your own death.<eos> No, what I am asking is for you to allow me to live!
No, what I am asking is for you to allow me to live!<eos> I will not be the treasure that builds an army against my father. That will not happen.<eos> Never.<eos> I will leave this place with Erik or I will not leave at all.<eos> Uhtred, I am asking you to save my life and with it the nations of Wessex and Mercia.
Yes, Lord.<eos> This cannot be how it ends.<eos> Lord, you have said all you can say.<eos> And bravely.<eos> There's nothing more for you to do, so I beg you do nothing.
Erik is in command, his men guard Aethelflaed, his ship is ready and waiting.<eos> It begins, it's simple. What happens is fate.<eos> Well, why go by river and not horseback?<eos> If we go with the tide it'll be faster, and to escape we row across river.<eos> They will follow you.
Of course I'm spying for Alfred, I despise the sea.<eos> Should Odda decide to do anything rash, you will tell him to hold fast?<eos> And why should he listen to me?<eos> Do you have a reason you would like to share?<eos> He is behind you.
On my life.<eos> I have no memory of it whatsoever.<eos> Lord, I dare say this to you as your friend do nothing.<eos> If I do not see you again, Uhtred of Bebbanburg,<eos> I wish you good luck, wherever fate may take you.
We attack as soon as it's dark.<eos> Brother.<eos> May I speak?<eos> I've something to say!<eos> I have something to say to each of you.
We go!<eos> She's escaping with Uhtred!<eos> I want them dead!<eos> Everyone after them!<eos> Lord, I'm grateful to see you, as are my men.
And perhaps within me.<eos> And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you swear?<eos> You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
As my oathman.<eos> I would have liked to have seen my land of Devonshire once more.<eos> How did it look?<eos> Devonshire was beautiful, Lord.<eos> God be with you.
Quickly, hurry up!<eos> How long will that hold?<eos> Not for long.<eos> Now bring her through, where we can have a better look at her.<eos> You do realise the beast now knows where we are?
We're not Roman.<eos> We're not part of the Roman army.<eos> No, we're not even slightly Italian.<eos> I mean, I do a mean spag bol.<eos> Let me tell you about the Romans.
No. No, no, no.<eos> We just don't know where she is.<eos> Not the same thing at all.<eos> Come on!<eos> I'll tell you about the Lusitania later.
18.<eos> Right, listen to me.<eos> All of you.<eos> I'm going up there to find my friend.<eos> If you come with me, I can't promise that you won't all die. But I can promise you this.
It's about how I want to live.<eos> I don't just want to be a crossing guard. I want to learn how to really think.<eos> Just tell us who you voted for.<eos> - Well, it's a classic Buridan's Ass. - Thank you.<eos> I don't know which one of you is right about the sludgefront, but Spinoza said I had to make a choice.
You can't do this yourself.<eos> Emma's right.<eos> I have to.<eos> If I don't, this won't just end with Robin getting hurt.<eos> She'll hurt everyone I care about... all of you.
The second you leave those poor bastards alone, they'll try to conspire a way to get you out of their house.<eos> You need to get the kids to bed? That's OK.<eos> I'll give you a hand with bath time.<eos> Your husband is having a heart attack?<eos> Let me run you both down to AE, you lying shitbags.
Doctors?<eos> Daffodils?<eos> Dragons?<eos> Debauchery.<eos> Well, that is lovely to hear cos I'm expecting you boyses to throw me a memorable send off for my leaving do Friday.
It's on the system.<eos> Under Tiernan.<eos> I don't know how to work it.<eos> Oh, come on, get out the way, will ya?<eos> Let me demonstrate to you the power of technology.
We're getting in the car this instant.<eos> - Right, your dad can do better than this.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Run!<eos> What I really wanted to show you was this creation.
I seriously had no idea how Donna's twin peaks ended up in Spielberg's second act but I was pretty fucking certain who was to blame.<eos> I can explain.<eos> Right, you're going to get out there and recall every fucking copy I've sold before someone else's kids discover ET stands for - Extra Titties.<eos> - Straight away. I'll take care of it.<eos> Shit, boys, you'd better look at this.
Are you sure you should be here?<eos> I told you, Vincent and I had a little sit down, cleared the air.<eos> Now take a seat, Carol.<eos> In fact, Vincent practically begged me to come by and share with you my life-changing news.<eos> And I know you'll be amazed.
Now our bassist has broken his arm, and we need a replacement for tonight's warm-up gig.<eos> Then, and I don't know if you're up for this, we're going to be heading up north to tour to support the miners.<eos> Love supporting the miners.<eos> "Support The Miners!"<eos> I could well be interested in coming on the tour, thank you.
I always wanted a Chopper.<eos> Ape-hanger handle-bars and the old suicide clutch.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> Yeah, well, we're a bit short of cash so I had to sell my car... so, yeah, that's embarrassing.<eos> Come on. I'll drive you guys home.
- What's happening?<eos> - It's an exorcism.<eos> Don't worry, she's a professional white witch.<eos> Oh, good, because just for a second there I was worried.<eos> There. It's gone. You shouldn't have any more trouble.
I almost felt sorry for the poor sap.<eos> No hard feelings, eh, Tony?<eos> That's right, now fuck off in that Range Rover my hard graft allowed you to buy.<eos> Some hard feelings, clearly.<eos> Now, I appreciate the last few days have probably been a bit... unsettling, but as far as you boys are concerned it's business as usual.
I'm a working mom.<eos> It's my one chance a week to give my family something and make up for the time I haven't spent with them.<eos> Are you telling me that I have been giving my family... garbage?<eos> Wait, uh...<eos> Haley, honey, have I been serving you garbage?
- Yes?<eos> - Yes, well,<eos> Chef Dumont had the audacity to tell me that I can't cook. - Huh.<eos> - Mm. Luckily, this one was there to straighten him out.<eos> I'm gonna make you a celebratory dinner.
Peter, you have to listen to this.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Jesus Christ. Come and find me, Peter.<eos> Matthew, 10:27.<eos> What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light.
You know what?<eos> It's all right. No. I know exactly what you all think of me.<eos> But I'm not just a boozer, I'm a pill popper too!<eos> That's right.<eos> And half of you bought them from me!
Gosh, this bed is so comfortable, I could just fall asleep right here.<eos> I am...<eos> I am so optimistic for you guys and just feeling so positive about this.<eos> I know what I'm going to do.<eos> I'm going to buy you this bed.
And space to move on.<eos> It's not about moving on, it's about acceptance and closure.<eos> And, I mean, it was really expensive, it was, like, $30,000.<eos> How... How do you know that?<eos> You're staying with me, it's all you talk about and I read your mail.
That's my book, Wolf Trials.<eos> The book Ethan Turner and I were working on, Wolf Trials.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Wolf Trials!<eos> I was gonna just announce it right now to all you guys!
What...what I want to know is how he found out about us. ‐ I don't know yet.<eos> Um, everyone who could make it is here, so...<eos> Um, we'll talk about this later.<eos> ‐ Eddie... please, I need to talk to you.<eos> ‐ Eddie Lane, many of you know well, breached our security this morning.
‐ Sean needs to get away from him.<eos> ‐ Who is that man? ‐ I can't tell you.<eos> ‐ Can't or won't?<eos> I can't help you if you don't talk to me, Mary.<eos> That's why we're transparent. ‐ Yeah, except all of you believe in it, but no one really practices it.
‐ No, I have no problem with you knowing.<eos> ‐ Except this is not the time or the place.<eos> ‐ Knowing what?<eos> ‐ It's adult stuff, sweetie.<eos> ‐ Because of the two of you?
Eddie was just a pawn.<eos> Wow.<eos> I really...<eos> I really thought we were friends.<eos> You never much cared for my friendship when Steve was ill.
Wow.<eos> I really...<eos> I really thought we were friends.<eos> You never much cared for my friendship when Steve was ill.<eos> All you wanted was power.
Answer the question. No.<eos> Hank was not privy to any of this.<eos> I thought Bill was involved, though, right?<eos> Bill had nothing to do with this.<eos> I did what I did to you because I felt I had to, but I'll go to my grave burdened.
I...<eos> I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.<eos> I... want her to go home with me.<eos> We support you.
I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.<eos> I... want her to go home with me.<eos> We support you.<eos> She supports you.
Cheers to that.<eos> Our losing Steve continues to be felt, doesn't it?<eos> There have been growing pains. We've all felt them.<eos> And that's why we're so thankful to Bill for coming out to show his support.<eos> We... can't let Richard's misstep, his, inexplicable lapse in judgment, his betrayal... take away from all the progress that, you are... you all are making here.
After everything she's done, you're worried about a law suit?<eos> You deny her the only hope left.<eos> It's safer for you if she just dies! Put this on record.<eos> Who here knows more about this than Vilma?<eos> None of you!
- Yeah.<eos> Well, you guys should go together.<eos> - What?<eos> - Fuck that.<eos> What's going on between you two, it's stupid.
Look, Abby's had a full day, and almost a full keg.<eos> She's passed out on the couch.<eos> What?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> I just think everything with her parents and the baby and you guys hit her all at once.
Okay, Heather, I like you, okay?<eos> And the word's "forgotten," not "forgot," but I correct everyone.<eos> - Point is, I like you.<eos> - All right... She likes you, you like her.<eos> I like you both, and we all like pie.
- All right... She likes you, you like her.<eos> I like you both, and we all like pie.<eos> But really?<eos> 'Cause ever since Colt and I hooked up, all you've ever done is make bitchy little comments about my age or my intelligence. Okay.<eos> Maybe you're right. Maybe I didn't think you should be together.
Okay, I don't think that's necessary...<eos> Colt, don't interrupt her.<eos> Listen, it's not always gonna be easy, but... I wanna do whatever I can to be there for you and the baby.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... you guys are all good?
Trevor?<eos> Yeah, that's about right.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Are you all right?
All visitors must display appropriate credentials at all times.<eos> Open and close, please.<eos> You have damaged internal systems.<eos> Maybe next time, you can design me better.<eos> How are you?
Why doesn't that surprise me?<eos> I'm gonna have to draw some attention, see if I can access the basement that way.<eos> You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?<eos> I'm just here for the girls and the beer.<eos> - Can I help you?
Your friend.<eos> Now what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
You know, the scan also turned up a number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the Deep Dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
You chose those?<eos> They're tactical.<eos> - Always for the job.<eos> - What else I got?<eos> - They suit you.
I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.
You kill innocent people.<eos> "Innocent," is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?
What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell that they had built.<eos> How Project 2571 had failed, and they had to move on<eos> to you.
What is that?<eos> I can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do you see it?<eos> Togusa!<eos> Don't take the medication that they give you.
Get down on the ground, now!<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Mira.<eos> My God, you're safe!
It was inevitable there would be failures.<eos> How many?<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts before you.
My parents.<eos> The way they died.<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.
We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic, upload your data on the raid, find out exactly what Kuze told you.
There is no place for us here.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I will always be there with you in your ghost.
I knew you would do it, Xander.<eos> You brought the world to us.<eos> The world is big,<eos> The world is big, but always fits in your heart.<eos> Take it with you always.
The whispers I hear, these ghosts of yours are the real kind of trouble.<eos> They've got training, they've got funding, and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Okay, so, you're worried that I might get hurt?<eos> I'm worried you might get dead.<eos> You know, I'm touched that you can imagine a world without me in it.
And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.<eos> And if I can't do my job, then people die.<eos> And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?<eos> Literally no one.<eos> But I will make sure to keep you safe.
Perfect.<eos> Tennyson!<eos> You're gonna like this.<eos> I just happen to have the best hardware in the South Pacific.<eos> 30% off the top gets you our finest hospitality package.
But we were getting along famously until somebody decided to interrupt.<eos> Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.
Mate, seriously?<eos> A grenade?<eos> What is this?<eos> Eastern Europe in the early '90s?<eos> Next, he's gonna send you a fax.
And then Igor on the stairs.<eos> See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.
Stop.<eos> Okay, when Xiang broke the window,<eos> he's the only one that didn't flinch.<eos> I need the President on the phone...<eos> That's not gonna come off, you know that, right?
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?
I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Well, maybe Dawkins was involved in the robbery.<eos> Why would a guy who owns a bank need money?<eos> That is an excellent question.<eos> Do they teach you that at Quantico?<eos> - Rippin' on you. - Yeah, you think so?
Zeke. He parked outside the house for hours.<eos> I had to wait.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Always thinking.<eos> Hey, I don't know about you, but I'm starvin'.
- Why?<eos> - Well, that's not important.<eos> What matters is, I gotta figure out a way to get that money so we can get the hell out of here.<eos> What's to figure?<eos> Oh. What? You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?
Because if I ate your mommy's breakfast, I'd end up a fat fucking bastard like everybody else in this town.<eos> Let's just pretend Uncle Zeke didn't say that, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Sally.<eos> Do you mind if we drop her off at school on the way to work?
After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.<eos> I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.<eos> You make it sound so simple.
Andy, you need to turn yourself in.<eos> Turn myself in?<eos> Are you kidding me? With Chris dead?<eos> Now that's fucking felony-murder.<eos> Andy, I can't get you out of this.
Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just shot a cop and split town.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Not great, either.<eos> Has Ed been acting strange at all, lately?<eos> You notice anything?
- Oh, yeah?<eos> Then where the hell is Daddy?<eos> - He's working late, goddamn it!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're upset, too.
He went to get a passport.<eos> We're going to Mexico.<eos> Oh, well, that's smart.<eos> Ed's a smart guy.<eos> Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?
What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> Wow. That's a new one.<eos> Listen, I've. I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> About how you thought you'd left this life behind.
Well, I hope you brought a crossword puzzle.<eos> Okay. Good-bye.<eos> You move one muscle and I'll blow your fucking brains all over the wall!<eos> Okay, get his gun.<eos> You. You get his gun.
You move one muscle and I'll blow your fucking brains all over the wall!<eos> Okay, get his gun.<eos> You. You get his gun.<eos> You get his. Fuck!<eos> You get the gun!
It's going real good.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Come on! What is this, The Price is Right?<eos> How many times you gonna spin that dial?<eos> - Shut up or I'll shoot you.
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> What are you.?<eos> Let me see it. You think I care about the money?<eos> It's all federally insured anyway.<eos> You.? You don't care if I take the money?
Stop saying that. Ed.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.
I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.<eos> Look, it was at a friend's wedding that your dad and I first got it on.<eos> Open the door, I want to show you something.
Like a real, true minute which is a long time to stare.<eos> Tells me you got something brewing up here.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else? I'm gonna say something else.<eos> Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.
Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else? I'm gonna say something else.<eos> Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.<eos> Oh. Smile!<eos> Hey, just something for you to think about.
Right. So, I misread that entirely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you did.<eos> Sorry, I'm... I'm having an off day.<eos> Do you ever have that?
Just don't make a scene.<eos> Why does everyone keep saying I do that?<eos> Hey, Jerry Kepp.<eos> Uh-huh. Just a hypothetical.<eos> If someone offered you 20 bucks to go up to our room and read your book in the tub, would you? Say yes.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up.<eos> Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
That is why I'm here today.<eos> Rodriguez Hayes must be overjoyed.<eos> Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.
Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.
You never did.<eos> I was Francie's first choice for maid of honor.<eos> I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks. Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?
Of course not.<eos> Hello.<eos> I am Renzo representing House Eckberg.<eos> I'm Luke Pfaffler.<eos> Can I help you with something?
How did you...<eos> My sense of smell is my best feature.<eos> Was that a bread roll?<eos> Happy Anniversary.<eos> What's wrong with you?
You know, this isn't really dancing.<eos> This is dancing.<eos> Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.
What do you mean, "What do we do?"<eos> To teach that asshole a lesson. Oh, Lord.<eos> No, I don't want to do anything that will jeopardize my freedom to run my successful business.<eos> That's right. Let's just please go back to the table before they think we've left.<eos> What do you care what anyone here thinks, Bina?
No, not really.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.
Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.
Wait, what baby?<eos> It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!
What did you say back there? It was...<eos> What did you do? It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.<eos> It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
My name is verena, and I'm going to be staying here for a while.<eos> I promise I'm not like the others.<eos> I'm much worse.<eos> Please look at me, Jakob.<eos> I'd like to help you.
Braver than the others.<eos> I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?<eos> Tomorrow, perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.
I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours, listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.<eos> The mind is capable of extraordinary things.<eos> It is your mind that is speaking to you, Jakob, nothing else.
Jakob?<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> I think you're afraid that if you speak, the voice will cease.<eos> We'll listen together.<eos> I'll tell you what I hear.
Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have spoken about the future before she died...<eos> About the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.
More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob...<eos> That I'm wrong or that I'm right?<eos> You can t...<eos> I do it to help you, Jakob.
For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> UTHER:<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?<eos> Listen to me, woman.<eos> I need you to do as I tell you.
Still so handsome, my king.<eos> Why has the water dropped?<eos> Why does the sword reveal itself now?<eos> I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.<eos> As your power increases, so, too, do the forces that will oppose you.
And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> Bumped into the Vikings this morning.<eos> They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.
Oi!<eos> What are you lot doing?<eos> Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.<eos> He's an upstanding citizen.<eos> I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.
I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> - You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> - (SPEAKING NORWEGIAN)<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.
So, what?<eos> So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The Blacklegs are coming.<eos> And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.
We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.
I know your story.<eos> And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand<eos> as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?
Hmm.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.
VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.
VORTIGERN:<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...<eos> Here are your people.<eos> ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.
VORTIGERN:<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> MERCIA:<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
You know he was the third most wanted man on the Blackleg's list?<eos> They've been trying to catch him for some time.<eos> Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.
But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.
Go on.<eos> It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.
It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.<eos> Jack's Eye turned.<eos> Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.
Blue!<eos> I'm all right!<eos> I'm gonna kill him.<eos> This lot have been trying to do it for years.<eos> They'd love to hear you say that.
You want Vortigern to stick his neck out and get him to Londinium? You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.<eos> You will face it when it's worth it to you.
A vantage point over the whole dock and most of the town.<eos> It's a 50-yard shot. I can do that easily.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Tell him.<eos> Tell you what the problem is, mate.
- Probably.<eos> The three exits are actually only one.<eos> 'Cause once the alarm arrow's fired, the gates will be shut within two minutes, and they're six minutes away by foot.<eos> Unless you can run like a Neapolitan stallion, I'd forget them.<eos> So, you have one exit remaining. And that has a tavern 20 yards from it. There's always more Blacklegs in the Two Hot Cocks than there are rats on the street.
- (METAL CLANGING) - (MEN EXCLAIMING)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> BILL:<eos> After you.
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll need a little breather.<eos> Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.
But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?<eos> Who's this young man?<eos> I'm the cleaner, sir.<eos> Who's he to you?
Archers!<eos> (MAN YELLING)<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> (INAUDIBLE)<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept
Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
- He's launched a fusion mine!<eos> - Evacuate the ship!<eos> All hands abandon ship!<eos> I repeat, all hands abandon ship!<eos> Damn you, Saber.
But you, along with all living creatures need only call me Master!<eos> Warriors?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> - You got a problem?<eos> - I don't trust you.
It's just over that ridge.<eos> Keep your red eye open, we're in annelid territory.<eos> - What's an annelid?<eos> - You don't want to know!<eos> After you.
- I know you were.<eos> It's okay, he's a friend.<eos> We have no friends here.<eos> Alright. I'll leave you two alone.<eos> I'm sorry, they're doing this to you to get to me.
I'm sorry, they're doing this to you to get to me.<eos> No matter what they do, you cannot give them what they seek.<eos> We will find a way out of here, and get back home.<eos> And we will return to this planet with a vengeance.<eos> Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!
Our home is Ares...<eos> Ares, is not your world.<eos> Your ancestors took refuge there after the greatest galactic war the universe has ever seen.<eos> You are children of Goros.<eos> - I don't believe you.
Our family!<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Sinjin is our family.<eos> Our oldest ancestor.<eos> You can't believe what this creature is telling you!
It's always gotta be the hard way.<eos> Now we can proceed.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Why, you!<eos> What did they do to you?
Crotalus.<eos> - Cover me.<eos> - What?<eos> Cover me!<eos> It's an honor to fight beside you.
I've routed all power to another task.<eos> Their fate is their own.<eos> Energy cloak engaged.<eos> Nearing target area.<eos> Control, is the frequency I gave you set?
I need their help, but I cannot tell them what I learned about our dark origin.<eos> I know.<eos> Your people have risen from the ashes of the past.<eos> Been reborn. You will lead them to greatness.<eos> With men like you and Saber by my side, we can build a brighter future. - We can.
And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.<eos> Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.<eos> Actually, I meant to give you this one.
Thank you, Azrael.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.
A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - I'm not telling you anything.
Check all the nurseries in the area!<eos> We're going to need to disguise ourselves as babies.<eos> Now, where can I get a giant diaper?<eos> Azrael, it's not your map.<eos> You want your own map, we'll get you your own map, but this is my...
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.
- Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.
Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...
We still have to warn them.<eos> Gargamel's wrong about me.<eos> It's not my purpose to help him.<eos> I'm meant to save those Smurfs.<eos> And we're gonna help you.
Look at you.<eos> You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?<eos> I do. I can show you.
You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?<eos> I do. I can show you.<eos> Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.
We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.<eos> What do we do with these blue blobs?<eos> Bring them along.<eos> Come on, Smurfette.<eos> I'm gonna show you my room.
Spitfire, spit fire!<eos> I like the way you think.<eos> I guess I'm pretty good with dragonflies after all.<eos> Monty!<eos> What have they done to you, my glorious bird of prey?
Are you done crying in the woods?<eos> I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.<eos> I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - She can't be serious.<eos> No, no, no, she would never.<eos> Even if I did believe you, which I don't, what could you possibly offer me that I don't already have?
It was hard to tell.<eos> They had masks on.<eos> I got close to one.<eos> It was a male, about six feet.<eos> And he had this tattoo wrapped around his neck that I told you about.
You don't want that.<eos> I don't even like this thing.<eos> No!<eos> And it doesn't like you, either.<eos> Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.
And I had to sit across from him.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Al.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I never told you this, but I've seen you perform a few times.
Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,<eos> "You get straight A's, you get a puppy."<eos> I like your confidence.<eos> Must have got that from you, young man.
And nothing ever happened to them.<eos> We hit a bank, we get away with it, we retire with dignity.<eos> Worst comes to the worst, we get caught, we get a bed, three meals a day and better healthcare than we get now.<eos> You... You're talking about us?<eos> Us and you?
I'm just lying here, thinking about all of the birthday wishes that I have had over the years.<eos> And how many of them I've kept secret.<eos> And none of them ever came true.<eos> They never seem to pay out.<eos> So I figure I'm going to tell you this one, Joe.
Hi, Annie.<eos> What are you shopping for?<eos> Chicken cordon bleu was the plan, but the plan seems to be changing.<eos> I gotta get some chicken thighs.<eos> Oh, let me help you.
Do you like ham?<eos> Okay.<eos> This will go perfectly with...<eos> I mean, if you want company. It's a big bottle.<eos> Yeah, listen, I got to tell you.
It's wrong.<eos> But if you do steal, don't steal from Value Town.<eos> Yeah, couple of great friends I got.<eos> You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.<eos> We never asked you to do anything.
Oh, I hear you.<eos> I hear you real good.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think we owe it to ourselves to live every single day that we have.<eos> I feel that I really want to get to know you better.
I hear you real good.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think we owe it to ourselves to live every single day that we have.<eos> I feel that I really want to get to know you better.<eos> Share a meal with you.
Hey.<eos> You mind?<eos> Take 'em both.<eos> Okay.<eos> How much time do you think you've got, Willie?
That's it?<eos> You look great!<eos> Just a feeling.<eos> You asked.<eos> What about you?
Just a feeling.<eos> You asked.<eos> What about you?<eos> Oh, I'd guess, uh, seven years.<eos> What about you, Al?
Why?<eos> I'm training him.<eos> He's making an effort to be a father.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Your father made you breakfast.
Sure, Joe.<eos> But only because you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> You're going to do it all.<eos> What's going with you today?
It's carnival day.<eos> Lots to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm coming right after school.<eos> Yup, and I'm going to bring you fried dough with your name on it.
Dad.<eos> I've been giving you crap for a long time, Murphy.<eos> I guess I deserve it.<eos> Mostly.<eos> That's one of the smartest things you ever said.
Your business? Your business.<eos> Talk to him, Joe.<eos> I can't... You're a selfish old bastard.<eos> I don't get it, Will.<eos> I would have given you my kidney last week.
I can't... You're a selfish old bastard.<eos> I don't get it, Will.<eos> I would have given you my kidney last week.<eos> Yours is probably no good.<eos> I still would've given it to you.
(SIREN WAILS)<eos> (TIRES SQUEAL)<eos> - Annie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I have to talk to you.
Thought you were tougher than that.<eos> ALBERT:<eos> I'm not tough.<eos> I'm a very sensitive person.<eos> I'm going to be honest with you.
Right.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> The airport.<eos> He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.<eos> I've got you a charter flight. Wheels up in an hour.
The airport.<eos> He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.<eos> I've got you a charter flight. Wheels up in an hour.<eos> Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.<eos> And I must say, the beard does give you a certain...
I think he's just been trusting the wrong people.<eos> And you know this because...<eos> A hunch.<eos> A little digging I've been doing on my own.<eos> How very entrepreneurial of you, darling.
I'm eighteen years old, daddy.<eos> I can go out when I want.<eos> Zooey, I didn't say you couldn't go.<eos> I just said you couldn't drive my car.<eos> I'm not talking to you, Katherine!
- Not nothing.<eos> It's never nothing, Mr. valecross.<eos> Good day.<eos> Our old friend, special agent fernack's here.<eos> - He followed you here from Russia.
- A head doctor?<eos> You know, a psychiatrist.<eos> While I like to believe that my teachings help heal mind and body,<eos> I'm a trainer.<eos> After we get finished here, no bully in the entire United Kingdom will dare mess with you.
- I'm testing their firewalls.<eos> Hard to imagine you and rayt marius having much to talk about.<eos> You're right.<eos> We didn't.<eos> So, what exactly did you and he do?
On that clock?<eos> There's only one spot in town that will have the gear we need.<eos> - Sonali alves.<eos> - I haven't seen her since rio.<eos> There's no chance she's forgiven you for that, boss.
There's no chance she's forgiven you for that, boss.<eos> What happened in rio?<eos> Carnivale.<eos> Who's sonali alvez?<eos> I'm not surprised Simon has not told you about her.
Do you need anything else?<eos> I think I'm good.<eos> Are you not at all concerned about Simon?<eos> You're a big boy.<eos> You're aware, of course, the steroids cause liver damage and erectile dysfunction?
Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Here's your 40.<eos> It was good doing business with you, girl.
-Likewise.<eos> - Sorry about your guy.<eos> - He's not my guy.<eos> We're associates.<eos> He has never made love to you?
You should know, your father was a very brave man.<eos> He risked his life trying to return money stolen from people who desperately need it.<eos> If you like you can finish what he started.<eos> Just press enter and the money will be returned to those who need it most.<eos> You'll be okay.
- Smells like pussy.<eos> - Why would it smell like pussy?<eos> Oh, hey, ocre.<eos> What's up?<eos> We were just talking about you.
Mm mmm something smells scrum-diddly-icious.<eos> How was school?<eos> Legalized torture paid for by the American taxpayer.<eos> - Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?<eos> Jodi, you're graduating this year. I think it's time you figured out where you're headed.
- It just says Girl Scout. - What's in your file, Virginia?<eos> These three files represent the king pins of the school's underclass.<eos> Convince them and you have a shot at this thing.<eos> The key is figuring out what makes people tick and then exploiting it mercilessly.<eos> - I like you, Virginia even if you are named after a slave state.
Get out of my office.<eos> - Mr. Samuels.<eos> Why didn't you defend me?<eos> - What do you want me to do, Mindy?<eos> - You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.
The mother who works in fashion, only if this constitutes working in the fashion industry.<eos> Her older brother getting a master's in business at Wharton.<eos> The only business he's mastered is delivering pizzas.<eos> The truth is revealed.<eos> The only reason Whitney was always so intent on exposing all of your weaknesses was so that you would never discover hers.
Lipschitzium is a very mild form of truth serum in gaseous form.<eos> Think of it like a very smart person's version of spiking the punch, okay?<eos> - Oh I'm fine with you drugging prom.<eos> So what changed your mind about working with me?<eos> - You may be a duplicitous opportunist, but at least you're honest about what you want.
It was very peaceful at the end.<eos> She kept your room exactly how you left it.<eos> She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.
Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!
Everyone says that.<eos> Gonna be sticking around for a while?<eos> No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.
Little Mark, eh?<eos> Bet he's a chip off the old block.<eos> James, actually.<eos> And Laura.<eos> How about you?
I cannot live on a promise.<eos> Soon.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on, Spud!<eos> I'm with you, Mark. Go on, Mark.
So when you said wife, two kids... James and...<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Laura, that wasn't strictly true? - No.<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to tell you the truth.
- No.<eos> It's just masculine.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.
What the fuck?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Ya Cunt, you!<eos> You fucking beauty, you!<eos> How you doing, Mikey?
- No, Frank.<eos> - Dad, leave it. - "Leave it"?<eos> I don't want to fucking leave it!<eos> What if I don't want to fucking leave it? What you gonna do about that, eh?<eos> Tell you what... Free pop.
"Loans are available of up to £100,000.<eos> "Applications should be made online,<eos> "which may be followed by an invitation to present a business plan."<eos> Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.
What, all of it?<eos> You snorted the whole fucking wad?<eos> It's called debt, Mark.<eos> The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?
You've never even fucked her.<eos> I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again.<eos> - What? When she was working at the sauna?<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> You know, since we're having this conversation, I can tell you that fully consensual, emotionally driven, not-for-profit sexual intercourse has been attained.
- "Out"?<eos> - Aye.<eos> Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank.<eos> Well, I was gonna... I was gonna deal with this myself and then give you the good news, but...
Choose 9/11 never happened, and if it did, it was the Jews.<eos> Choose a zero-hour contract and a two-hour journey to work, and choose the same for your kids, only worse.<eos> And maybe tell yourself it's better that they never happened.<eos> And then sit back and smother the pain with an unknown dose of an unknown drug made in somebody's fucking kitchen.<eos> Choose unfulfilled promise and wishing you'd done it all differently.
Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get rather than what you always hoped for.<eos> Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.
Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.<eos> Until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece, they will all be gone.<eos> And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.
Look, we're here as an act of memorial.<eos> Nostalgia.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You're a tourist in your own youth.<eos> Just 'cause you had a near-death experience, and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.
I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.<eos> I bet you were fucking looking forward to it, too, weren't you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I was looking forward to it.<eos> I ought to fucking kill you.
What is all this shit anyway?<eos> It's just, like, stories and that.<eos> "Stories"?<eos> What are you writing stories for?<eos> Who's gonna read shit written by a Cunt like you?
"Spud had never hurt anybody.<eos> "If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate, "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?
This your bird, Murphy?<eos> Please, Franco, leave her alone.<eos> She has nothing to do with this.<eos> 'Course she hasn't.<eos> What would she be doing with an ugly Cunt like you?
No, I'm like one of the last indigenous guys around here.<eos> I cannot go anywhere.<eos> "He says, clinging to the hope "that he won't commit this crime against his friends.<eos> "And she says..."<eos> I'll send you your share.
Am I catching you at a bad time?<eos> - What is it, LeFou?<eos> - A certain damsel is in distress.<eos> It's hero time.<eos> I'm not done with you yet.
I'm not done with you yet.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Belle! I heard you had trouble with the Headmaster.<eos> He never liked me either.<eos> Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though?
They're never going to trust the kind of change you're trying to bring.<eos> All I wanted was to teach a child to read.<eos> The only children you should concern yourself with... are your own.<eos> I'm... not ready to have children.<eos> Maybe you haven't met the right man.
Go! Philippe, go!<eos> Go, go!<eos> Good boy.<eos> Go, boy.<eos> Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.
I need a minute alone with him.<eos> Are you so cold-hearted... you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?<eos> Forever can spare a minute.<eos> When this door closes, it will not open again.<eos> I should have been with you.
It's all right.<eos> Now go.<eos> Live your life. And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love. I've been burned by you before.
I told you to join me for dinner.<eos> And I told you no.<eos> What time is it?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'd starve before I ever ate with you.
Don't you ever want to escape?<eos> The master's not as terrible as he appears.<eos> Somewhere deep in his soul, there's a prince... of a fellow who just waiting to be set free.<eos> Lumiere mentioned something about the west wing.<eos> Never you mind about that.
Straight to bed.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What did you do to it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Do you realize what you could have done?
Well, there are a couple of... things in here you could start with.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's wonderful!<eos> Yes. I suppose it is.<eos> Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.
What, Mama?<eos> There may be something there That wasn't there before<eos> What is it?<eos> What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.
King Arthur and the Round Table.<eos> Knights and men and swords and things.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.
Knights and men and swords and things.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.<eos> Well, I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.
Your village sounds terrible.<eos> Almost as lonely as your castle.<eos> What do you say we run away?<eos> Another little gift from the enchantress.<eos> A book that truly allows you to escape.
You need help, sir.<eos> A place to heal your troubled mind.<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> Just fine.<eos> Well, I saw her in the ballroom... and said, "You're making everything look so beautiful.
- I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.
Lumiere... I can't... speak.<eos> It's all right, Cogsworth.<eos> I can't...<eos> Lumiere... my friend.<eos> It was an honor to serve... with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I tried.<eos> Last summer spree?<eos> It will be a lonely weekend here.<eos> I'll bring you a 3kg fish.
What was she like?<eos> Well, she was very pretty.<eos> What color was her hair?<eos> That color.<eos> You want me to tell you the story?
So why is it so cruel?<eos> Why did you say that?<eos> The Great Spirit made the princess jump off a cliff And made Jesus die on the cross.<eos> Do not you find that cruel?<eos> Let me tell you something.
Maybe I was already there and I had not seen it before. Do not know.<eos> It's total madness.<eos> But I have to do something. That's all I have.<eos> Right.<eos> But I will go with you.
Right.<eos> But I will go with you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I hope everything goes well for her.<eos> I hope everything goes well for you too.
I have a fireplace at home if you want to warm up.<eos> Come on, Mack.<eos> I know a person who would love to see you.<eos> Do not.<eos> I told you.
Knead. Fold. Turn.<eos> That's it.<eos> I know there's... A great chasm between us, Mack.<eos> You may not believe... But I have a special affection for you.<eos> I want to heal this wound... That grows in you and between us.
Sarayu is creativity. Action.<eos> The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love was meant to exist in a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we want to have with you.
Do not think about the past. Do not think about pain.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Everything will be fine.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Believe me, none of this will hurt you.
I do not care what they call me.<eos> I just want people to change because they know Papa.<eos> To feel what it is to be truly loved.<eos> I do not think I've ever felt this.<eos> Put your shoes on. I'll show you how.
Does God have time to sunbathe?<eos> Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doing right now.<eos> Papa...<eos> Yes, MacKenzie?<eos> I caught you heavy.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I did not know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right. And that I know what's best.<eos> And then?<eos> Forgiveness does not establish a relationship.<eos> It's just relieving the lump in the throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.
It is stealing your joy. And deforming their ability to love.<eos> I can not.<eos> You are not arrested because you can not, He's stuck because he will not forgive.<eos> You do not have to do it yourself.<eos> I'm here with you.
I do not know how to forgive.<eos> Just say it out loud.<eos> I...<eos> I forgive...<eos> I forgive you.
Maybe I have to forgive a thousand times Until it gets easier.<eos> But it will.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.
But it will.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.
Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.
We've been collecting them for quite some time.<eos> Here it is.<eos> MacKenzie, we have something to talk about.<eos> You can stay here with us, Or go home to Nan and her children.<eos> Anyway, we promise to be with you always.
Yes I arrived.<eos> I was there.<eos> Right. Dude, this is a lot to digest, right?<eos> I knew God.<eos> Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.
I knew God.<eos> Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.<eos> Mack?<eos> Take a rest.<eos> Are you alright.
For everything.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay, we'll talk later, dear.<eos> You just need to rest now.<eos> I have so much to tell you about... The lake And Pope.
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You.<eos> I know things are not Very good between us lately.<eos> I was so lost in my sadness, I was not able to help you with yours.
I love you so much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.<eos> I love you very much, Kate.<eos> That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.<eos> I believe in you.
Stop!<eos> Light.<eos> That one's called Stop Light.<eos> Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?
Oh, there's one where two owls are pissing in each other's mouths.<eos> I must have seen that on 12 trucks today.<eos> Oh. If it isn't the only two men I've ever slept with.<eos> Finally!<eos> How are you, Ray?
No one's in an owl costume.<eos> You're missing out.<eos> Here's Tony.<eos> Give him his medicine and have him back on Saturday.<eos> I don't know why the judge just didn't make you keep him.
I think very highly of you, too.<eos> "Girlfriend."<eos> You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."
Sorry about that.<eos> Do you want to drink about it?<eos> I...<eos> I think I'd better not tonight.<eos> I brought you something.
Gundy pays me.<eos> Who else?<eos> Gundy?<eos> Which Gundy?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.
You know what them are, fancy man?<eos> Them's people think they're better than other people.<eos> They ain't!<eos> Nobody's better than nobody, that's our motto these days.<eos> And if you think you is, we'll fuck you up till you isn't.
I'm kidding. Totally kidding.<eos> I can water them with soda pop.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> They... they smell funny.<eos> Here you go.
Baby shoes.<eos> Um... who do those belong to?<eos> Yeah, those... Those are actually mine.<eos> Um, they're... they're my sho...<eos> Beat you to it.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
Stop!<eos> Hey, what are we waiting for?<eos> Use your brain, Sonnyboy.<eos> You know, I got a card when I got out of prison one time, from my momma.<eos> "Young man," with brains, muscles, looks, and girls chasing you... you'll go far.
I intend for her to have the best and be the best, and she will never hear a whisper of her no-account, drug addict birth father or her whore of a mother.<eos> Nobody better'n nobody.<eos> After all that, I gave them the damn card.<eos> They found a nice, cheery front to sell it, and that did the trick.<eos> Made people feel good, I guess, the kind of good feeling some dumb card can give you.
- Who's that?<eos> - I didn't say it weren't secondhand.<eos> This morning, we're gonna go over your revision sheets and take a look at exam prep.<eos> If we don't hit the 60 percent pass rate, we're gonna be spending a lot more time together in queue at the job center.<eos> So, Tom, how did you get on with the exercises?
So, Tom, how did you get on with the exercises?<eos> Tom.<eos> - Triangles?<eos> - What?<eos> Okay, Eileen, what about you?
See you later, Lucy.<eos> Put here some vegetable stock...<eos> Police investigation con...<eos> What are you so fidgety about?<eos> If someone said for you to come around later, what time would you say that was?
- How's the head? - It's all right.<eos> - How's it look?<eos> - Already, it looks better.<eos> We need to even this up a bit.<eos> You know, if you feel up to it, maybe later you should go to Lucy.
How was Lucy yesterday?<eos> Different.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So were you.<eos> Keep thinking if your mum was still with us, she'd be out there now, kicking doors down, trying to find the little bastards that did that to you.
Keep thinking if your mum was still with us, she'd be out there now, kicking doors down, trying to find the little bastards that did that to you.<eos> Tom!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - It's Monday.<eos> You've just been shot in the head.
- It's funny, innit?<eos> - Eugene.<eos> You know what else is funny? I know where you live, you little...<eos> - Bruv, you made it. - Yeah.<eos> How you feeling?
- Relax. Chill out.<eos> - Take him back to Nanny, bruv.<eos> - I'll sort it. Just chill.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort it, Danny.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Comes out here empty-handed.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - How was the party?<eos> - It was all right.<eos> How you feeling?
- Boring without you there.<eos> Got no one to throw chips at in the canteen.<eos> - Like you'd ever dare throw chips at me.<eos> - Yeah, what would you do about it?<eos> Give you a slap, obviously.
- Why are you leaning on my car for, fam?<eos> - Cutz, man... Get off the fucking car.<eos> - You sure you can handle it, yeah?<eos> - Well, it's easy, man.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Should we start talking to you now?
Plus, ducks are weird.<eos> - Shit, they're coming.<eos> - No!<eos> - Quack!<eos> - Stop it! I'll kick you in.
Same.<eos> Did I ever tell you about when I got locked out on your roof overnight with, uh, what's-her-face?<eos> - No.<eos> - Alice.<eos> Do you know Alice? She sat, like, left of you in...
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Luce?<eos> No.<eos> - 'Cause I think you might...<eos> - Leave it, Eugene.<eos> - What about you, Tom?
- What's happening?<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah, man. What you saying?<eos> Nothing, man, I just wanted to ask you a little question.<eos> You see, if someone put a gun to your fucking face like this here, huh? And said, "Give me names,"
- Leave it to me, boss.<eos> Got ya.<eos> You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> I don't have to tell you everything.
Got ya.<eos> You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> I don't have to tell you everything.<eos> You know, I see your mom in you when I look at you.
And she was my daughter.<eos> She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.<eos> So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.
You all right, sweetheart?<eos> Looking for some business?<eos> I got a tenner somewhere.<eos> Could do with a little sucky-suck.<eos> Why don't you take that tenner and shove it up your ass, my darling?
Cass, man.<eos> I've known him since forever.<eos> He was a dickhead, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what happened to you?
Been revising.<eos> It's not what I've heard.<eos> My cousin Tia says you haven't been in exams.<eos> It's a shame, man.<eos> I always thought you'd be the one to go places.
- See you around.<eos> Let's cut him down.<eos> Take him from the balcony...<eos> Everyone's saying it's iBOY.<eos> Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's going on with you?
- Don't worry, she'll be all right.<eos> We'll keep an eye on her.<eos> Cutz is a man with a hammer in a world of china. Know what I mean?<eos> Keon, let him go.<eos> You're gonna wish you hadn't done that. Oh, yeah?
Don't be such a clever bastard."<eos> You're special, Tom.<eos> Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.<eos> All right, I'm special.<eos> What's it got to do with you?
Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.<eos> All right, I'm special.<eos> What's it got to do with you?<eos> My one gift, if I may be so bold, is vision.<eos> I want to help you fulfill your potential. I want to give you the opportunity to change the world.
Okay.<eos> Well...<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> I've spent a lot of money bailing my boys out of police custody, so you owe me.<eos> Now, I want you to ask yourself one very important question.
I'm trying.<eos> A bit of performance anxiety?<eos> Tom?<eos> Come on!<eos> If I gave you the option to walk away, would you take it?
Tom?<eos> Come on!<eos> If I gave you the option to walk away, would you take it?<eos> What?<eos> If I gave you the option to walk away and never come back, would you take it?
'Cause we were friends?<eos> Or 'cause you're scared of me?<eos> Keep it. I don't want it.<eos> I reckon you did us all a favor, you know, taking him out.<eos> I'm just saying, I know you're probably beating yourself up about it, but, guys like that, they gotta get got.
- I mean, I literally shot a guy.<eos> - I'm sorry, Lucy.<eos> I'm trying to say I'm sorry.<eos> All right.<eos> I forgive you.
I forgive you.<eos> I see his face whenever I close my eyes.<eos> I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes.<eos> I don't know if it ever really goes away.<eos> But I'll help you if you help me.
- He speaks Mandarin?<eos> - Not according to his profile.<eos> I'm sending this to you.<eos> See what you can make out of it, okay?<eos> What did O'Neill say to you?
- Fuck our mission!<eos> -What?<eos> How can you say that?<eos> - When was the last time you did something just because you wanted to do it?<eos> You've always been expected to do things.
And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well...<eos> this is a '24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?<eos> Gabriela?<eos> See... I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.<eos> Hooked on barbiturates.<eos> You were an animal.<eos> But we took you in.<eos> I gave you a family.
Adamantium.<eos> If you are planning to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're out on the high seas?<eos> - I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I've tried.
If you are planning to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're out on the high seas?<eos> - I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really, if you're not going to talk to me.
And I'm pretty sure, you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.<eos> It says, "lbuprofen."<eos> That was my favorite mug.<eos> Stay out of my shit.<eos> Something's happening to you, Logan.
You're not the only one that's been enhanced.<eos> Logan. Logan!<eos> This is Laura.<eos> Caliban, come!<eos> This is who I've been telling you about.
Communicating.<eos> Take these now.<eos> We have to get out of here. It's not safe here anymore.<eos> And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?<eos> Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about.
She heals!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.
Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course, you'd say that.<eos> But I got a theory that people don't really change.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.
She's a business mistake, a RD gone bad.<eos> There's liability.<eos> They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they?<eos> We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else.<eos> Someone you care about, maybe.
If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?<eos> There is a young mutant sitting in our car.<eos> Yeah, I see that.<eos> And where we're taking her, there are others.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
I mean, I'll do it.<eos> - No. No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You wanna travel, I wanna travel. Son. Son.<eos> That sounds good to you, right?
You're a newborn, by any measure.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Your body has work to do.<eos> Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization... stromal cell proliferation.<eos> This will help you heal.
Quit looking at me.<eos> You are dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?
Yes, he was one of them.<eos> I think I might have killed him.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Why don't you show some respect, mutie?<eos> You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind.
- Right?<eos> Yeah, 'cause it's a gateway?<eos> - It's the finish line.<eos> - There's worse stuff.<eos> I don't think I can help you.
Well, I feel like I'm about to explode, we're definitely gonna be late to school, and I'm on my fourth hairdo for the talent show.<eos> Ah.<eos> Did you have your meeting with the superintendent yet?<eos> Not yet. But that's why I'm calling, actually.<eos> I wanna tell you that...
What?<eos> She wants to change the song to a Big Sean song.<eos> Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right? Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves. - All right, look, Ally,<eos> I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?
Now!<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> Messing with the TV with your goddamn computer telephone?<eos> No, I'm not the one doing it.<eos> I'mma show you what's funny.
Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I can't wait to fuck you up.
Good batch of kids.<eos> Thank you, Coach.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Everybody, on the track!<eos> Clifford, stop doggin' it. I will fuck you up.
No. I'm not actually pregnant.<eos> No, I would never sleep with a student.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Without protection.<eos> By the way, did that twin say anything to you about me?
Ask the man a question.<eos> Yeah, I could put it in question form.<eos> - Do you want your job back?<eos> - No!<eos> I'm done with this place, and I woulda told you that if you weren't in my goddamn business again.
Kill the motherfucker today. I swear to God.<eos> Okay, so right off the bat, I'm noticing that Campbell, you're sitting at Israel.<eos> And Strickland, you've chosen Iran.<eos> Okay, I'm wondering if that's maybe sending a hostile message.<eos> You know, if we can get you to an ally country, you know,
This is crazy, you know?<eos> Do you hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you've become unhinged!<eos> Maybe.<eos> But let me tell you something.
Do you hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you've become unhinged!<eos> Maybe.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> You don't show up to that fight this afternoon, an unhinged man might wanna do something real nasty to you.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I was wrong.<eos> You're so pissed off right now, you might even win.<eos> You really think I could win?<eos> Tell you something.
I know what you gonna do before you even do it.<eos> Back off.<eos> Back off.<eos> All your hard work, sneaking around lying and shit.<eos> Now it's just you and me.
He's there.<eos> You could just go over there.<eos> And I'd stay here if you're worried about losing your seat.<eos> I can see that that's not it.<eos> Okay. I tell you what.
- How do you measure a year in the life? - Oh, God.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - Honey, what...<eos> - Hey.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
Hi!<eos> - Andy!<eos> I was so afraid that you wouldn't make it.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What happened to you?
- No, no, no, it's because you were right!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> And... And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.<eos> And... And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.
I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I believe you.
- Boom.<eos> Up top! Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.
- From Gandhiji.<eos> - Gandhiji?<eos> It won't work. Nope.<eos> Why don't you come tomorrow?<eos> I'll make real glasses for you.
Seth, I don't have the money now I need some time.<eos> Not even 100,000?<eos> He doesn't have the money.<eos> He needs time.<eos> You have worked for me all these years... I'll give it to you.
Okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> Tea from a cop station.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> You'd better shut shop. Or, I'll make it difficult for you to even breathe.
- Devji.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Tea time.<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerising."<eos> "The entire neighbourhood is crazy for you."
Neither did I know that you would traipse into my heart and stay for ever.<eos> Come rain or shine, not a moment shall we stay apart.<eos> Tied to the kite is a string's destiny lt soars higher and higher.<eos> The heart soars higher and higher like a kite.<eos> This kite shall for ever be with you it'll always be drawn to you.
Miss Ratna was right.<eos> The coastline of Gujarat is indeed the longest.<eos> Thanks for the help I had heard that Damla Seth rules the seas, not the government<eos> - l witnessed it today.<eos> - l've heard lots about you, too it'll be fun to work together.
They call me Laila.<eos> Laila! That's me I am everyone's dream date.<eos> O Laila.<eos> They call you Laila.<eos> That's you! Laila. You are everyone's dream date.
Ass!<eos> Freaking Four-eyes!<eos> Scared you, didn't I?<eos> A bit<eos> I pine for you.
Why don't you express it, too?<eos> Please do.<eos> You are going to kill me some day,<eos> Your defence indeed is deadly.<eos> You are the beginning. You are the end. The story of my love is all about you.
Only 22,000?<eos> Darn it!<eos> Freaking duffer!<eos> Business meant life to you.<eos> And finally, they traded you.
Look.<eos> Over here ln a straight line, on both sides, tall houses are standing.<eos> Children are flying kites on the roof.<eos> The sky is enveloped with kites.<eos> And... over there... no, right behind you,
- No, no I don't need to listen to your phones anymore I'm here as the Superintendent of Police, Crime.<eos> Trust me, I had no hand in your transfer this time.<eos> Honestly I know.<eos> All your hands are tied.<eos> That's why I came here to reason with you.
- Greetings, bhai. - Tell me.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I need a small loan, bhai ln fact, you need a huge amount.<eos> Trust me, bhai I'll repay it, with double the interest<eos> I can't give you a loan.
Miss me?<eos> 'Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me? Did you miss me?<eos> ' I've only been gone four minutes.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.<eos> "Very well," said the merchant. "I give in.<eos> I am yours."<eos> "But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"<eos> "Because," said Death, "I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
- Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.<eos> God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.<eos> Yeah, but there'll be cake.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.
- Ha, I know. Why am I looking at this?<eos> That's her, John and Mary's baby.<eos> Oh, I see, yes.<eos> Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?
As inevitable as mathematics.<eos> - Appointment In Samarra.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> The merchant who can't outrun Death.<eos> You always hated that story as a child.
Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We... We all had one but the others were...<eos> Haven't you even looked at it yet?<eos> I glanced at it but I prefer - to hear it from you. - Why?
A vow. All right. I'll see what I can do.<eos> But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.<eos> They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'
God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm, I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.<eos> Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.<eos> I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
- Ajay?<eos> - Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.<eos> Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.<eos> I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.
Oh, and I made them pay.<eos> You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.<eos> Little whispers. Laughter. Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!
You know I'll kill you too. You know I will, Ajay.<eos> What, you think I care if I die?<eos> I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.<eos> Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.<eos> I swear to you, Ajay.
- You don't make it easy, do you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, being... being so perfect.<eos> Mary, I...<eos> I need to tell you...
- You don't need to read it now.<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock. He says...<eos> John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
She should be there.<eos> There she is. Top deck, number 9 bus, right there.<eos> We've got the bus.<eos> We're in pursuit.<eos> Aggy, we have you.
City wide.<eos> Is there a, uh...<eos> There's gotta be coverage on whatever the hell this is.<eos> I mean, the TV's still working.<eos> Hey, mom, um... It's been a super weird day here and I just would love to be able to talk to you.
So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Love you.<eos> Hey, I must have just missed you.<eos> Well I wanted to tell you that I just bought the tickets so Iceland is a go.
There is no yesterday.<eos> There is just this moment right here-- stop.<eos> I am trying.<eos> This is the last of the water so we'll have to get some more tomorrow.<eos> I wanna thank you for today.
Thank you.<eos> I really owe you one.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why do you want a gig documenting a mapping mission when you're up for the cover of Time?<eos> Jerry, when three sources tell you the same thing word for word, you know they're lying.
Nothing he wouldn't do himself.<eos> He's taking the lead.<eos> Doesn't he miss his bed?<eos> I miss my bed!<eos> - Don't you miss your bed?
(BECKONS INDISTINCTLY)<eos> Chapman to all stations.<eos> Recon environment.<eos> MILLS:<eos> Cole, what's wrong with you?
You do know that story is about a mouse becoming friends with the lion after taking the thorn out of his paw though, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The mouse kills the lion with the thorn.<eos> (MOSQUITOS BUZZING)<eos> Who told you that, Cole?
(GASPING)<eos> Cole!<eos> - No, no!<eos> - Mills!<eos> We 90'! You!
What the hell is this?<eos> (GASPS)<eos> SLIVKO:<eos> Oh!<eos> Behind you!
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals, for minor surgical procedures.<eos> Interferes with...<eos> - The memory.<eos> - The memory. Yes.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.
Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you. Anyone.
Because Mrs Hudson's right.<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling, and I'm never climbing out.<eos> I need you to know, John. I need you to see that up here I've still got it.<eos> So, when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered.
Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
Thirty feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.<eos> Help me bring him down.<eos> - What, what plan?<eos> - I'm not telling you.<eos> - Why not? - 'Cause you won't like it.
Thank you.<eos> You should bag that up. Sell it. Make money from that on eBay.<eos> You can make more, if you like.<eos> Anytime you like.<eos> Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain, that you've just been played?
Faith?<eos> God.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> Sherlock, you all right?<eos> Sherlock, you okay?
Save John Watson.<eos> Save him. Sherlock...<eos> John, you want to watch this later? Save him.<eos> Don't think anyone else is going to save him because there isn't anyone.<eos> It's up to you.
- Okay, that's good.<eos> - And if my deduction is right, you're gonna be honest and tell me, okay? Okay.<eos> Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> - to become randomly attached to... - Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.
Before you know it.<eos> She was wrong about me.<eos> Mary?<eos> She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way, I'd... I'd rescue you or something. But I didn't, not 'till she told me to.<eos> And that's how this works, that's what you're missing.
I... I don't work here.<eos> My special hair band.<eos> I'm not one of your doctors.<eos> The one I made you steal from Mummy.<eos> It was the last thing I said to you, remember?
Why?<eos> You play, don't you?<eos> How did you know?<eos> How did I know?<eos> I taught you, don't you remember?
I don't need your help.<eos> Redbeard was my dog.<eos> I know what happened to Redbeard.<eos> Oh, Sherlock. You know nothing.<eos> Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.
Try... Try to stay calm, just...<eos> Tell me what your name is.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell my name to strangers.<eos> Of course not, very good, but...<eos> I'll tell you mine, my name is...
Hello?<eos> Oh, dear. We seem to have lost the connection.<eos> How have you done this?<eos> How is any of this possible?<eos> You put me in here, Mycroft. You brought me my treats.
This is an experiment.<eos> There will be rigour.<eos> Sherlock, pick up the gun.<eos> It's your turn next.<eos> When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- Home.<eos> - No. I mean, what airport?<eos> Enough for now!<eos> Time to play a new game.<eos> Look on the table in front of you.
And if we fail, she crashes into a city.<eos> How many will die then?<eos> How are we gonna get her to do that?<eos> I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.<eos> Is there really no one there that can help you?
Please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Just... Just don't do it.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I can't say why. But I promise you, it is.
Just... Just don't do it.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I can't say why. But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that.<eos> I can't... I can't say that to you.
- No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not to you.
I just spoke to the girl on the plane again.<eos> - We've been out for hours.<eos> What, she still up there?<eos> Yes. The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.<eos> - Is Mycroft with you?
- Is Mycroft with you?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> I can hardly see anything.<eos> Mycroft?<eos> Mycroft? - Are you okay?
Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.<eos> They're not dog's bones.<eos> Remember Daddy's allergy? What was he allergic to?<eos> What would he never let you have all those times you begged?<eos> Well, he'd never let you have a dog.
The puzzle will save the plane.<eos> The wrong dates.<eos> She used the wrong dates from the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.<eos> Is this strictly relevant?<eos> Yes, it is. I'll be with you in a minute.
You see, babies aren't getting as much love as we used to.<eos> Why?<eos> Have we been bad?<eos> No, Staci.<eos> But I'll tell you who is.
They were having a meeting.<eos> There's something about puppies.<eos> It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
We have to get to the airport and stop Francis Francis... before the plane takes off!<eos> Yes! But how do we get past Scary Poppins down there?<eos> Okay. There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?
Yes! But how do we get past Scary Poppins down there?<eos> Okay. There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What's the matter with you?
Mom, Dad!<eos> Stop!<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you!
Okie-dokie.<eos> Dear Boss Baby... I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.
And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.<eos> It will be hard work... and there will be no pay.<eos> But the good news is that you can never be fired.<eos> And I promise you this.
And yet here you stand, a hero.<eos> I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.<eos> I swear.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar... wishing you could.
I don't know.<eos> It's worse.<eos> It's so much worse.<eos> You son of a...<eos> Hey! - I've had it with you!
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!<eos> I don't gotta listen to nothing!<eos> You betrayed the code!<eos> Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!
Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.<eos> But instead of returning you... Yondu kept you.<eos> I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.
Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known... we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.<eos> What say we head out there right now?<eos> Your associates are welcome.<eos> Even that triangle-faced monkey there.<eos> I promise you... it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.
Why did he talk again?<eos> To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.<eos> As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket... and you would tell all the other children... that he was your father, but that he was out of town.<eos> Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.<eos> I told you that when I was drunk.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.<eos> What is your goal here?<eos> To get everybody to hate you?<eos> Because it's working.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.<eos> This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.<eos> Your friend... There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.
If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
Not long after.<eos> It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.<eos> I called her my river lily.<eos> And from that love, Peter... you.<eos> I have searched for you for so long.
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> It's the best ship we got.<eos> Location of Ego's planet in the nav.<eos> We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
I had to watch her die!<eos> Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
She was like you.<eos> Disgusting?<eos> Innocent.<eos> Drax?<eos> There's something I must tell you.
He's goddang precious!<eos> Psst! Hey, twig!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aw, man... what did they do to you?
Rocket?<eos> Rocket, are you there?<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.
You let me live!<eos> I don't need you always trying to beat me!<eos> I'm not the one that just flew across the universe just because I wanted to win.<eos> Do not tell me what I want.<eos> I don't need to tell you what you want!
It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win.<eos> And I just wanted a sister!<eos> You were all I had.<eos> But you were the one who needed to win.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
Oh, my God.<eos> For the first time in my existence... I am truly not alone!<eos> What is it, son?<eos> My friends.<eos> You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.
What?<eos> Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.<eos> I wanted to do this together... but I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery!<eos> Finally!<eos> Rocket?<eos> Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.
Yeah! Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.<eos> So stop pissing me off!<eos> We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you... I don't want to do this alone.
He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
Oh, right. You can't leave your house.<eos> It's not a house, it's a penthouse on Park Avenue.<eos> I can't leave because of my disease.<eos> Osteogenesis Imperfecta.<eos> Yeah. Still don't believe you.
That plaque for your mother, it's just a piece of metal in the ground, okay?<eos> Her ashes were spread across the Pacific Ocean.<eos> You deserve to know that.<eos> She's not out there, Gardner.<eos> She's in you.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What scares you?<eos> You.
Do you play?<eos> Used to.<eos> What's your favorite thing about Earth?<eos> Dreaming.<eos> How 'bout you?
Used to.<eos> What's your favorite thing about Earth?<eos> Dreaming.<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> So far, uh, meeting you.
Thank you, uh...<eos> Excuse me. That's our emergency eye wash station.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> So the operation worked. You're all better now?
They suck. They lie. They use you to get what they want, and then they just throw you away.<eos> And the thing is, I didn't even like Calculus.<eos> No, just Mr. Hall's always drunk and nobody can understand what he's saying, but he doesn't care what we do on our computers.<eos> Tulsa... So that's what I looked forward to.<eos> Tulsa, I'm not... To Calculus. To talking to you.
Why?<eos> Because we're all messed up and scared and trying to be something that we're not.<eos> And if we all went around just declaring our innermost desires to the exact people we felt them for, well, then we'd all end up happy, or something.<eos> Look, Gardner...<eos> I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful and I've kind of had an amazing time with you.

To myself?<eos> All my life, I couldn't feel anything.<eos> I couldn't feel water. I couldn't feel a fire. I couldn't feel wind on my face.<eos> And now I can.<eos> That's nothing compared to what I feel with you.
It feels weird.<eos> I mean, it's not real, you know?<eos> It's not how I pictured it.<eos> It's hurting my head to see it like this.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Gardner, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want.
Do you even know why you're sick?<eos> 'Cause your heart's too big.<eos> We are going to Summerland.<eos> You can't.<eos> They're gonna help you.
You're the best mom I never had.<eos> Safe travels, okay?<eos> Oh, miss. Hold up, miss. Hey!<eos> Nice ride.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, miss. Hold up, miss. Hey!<eos> Nice ride.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> You're amazing.<eos> And I had the time of my life with you.
Nice ride.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> You're amazing.<eos> And I had the time of my life with you.<eos> But the last thing I'm gonna do is actually tell you that.
But Okja's ours.<eos> We bought her from them.<eos> You sent them the money!<eos> Actually... they wouldn't let me buy Okja.<eos> So I bought you this gold pig instead.
They wouldn't dare hurt her.<eos> She needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant.<eos> Whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless.<eos> We have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in New York City.<eos> We promise to bring her back to you.
Can we phone her now?<eos> Let's take a picture first, then call her.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Of course.<eos> In the plane... If you get airsick... chew the end of this.
You're having a moment, I see.<eos> Yes, things are going super well.<eos> It's all a massive success.<eos> Really?<eos> They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.
They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?<eos> I've sent you a reminder of the true face of the most powerful CEO Mirando has ever had.
Never mistranslate.<eos> Translation is sacred.<eos> From this moment on, you are no longer a member of the A.L.F. You are permanently banned.<eos> Get out.<eos> However... since it is vital that we continue with our mission, we will return your equipment to you after its completion.
It'll make you feel better.<eos> This is an unspeakable place.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> There are worse rooms out there.<eos> Lucy Mirando says I'm not supposed to harm you in here.
Mija. Mija, I don't think you understand this situation.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We are the ones who have Okja.<eos> Okay?<eos> We are doing you a favor. Do you get it now?
Yes, but you should know the situation is not good.<eos> What is it?<eos> I didn't...<eos> There is no other way.<eos> I wish you didn't have to see this.
- Yeah!<eos> Lowering mayor package through hole.<eos> Madam Mayor!<eos> Thanks for dropping by.<eos> I've only got one thing to say to you, Joker.
Do you like to gamble?<eos> Oh, I certainly do.<eos> Do you ever play roulette?<eos> On occasion.<eos> Well, let me give you a word of advice.
When has that ever happened?<eos> Computer!<eos> Calculating.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I'm always one step ahead of you.
Then I'd say that I don't currently have a bad guy.<eos> I am fighting a few different people.<eos> What?<eos> I like to fight around.<eos> Okay, look, I'm fine with you fighting other people if you wanna do that, but what we have is special.
Alfred, you've been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay.<eos> - It's Pinot grigio, sir.<eos> - Whatever it is.<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> You're satisfied serving me.
It's completely useless.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Thanks, Batman!<eos> Please, stand over there.<eos> And don't touch, look at, or do anything for the remaining moments you have in my presence.
Rip!<eos> That's better!<eos> Now I'm free, now I'm moving.<eos> Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!<eos> I can only look you in the eyes right now.
It's raining dads!<eos> So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<eos> I sure am, Dad Two!<eos> But first, where's the seatbelt?<eos> The first lesson is, life doesn't give you seatbelts!
- And a song.<eos> ♪ Fly, Robin, fly ♪<eos> Harder pass.<eos> Now slide!<eos> Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you how to masterbuild your way inside that thing.
But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.
- Alfred, you gotta let me out of here.<eos> Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything we've ever seen.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> You don't know everything I've seen.<eos> I haven't told you everything.
I thought I told you to go back at the prison.<eos> - I tried, but Bane was in there.<eos> - So?<eos> He had sort of a "get out of this bathroom now" vibe.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.
- What are you doing?<eos> Okay. Everybody, timeout off.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> I've been parented.<eos> - Batman, I can help you.
Come on, let's hear it for us!<eos> That was incredible!<eos> I felt so jazzed!<eos> I say "jazzed"!<eos> I gotta give it to you, Batman.
He's not worth it.<eos> I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!<eos> That is right.<eos> Respect!<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,
I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You and I are done!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Kid, don't do that.<eos> Atomic batteries to power.<eos> Turbines to speed.<eos> Don't do what I would do!<eos> I never even taught you how to drive!
Bringing it, sir.<eos> For Queen and country!<eos> You just got Union Jacked!<eos> Robin, get ready.<eos> I'm about to teach you some father-and-son stuff.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
That's my building.<eos> You should sell it and buy some shoes.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello! we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.<eos> And give you lots of hugs and kisses and tell you what a sweet little boy you are.
- Yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> hey. - Hey.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you. It...
I want to know what happened.<eos> to my parents... to the company that has my name on it!<eos> That's all you want?<eos> Answers?<eos> I'll tell you everything I know.
if you...<eos> - You really need to leave.<eos> This is just a practice sword.<eos> It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.
huh?<eos> See?<eos> He loves me.<eos> Dad.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Now we need to approach this with finesse.<eos> Like the way you handle everything in life?<eos> Ward.<eos> Leave this to me.<eos> I'll tell you exactly what to do.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay. and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?
Let it go.<eos> And this is your home.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll be out in 72 hours.<eos> That what they tell you?
okay?<eos> They drugged me. They... they... they brought me here against my will.<eos> You saw me being attacked the other night.<eos> You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?
of course not.<eos> why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.
We're putting him somewhere safe.<eos> Somewhere safe?<eos> We can't risk him falling into the hands of anyone else.<eos> He said he is the sworn enemy of the Hand.<eos> Do you realize how important that could be?
And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?<eos> That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?
That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?<eos> because I want you to succeed?<eos> I guess.<eos> You guess?<eos> - I believe you.
Do I need to spell it out any further?<eos> I got it.<eos> I...<eos> I'll take care of all of it.<eos> and I'm gonna make you a great man.
so...<eos> I'll have all this solved by Friday.<eos> Door included.<eos> Then...<eos> Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.
Just think of all you could do with that.<eos> I have to change my name?<eos> The world already thinks Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.
Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.<eos> You can start all over.<eos> It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?
The new place with the glass floor?<eos> it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.
Breathe.<eos> move in! Move!<eos> Good!<eos> That was good.<eos> Oh! - You okay?
I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you... that's fine.
I'd like to take a look.<eos> Trying to get my head around all this.<eos> This is not the time or the place.<eos> You were like a brother to me.<eos> but still... I looked up to you.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
uh... I was always a poor speller.<eos> This doesn't prove anything.<eos> Anybody could have made this.<eos> Look closely. right next to Joy's name.<eos> I assure you... it is an exact match.
Red Hook.<eos> Joy closed the deal on the pier.<eos> Talk with her.<eos> We've needed a fighter like you back in the family.<eos> maybe I could teach you kung fu some time.
Thank you for coming out.<eos> - Thank you. - Danny.<eos> That answer was much kinder than we deserved.<eos> Kindness is the eternal law.<eos> have you got time to go through that pier deal you put through?
We've got bourbon to finish.<eos> I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?
I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?
if this is about fighting for cash...<eos> I'm not judging.<eos> I used to fight in a few illegal fight clubs on my way back from K'un-Lun.<eos> But just so you know... I'm more than willing to pay up on our previous deal.<eos> I still owe you rent for six months.
Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.
I need your help.<eos> We can do a lot of good together.<eos> I'd have to cancel my evening classes... Hey, listen.<eos> Hey.<eos> If it helps, you can forget about rent this month.
What?<eos> You know about the Hand?<eos> What do you know?<eos> That you just started a war by taking him from them.<eos> Do you realize that?
But this?<eos> I've been training my whole life for this.<eos> This is the one thing I know I can do better than anyone else.<eos> I am the only one who can defeat them.<eos> God! My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.
there will always be forces gathering against you... waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.
there will always be forces gathering against you... waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.<eos> They are everywhere.<eos> because they are aware of you.
looking for what you reveal to them.<eos> you are your own worst enemy.<eos> The time has come.<eos> The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads...
Why do you ask?<eos> What happened last night can't happen again.<eos> Ward.<eos> I... and you...<eos> I have no idea what's going on with you.
Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> I'm going with you.
Too risky.<eos> Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.
Very rare.<eos> It'll help you let go.<eos> isn't it?<eos> it is.<eos> You want to be free... of all that is boiling inside of you to get out.
Banish it.<eos> I can't.<eos> you can.<eos> Just give in.<eos> and I can give it to you.
This is my purpose.<eos> No room for doubt.<eos> Finish it.<eos> Finish it now.<eos> You belong to me... and I command you.
What if someone had seen you in there?<eos> I don't think anyone would recognize us from the country club, Joy.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> - You're slipping.<eos> You're fine?
Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.<eos> And... I mean, you... you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.
Sometimes, it's... it's just easier to... pretend nothing's wrong than to say something.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.<eos> Just... for a few weeks.<eos> I can handle things here.<eos> There are places... discreet places... that could help you.
I can handle things here.<eos> There are places... discreet places... that could help you.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.
The way he fights...<eos> Not just his body, but... his heart.<eos> It's like a second language to him. It's... it's...<eos> It's inspiring.<eos> It sounds like you truly care for him.
Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?<eos> Did you know about the offices on the 13th floor?<eos> Well, if I had known, I would have had Ward charge her rent.<eos> Hey, I've always been honest with you, Danny.
The day you died.<eos> That's just mean, Ward.<eos> You should be grateful.<eos> Yeah. You wouldn't have a life without me.<eos> I've given you everything.
You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> The hell is wrong with you?
I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.<eos> I'm going with you.
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
Big Pun?<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?
A gentleman never kisses and tells.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> "Danny Rand got some."<eos> What about you?
But if I did kill her... I would only be fulfilling my duty as the Iron Fist.<eos> Oh, you really think that you can justify murder?<eos> I swore to protect the people of K'un-Lun from the Hand, okay?<eos> Killing... is wrong, no matter who pulls the trigger or why.<eos> I wonder if you'd feel the same way if someone killed your mother and father.
I didn't know.<eos> My head knows the facts, but right now, my heart is doing the driving.<eos> Okay, then forget the facts.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> Let's... Tell us how you feel.
That's bullshit.<eos> Can you name the last person I dated?<eos> I just have no idea who you've been seeing, or what you've been reading, or... anything about your life outside of Rand.<eos> We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.
Do you understand?<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> Okay? Just tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.
We should stick together, find Claire, and then figure out what to do.<eos> Hey. I'll be okay.<eos> Hey, Zhou Cheng, wake up.<eos> Open the door.<eos> You okay?
What are you doing?<eos> I need to get into this building, and you're in my way.<eos> Maybe you could finish your nap elsewhere?<eos> I'm quite comfortable here.<eos> Yeah? Oh, you could try to make me move... but I wouldn't advise it.
Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.
- You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.<eos> But unless you see it with your own eyes, you may not believe me.<eos> What I'm about to show you is shocking, but it...
Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me...<eos> She'll tell you everything that you want to know, and no one gets hurt.<eos> You okay?
He took me to this... this Art Deco building on 57th.<eos> Said he wanted to show me something.<eos> Then he freaked out, and we left, and...<eos> Do you know anything about that building?<eos> I don't believe you.
China and back.<eos> I caught something.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> Just... get Gao.<eos> You're gonna run out of time.
How do you feel?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> You okay?
There's something I'd like to show Danny first.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
A well-functioning organization focused on the common good, or... something else?<eos> Rand isn't what you hoped it would be.<eos> But you are just the person who can turn it around.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> What I'm about to show you is something that's been kept secret for decades.
What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.<eos> And, Danny, there's more where that came from.<eos> I showed you how to heal Colleen, and I've just opened up a way for you to recharge your chi.

Guarding an entry.<eos> If that's why you're interested in me, then... you got the wrong man.<eos> I don't need a guard, Danny.<eos> I need a partner.<eos> With you at my side, no one would stand against us.
- He's not picking up.<eos> - Oh, let it ring.<eos> Danny? Uh, I've been meaning to call. What's up?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Well, Danny, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.
Colleen brought me.<eos> - Are you coming onboard here?<eos> - Oh, thinking about it.<eos> That would be so kick-ass.<eos> I... I've been telling them about you.
I... I've been telling them about you.<eos> This is the guy that whacked that kid with a pole. It's, uh...<eos> not my greatest moment.<eos> Well, I thought it was awesome.<eos> So... you like it here?
In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.<eos> I wanted to tell you from the beginning.
Come on!<eos> You've been lying to me this whole time!<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Did Bakuto give you that money the first time we met in the park?
I already felt the way I feel.<eos> And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny... So when did Bakuto approach you with this... this idea of recruiting me?
Manic depression, barely treated.<eos> Oh, I know. I know. I know what it's like to have a troubled son.<eos> - Stop.<eos> We share so much, you and I.<eos> That's why I thought it was, um, important to come and offer you an easy solution.
A powerful man, stressed by a life and a job that simply overwhelmed him.<eos> You go out a tortured hero.<eos> None of this comes to light.<eos> You better get the hell out of here.<eos> I don't know what you're up to, but I can tell you right now that I will never...
You survived.<eos> You're the Iron Fist.<eos> The people need to meet the Immortal Weapon.<eos> I'll be your second.<eos> Standing beside you on the pass.
He's confused as to why you would abandon your post and leave us unprotected.<eos> yeah... he's also very pissed.<eos> Davos?<eos> I saw you taken by those men outside that dojo.<eos> - I followed you to the compound.
- I'm not.<eos> Claire.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> It's what the Order of the Crane Mother has trained me for.<eos> And did those monks teach you how to deal with a broken heart?
It's clean.<eos> Or cleaner.<eos> A friend of mine left it here.<eos> Is your friend okay?<eos> Probably doing better than you are.
I should go with you.<eos> it's hard enough being a delivery guy without a warrior monk accidently kicking the crap out of you.<eos> So just... wait here.<eos> Already paid for it.<eos> - Danny told you.
- Danny told you.<eos> - So it's true?<eos> You're in the Hand.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I don't know that he wants to talk to you.
You know what the whole rest of your life is gonna be.<eos> - Guarding the pass.<eos> - Guarding K'un-Lun.<eos> I didn't know where else you would go.<eos> Is Bakuto with you?
- To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.
To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.<eos> Are you gonna believe everything they taught you in K'un-Lun?
And the way things are going... I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> too?<eos> Just stop.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> How can I ever trust you again?
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
and that's to see the Hand destroyed.<eos> And then you go back to K'un-Lun?<eos> could you give us a minute?<eos> I'll be outside... keeping guard.<eos> I don't like what's happening to you.
Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Mary.<eos> You guys been keeping up with your training?<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> - Bakuto wants to talk to you.
what is keeping you here?<eos> we have to wait for Bakuto.<eos> Whoa!<eos> wait!<eos> - I'm not here to hurt you.
Oh, shit.<eos> - Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here. And most importantly, I can free you from your father.
I want you in charge, because Harold has become...<eos> - Goddamn dangerous.<eos> - He can't be trusted.<eos> Our relationship would be more quid pro quo.<eos> Take this drug I'm giving you now, for instance.
- Let her go!<eos> - He's ignorant.<eos> Don't let him bait you.<eos> It's all he knows. All he's ever been taught.<eos> When did you become such a milkmaid, Danny?
It's no wonder you can't summon the Iron Fist.<eos> You know, last week, if you would have told me that I'd be here, working with my daughter, I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> Reunion would be a hell of a lot better if we weren't taking down drug dealers.<eos> Oh, well, we take our blessings where we can find 'em.<eos> You used to say that to me when I'd sit with you during your chemo treatments.
I need to talk with Joy alone.<eos> Well, anything you have to say to Joy, you can say to me.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Just give us a sec.<eos> So how are you?
- No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a...<eos> It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.
That's because he is a piece of garbage, and you're human.<eos> The longer I spend in New York, the more I realize the duality in life.<eos> My grandmother always said that that was the truest sign of wisdom.<eos> I didn't get it then, but now...<eos> I'm gonna put you in a hotel.
You're not gonna want to move, Harold.<eos> I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you. It was a mistake.
Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> So what?<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.
Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.<eos> We're going to change the world.<eos> Well, the promises I've made you are still in place.<eos> I'll help you realign your chi so you can access the Iron Fist again.
These two are warriors.<eos> You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.
This is because I left you.<eos> Yield.<eos> I kicked your ass back in K'un-Lun and I kicked your ass here!<eos> Yield!<eos> Danny! I hurt you. I get it.
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
All thanks to you.<eos> - You're like family to me.<eos> Talk later.<eos> When Bakuto put the cuffs on me, I... I had no idea if the Fist was gonna work or not.<eos> - Does this mean you're better?
That whole thing with Davos was...<eos> - Ugly.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.
I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.<eos> And then, I thought it could be with the Meachums, but...<eos> But what I found in you is...
he stabs me in the back?<eos> You don't wanna start down that rabbit hole.<eos> believe me.<eos> I'm such a jerk.<eos> I haven't even asked how you're doing.
take it.<eos> J-Money.<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> Look who I found.<eos> I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.
And the third option?<eos> Prove your innocence.<eos> Those documents are digital.<eos> There's a very good chance that they've been copied somewhere.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might have them?
He's been lying to me. Manipulating me.<eos> He's been pretending to be... be my friend. I...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He's not gonna get away with this.<eos> I'll help you.
Is there a version of this where we don't kill someone? - The tablet.<eos> How do we get the tablet?<eos> - Ward.<eos> right?<eos> You're looking better.
You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.<eos> I know.<eos> And I don't blame you.
Who said I needed protecting?<eos> I say so.<eos> he is dangerous.<eos> Joy... every second you spend with him could be your last.<eos> Do you hear how crazy you sound?
Dad has been held prisoner for 13 years.<eos> of course he's acting a little off. Who wouldn't?<eos> A little off?<eos> I watched him go at two dead men with a claw hammer.<eos> I can tell you where he made me dump the bodies.
I watched him go at two dead men with a claw hammer.<eos> I can tell you where he made me dump the bodies.<eos> Ward.<eos> I feel like I can't even...<eos> I can't even trust a word you say.
I had to get out of there.<eos> Yeah. Look... I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I didn't.<eos> I saw everything that you had on the Hand's drug operation.<eos> Remember?<eos> so... tell me the truth.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.
Remember?<eos> so... tell me the truth.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.
The plan was to go up if it's clear. guys with guns is the opposite of clear.<eos> let's call the police.<eos> We can't wait for the police.<eos> Harold is dangerous.<eos> Let's not pretend that you care about Ward when we know what this is really about for you.
In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Up to you.
Do you think I could ever be like him?<eos> Oh, Ricky, you already are like him.<eos> I mean, like, going on adventures and stuff.<eos> Do you remember what granddad used to always say...<eos> That the key to adventure is always right in front of you.
We need to come up with a lot of money before the end of the month.<eos> Grandpa would be sad to hear that.<eos> He was the founder of that place.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> But you know what? I don't want you to worry...
Because I have a town hall meeting this week, and I'm gonna do my very best to convince the municipality to do what's right.<eos> So, I need to you to say a wish for your dear old mama, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna need it.<eos> It's time for you to go to bed now.<eos> I want you to come brush your teeth, okay?
Why would he go through the trouble of hiding this if it wasn't something really special?<eos> And I'm the one who found it.<eos> Don't you see? It's like he left it for me.<eos> I've got a good feeling about this one, guys.<eos> It's not that we don't want to believe you, but-- we don't believe you.
There's definitely something behind here.<eos> That's pretty cool.<eos> You're like royalty around here.<eos> Key.<eos> "The key to adventure is right in front of you."
A magical what?<eos> Well, I'm gonna make it my business.<eos> Seth, scram.<eos> Hey, chill out, Ozzie. I was just coming by to pick up some old comics.<eos> Well, not until you pay for the ones you "picked up" before.
Let's just say I'm the guy who understands your situation.<eos> You don't have many friends 'cause you got a bad rap for being a bully when really you were the one who's excluded and was misunderstood.<eos> And I know exactly how you feel. Trust me, I was just like you.<eos> Now, you wanna get back at your friends for what they did to you?<eos> I can help you do that.
And how is that a good idea?<eos> Why did you call me here?<eos> You can't keep ordering me around like this.<eos> I can do anything I want.<eos> Besides, I want you to meet someone.
Ozzie, you down here?<eos> Yeah, in the back.<eos> Hi. Ozzie, we need your help.<eos> Sure, I'm at your service.<eos> We need something from you.
-Hey, what's going on?<eos> -We need to talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> About anything in particular?<eos> I need to tell you that--
Okay.<eos> About anything in particular?<eos> I need to tell you that--<eos> Martin, it's okay.<eos> I just- - I wanted to tell you how much I... care about you.
'Cause I'm too busy destroying the fake wish box.<eos> Really? You think I'm that stupid to fall for that silly trick?<eos> And here I thought you had such potential as a criminal.<eos> Criminal?<eos> I'm sorry. I tried to tell you.
I am my grandfather's grandson.<eos> And I'm proud of that.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> How are you?
There is nothing more important to me in this world than you.<eos> Naturally, I had everything under control.<eos> That's him right there, officers.<eos> Oh, thank God you guys are here.<eos> I know I'm the last guy you probably want to talk to right now, but I just wonder if you'd give me a chance to explain myself.
- We have to get him help.<eos> - No. You need to run.<eos> My name is Danny.<eos> I'm hunting members of the Hand.<eos> I think you're the man we're looking for.
- Do not say the H-word.<eos> - Jess, I...<eos> - I've got enough of a headache as it is.<eos> I'm just saying, you might wanna consider going home, getting some sleep, rejoining society.<eos> I'm talking to you.
- Oh, my pleasure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> God.<eos> - You okay?
I'm already angry.<eos> At who?<eos> Everyone.<eos> I just want my life back.<eos> They can't give you that.
I hope so.<eos> But maybe you won't.<eos> But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.
But maybe you won't.<eos> But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.<eos> You have... You gotta take it back.
I'm sorry. After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.<eos> - Danny.<eos> Wake up.<eos> - No!<eos> You okay?
- What?<eos> We are not doing that thing where you come in here like you live here.<eos> - You gave me a key.<eos> - You took the spare key when you changed the locks without my permission.<eos> Door was broken, and I was doing you a favor.
You know, "He's squeaky clean.<eos> This is unlike him."<eos> But then I got a call.<eos> Someone used a voice scrambler and told me not to take the case.<eos> Bet you loved that, didn't you?
Elektra.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do miss her.<eos> But I know that the things she brought out of me were wrong.<eos> From what you've told me about her, I think she'd be happy about how well you're doing.
Purgatory is a place for the dead, Matthew, not the living.<eos> There's nothing wrong with letting people go.<eos> She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.
I ain't know nothing about that.<eos> I mean, we didn't talk about everything.<eos> That was his business.<eos> Of course.<eos> What about you?
I'm just in between stuff right now.<eos> I'm always on that hustle, though.<eos> You feel me? I do.<eos> Listen...<eos> I can help you.
Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
- Yeah.<eos> You sure you want to stay pro bono?<eos> I'm just happy I could help.<eos> - Thanks, Josie. - Hmm.<eos> How about you?
After you told her your little secret, lucky she didn't freak out and have us both disbarred.<eos> - We can trust her.<eos> - I know.<eos> You can trust me, too.<eos> How you doing after last night?
Earth shook, Foggy.<eos> The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.<eos> But I do think I can help you through it.
The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.<eos> But I do think I can help you through it.<eos> I came to offer you something.
Then we tried anyway.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Talking to you.
Is this about protecting me or protecting you?<eos> Take the day off.<eos> Have a drink or five.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.
You've earned it.<eos> They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.<eos> You actually saved lives today.<eos> Well, save yourself some time, Hogarth. Stop worrying about me.<eos> This only looks like plastic, but I'm telling you it's solid gold.
- Welcome back, big man.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.
Weird how?<eos> This tremor stuff, I think...<eos> I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.<eos> Trish, I gotta call you back.<eos> Malcolm, what did I tell you about coming in my apartment?
I should never have come here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You can't have this.<eos> You okay?
Great.<eos> Then I guess you're free to go.<eos> Malcolm?<eos> Yeah, I just gave my statement.<eos> Are you okay?
He loved us and his job.<eos> And that's it. That was his whole life.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> How are you?
- 305. Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.
- Of course I have.<eos> - Okay, so what's the difference?<eos> The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.
Good luck, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're having a rough time in here.<eos> Misty says you'll be arraigned within 24 hours... but we can figure this out.<eos> Has anyone approached you about making a deal?
And then I realized he was using his lunch money.<eos> He said it was worth it... to keep the dream alive.<eos> How 'bout some cookies?<eos> Chocolate chip.<eos> Did he tell you I keep them?
- Danny Rand.<eos> Boy billionaire?<eos> He's a little off in the head, but he packs a mean right hook when it counts.<eos> So do you.<eos> You okay?
- Where? I can't be a part of this.<eos> If you ask me, you already are.<eos> We need to put it all on the table.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> I don't owe you any...
Besides, you leaping around the city like a Russian gymnast didn't exactly help.<eos> - You don't have any proof.<eos> - I did.<eos> You smashed it.<eos> I'm not threatening you.
Hey, these abilities that you have such contempt for... they might do some good right now.<eos> This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I just want to get answers for my client. I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.
I just want to get answers for my client. I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.
What word?<eos> Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem. Not you.
She hesitated.<eos> She didn't kill me. She had...<eos> She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.<eos> What do you want to do with him?<eos> Well, I can't disclose that.<eos> But I'll tell you what I'm willing to do for him.
We want him alive.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We work together, we walk out of here alive.<eos> No!<eos> Wait, I just wanna talk to you.
I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> What have they done to you?
Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can help you, Elektra!
It'll only be for a couple days.<eos> So, are you gonna tell me what this is all about?<eos> At this point, the less you know, the better.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> A couple days ago, I'm the one who introduced you to Danny Rand.
- For what?<eos> All of it.<eos> I never meant to make my trouble your trouble.<eos> Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.
Became the fighter you were meant to be.<eos> The fighter you wanted me to be.<eos> The one you needed for whatever horrible shit you're trying to get away with.<eos> Join me, Colleen.<eos> This time I'll tell you everything.
You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.<eos> Soon, Iron Fist.<eos> You'll learn your destiny is much more than what they told you in K'un-Lun.
It's after midnight.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> I'm gonna need a little more than that.<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> They came for you before, Karen.
I might know something.<eos> - Hell, we might even be on the same side.<eos> - You know we're on the same side.<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you anyway.<eos> Then I don't know how I can help you.
By the fourth, they'd run out of water.<eos> By the sixth, no food.<eos> I believe it was the tenth day that they knelt before me.<eos> Begging to make it stop.<eos> Well... if I kneel before you right now, shithead, will you shut up?
If she's as sweet as she smells, - I get why you're tore up about this one.<eos> - Don't bring her into this.<eos> All these years, this is what I've been protecting you from.<eos> Your two worlds colliding.<eos> If you had it your way, this is what my life would be.
- What?<eos> - Come on, we gotta go.<eos> Meeting's over.<eos> - Excuse me for one second.<eos> - Are you okay?
You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.
We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.<eos> But how can I trust you?
- And you're just now remembering this?<eos> You sense anything at the bottom of that hole?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I kept tabs on it. Once the building was finished, my sense was the hole was gone.<eos> - You sure? - I'm not sure of anything anymore.
He designed the place.<eos> What, you think he knows how Danny ties into this?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Well, I guess you two better get going.<eos> What about you?
You've been sleeping for hours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I like it here.<eos> Back in New York?<eos> Back with you.
We were unified. Until you brought the Black Sky into the fold.<eos> Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> I don't think I have to answer to you.
Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.
You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.<eos> And it's not like you, Alexandra, to show such...
Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.
It's simple.<eos> My dad abandoned us and got himself killed.<eos> - I know it's probably hard to understand...<eos> - Actually, it's not.<eos> Your dad didn't wanna hurt you or your mom.
But winning it... is gonna take something else.<eos> - You trained with the same elders I did?<eos> - No.<eos> Then what makes you think tying me up is the right choice?<eos> It seems like you're just making this up as you go along.
This is something below the building.<eos> - The hole?<eos> - No. Whatever this is, it's at the bottom of the hole.<eos> There's something under Midland Circle.<eos> - How you feeling?
But I feel the need to make amends.<eos> I thought that entire vintage had been destroyed in the fires at Marseille.<eos> You'd be surprised what you can find at the bottom of the Balearic Sea.<eos> Go on.<eos> I did not originally want to leave K'un-Lun with you.
You wanted to stay with the elders.<eos> You wanted to... use our discoveries only for good.<eos> It's time for you to know the truth.<eos> I did not want to stay in K'un-Lun at the time.<eos> I simply did not want to leave with you.
This isn't power.<eos> Living underground.<eos> In hiding.<eos> You know nothing of power.<eos> You didn't exist until Alexandra gave you life.
It does not matter.<eos> She has the ability to bring us a new beginning.<eos> And after that, anything can happen.<eos> What are we doing down here?<eos> That depends on you.
Matter of fact, I come with you. We both get disbarred.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know. And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.
Okay, good.<eos> 'Cause the people in this building need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer.<eos> I know.<eos> What is this?<eos> I still have a key to your place, so I brought you a change of clothes.
Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.
Okay is long gone.<eos> You should be at the precinct.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I know what you want, but you're not gonna get it.<eos> Because unlike you, my master taught me loyalty.
Except it's not fate.<eos> I came here to end this.<eos> Did you come for me?<eos> Or did you simply follow?<eos> I trained you to believe in yourself and your purpose.
Guys, this is... a lot worse than what we faced before.<eos> That's an understatement.<eos> So how are we gonna handle it?<eos> I got an idea.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.
But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.
I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.
She's losing too much blood.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> You guys need to get to the surface.<eos> - No complaints here.<eos> - What about you?
This is who I've always been.<eos> You forget... I know when you're lying.<eos> You've always wanted to find light in me.<eos> Look where it brought you.<eos> There is goodness in you.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
The end.<eos> Everybody get back! Get back!<eos> Take cover! Take cover!<eos> You gotta help her!<eos> I'm sorry, Matthew... for all the pain I've caused you along the way.
We'll see.<eos> What are you having?<eos> My fourth.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just came to see how you're holding up.
I don't know what to say.<eos> Nothing that I don't need to say myself.<eos> After what happened between us... we both could've handled it differently.<eos> Instead, the Earth had to shake for us to find each other again.<eos> What I did to you was...
One of 'em is in Harlem.<eos> Yeah, maybe we'll grab a coffee sometime or something.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's, uh... strong.<eos> How are you?
What do you think?<eos> I don't hate it.<eos> It's almost like you're back in business.<eos> Yeah, almost.<eos> How you doin'?
I saw your Instagram and I figured you might come here, so I...<eos> I'm, um...<eos> I just wanted to say...<eos> - Jesus, Mickey, come on...<eos> - Just, I just want to apologize to you 'cause I know I fucked everything up and I'm really sorry, and I haven't been honest with you.
I'm, um...<eos> I just wanted to say...<eos> - Jesus, Mickey, come on...<eos> - Just, I just want to apologize to you 'cause I know I fucked everything up and I'm really sorry, and I haven't been honest with you.<eos> There's a lot of stuff that I didn't tell you about myself, um...
- Just, I just want to apologize to you 'cause I know I fucked everything up and I'm really sorry, and I haven't been honest with you.<eos> There's a lot of stuff that I didn't tell you about myself, um...<eos> I'm an addict.<eos> I'm, uh... I'm a drug addict and I'm an alcoholic and I'm a sex and love addict and I...<eos> I think I need to just be by myself for maybe, like, a year and try and figure this shit out, but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you because you were a great guy and I really had such a good time with you
- Whoops. - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - No, that's okay.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> Jesus! I never wanted this night to go on this long.<eos> I just wanted to tell you my deal and then just go home.
- None of my business. - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Honestly, I'm just not that equipped to deal with a situation where I'm... juggling women or whatever, you know. I'm not Warren Beatty.<eos> Not even Ned Beatty.<eos> I guess I was worried that if after we had sex, I started texting you or calling you, you would just be like,
Mickey, stop.<eos> You're not helping, okay.<eos> Gus!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Gus, are you okay?
Wow, that's cool.<eos> You made our asses look good.<eos> That's 'cause I'm hot shit.<eos> Well, your hot shit came out of our lame asses.<eos> I just wanted to give you the good news.
Yeah, I don't know.<eos> It's hard to accept a pat on the back at work, when you're shitting the bed in the rest of your life.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Something up?<eos> - Oh, like I would ever tell you.
♪ And the cider house rules ♪<eos> ♪ And the cider house rules ♪<eos> One more time.<eos> ♪ And the cider house rules ♪<eos> How are you, dude?
You can stay here if you like.<eos> Nice and comfy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The coats are comfy.<eos> If I borrowed, like, $100 from you, I could pay you back $110 later on.
Feel like that's what people say when someone comes back from a trip.<eos> Well, then, let's just say I look super tan.<eos> - You want to order something? - Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, how have you been?
So, how have you been?<eos> Good.<eos> Good to be back. Yeah.<eos> - How about you?<eos> How are you? - Good. Good.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Time apart can really, uh, fuck up a relationship.<eos> I mean, that's what happened to my best friends, Katy and Russell.<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, did I not tell you?
- No, Mickey.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You're right.<eos> I am very codependent.<eos> And it's scary for me to look at my own shit, so I focus on yours 'cause it's easier, and that's just super unfair to you, and... I am sorry.
What's wrong?<eos> You're acting weird.<eos> I don't think we should do this anymore.<eos> Do what?<eos> You and me.
But I wasn't really breaking the rules or whatever.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey, great to see you!<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> How are you?
I was... making you that way.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I think it's, like I said, I'm really bad with separation, and... it made me act out and I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.
I think it's, like I said, I'm really bad with separation, and... it made me act out and I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.<eos> Well, me, too.<eos> I mean, I'm into you, not me.
Hey, I got your broccoli.<eos> I haggled him down to $1,000. I think that's fair, right?<eos> Yeah, you want to get out of here?<eos> I'm having a good time. You want to check out a few more booths - and then maybe head home?<eos> Yeah, um, how about I get you a massage?
Yeah, um, how about I get you a massage?<eos> - I don't know. I don't need it.<eos> - Come on!<eos> You got me broccoli. I'll get you a massage.<eos> - Okay. - Yeah, I'm getting that for you.
- We need to talk.<eos> No, we do not need to talk.<eos> I'm not leaving until we talk!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?
You want someone who is gonna fight for you!<eos> No, Dustin, I don't.<eos> Please, I don't.<eos> You don't know what the fuck you want, okay?<eos> I'm being direct with you.
I think when I got back, I just got excited...<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> Gus, it's not.<eos> It's...<eos> I wanna be in a relationship with you.
You came to me. I helped you.<eos> If you don't do this, you know the consequences.<eos> I'm not that guy anymore.<eos> You are always that guy, John.<eos> I can't help you.
You call this out?<eos> What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> What did you expect?<eos> Did you really think this day was never going to come?<eos> What does he want you to do?
Please.<eos> I didn't want to do this, John.<eos> Had you stayed retired, I would have respected it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're thinking about it, aren't you?
And what was her name, this woman whose life has ended my own?<eos> Helen.<eos> Helen.<eos> This Helen... was she worth the price that you now seek to pay?<eos> Now... let me tell you what happens when I die.
Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.<eos> The marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.
Jt didn't tell me that.<eos> He didn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> - You know what? Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.
Go on.<eos> Hey, bro, hey...<eos> Just calm down, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, look, man, i know you don't wanna be in here.
We are helping them.<eos> - You set it on fire?<eos> - Screw you, old man.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> I just told you, i didn't set that fire.
Alrighty. Save those horses!<eos> Come on, George b.<eos> That's it.<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I want so much for you to feel better.
Hey, there.<eos> You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
Yeah, somebody trained you really well.<eos> Now, don't you move or I'll be ass over teakettle, and we don't want that, do we?<eos> Come on now, aces.<eos> Look, I know you're scared, buddy.<eos> I promise, i ain't gonna hurt you.
Let's talk. Okay?<eos> Just talk, please.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I will have dinner with you.
But I don't see how.<eos> The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.
Keep me informed.<eos> You know that girl, Christian?<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't want you to worry about it.
You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian.<eos> It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you.
Whatever happens between me and Christian is none of your goddamn business.<eos> So you stay the fuck away from us.<eos> Hey, we should think about going soon.<eos> I wanna go now.<eos> What did Elena say to you?
I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Good evening, Mr. grey.<eos> Hey, ed.<eos> The rest of the crew will be here in the morning.<eos> If something were to happen to you because of me...
Nothing's gonna happen to me.<eos> Can I wash this off?<eos> Don't stray from the lines. Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?
Don't stray from the lines. Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.
You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything. And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.<eos> But I'd like to take you there myself.
But I'd like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course I would rather see New York with you.
Am I still gonna have a job now that he's not there?<eos> Well, if you don't, you can just...<eos> Christian, you know i love working.<eos> You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.<eos> What if I gave you a key?
You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.<eos> What if I gave you a key?<eos> I mean, what if you had a key, and you kept some of your stuff here?<eos> Keep all of your stuff here and you slept, you know... Not at your place.<eos> Are you asking me to move in with you?
Hey, it was all you.<eos> What? You don't believe me?<eos> I don't believe it myself.<eos> I asked you a question last night.<eos> About moving in with you?
Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?
Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?<eos> I expect you to call me Ana. And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself.
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
No, Christian.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Ana...<eos> Go to escala.<eos> For once, just do as you're told.
Look, I know she scared you... Yeah.<eos> She scared me.<eos> But you scared me more.<eos> Seeing you like that with her.<eos> I'll never be able to give you that kind of submission and obedience.
Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.
And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.<eos> But I'm done with it.<eos> You mean more to me than anything else.<eos> I wanna believe you.
Out all night.<eos> You didn't have any weird dreams or anything? Or, like, wake up at all?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, none that I can think of.<eos> I mean, there was a little thing of asking you to marry me, but aside from that, no. Nothing.
Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanna spend every second of the rest of my life with you.
The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday?<eos> When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you? He is so weird.
Ros and I have to go to Portland for some meetings.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow night.<eos> Come on.<eos> When were you going to tell me about your birthday?<eos> Your parents are throwing you a party.
Call it delayed gratification.<eos> Ls that... Ls that mount St. helens?<eos> I changed the flight plan, get us home sooner.<eos> Great.<eos> You realize that's a volcano, right?
Leave it on.<eos> Just turn it down please, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're shivering.<eos> I'll get you a sweater, okay?
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele... What am I gonna do with you?
Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's actually... It's going really well.<eos> Um, but I was calling because I, um... i wanted to talk to you about Christian.
You saw us last night.<eos> Yes. And because of that I am never taking anything for granted.<eos> Ever again.<eos> Hey! I heard about the crash.<eos> Are you okay?
Like, gone, gone?<eos> I'm done.<eos> The business. Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> What's that you got there?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.
Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> After you.
You do not have friends, and you're a loner who has super powers, It is not like that?<eos> We all like you, Ler,<eos> Khan,<eos> Arsus,<eos> Are not you curious who who did this to you?
He's in trouble, come quickly!<eos> Come on, come on<eos> You know I can't make living without my car<eos> Isn't my problem bro.<eos> Dominic Toretto, I heard about you

I jumped out of a 4 storey window Saving my partner's life<eos> Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs<eos> Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue<eos> I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me? And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?<eos> Let me tell you something.

The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room With one very... specific instruction<eos> It's not to save me<eos> It's to kill your son<eos> And that's a lot of bullets And it only takes one for you to loose everything<eos> So, I have to ask you, because... I know family is so important to you
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes<eos> I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something<eos> Deckard?<eos> He didn't make it<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Dom
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams Without any repercussions?<eos> I wouldn't have even looked your way.. If you hadn't done that<eos> You didn't even know you had a kid<eos> You can thank me for that And start doing the job I'm asking you to do<eos> Help you start a war

Did you invite them in?<eos> I literally just opened the door.<eos> - Come in. Come in.<eos> - Yeah, come on in.<eos> - After you.
What tub are you ta... The tin?<eos> That's a tin.<eos> That's not a tub.<eos> Tub, tin, whatever. No, I don't know.<eos> Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.<eos> Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.<eos> It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!<eos> Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "Hey, don't ingest that."<eos> 'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
- That happened at a bachelor party! They're strippers!<eos> They climb all over you! You can't stop them!<eos> You guys know!<eos> They're like monkeys at a zoo!<eos> The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.<eos> Hey, Ma-Martin. Are we cool, man?<eos> - I just want you to know truly... - Yeah, no. - Bro, I would never...<eos> - Gary, it's fine.<eos> - I mean, you know, we're not even... - I know. We're not, but still, I promise you on my...
- Yeah. Good to see you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?<eos> Yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, you know, you look like a... a rapist...<eos> Like you've committed rape.<eos> You know why Ginnie dumped you?<eos> 'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.<eos> I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
Take a picture, and post it on Bri-Baby's Twitter fuck.<eos> - You gonna make it upstairs okay?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Where it's at? - We'll...<eos> We'll help you up.
All right. - There you go.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> Move just a little bit.<eos> Drink this. Megan...<eos> Drink this. It's gonna make you feel better.
Move just a little bit.<eos> Drink this. Megan...<eos> Drink this. It's gonna make you feel better.<eos> - I'm not thirsty.<eos> - It'll make you feel better, Megan.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. Hot Stuff?<eos> - Mr. who? - Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.<eos> Really?<eos> Damn it.<eos> For you, man. Damn it.
- Fine.<eos> - That's what I thought.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Shit.<eos> Because it's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
I know how persuasive my dad can be.<eos> Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy?<eos> I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.<eos> I'll try.<eos> How are you?
They attend the funeral of a widower 'cause they know there'll be lots of old men.<eos> And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.
And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.<eos> And if you are ever short of two shillings, please do not hesitate to ask, as Africa also served me incredibly well.
Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you. To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?
What are you doing with the door?<eos> You want a bush, you come through me.<eos> That is private property.<eos> Helga, it's so good to see that you're still working-- even still alive.<eos> You know that I lay with you when I was just a little boy.
Do you want to fuck?<eos> - No, I want my family offices back.<eos> How much do you make here?<eos> With the workers in the yard and the boats that moor at the wharf... we make ã10 a day.<eos> I can give you five and whatever you like.
You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.<eos> Heard the stories.<eos> If I give you a girl, I will never see her again.
He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.<eos> It is more than ten years since you went away, and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, for both of our sakes.<eos> Whatever happens with this business of inheritance, and no matter if it results in a dispute,<eos> I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried, buried in a deeper grave.
And by the command of His Majesty Kill him.<eos> Where are you keeping everyone?<eos> In there.<eos> Right.<eos> You good?
Yes.<eos> You always had such beautiful fingers.<eos> Maria?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm sorry for what I did to you.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother?<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15.<eos> ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.
I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.
I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.
Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.<eos> And I can't stand to have you this close to me... Well, that is a shame, isn't it?<eos> Because I will always be this close to you.
James.<eos> For God's sake.<eos> The Art Of War.<eos> Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.
Where's Helga?<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed. I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that. Mm.
In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?<eos> But in the event... of a messenger coming to tell you that he had killed me, well, champagne!
Go and wash your hands.<eos> No need for any more questions.<eos> Not when half of London will be retelling the story anyway.<eos> So I shall hear through gossip?<eos> As I hear about you.
"For the purpose of preventing contagion." Hm?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I strongly suggest you to continue to see nothing.
James, what are you doing?<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> Dear Lord, we are gathered in your presence here today on this most sorrowful occasion to say farewell to Winter.<eos> Cured of her love of the world, untouched, pure, commended to God... she will not be covered in earth as corrupted flesh, but instead will be sent to you, O Lord... aboard a sunrise...
Robert.<eos> It's Robert.<eos> You know James Delaney, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come into the house, we'll find you something to eat and somewhere to sleep.
You might have done.<eos> But I do know you cared for her.<eos> You were kind to her. She told me.<eos> The boy Robert's arrived.<eos> You OK?
To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> What about you?
Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account...<eos> he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe? Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
- He's not coming!<eos> Don't he want his share?<eos> - Hurry up, Temple!<eos> - Come on, Temple!<eos> Hello. I've been looking for you.
Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.<eos> And if that sickly youth on the doorstep is there to protect you from East India assassins, know that by 2:00 AM he's easily distracted by whores.<eos> Well, you needn't worry about the East India Company.

But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?<eos> I want that information.<eos> I will pay you for it.<eos> I'll pay you a pound every month.
I will pay you for it.<eos> I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.
Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.
Do you know we can't even afford new china?<eos> So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha... I apologise... that I am not related to you.
So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha... I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.
It's not like I'm going anywhere.<eos> Sorry about the village.<eos> But it's just the same old village, though.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'd give up a million villages just to be with you here forever.
Uh, Norman Bates.<eos> I'm Madeleine Loomis.<eos> Well, it's sure been nice meeting you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I have to take money from you.
Mother, I'm not thinking anything.<eos> She is just a nice girl.<eos> Would it really be that awful if I had a friend?<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> Oh, Mother, what is wrong with you?
Well, let me see, for, uh...<eos> Let's see, for starters,<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?
And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?<eos> Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?
I can't leave!<eos> I can't go anywhere! I'm going nuts here!<eos> I literally gave up my life to protect you.<eos> Okay?<eos> To give you a life without trouble.
We... we... we have a life.<eos> I know, and I appreciate it.<eos> Stop saying you appreciate it!<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> It's not fair to you.
He did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.<eos> Dylan.<eos> He didn't want me to tell you, and I...
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.<eos> Dylan.<eos> He didn't want me to tell you, and I...<eos> I never wanted to tell you.
I don't know, Kate.<eos> Mother.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you some sample cans of paint and brushes so you can try out the colors.
Mother.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you some sample cans of paint and brushes so you can try out the colors.<eos> Well, that's incredibly kind of you.
I brought you some sample cans of paint and brushes so you can try out the colors.<eos> Well, that's incredibly kind of you.<eos> Oh, I found my wallet, actually.<eos> You can pay me later.<eos> I felt bad; I should've just told you that yesterday.
This place is awfully cute.<eos> We, uh...<eos> I... I like it.<eos> I'd love to see the house.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, I'd love to show it to you. It's just a little bit of a mess right now, so.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean, it happened.<eos> We did not plan it, but...<eos> I just felt so strong, like life had given me a second chance.<eos> Can I... can I talk to you about something?
We did not plan it, but...<eos> I just felt so strong, like life had given me a second chance.<eos> Can I... can I talk to you about something?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, I want to thank you.
Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, I want to thank you.<eos> For... what?<eos> For what you did for me to help me get the surgery.<eos> I can't tell you.
Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes, that's all.<eos> You know, I see these housewives in their identical homes with their identical lives, and...<eos> They disgust me, but sometimes I... I wish I could be like that, wish I could live like that.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
- Mom!<eos> - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I said, "Just a sec."<eos> Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?<eos> You can find everything that you've been searching for in Christ.<eos> And I'd better not come home and find my son watching that claptrap with you.
- What about the dogs?<eos> - Don't worry, sweetie.<eos> Tomorrow... you're gonna write us a little check, and then we will be happy to get you the hell out of this place.<eos> A check?<eos> I'm gonna make this easy on you, Madalyn.
Do I need to remind you who's holding the guns here?<eos> Everybody just needs to settle in... and try and get along.<eos> Looks like we're gonna be roommates for a few days.<eos> You don't think the police are gonna be looking for me?<eos> No, Madalyn, I don't think anyone's gonna be looking for you.
- Yeah, I wanna ask Mrs. Murray...<eos> - Uh, Murray O'Hair.<eos> How can you look at yourself in the mirror every day?<eos> Only a godless bitch like you would go to court to stop prayer.<eos> Thanks to you, this country's on its way to hell in a handbasket.
- Oh, come on.<eos> You were over that fusspot a long time ago.<eos> At least she didn't cheat on you like Richard did with me.<eos> What about Robin?<eos> No, don't you worry about Red.
- Let me give you an example.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Uh, Johnny, you were recently married. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And how about if you went to your wife, and you grabbed her and said,<eos> "Uh, may I have carnal knowledge of you?"
You are so full of yourself, you can't see the fucking forest for the trees.<eos> While you're out fighting the world, you're making real enemies right under your nose.<eos> You get a load of that, Red?<eos> David Waters is lecturing me.<eos> Your own son would tell you the exact same thing.
That's what men do.<eos> Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.
You think they're gonna believe a fucking felon? Get out of here.<eos> You're ruining my holiday party.<eos> You really can be pathetic, you know.<eos> You just wanna be the momma I never had, give us both a second chance.<eos> Well, let me tell you something about my momma.
Leave a message.<eos> Hey, Bob, it's, uh... it's Danny.<eos> You know, I was actually just headed back to Florida just now, but, um... I've got a couple things I gotta tie up still here in Texas.<eos> So, uh...<eos> But I'm gonna be sending you a letter.
Yeah.<eos> Well, you've called me worse.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, you know that.<eos> What about you, Red?
- Diwata.<eos> Children of the board unite, right, Howie?<eos> My private blog.<eos> It's getting a lot of hits lately.<eos> You should check it out.
You know what?<eos> Then on the record, I say,<eos> "Why don't you ask your stepfather about our school's policies?"<eos> Because he's on the school board that actually makes them.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

Please proceed to your next round.<eos> For those who did not advance, the cafeteria is available for a short time and accepts all major credit cards.<eos> Finally, congratulations to the Holy Ghost Academy...<eos> Hey, is that you, man?<eos> I heard what you did on your PS-Opp.
I shouldn't then.<eos> I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?<eos> Yeah, alcohol dries out the chords.<eos> You know... someone who looks a lot like you, was checking out the family planning center, across from the pizza shop I work at last week.
I was just too scared to go in.<eos> 'Cause I'm not sure I'm...<eos> I did one of those, like, home tests, and it was, like, kind of a line, maybe not.<eos> I can't go to my family doctor, so I've gotta go back there to get official results.<eos> Do you have someone to go with you?
Too soon.<eos> You know you're really lucky, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Especially since that guy, Mark... day after we did it, I... called just to say hey or whatever, and he was like,<eos> "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted," so...
I don't know what to do.<eos> No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.<eos> Well, you know, getting people to listen to you is kind of the opposite of getting people to like you.
Kylie?<eos> Is that your adoptive family?<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You should've died with them.<eos> Let me help you with that.
Hello?<eos> Hey!<eos> Mom?<eos> It's okay, your mom's not here.<eos> You're okay.
It's been a while since anyone came through Canaan.<eos> How long?<eos> Since April 8th, 1987?<eos> Why would you disturb those things?<eos> They don't belong to you.
I know why they didn't...<eos> You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.
I want to save Stiles.<eos> Don't let me be the only one left behind.<eos> I don't have a Caleb.<eos> Go.<eos> - Are you okay?
Don't let me be the only one left behind.<eos> I don't have a Caleb.<eos> Go.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Are you okay?
What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But stay behind me.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It's afraid of you.
And there isn't a catastrophic solar flare.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> He has third degree burns over 90% of his body.<eos> I should be telling you to say your goodbyes.
Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.
On a ghost town.<eos> You don't see anything?<eos> I see a deeply disturbed young woman.<eos> You're afraid to remember him because you're afraid of what it means.<eos> Why do you care so much if I remember him?
Would you please try to behave like a human?<eos> I need Stiles for that.<eos> Why? Is he your human crutch?<eos> He's my anchor.<eos> I'll get you a new anchor.
- What, you're kidding, right?<eos> - Go.<eos> Get help.<eos> Find your friends.<eos> Yeah, and what about you?
He was here.<eos> I know it.<eos> Stiles was here.<eos> Liam...<eos> - There's something you need to see.
They're all gone.<eos> - Look, you have to come with me.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.
You understand?<eos> Clay!<eos> You're back already, dude?<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah, let me tell you something.
What?<eos> I mean, it's not cool to be homophobic, but I totally respect your right to be.<eos> Wait, you think I'm homophobic because I won't embrace a man in his underpants that I just met?<eos> But your reaction was really strong. Borderline violent.<eos> I bet if I were a hot woman in a bikini, you'd probably be fine hugging me, yeah?
That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.<eos> - What's up, bro?<eos> - Dude, that is awesome!<eos> You know, my cousin competed against you in freestyle.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times I've seen you ride.
Yeah, me too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, hey, look, man, welcome.<eos> I cannot wait to work with you.
Hey.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> How are you?
It was pretty impressive the way you were able to peg those bikes back there.<eos> I think if you would just chill for five minutes, man, we can have a winning team. You know what I mean?<eos> LA-15-7-MARY-3 and 4, we are in pursuit of red Ferrari.<eos> Code three!<eos> I was trying to give you a goddamn compliment!
Hansen just saw him at All Steel Armored.<eos> What about his partner?<eos> There's no way Baker could be IA.<eos> He was a fucking X-Games guy a few years back.<eos> - You don't like it.
Is there any blood?<eos> Fucking blood.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> We're going to talk about this.<eos> Dude, I will run in and get you some Imodium if you're ashamed, okay?
Take the olive branch and accept some help, okay?<eos> Come on, Ponch!<eos> Ponch, slow down.<eos> You're not good enough to ride this fast.<eos> I'd rather crash and die than talk to you.
Okay.<eos> Look, man, just, real quick, I wasn't trying to embarrass you.<eos> We all have sex issues.<eos> I haven't slept with my wife in a year.<eos> But when people have oversexualized behavior like yours, sometimes that's evidence of past childhood trauma and I just wanted you to feel safe talking to me.

I'm northbound, through Elysian Park.<eos> Ponch is southbound.<eos> Change of plans. I'm going around.<eos> This is 7-MARY-4, we're heading towards some kind of fair.<eos> 7-MARY-4, we're right behind you.
Good morning.<eos> Uh, it's Officer Jon Baker, and I was wondering if you could patch me through to Ava Perez.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> You thought it was inappropriate to go on a motorcycle ride together and now, I'm supposed to come over to your bedroom, help you from your bed into your bathtub so you can pop some pills and loosen up?
Turns out they filed an eviction notice yesterday for an apartment he cosigned on.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> Text me the address.<eos> Buddy.<eos> Oh, my God, dude. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.
Argh! Ow!<eos> God, you're fucking hurting me, man.<eos> - Let's just get it over with!<eos> - You're making it worse!<eos> I'm not gonna argue semantics with you.
We need round two with TJ's wife.<eos> See ya, buddy.<eos> Jesus, dude, you eat more pills than Elvis.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Hey, I know you were joking back there, but I want you to know I don't abuse my medication.
We'll need your help to see who that could be.<eos> I see you around this house again, I will be in your ass with a boot.<eos> - Motherfucker!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I told you to stay away from here!
You're gonna lift this.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, how did you know about TJ?<eos> His wife didn't even know.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with a secret.
His wife didn't even know.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with a secret.<eos> Not like that.<eos> Unless they were part of your crew.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...
I still do it.<eos> Fuck it, right?<eos> I'm only here once, you know?<eos> Oh-oh, is that our guy?<eos> Listen, I gotta tell you something.
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yes, I'm serious.<eos> Okay, don't shoot.<eos> I do all the shooting, okay?<eos> Okay, I'll corral them to you.
Oh, body's a little sore, but I'm okay.<eos> They just discharged me.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Yeah, I was kind of scared when I saw your car Frisbee like that.<eos> But, I'm glad you're all right.
No, I do not.<eos> Maybe after I take care of your little boyfriend.<eos> So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> When I am healed, I am gonna physically destroy you.
I'm really sorry, man.<eos> I would've been here when you woke up, but I was buying a new phone.<eos> No, man, it's good.<eos> I'm all good.<eos> What do you mean, you're good?
Listen, I've done back flips with worse injuries than this.<eos> We're gonna need backup.<eos> Clearly, he blames us for Reed.<eos> We don't know who in this department is in on this.<eos> - I trust you, and you trust me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Back up, you're on Ponch's pinky!<eos> I saw a look on your face tonight I haven't seen in years, not since you competed.<eos> I can tell you really like this thing, being a cop.
You're kind of a dick.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Ponch.<eos> Take care, Karen.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Yeah, are you okay?
It turns out that he got all this stuff from a family whose son died in a plane crash a couple of years back.<eos> And now it's just a bunch of outdated junk.<eos> I prefer "vintage."<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> You still got some life in you.
It's not uncommon for a new student to find something or someone that's more interesting to them than class.<eos> My advice to you?<eos> Move on.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - I'm telling you, it's different.
I can feel her.<eos> It's all changing.<eos> You don't have much time.<eos> You need to trust me.<eos> How could I ever trust you?
Look at me.<eos> You're the girlfriend.<eos> Where's Holt?<eos> I...<eos> I can help you.
You're the girlfriend.<eos> Where's Holt?<eos> I...<eos> I can help you.<eos> But I need to show you something first.
I just painted the ceiling.<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> He's not avoiding you.<eos> He's just on a journey.<eos> I want you to watch something and then you'll understand.
- Is that my phone?<eos> - You're lying!<eos> I need you to do this for me.<eos> It's just a two-minute video.<eos> It won't hurt you.
What is that?<eos> Go back.<eos> Right there!<eos> The bird.<eos> I told you in the car I saw that bird.
Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Burke!<eos> It's Julia!<eos> I have to talk to you!<eos> The boy's not with you.
I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.<eos> It's braille.<eos> I'm gonna come find you guys.<eos> Our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> I'm telling you, she's coming back.
Daughter of the South.<eos> Stone queen on a throne of honey.<eos> Secret owner of all gold.<eos> I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
I bow my head before you and worship you.<eos> My God, that's incredible.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't stop, honey.<eos> I offer you everything... my money, my blood, my life!
Everything!<eos> Gift me your body.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hello, kitty.<eos> What can I get you?
So what, you're from Ireland?<eos> I told you I'm a leprechaun.<eos> We don't come from Moscow, Russia.<eos> Or Moscow, Idaho, for that matter.<eos> How much has our man told you?
I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.<eos> You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well, I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.
Sounds like a lot of work to me.<eos> It's easier just to pluck them out of the air.<eos> Simplest trick in the world.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> Tell you what.
I'll fight you for it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not fighting you.
Can you feel the joy rising in your veins like the sap in the springtime?<eos> We're done.<eos> It ain't over till I say it is.<eos> You may have drank a lot.<eos> Let it come back to you.
You're going to be driving Betty here from now on.<eos> I just thought you could use some sleep.<eos> It's not every day a man gets to bury his wife.<eos> I have preparations and communications to keep me busy enough, after which I will entertain myself.<eos> Now I'll tell you this once and once only ever.
I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.<eos> Robbie did his best to avoid looking at me.<eos> Get used to the boot, puppy.<eos> There is no closure from the dead.<eos> Maybe, you know, three years from now, some therapist will tell you, to write her a letter saying everything you wish you could say to her and drop it in the ocean.
And maybe it'll help.<eos> It won't help.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Shadow.<eos> I really am.<eos> Anyone tell you that yet?
What is it Wednesday is up to?<eos> We barely exchanged a dozen words.<eos> But you can let me out here and then I'll walk the rest of the way.<eos> You're saying that you don't know?<eos> Telling you I don't know.
Telling you I don't know.<eos> Would you tell me even if you did?<eos> Probably not.<eos> As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?
Don't trust him.<eos> Trying to start a war, GladOWar?<eos> We're at war already, and we're losing.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Today is my day.<eos> This is all too big.<eos> Too much going on at once.<eos> - Aw, Jesus, Nancy.<eos> - I'm gonna tell you a story.
It was good fucking times.<eos> Kings didn't like that.<eos> Kings came one after the other to knock her off her throne.<eos> They didn't last long.<eos> When the queen was done with you... you were gone.
She gets on her knees.<eos> She takes what she don't want to, and we watch in easy fucking judgment and pretend we'd do a single thing different in her shoes.<eos> I hear they blew up your altar.<eos> Darn.<eos> I have a new one to offer you.
Not in a long while has he been one of yours.<eos> You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?
That's Jesus Christ. A Jesus Christ.<eos> Some Jesus Christ.<eos> For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?<eos> Like I said, you wouldn't believe in me if I told you.
For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?<eos> Like I said, you wouldn't believe in me if I told you.<eos> Happy Easter, you old fraud.<eos> And a fair Ostara to you.
No!<eos> It's her day.<eos> You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned.
You know, I don't really believe any of this.<eos> And maybe everything that's happened so far is just some kind of vivid dream.<eos> And...<eos> I don't even know if I can believe that.<eos> Even if you don't believe, you cannot travel in any other way than the road your senses show you.
They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.
I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.<eos> Make them pray.<eos> Let them remind themselves it was a queen that gave them the harvest.<eos> They'll be hungry but then they'll turn to you, and they will pray to Ostara once again.
I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Don't stoop.<eos> Somebody tried to raise you with refined manners, dead girl, and failed.
I swear to Jesus.<eos> He's right outside.<eos> You know which god.<eos> Of course I know which god.<eos> I want to hear you fucking say it, so say it.
And it will definitely fucking suck.<eos> But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.<eos> They are not racist.<eos> All right.<eos> I would've told you.
I'm not jealous.<eos> I made you jealous? I'm not jealous of Rod.<eos> It's Rod!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?
It's the groundskeeper.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Hi!<eos> My little girl! Come here!<eos> How are you?
And let me finish?<eos> Uh-huh. Go ahead.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely. Oh, God.<eos> You realize you're coming off as, like, the world's biggest douchebag, right?
That was so crazy.<eos> I mean... How are they different than that cop?<eos> That's the fucking bummer of it all.<eos> Anything more you'd like to add?<eos> I told you so, like...
Logan.<eos> Logan King.<eos> Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.
Stop, don't...<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Don't...<eos> Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's all good, all right?<eos> They got you on display now, huh?
But it's Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so...<eos> Bruh, I don't care if the bitch is lyanla Vanzant, okay? "Iyanla Vanzant: American inspirational speaker," "life coach and television personality." ________________________________________<eos> You ain't gettin' in my head. I know. She caught me off guard, right?<eos> But it's cool because I'm cured. It worked.<eos> Bruh, how are you not scared of this, man?
I just need to go.<eos> - You wanna go? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Without me?<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> I told you about that night my mom died.
Are you packing?<eos> Rose, we gotta go. We gotta go now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Is everything okay?<eos> I'll tell you in the car. But we gotta go right now.

Help.<eos> Help. Help me.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Chris!<eos> I mean, I told you not to go in that house.
An automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?<eos> I could be Mr. Wednesday with a shake of the handed.<eos> How much has our man told you?
This is how we get stereotypes.<eos> Anansi...<eos> You want help?<eos> Fine.<eos> Let me tell you a story.
Hey, you-you hungry?<eos> I mean, they got no food here, but you can order a pizza, and you can put it on the room.<eos> Look, I'm not fuckin' hungry.<eos> I was just hijacked by a toad-skin-smokin' punk in a virtual fuckin' limo.<eos> Said to tell you that he's reprogrammed reality.
Never really had a life here.<eos> It's Laura's town.<eos> Too many people tell each other not to repress their emotions, to release their feelings, to let the pain go.<eos> There's a lot to be said for bottling up emotions.<eos> I'm gonna tell you something and you're gonna want to hurt me, but what I say has gotta be said.
Now they hold a smaller screen on their lap or in the palm of their hand so they don't get bored watching the big one.<eos> Time and attention, better than lamb's blood.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.

They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.<eos> I would never do that to you, honey.<eos> No, I want to offer you a job.
And he ain't even yesterday anymore.<eos> I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?
They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.<eos> We're done.<eos> Whatever the old guys are giving you, I can give you so much more.
Lucy!<eos> Don't fight gravity, Shadow.<eos> I've been at this a while, not as long as some, but I've seen things.<eos> Guys like you end up a suicide every time.<eos> I'm trying to help you keep your neck out of the belt.
- I don't want one.<eos> Well, you need one.<eos> What if someone wants to talk to you?<eos> Why the hell would I want to talk to anyone?<eos> Okay, what if I need to talk to you?
Why is he in my home?<eos> Make him not be here, or I'll make him not be here.<eos> I already invite him for dinner.<eos> I cannot uninvite. I come here only to share bread and information.<eos> What you choose to do with the latter is entirely up to you.
Can you get out?<eos> I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.<eos> Or I will break him open... Shh! Shh!<eos> I'm not going with you anywhere!
Let your sister hear this con man, this son of a bitch, come into my home and try to make me die.<eos> You brought that madness into my life once.<eos> - Never again.<eos> - They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you... each of them thinking they know what strong is.
No, no, no. No. Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?<eos> So you stay and you eat.<eos> Otherwise, she will be insulted.<eos> You understand? But if you want to leave after, I will hold open the door.
- The whole lot was almost worthless.<eos> This is treason, Falk!<eos> You treasonous asshole!<eos> - The Reconnaissance Directorate is done. The country we worked for is done, too.<eos> The country is done because of the likes of you.
Tomorrow will be challenging.<eos> - You're ready.<eos> I think so.<eos> Good night.<eos> What's between you and this agent?
I didn't choose my father.<eos> He is an egoistic asshole.<eos> I was supposed to be on the Kasan-job.<eos> Again he blocked my way.<eos> What about you?
- I know that you do.<eos> I see...<eos> You still haven't got over it. That he unmasked you.<eos> Well, all right. Let's assume... I do have Kern.<eos> Why would it be in my interests to entrust him to you?
- First you have Martha betray me, then you steal my child?<eos> - She didn't betray you, asshole.<eos> We discovered you with our bugs.<eos> And you just happened to become a couple?<eos> I was to find out if she was working with you. Weeks of interrogation.
- Seen her eyes?<eos> Check out her hands.<eos> And she's pretty, smart and strong willed.<eos> Plus she's successful.<eos> It seems to really matter to you.
Move across.<eos> Falk!<eos> Shit.<eos> We need a paramedic in room 115.<eos> I have to tell you something.
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper<eos> - than go to another fucking funeral.<eos> - Got it.<eos> You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.<eos> When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.<eos> You're sounding just as paranoid as him.<eos> Dad said he needed to change things up.<eos> People knowing our address was too dangerous.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
You're looking at this all wrong.<eos> You're wearing whatever the opposite of... What is it? Rose-colored glasses.<eos> That's what you're wearing.<eos> Shit-colored glasses.<eos> Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.<eos> I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.<eos> Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.<eos> Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."<eos> These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
It's okay.<eos> I just told one person.<eos> It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.<eos> You mean Isla.<eos> You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.<eos> - It was always about your mother.<eos> - Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.<eos> Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.<eos> - Hey. Can I show you something?
Wait.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - That's what I'm trying to figure out.<eos> - You were gonna keep this from me?<eos> - No, I'm... I'm showing you now.
And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.<eos> I know Mom died...<eos> Not died. She killed herself.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
- Sit down.<eos> I need you to come with me right now.<eos> Sit down, Will.<eos> This is just your memory.<eos> I'm a part of you. Sit down.
He's in a different place.<eos> Two separate parts in the same place.<eos> Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.<eos> No, no, no. I'm not ready to go back yet.<eos> I need more time with you.
His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.<eos> That's okay.<eos> If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
Look.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, come here.<eos> Let me help you.
- Motherfucker!<eos> God damn it.<eos> You okay? Yeah.<eos> Just a leg cramp.<eos> You like what you see?
Now you know.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to relax.<eos> I also wanted to see you.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you ever stop to think about what happened to Charlie could have happened to me?
Well, according to that definition, everyone would be running a con.<eos> Fine. Fuck.<eos> I'm running a con. But you know what?<eos> This is a con I plan on running for the rest of my life.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to threaten you.
Do you remember that?<eos> My sainted brother broke the law?<eos> No, I...<eos> It was... We blew up a paint can with a firecracker.<eos> Oh, Grandpa, I was hoping to leave Jacob with you while I went to the shop today.
No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm guessing you're mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you, Lance?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.
I was just trying to help you out.<eos> A client with bogus collateral. Okay, now, I didn't know that.<eos> Wanted for murder in New York.<eos> - What? - You gonna pretend you didn't know about that?<eos> You honestly think I would send you a murderer?
And then he cheated on you. Yeah, you should have punched him in the dick.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now... I have to go tell Audrey.<eos> This is new.<eos> I've already said it to you on many occasions.
Uh, all right, from the pull.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wow. What a performance.<eos> I mean, really, really captivating.<eos> - Hey, how you doing? - Good. How are you?
[screaming]<eos> It's subtle, but it is there.<eos> It has more of a... oh, what would you call it?<eos> A solid pop sound.<eos> Did you recognize that, Marius?
I don't know what...<eos> I was really starting to like you, but now that I found out that your accent is fake and...<eos> Calm down.<eos> You.<eos> I know exactly what I'm gonna do with you.
Hush Puppy doesn't get a goddamn choke leash. Then it's a regular leash.<eos> Whatever. - Just put her on a leash.<eos> ♪ Come on, baby, shake your body ♪<eos> All right, let me see.<eos> It's pretty damn cool, I'll give you that.
Oh, fuck.<eos> All right, hang on, hang on.<eos> You know what? Something's really bugging me here.<eos> I thought things between you and me were good.<eos> I mean, you earned my trust the past few years.
All right, hang on, hang on.<eos> You know what? Something's really bugging me here.<eos> I thought things between you and me were good.<eos> I mean, you earned my trust the past few years.<eos> I gave you your freedom.
Why run now? Hmm?<eos> Someone got to you, didn't they?<eos> It was Marius, wasn't it?<eos> He got through to you, huh?<eos> Sent you a warning or a little message or some code or something like that?
Thank you.<eos> Do the nose.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not sticking up for you earlier with Audrey.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not sticking up for you earlier with Audrey.<eos> No problem. I'm still... I'm still just sort of catching up on things.<eos> Was she always that mean to you when we were kids?
No.<eos> I used to get angry and fight with her, but nothing changed, so why even try?<eos> You still glad you came back?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Pete, your memories of this place... it hasn't been like that since... well, since you and your mom left.
There's got to be new people in the casinos that don't know me, right?<eos> I saw Karolina.<eos> Well? How did she seem?<eos> She seems scared.<eos> She still doesn't want to talk to you.
It's a mainly... It's, of course, a mainly white business, all the company owners and the agents, and they all are secretly racist.<eos> So they all tell these girls not to do this.<eos> And then I'm the one telling these girls,<eos> "I've done more interracial than regular scenes, and I'm good."<eos> But it's a fear factor for a young girl, and of course, when you look up to your agent, he's been teaching you things, you're gonna believe what he says.
"Would you like to play the role?"<eos> A lead role in a real movie?<eos> Well, I guess so.<eos> I said, "Can I cook too?" He said, "Yeah."<eos> He said, "I'll pay you 100 a day for acting, and 45 a day to cook."
And I said, "How's Mom taking it?"<eos> And he said, "Well, you know Mom.<eos> She rolls with any punch that comes her way,"<eos> and she did, you know.<eos> Uh, she never said "I forgive you."
"How do you get into porn? How do you get into porn?"<eos> And then I ended up doing a photo shoot with High Society and Cherry Magazine in Jamaica.<eos> And who was my roommate?<eos> Jenna Jameson was.<eos> So, she's like, "You need to move to LA and live with me", and I'll hook you up."
I'm like, "You're a fucking jerkoff!"<eos> Dude calls me back, like, a year later and he goes,<eos> "I got your comeback film."<eos> I'm like, "Get the fuck outta here."<eos> "Didn't think I'd be hearing from you again," and...
Rig ht there.<eos> Yeah, very strong.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Rig ht there, good.<eos> Do you like this job so far?
Beautiful.<eos> Rig ht there, good.<eos> Do you like this job so far?<eos> I love this job so far.<eos> Are there certain aspects of this kind of work that you dislike?
The adult business and the escort business are two separate businesses. They want nothing to do with each other.<eos> In fact, years back, if you were escorting, you were blackballed in the adult industry.<eos> They would never hire you again on set if they found out you were escorting.<eos> You're supposed to be untouchable when you're doing film.<eos> And so that means not everybody can get to you to shoot you or... not everybody could get to you to have sex with you.
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the feature presentation.<eos> Shit.<eos> This thing on?<eos> How the hell am I gonna shut it off?<eos> And Tabitha, what about you?
So you can chat 'em up.<eos> Oh, chat's not really my thing.<eos> I like it.<eos> I think we're gonna get along.<eos> As long as you remember I started here three weeks before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you.
- Nothing wrong yet.<eos> It's called taking care of things.<eos> - Dad, you remember Clay.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> How you doing, Clay?
Then you are deaf.<eos> That's so much smoother. Like night and day.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I know, and you should too.<eos> That's why I'm showing you this.
When you're done listening to all 13 sides, because there are 13 sides to every story... rewind the tapes, put them back in the box, and pass them on to the next person.<eos> Why the hell am I on this?<eos> Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.
I'm fine, really.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I told you, bike, branch, skin.<eos> That's all?<eos> Mom, I tell you everything about my life because it is so fascinating, I promise.
I, uh, should get to class.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> So, I'll see you around, then.<eos> I guess you will.<eos> Being Kat's boyfriend was kind of the only remarkable thing about you, but, Justin, you were my Kryptonite.
I like it.<eos> It shows initiative.<eos> So, could I like maybe get your number or something?<eos> Or something?<eos> So, I could give you my number or give you some fake nuclear launch codes?
I just said "Hannah Baker is."<eos> Can't say that anymore.<eos> Just wait, I'm gonna get you.<eos> I dreamed our first kiss would take place in the park.<eos> I never told you that.
What came after my first kiss? Not so wonderful.<eos> We'll continue our discussion of nonverbal signals tomorrow.<eos> So, until then, make note, be aware.<eos> I'm not angry you betrayed me.<eos> I'm angry that I trusted you in the first place.
I'll see you around, Clay.<eos> Tony.<eos> Am I side two?<eos> Hey, Helmet.<eos> Can I eat with you?
Hannah.<eos> A rumor based on a kiss ruined a memory that I hoped would be special.<eos> In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.
I've been there.<eos> Now, it won't always be easy.<eos> It might even hurt a bit.<eos> Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.
Hey, Joanne.<eos> Hazel.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> Um, I'm ahead of you.
For a while, we were the kind of friends you wish you had.<eos> We did disgusting things like shop together.<eos> Sorry!<eos> And compare what we bought.<eos> That top is perfect for you.
Hey, man.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> How am I doing?<eos> How are you doing?
I'm committed to this.<eos> God, you're weird.<eos> No, I'm a searcher.<eos> The fact that you just called yourself a searcher is weird.<eos> Something's up with you today.
Are you fat-shaming my salad?<eos> You called my lunch a murderer.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Anytime.<eos> Can I ask you a super-needy, when-did- I-become-this-kind-of-girl question?
That was the table, yeah?<eos> Don't pretend you don't know.<eos> You listened to the tapes. You had to.<eos> Who else has?<eos> I'm not here to tell you that.
It's hard.<eos> To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?
To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?<eos> More than I can tell you.
Why haven't you been at school?<eos> I just needed a day off to chill.<eos> They day after you talk to Porter, you need a day off?<eos> You're not telling me something!<eos> What would I not be telling you?
That if a butterfly flaps its wings at just the right time in just the right place... it can cause a hurricane thousands of miles away.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is Justin here?<eos> Haven't seen him for days.<eos> I thought he was with you.
It's chaos theory.<eos> But, see, chaos theory isn't exactly about chaos. It's about how a tiny change in a big system can affect everything.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Dude, it's time to wakey.<eos> I'm rolling in ten, if you feel like school.
Mrs. Antilly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> What, like in the world?<eos> Or with you.
So, speaking of tonight, I don't know if you know this, but there's a penumbral lunar eclipse at 11:49.<eos> A what?<eos> The Earth's shadow is the penumbra.<eos> Tonight, the moon is gonna pass through it.<eos> Last show is at nine, and if we clean fast, and we probably can, because no kids are coming to that English movie because it's boring, we could get out in time, and I could maybe point it out to you.
There would be a shadow. Not like a full eclipse.<eos> You wouldn't exactly see the...<eos> But, yeah.<eos> You should, like, patent yourself.<eos> And, yes, I will look at the moon with you.
Clay.<eos> Ah. You saw the list.<eos> She does have...<eos> Unique lips. Yeah.<eos> You should get her number.
Also, didn't totally suck at school that Justin Foley liked me back then.<eos> Okay, back then.<eos> Why are you friends now?<eos> Because if I stop hanging out, they're gonna know something's up.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
No. No.<eos> I meant it to piss Jessica off. Because she wouldn't have sex with me.<eos> Alex.<eos> Don't.<eos> That doesn't seem like you.
Maybe you need some chamomile tea.<eos> 'Cause people are listening?<eos> Well, it's too bad no one paid attention before.<eos> - What is that about?<eos> - I told you.
- Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.<eos> They just want to shut you down.<eos> And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.
Whatever we have to do, okay?<eos> You're freaking me out.<eos> Maybe you're too fucking stoned, huh?<eos> You made me paranoid, Tyler.<eos> So now... I'm giving that to you.
Maybe you're too fucking stoned, huh?<eos> You made me paranoid, Tyler.<eos> So now... I'm giving that to you.<eos> Maybe I'll never know why you did what you did.<eos> But I can make you understand how it felt to be me.
- Yeah, I was just going to do laundry.<eos> - You were? I don't think I've ever seen you do laundry.<eos> - I live to surprise you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Oh, honey, did you have an accident?
Look, I just...<eos> I turned the water on just now, and I thought about it all, the whole thing, taking clothes off, dealing with hair, and I just...<eos> Look, we shower, like... every day, and it's just... a lot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Clay, honey... I need to discuss something with you.
You talking about Clay?<eos> Keep your voice down, dude.<eos> Whatever you're doing, I want in.<eos> We're not doing anything, Tyler.<eos> It's not like we would trust you if we were.
No snapping of arms.<eos> For days after Tyler's picture went around, I tried to catch your eye.<eos> You ignored me for weeks.<eos> But I decided enough was enough.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
Well...<eos> I love this car.<eos> It has that new car smell.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did your parents buy you a new car for this dance?
Later.<eos> Okay, seriously, how does he get all the hot girls?<eos> I mean... his dick must be huge.<eos> Only one huge dick in the vicinity at the moment, Bryce.<eos> She's talking about you, big guy.
- Me and Hannah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're fun girls, right?<eos> That's what it looks like in the picture.<eos> Hate to disappoint you, Monty, but I'll tell you a secret.
No one's even told their parents.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Is that...?<eos> Yeah, that smell is me.<eos> You're really not doing so well.
Yeah, that smell is me.<eos> You're really not doing so well.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Hey... it's good to talk to you about this.
You're really not doing so well.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Hey... it's good to talk to you about this.<eos> Can I just... I want to show you something.
Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?
What do you think everyone would say?<eos> "She's got two gay dads, that's why she's..."<eos> And my dads, they've taken so much crap, my whole life, for being gay and then for being dads, and I just can't...<eos> I couldn't do that to them.<eos> What people think of you isn't more important than Hannah's life.
No one's going to think anything's happened.<eos> No one's going to think or say anything.<eos> Clay's out of control.<eos> I'll get him under control.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.
Nothing.<eos> One of Tony's mix tapes.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah, great.<eos> Clay, I need to talk to you.
Sure.<eos> You have nothing more to tell me... about bullying at school?<eos> No.<eos> Or, um... Hannah Baker?<eos> Look, I told you, Mom... I didn't really know her.
cheer camp.<eos> Sheri, I am so sorry, but those hearts look like butts.<eos> They do.<eos> The Dollar Valentine survey was a two-parter:<eos> Describe yourself, and describe what you're looking for in someone else.
See you in history.<eos> See you.<eos> Hey, Sheri.<eos> Listen, I could...<eos> Like, if you wanted to, I could help you finish the paper.
We only have 20 minutes before the first bell rings.<eos> We could also work on it after school.<eos> Maybe at Monet's?<eos> Oh, my God. I mean, that would be amazing.<eos> You sure you don't mind?
- Listen, dude.<eos> I needed a "C" average or above to play baseball.<eos> U.S. History was kicking my ass.<eos> And I got help, right?<eos> What about you, dude?
Why is Marcus Cole calling me?<eos> No way.<eos> It's Dollar Valentine.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, well, I shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure you were on his list.
I figured it was a sign.<eos> Yeah, but... wait a second.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> Maybe I'm not on your list.<eos> Hey, well, if you go out with me, I can show you.
Hey, well, if you go out with me, I can show you.<eos> - Says you.<eos> - Says me.<eos> And my dead president friend, Benjamin Franklin, who was actually not a president.<eos> It is ready to buy you milkshakes, hamburgers, French fries, anything you want from the world-renowned Rosie's Diner.
- Listen...<eos> - Nope, no "listen."<eos> What follows "listen" is nothing good.<eos> Let me put it this way. Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."
I didn't really do it.<eos> Couldn't afford it, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, uh...<eos> What about you? Did you?
You two are seeing Never Say Goodbye for Valentine's Day.<eos> No, we're seeing Thirty Ways to Die.<eos> You're a classy date.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I am.<eos> What's up with you, man?
Aren't you and Dad doing anything for Valentine's Day? Ooh!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> When you've been married as long as we have, the best you can hope for is... takeout and some red wine.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He buys you flowers all the time.
And I just had to sit there, wondering.<eos> Imagining.<eos> Playing over all the different scenarios in my mind.<eos> And all the while thinking that they all knew... everyone in the whole place... that I'd been stood up on Valentine's Day.<eos> I decided to give you one more chance.
Maybe not.<eos> Maybe I'm getting back to my life, and, you know, people who aren't completely fucked up.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> So you can stop following me.<eos> I'm not following you.
I thought you said the coffee here is overpriced.<eos> Yeah, he says that all the time.<eos> Clay, Brad. Brad... Clay.<eos> Uh, hey.<eos> Uh, I'm not following you.
What do you mean, nothing?<eos> He said you'd been following him.<eos> He's just a little out of his head lately.<eos> Too much caffeine.<eos> That's the kid who keeps texting you?
- Come on, Jess.<eos> - Relax.<eos> - Jess.<eos> - Relax, it's fine.<eos> Jess, what the fuck is going on with you? Come on.
- Relax, it's fine.<eos> Jess, what the fuck is going on with you? Come on.<eos> Come on. Stop!<eos> What the fuck, Justin?<eos> - I told you, my mom... - Your mom what?
You were thinking of Hannah.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.
Hannah and I, but...<eos> I did it.<eos> And it's horrible, and I can't...<eos> Look...<eos> I can't tell you what it is, and I don't want you to know, 'cause I don't want you to look at me that way, and it would kill me if you heard what were on those tapes.
What?<eos> What happened, sweetie?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.
Is everything okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> I can tell you're not fine.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Why are you taking that case, Mom?<eos> Why are you getting involved with all that?<eos> Is that why you're upset?
Because you're a good kid.<eos> Maybe there aren't any good kids.<eos> I have to get ready for bed.<eos> Clay, honey.<eos> If this case could hurt you in any way... then I won't take it.
Clay, honey.<eos> If this case could hurt you in any way... then I won't take it.<eos> But you have to tell me why.<eos> You have to tell me what's going on.<eos> I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
He do something to you?<eos> No, Dad.<eos> 'Cause, you know, if he did, I'd kill him, right?<eos> Dad.<eos> If anybody does anything to you, I'd just...
Even the most basic social interactions help keep us alive.<eos> Statistics prove the subjective feeling of loneliness can increase the likelihood of premature death by 26%.<eos> If it sounds like I'm quoting from a school textbook... I am.<eos> Too bad nobody bothered to read it.<eos> And let me tell you... there's all kinds of ways to feel lonely.
I heard the stirrings.<eos> Some, uh... thumps and mutterings and such.<eos> We need to get him back to Dr. Ellman.<eos> He won't take the meds, but the talk therapy was always helpful.<eos> Feel like it was more helpful for you to have him doing it.
Maybe she should try a diet.<eos> Seriously, Pratters? Jesus!<eos> I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then... you know, don't be fat.<eos> Mr. Pratters!<eos> Pratter's, that's like someone saying to you, "Don't be an idiot and a dickwad."
Right.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?
We all need it.<eos> Human contact.<eos> And communications class, crazy as it was, was human contact for me.<eos> Until someone in that class cut my lifeline... someone who is known for being sweet.<eos> I'll tell you who it is... but you're going to have to wait.
What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.
Have you ever noticed us?<eos> Take a handful, boys.<eos> Start passing these babies out.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> How many of these did Daddy make you?
Leave me alone!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This shit that happens to you... I think some of it you bring on yourself.
You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.<eos> Big deal.<eos> You should have let it go.<eos> But you didn't let it go.<eos> You didn't like that someone told you no.
What I'm saying... I had things to hang on to.<eos> I had chess club, I had Knowledge Bowl...<eos> See, now you're embarrassing yourself, Dad.<eos> Do you have something?<eos> Does anything bring you joy?
It's a basketball game.<eos> I'm here to show some school spirit.<eos> That's great.<eos> Great, Clay.<eos> I'm glad you're, you know... feeling better.
Still don't know who they're from?<eos> You got, like, six compliments today.<eos> I got a cartoon and a campaign flyer from Courtney.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do realize shilling for votes is not a compliment, Courtney.
The day after you insulted me in the cafeteria, my compliment bag was empty.<eos> Not even a cute bunny.<eos> By the end of the second week, I knew something was up.<eos> Maybe I should have let it go, but I didn't.<eos> I wrote you a letter.
Just tell me one thing:<eos> Tell me all this is not about a guy.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's about a girl.<eos> I texted you, Jessica. And you said you'd come.
- Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because.<eos> Well, do your folks know?<eos> About you and Hannah?
We left early.<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> Me and Bryce and some other guys.<eos> You couldn't have texted me?<eos> Bryce said he texted you.
Me and Bryce and some other guys.<eos> You couldn't have texted me?<eos> Bryce said he texted you.<eos> Yeah, he texted me to come over, not that you were there.<eos> I mean, I texted you like four times. You couldn't have hit me back?
Share 'em.<eos> Release 'em to the world.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Really?<eos> You... you don't give a shit?
No, I didn't know that.<eos> He showed it to me.<eos> Asked if I wanted to read it.<eos> And I couldn't... read it because... it's starting to make sense to me... why she did what she did.<eos> I can help you through this.
What you're so sure of, but you won't say how.<eos> Huh?<eos> Fine.<eos> Forget you, then.<eos> Let me help you.
Hey, Sheri.<eos> How was the rest of your weekend?<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> You were great at the game.<eos> Jessica. Hey, how are you?
I needed direction.<eos> Any direction.<eos> You have to be kidding me.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I have something I have to show you.
Alex.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.<eos> It's all this shit with the tapes, isn't it?<eos> If all that just went away, you'd be fine.
Oh, Jess, come on, look.<eos> I just...<eos> Maybe later.<eos> I just don't want to right now.<eos> I don't do it for you anymore.
He's not here. He isn't here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, calm down.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I left you a detailed message.
I've got skin to cover all my thoughts like Saran Wrap That you can see through to what leftovers are inside from the night before<eos> And despite what you might think My skin is soft And smooth<eos> And easily scarred<eos> But that doesn't matter, right?<eos> You don't care about how soft my skin is
Hannah. What's so secret you couldn't speak to me at school?<eos> You know damn well.<eos> How could you do that to me?<eos> The poem?<eos> I did you a favor, Hannah.
Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wish I had known, though.<eos> Why you cared so much about Hannah.
They're different things. Trust me.<eos> So that guy Brad... is he your boyfriend now?<eos> I hope he's still my boyfriend.<eos> He's been pretty annoyed lately because... I've been spending all my time with another guy.<eos> You.
My God! Okay, fine.<eos> Come here.<eos> Seriously, Clay?<eos> Get over it.<eos> It was you she was talking about, right?
Hannah said you were completely out of it.<eos> She said things happened.<eos> If something happened, I'd remember it.<eos> We were both pretty drunk, so we basically just passed out after.<eos> Justin told you that, or you remember?
What?<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> Ah, nothing.<eos> Nah, sorry.<eos> I saved you a particularly gnarly piece with some hair in it.
Okay, and you're just... doing your own thing.<eos> Oh, more than ever.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, look, I understand that you're going through your own process or whatever, but I'm worried about you, man.<eos> I don't want to see you get hurt.
I'll start with the school.<eos> You don't know what the f...<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> Okay? You haven't even listened to your own tape.<eos> I'm telling you, the worst is yet to come.
Fuck you.<eos> You're calling me a pussy, after what you did, or didn't do?<eos> - Fuck you. - Fuck you.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Whatever happens to us happens to you too.
I'll take beer.<eos> Excellent choice, madam.<eos> Tonight, it is being served lukewarm in questionably clean cups and devoid of any flavor. - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> When I was saving your seat for you, I had to fight off not one but three drunk teenagers playing Suck and Blow.
Oh, my God.<eos> Uh, you look really nice tonight, by the way.<eos> Oh. This?<eos> I just threw something on.<eos> Well, you do, you look really good.
You want to ask me a legal question now?<eos> Really?<eos> I just...<eos> If someone hurt someone... but the victim won't come forward...<eos> Clay, who's hurting you?
Wait, wait, Mom, hey.<eos> Hey, Mom, what are you doing?<eos> I need to find out what happened.<eos> If I can't get you to talk, then I am going to find someone who can.<eos> I'm trying to help you, but you are pissing me off.
And then an unlikely hero came my way.<eos> Hey, you need a ride home?<eos> Is it that obvious?<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> I mean, you always look good, but you don't look so good.
Now I wonder if we would have both been better off staying at the party.<eos> Sheri, this one's for you.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> You don't want me to grab you a water or something?
I kind of liked the music.<eos> Did you like the music?<eos> Sheri.<eos> What?<eos> I have to tell you...
I'm trying to make it better.<eos> And I'm trying to make up for it.<eos> Will you just meet me after school?<eos> Why?<eos> So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.
And I'm trying to make up for it.<eos> Will you just meet me after school?<eos> Why?<eos> So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.<eos> Give me a chance to prove to you that I'm not like everyone else on the tapes.
So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.<eos> Give me a chance to prove to you that I'm not like everyone else on the tapes.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll come.<eos> I'll text you the address.
Can we...<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About what?<eos> About what happened.<eos> I need to tell you...
Let's see who can break it first.<eos> Like, break the light bulb?<eos> What are you, six?<eos> It's just a stupid light bulb.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Why aren't you?<eos> Cut it the fuck out.<eos> - Throw it back.<eos> - Jess, stop.<eos> Jess, what is happening with you?
Didn't you just get back from suspension?<eos> Fuck you, Alex.<eos> No thanks, Monty, you're not man enough.<eos> Okay.<eos> I suppose you expect me to thank you.
Fine.<eos> Yeah, so just like...<eos> Only actors in Hollywood hold it that way.<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> Here, let me show you.
There's so much hurt.<eos> I couldn't take knowing I'd made it worse.<eos> And I couldn't take knowing it would never get any better.<eos> I thought you'd be here.<eos> I think I will join you.
But it was the same night.<eos> That same awful night.<eos> Remember that story I was saving for later?<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> And it's all about you... Clay.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am, this rebel is going to tear out into the night on his sweet ride.<eos> - But part of me was saying, "Don't go."<eos> Not even for Clay.<eos> I should have listened to that part of me.<eos> See, I never told you, Clay, but I've always admired you.
Call me if you need a ride!<eos> Don't do any hard drugs!<eos> Or any drugs.<eos> Okay.<eos> I bet you also wish you'd never gone to Jessica's.
You'd never kick my ass.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> - How am I tempting you?<eos> - Go talk to her, man.<eos> You're the reason she came.
I think you do.<eos> Go on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Going in.<eos> I'd talked to you a million times before, but... tonight was different, and... I didn't know what to say to you.
Yeah, me too.<eos> I actually didn't ride my bike here, so we can't do that.<eos> So, but I'll go get the drinks.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.<eos> Cool. I was so nervous that night, but you made it seem so...
Good. Good.<eos> Listen, you and your dad are on your own for dinner.<eos> Something came up here.<eos> Something... with Hannah's case?<eos> I'll tell you later if I can.
- Do you?<eos> Jesus, you're like two little boys.<eos> Put your dicks away. I want him out.<eos> Either he goes or I go.<eos> I'll get you a beer.
Kind of.<eos> But it's strictly coincidental.<eos> If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in... Girls.
- Why?<eos> - My parents need me to work at the store.<eos> Which kind of sucks, because I really like working at the Crestmont.<eos> I do too.<eos> What I mean is, I like working with you.
Hey, Dad, it's um... Justin.<eos> Is it okay if he spends the night?<eos> We have some homework we have to do.<eos> - Sure.<eos> How you doing, Justin?
I like the name Hannah.<eos> At that moment... everything was perfect.<eos> And for the first time in a long time... I could imagine a future where I was happy.<eos> How good life could be.<eos> And I know you felt it too.
They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.<eos> Did Justin finger you?<eos> I bet you went down on him.<eos> - And they all became you.
- Sometimes it's better to wait. Thought you were easy.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> No, just stop, okay?<eos> Did I hurt you?
- You all right?<eos> - I don't want you here. Get out.<eos> Hannah...<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> But you walked out the door... like I told you to.
You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.<eos> I would have ruined you.<eos> It wasn't you.
That all of this is my fault.<eos> How did I know that?<eos> I-I just left Hannah. I left her there.<eos> She needed me, and I walked away.<eos> You were doing what she told you to do.
I didn't believe it.<eos> I was angry for a minute because... because I was jealous of Justin.<eos> And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.<eos> And I was an asshole, and I'm sorry.<eos> And I can never make it right, I can never say all this to you, but... I love you.

Prepare you for what kind of questions they'll be asking.<eos> Which will mostly have to do with your relationship with Hannah Baker.<eos> And the more we know before the depo, the easier it will be.<eos> Mom.<eos> I promise I'll tell you everything... but not yet.
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.<eos> It's... probably for me, don't you think?<eos> Morning. Are you the parent or guardian of Clay Jensen?<eos> I just don't get why they're calling you to testify.<eos> Did Hannah ever say anything to you about bullying or anything?
Are you seriously trying to make excuses for what you did?<eos> No.<eos> I just want you to understand...<eos> And I want you to understand what it's like to be raped.<eos> But I truly hope you never will.
Well, uh... see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you.<eos> Oh, wait. Uh...<eos> I'm supposed to tell you to turn in your uniform.
I didn't mean tell the truth about everything.<eos> Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.
Hi.<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> - Great.<eos> - Uh, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine, I just wanted to talk to you about... something.
I...<eos> I found something in Hannah's closet, hidden away.<eos> - I thought maybe... you could help me understand what it means.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you know or recognize any of these names?
I'm so sorry, okay?<eos> I just convinced the landlord to work with us to pay the back rent.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I thought you were more responsible than this.<eos> - We trusted you!
It's kind of an emergency.<eos> You want to buy some weed.<eos> From me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If you wouldn't mind.
- You heard about that?<eos> - Yeah, everybody did.<eos> Any time one of the squeaky clean kids gets dirty, it's pretty big news.<eos> That's... interesting.<eos> I'm gonna hook you up this time 'cause you seem desperate, and I happen to have shit on hand. And, you know, 420 brotherhood.
- She was my friend.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - What does it matter? Say it.<eos> - Calm the fuck down.<eos> I need what I need, for you to admit what you did.
Respect.<eos> Jesus, Jensen.<eos> Respect.<eos> So she wanted it.<eos> She got in the hot tub with you.
She did.<eos> But she didn't tell you so.<eos> She didn't have to.<eos> Girls play games.<eos> She didn't say she wanted you to fuck her.
Girls play games.<eos> She didn't say she wanted you to fuck her.<eos> She never said no.<eos> And that's not rape?<eos> Why do you care so much?
Please, the woman next door will call the cops.<eos> We're done.<eos> Mom.<eos> IthoughtmaybeIcouldforget about what had happened.<eos> But thanks to you, Bryce... I'd finally lived up to my reputation.
Clay.<eos> Mom, soon.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, what the fuck happened to your face?<eos> I'll show you.
She can talk about this photo now, or do it in court.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> You were the only one who tried to tell me the truth.<eos> Are you...<eos> I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing," because, like, how the fuck do you think, right?
Thank you for meeting me.<eos> You were the only one who tried to tell me the truth.<eos> Are you...<eos> I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing," because, like, how the fuck do you think, right?<eos> But... how are you?
Justin... is Justin Foley.<eos> Are you and Justin still friendly?<eos> Justin Foley is dead to me.<eos> Jesus Christ, are you following me?<eos> I have to talk to you.
Shit's so fucked up.<eos> You think?<eos> - Just talk to me.<eos> - Why, Justin?<eos> Why should I talk to you?
Fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You don't look fine.<eos> Daddy?<eos> I need to tell you...
You gotta hand over your guns.<eos> We only have two.<eos> Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.
We've been told you have a deal with them, that you know them.<eos> Then you know they rule through violence and fear.<eos> Your Majesty, I only told them of the...<eos> Our deal with the Saviors is not known among my people... for good cause.<eos> We made you a party to that secret when you told us of the Hilltop's own travails, but we did not expect you to share...
I'm training.<eos> I'm pushing myself, trying to step up.<eos> Put the safety back on.<eos> Practicing shooting.<eos> Let me give you some advice.
You're not me.<eos> Go home, Benjamin.<eos> - Well, I... Wha...<eos> - What?<eos> Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.
Go home, Benjamin.<eos> - Well, I... Wha...<eos> - What?<eos> Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.<eos> He doesn't want to bug you, but he needs to know that you're okay.
- Well, I... Wha...<eos> - What?<eos> Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.<eos> He doesn't want to bug you, but he needs to know that you're okay.<eos> He told you that?
And if they do, somehow... they will have saved us, and we won't have done a thing.<eos> My dad always said that if you're asked to be the hero, be a hero.<eos> You wanted me to be ready for anything, and I am.<eos> We are.<eos> I thank you for your sage counsel.
So that's it?<eos> You're finally leaving me?<eos> You caught me.<eos> I'm just... sick of being so damn happy at home, you know?<eos> Didn't know how to tell you.
Hey... do you want to head to the infirmary?<eos> No. I'm okay.<eos> Hey. Where'd you go in them trucks?<eos> I need to speak to Daryl alone. That okay?<eos> Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.
Yeah.<eos> You went to see them, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> They did that to you.
She's tough.<eos> Maybe she'll live.<eos> Say her damn name!<eos> Carol.<eos> I hoped you didn't know her, but I didn't think you'd care, 'cause you know what needs to happen. - No.
I'd tell you if I did.<eos> Vonda N. Mclntyre.<eos> Th-this will be satisfactory.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I'll get you something.
Well, Eugene I know you remember Lucille.<eos> Now, you see this right here?<eos> You might have to get real close.<eos> That, my friend, is the bullet you made.<eos> Now, under normal circumstances, I'd be showing you that real close over and over again.
Not only is that practical, it is just bad-ass!<eos> Whoa. Look at you, Dr. Smarty-pants.<eos> Did Rick have you doing this kind of valuable stuff for him?<eos> His loss, our gain.<eos> I feel like I need to give you some kind of signing bonus here.
His loss, our gain.<eos> I feel like I need to give you some kind of signing bonus here.<eos> Uh, w-well, I wa... I was gifted these pickles.<eos> No.<eos> As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.
And I wanted to let you forget.<eos> I don't think I'm gonna make it out here, but you're wrong.<eos> Being there isn't better than being dead.<eos> It's worse.<eos> I hope you realize that, and I hope you get away.
- It's not true. Dwight?<eos> He's lying about it.<eos> I would never do that.<eos> Why? Why? Why would he do that?<eos> Why would he intentionally try to hurt you?
Please!<eos> No.<eos> No, no, please!<eos> Now you know I hate this shit.<eos> Just tell me you did it and that you're sorry, and I don't have to do this. Yes.
I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you had to say.<eos> That is all you had to say.<eos> A good thing we got a spare Dr. Carson.<eos> I trust you, Dwighty boy.
You're a coward.<eos> You're... a coward.<eos> That is a correct assessment.<eos> May I come in?<eos> So, how you liking it here?
This week?<eos> This year?<eos> No. You don't.<eos> I can't just wait.<eos> I don't know about you, but I can't.
I'm gonna go find them.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What was it?<eos> It was a deer.<eos> I owe you a deer.
We should get back.<eos> If we're getting the guns, it doesn't matter if it takes a little longer.<eos> Wait.<eos> I've been, um...<eos> I've been waiting to show you this one.
I can push. So can I.<eos> You just worry about steering us in that gap.<eos> Shit.<eos> The brakes don't work.<eos> Michonne, you good?
Shit.<eos> The brakes don't work.<eos> Michonne, you good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?
- Nah. We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Eight more!<eos> How about you?
10!<eos> Rick!<eos> Rick!<eos> Michonne!<eos> I tried, but I still owe you one.
- 10.<eos> - 9.<eos> And the cat back.<eos> 20. I keep the cat.<eos> We get you the guns.
In a few more days.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was just... I was just coming over to see you.
She probably just went out looking for more.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why were you...<eos> Why were you coming by?<eos> I have something to tell you.
He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.<eos> I will go with you to Alexandria, if you want to make the trip... if you want to talk to him.
Is it what you wanted?<eos> Was it just too late to get away?<eos> Hey, we can leave for Alexandria right now.<eos> Right now, if you want to.<eos> Is there anything I can help you with?
Right now, if you want to.<eos> Is there anything I can help you with?<eos> No.<eos> Well, can I just --<eos> If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you?
Then you can have the guns.<eos> And all of us can go on with our day's journeys.<eos> Ezekiel...<eos> I need you to understand the gravity of what's happening here.<eos> I gave you a choice.
All right. Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> "T-To injure an opponent... is to injure yourself.<eos> I'm sorry for coming to you.
Not now. Benjamin not -- would not -- Man, I said now not!<eos> I said...<eos> Y'all just go.<eos> Do you really want to know what happened in Alexandria?<eos> What happened to you?
Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Carol.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thank you.
But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.<eos> You owe her that much.<eos> Listen...<eos> Enid...<eos> Maggie trusts you.
Okay.<eos> Sasha...<eos> Yeah.<eos> In 10 minutes, I'm gonna tell Maggie what's going on.<eos> It's up to you what you want to do with that.
I won't miss. Even if you shoot and graze him, he doesn't die.<eos> I won't miss.<eos> If we go in and get caught...<eos> I won't get caught.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Girl, pick that shit up right now and scram.<eos> And I'll take that.<eos> Now.<eos> Don't make me cut it off you, girl.
Will you teach me those knots?<eos> I know a bunch, but not those.<eos> Won't matter soon.<eos> It might.<eos> Yeah, I'll show you.
But as a human mind in a cybernetic frame, Mira can do all those things, and more.<eos> The first of her kind.<eos> She will join Section 9 as soon as she is operational.<eos> Please, don't do that.<eos> You're reducing a complex human to a machine.
I don't think of her as a machine.<eos> She's a weapon.<eos> And the future of my company.<eos> The first artificially created memory enhancement.<eos> Sirenum's training protocol is the fastest and most efficient way to develop the abilities you've always wanted.
I'm flawed.<eos> But I embrace change and enhancement.<eos> Now there's nothing I can't do.<eos> Nothing I can't know. Nothing I can't be.<eos> I want you to listen to something.
Nothing I can't know. Nothing I can't be.<eos> I want you to listen to something.<eos> That's my four-year-old daughter.<eos> In the time it took her to sing that lullaby, she learned to speak fluent French.<eos> Did you know that song...
There's an echo box up here.<eos> Someone's scanning data traffic.<eos> Let's see who's worth this kind of surveillance.<eos> Accessing hotel security network.<eos> What are you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.<eos> Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone contact the President's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?
73% of this world has woken up to the age of cyber-enhancement.<eos> You really want to be left behind?<eos> My people embrace cyber-enhancement, as do I.<eos> But there's no one who really understands the risk to individuality, identity, messing with the human soul.<eos> Gentlemen. Excuse me. I think you have the wrong...
You Okay?<eos> You're injured.<eos> You're not the same.<eos> It's just a robot!<eos> Your skin deserves the best, and so do you.
And with time you'll feel more and more connected to it, and to them.<eos> Open and close, please.<eos> We cling to memories as if they define us, but they really don't.<eos> What we do is what defines us.<eos> You are entering a Hanka secure area.
Authorized personnel only.<eos> Please disable communication enhancements.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Dr. Dahlin!<eos> Are you finished yet?
Please disable communication enhancements.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Dr. Dahlin!<eos> Are you finished yet?<eos> If you hadn't riddled the geisha with bullets, this would be much easier.
Anytime.<eos> Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?<eos> Is Section 9 missing some critical operational resource?<eos> Major is our most sophisticated weapon only if she's intact.<eos> And Dr. Ouelet informed me that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> We need him alive.<eos> Please, I've been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.
Please, I've been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.<eos> So tell us who we do have.<eos> My name is Lee Cunningham.<eos> - Where'd you get the weapons?
- Yeah.<eos> Isn't she a little angel?<eos> - This is your daughter?<eos> - Right.<eos> Do you have kids?
Isn't she a little angel?<eos> - This is your daughter?<eos> - Right.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> Where do you live?
Where do you live?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I think it's a tall place. Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.
I can't remember.<eos> I think it's a tall place. Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife. You live alone.
- It's just you.<eos> - What? No.<eos> We've been to your apartment.<eos> There's nobody there.<eos> - No. - You've lived there - for 10 years by yourself.
- No. - You've lived there - for 10 years by yourself.<eos> - No!<eos> So you're just lying. I'm not lying!<eos> I didn't kill anyone!<eos> - Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Why do you keep doing this to me?<eos> - Holo cube disconnect.<eos> Please!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> Why do you keep saying this to me?
I just don't like it.<eos> I need you to take me back.<eos> There's more I need to find out.<eos> Sure.<eos> Dr. Ouelet, what have you told her?
Hanka Security to headquarters.<eos> We have the Major.<eos> Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.
We have the Major.<eos> Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should've called the first time she came to see you.
Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should've called the first time she came to see you.<eos> Instead, you gave her information.
She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should've called the first time she came to see you.<eos> Instead, you gave her information.<eos> What makes you think you have the right to tell me
2571 is not a failure.<eos> I'll delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> She won't remember him at all! No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist, and then I order you to terminate.
She won't remember him at all! No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist, and then I order you to terminate.<eos> What?<eos> You'll build one that's better.
You download all the data on the terrorist, and then I order you to terminate.<eos> What?<eos> You'll build one that's better.<eos> - I'll delete everything.<eos> - You've deleted before.
But her ghost survived!<eos> Her ghost is what failed us.<eos> We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.
Please relocate to your designated safe room.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> That's the problem with the human heart.<eos> She killed Dr. Ouelet!<eos> You're to have no further contact with her.
You're to have no further contact with her.<eos> Hanka Security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are their orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?
Hanka Security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are their orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> You built her!
This goes public, your unit goes down.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Pumpkin!<eos> You surprised me.
She likes you.<eos> I was looking for...<eos> Come in.<eos> Yeah, come, come.<eos> Can I offer you some tea?
On the street, in my dreams.<eos> As if she's still here.<eos> She was fearless!<eos> And Wild.<eos> You remind me of her.
And Wild.<eos> You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?<eos> The way you look at me.
You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?<eos> The way you look at me.<eos> Who are you?
The way you look at me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Will you come again to visit me?
At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.<eos> Do you want some of this?<eos> Or are you just gonna...<eos> Access granted.<eos> Okay, you may sit.
So, how do we get it back?<eos> These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.<eos> We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?
Let's go.<eos> World getting smaller?<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Running from your problems never works out.<eos> You need a new plan.
You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?<eos> You mean the clown show?
Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?<eos> You mean the clown show?<eos> You had a guy over there wearing $1,000 Beats when you can buy the knockoff for half the price.
You mean the clown show?<eos> You had a guy over there wearing $1,000 Beats when you can buy the knockoff for half the price.<eos> Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.<eos> Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?<eos> You know what the kicker was?
Trust me, he's not laughing.<eos> Nor will he ever again, for that matter.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.<eos> I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.<eos> They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.
The last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.<eos> And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.<eos> Patriotism is dead.<eos> There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?
There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?<eos> I'm Triple-X.<eos> Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Where are you going?
Gibbons was handed a blank check.<eos> Which is the long way of saying he got you a new ride.<eos> World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.
Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.<eos> Is she always this much fun, or just on special occasions?<eos> No wonder our country's in debt trillions of dollars.<eos> Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?
What about you?<eos> No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touché.<eos> You are Xander Cage.<eos> Anything you need, Becky can source it within the hour.
Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system.<eos> Am I right?<eos> No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?
No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?<eos> Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?
Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?
Of course not.<eos> We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.<eos> We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him, Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.
And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world,<eos> who would you target?<eos> Shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.
Just in time.<eos> Watch out, Cage.<eos> Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.<eos> Hey, suit.<eos> You got what you wanted.
Is this what happens when shit gets real?<eos> What do we do?<eos> Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.
Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.
Think I could've been FBI?<eos> Couldn't do any worse than these assholes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Did you see anything at the Burton place last night?
- Jesus.<eos> Enough already, will ya?<eos> - I just. I saw it.<eos> You represent the Bureau.<eos> Judge Dawkins? Can you open up, please?
Do they teach you that at Quantico?<eos> - Rippin' on you. - Yeah, you think so?<eos> Judge Dawkins!<eos> Zeke Sikes!<eos> Can you open up, please?
Judge?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you guys?<eos> Ed is the guy we're looking for.<eos> Andy is just a patsy.<eos> We understand that you got strong feelings on the matter.
I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!<eos> Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?<eos> My partner's the smartest guy in the room, and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.
Yeah, that could.<eos> Wait, say that again?<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> The Camaro is black and the suspects are white.<eos> No, you should. You should definitely cut them loose.
No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> The Camaro is black and the suspects are white.<eos> No, you should. You should definitely cut them loose.<eos> Yeah, I agree. That is. It's quite the coincidence, right?<eos> But, no, you should let them go.
Oh, Chris.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Your partner doesn't seem too comfortable around bodies.<eos> Yeah, well, he knew the guy.<eos> You seem all right.
That's the one.<eos> Well, that connects them.<eos> What about, uh.?<eos> - My brother?<eos> - Yeah. You said he knew these other two well.
The file said he got rung up on meth charges.<eos> When the lab exploded, Ed's son died in the blast.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Anyway, uh, when the election came around, my brother got less than ten percent of the vote.<eos> - You think he took the money?
- He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?
- And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?<eos> Have you seen my face?
Listen, we got a dead body in a county that doesn't get dead bodies and a cop with a bullet hole in his arm.<eos> This is a big deal.<eos> So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Long enough for you to come out a different person.
This is a big deal.<eos> So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Long enough for you to come out a different person.<eos> Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.
So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Long enough for you to come out a different person.<eos> Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.<eos> Maybe you come out an old lady.
- Oh, sorry, honey.<eos> It's not you. It's the drugs.<eos> Sometimes, these things just flush me right out.<eos> - Andy!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
- Andy!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - I want the money.<eos> - Why would I have the money?<eos> - Don't you play fucking dumb with me!
- I want the money.<eos> - Why would I have the money?<eos> - Don't you play fucking dumb with me!<eos> - I don't have it!<eos> - Really? - You haven't seen Ed recently?
- Don't you play fucking dumb with me!<eos> - I don't have it!<eos> - Really? - You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.
- I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Under the fuckin' bed?<eos> You didn't think I was gonna search under the goddamn bed?
You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Under the fuckin' bed?<eos> You didn't think I was gonna search under the goddamn bed?<eos> Andy, think about what you're doing.
Andy, think about what you're doing.<eos> - Ed will kill you.<eos> - Fuck Ed! He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?
- Fuck Ed! He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!<eos> You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?
You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?
Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.
None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.
- No, it's not Ed.<eos> Please don't open that door, I'm begging you.<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> - Andy, I'm on my knees. Please, let's just talk about it.<eos> Once you open that door, there's no going back.
Stop!<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> Please, I won't say anything, I swear!<eos> - That's what everybody says.<eos> - Jesus, you've done this before?
It's a local crime committed by locals against locals.<eos> Shit, as I'm sure you're aware, one of the guys involved is my own goddamn brother.<eos> In high school, we all played on the same football team. We all know each other, so.<eos> I assure you, if anybody's capable of catching these guys, catching them before there's any further bloodshed, it's gonna be my partner and I.<eos> That being said, when it comes time to make arrests, you guys feel free to take every ounce of credit.

So, if you don't mind taking a bit of a back seat, we'll be happy to paint you as the heroes.<eos> How's that sound? - May I?<eos> - Oh, by all means. Okay.<eos> Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.<eos> And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?
Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.<eos> And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?<eos> We understand that what happened here last night is a very serious matter around these parts, but, as far as the Bureau's concerned, it's not exactly 9/11 part two.<eos> If it wasn't for the fact that the bank is federally insured, then we would not be down here messing around in your affairs.<eos> So, if you were expecting a couple of, uh. Grizzled FBI guys charging in here and giving you the high hat, well, you're gonna be happily mistaken.
Chris?<eos> Chris, Zeke Sikes!<eos> If you're in there.<eos> I'm coming in!<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get up!
I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You know who I am, son.<eos> I'm Judge Dawkins.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
I didn't.<eos> I didn't.<eos> What have I. What have I done?<eos> You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!
I didn't.<eos> What have I. What have I done?<eos> You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!<eos> Why did you provoke him?
You killed him.<eos> You provoked him!<eos> Why did you provoke him?<eos> Just making sure.<eos> - You manipulative little sh.
Why did you provoke him?<eos> Just making sure.<eos> - You manipulative little sh.<eos> - Focus, Judge.<eos> You just emptied a machine gun.
- Ed. Where the fuck is Ed?<eos> - Ed's keeping a low profile.<eos> There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.
- Hello?<eos> - It's me.<eos> Judge Dawkins.<eos> Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.
Judge Dawkins.<eos> Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.
Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.
We got this. Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.<eos> All right, where were we, boys?<eos> - Evening, fellas.<eos> - Oh, Sheriff Sikes, my man!<eos> Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble to help us out once again.
Thank you.<eos> So, uh, unless there's anything else, I'm just gonna be heading home.<eos> I gotta get home before Allison pitches a fit.<eos> I gotta be there right when dinner is served.<eos> Judge, uh. You wanna.
I mean, no matter what the circumstances.<eos> That's awfully kind of you to say, Judge.<eos> Though, hopefully, tonight will just be your typical quiet night at the bank.<eos> Of course. Okay.<eos> Well, I hope you brought a crossword puzzle.
I took some shots at 'em, but I just got too woozy.<eos> I had to come back in and lie down. Hi, I need an ambulance and, uh, cops. I need.<eos> It's just something to numb the pain before we take you to the hospital.<eos> - No, no, I can't. I'm allergic.<eos> - You have to have something.
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I don't think we've ever been at a reception table with a nanny before.<eos> Have we, Jerry?<eos> Only very good or very bad nannies are remembered so many years later.<eos> Which one are you?
It was on the RSVP. You put it there yourself.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> And how are you so sure you're not with the singles?<eos> If there are couples at your table, they could be what's called "swingers."<eos> How well do you know the bride and groom, Mr. Kepp?
My name is Walter.<eos> I can tell by your accent you must be a relation to the bride's father.<eos> Close relation?<eos> Yes.<eos> So what do you do, Walter?
- Why can't a person ask that?<eos> Yeah, I'd like to know.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Okay. She'd like to know.<eos> So, Walter, what is it that you do?
Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.<eos> What's your favorite book, Walter?<eos> Probably that one.<eos> Walter, where do you live?
Your nails are orange and your hair is orange.<eos> And your dress is orange.<eos> I say it's too much orange.<eos> Too much orange?<eos> That's what I was saying, so you have to lose one of them.
Too much orange?<eos> That's what I was saying, so you have to lose one of them.<eos> I meant the dress.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Where are you from?
I'm calling it "The Band."<eos> Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear. It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right? You're the nanny.
It's not gonna be what you want to hear. It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right? You're the nanny.<eos> Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> And you know Henry Grotsky from the diner scene, you're those people...
Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!<eos> She is the best friend of the bride.<eos> Well, oldest.<eos> How close to the toilet do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?
I'm a fan of detective fiction, Eloise.<eos> Big, big fan.<eos> So when I find that something doesn't add up, I investigate.<eos> Can't help being a detective, it's just who I am.<eos> And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?
Can't help being a detective, it's just who I am.<eos> And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?<eos> He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio.<eos> That rank.<eos> Fill us in anyway, would you, on how exactly the bride's best friend ended up back here with the Klumps.
It's no mystery, it's not a big deal.<eos> I got dumped by Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, the best man.<eos> That tall drink of shit over there at table one you can barely see.<eos> God, look at him.<eos> That guy is exactly who you think he'd be.
I feel nothing, actually.<eos> I feel liberated.<eos> I feel free.<eos> God.<eos> You have no idea what that feels like.
Someday.<eos> I mean, I am free.<eos> I do, I mean, I'm a free man, I do know how it feels.<eos> Right. Great.<eos> Well, then, you know. It feels great.
What a shame.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> So much.<eos> How long have you worked here?
Since when does a man need a reason to go to a wedding with his own wife?<eos> See? He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.
Because it started with you asking for a dance and then the answer to that was no.<eos> First, can I ask if she'd like to hear about my extracurriculars?<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Rezno, and say that she has evaluated the whole package, including the after-school specials and she's not really ready to dance with that, okay?<eos> So you could just stand awkwardly in front of another table.<eos> Oh, okay. Thank you for the clarity of that.
Where's Mr. Manny?<eos> Mr. Manny?<eos> A lady at Table 4 says she tries to eat her own weight in purple cabbage every week.<eos> How do I figure out if the kitchen has that much purple cabbage?<eos> I don't know why you're telling me...
So, yeah, in honor of that I've got a few things I'd like to say about love.<eos> This friend of mine, Clarence, once stood up during lunch period and said he had something to say about love.<eos> Then he took a dump on the table.<eos> When Francie first met Doug, she just always knew that he'd never let her down.<eos> But I thought people almost always let you down, so where did that come from?
You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.<eos> Teddy Millner was always rotten.<eos> You don't know me.
Not you.<eos> And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.<eos> That was the worst invitation to anything I've ever received, ever.<eos> Is your room this way? Or are you just following us?
Honestly, it still sounds better than junior prom, honey.<eos> Junior prom is a horror show.<eos> Well, if the thinking was for me to see people at their most happy, I would have to say that seems to be a huge miscalculation.<eos> Did you just break another chair?<eos> What kind of nanny are you?
Three...<eos> Actually, over three years ago.<eos> But no one's counting.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.
It might be best.<eos> If Uncle Roger finds out, he might tell my parole officer and then they'd send me back to jail or extend my time at the halfway house.<eos> I share a room with a man called Jalapeno who has a smiley face tattooed on the end of his penis so that when he pees it looks like it's vomiting sunshine.<eos> He's not as sweet as he sounds.<eos> Well, then you shouldn't do it.
Hello.<eos> My name is Walter and I'm a successful pothead.<eos> I'm smoking the reefer.<eos> Who smokes pot?<eos> Are you a potter?
Who smokes pot?<eos> Are you a potter?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You're a pothead.
Remember that suit I was wearing earlier?<eos> The chaplain from the halfway house got me that from Goodwill.<eos> And then now I'm wearing the suit of a beautiful lady.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Thank you. You wear it well.
What if you came here for a different reason today?<eos> What if you went away with someone better?<eos> What if I know how to find your wedding crasher?<eos> Go with your gut. Go with your gut. Go with your gut.<eos> Megan-Ann, Mr. Pfaffler, you probably don't remember me.
Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.<eos> You're the Kepps, right?
Enter la rocciosa...<eos> And the boy who wouldn't speak.<eos> My first language.<eos> I have these from previous employers.<eos> Did you live with each family?
My first language.<eos> I have these from previous employers.<eos> Did you live with each family?<eos> Yes. I find it helps in understanding the child to know the family.<eos> And do you remain in contact with these people?
Did you live with each family?<eos> Yes. I find it helps in understanding the child to know the family.<eos> And do you remain in contact with these people?<eos> When a child recovers, the family will generally choose to forget.<eos> You've no degree. But they say you've a gift.
Seven months...<eos> And sixteen days.<eos> Alessio will see you to your room.<eos> I would like to introduce myself to your son.<eos> You haven't told me his name.
And sixteen days.<eos> Alessio will see you to your room.<eos> I would like to introduce myself to your son.<eos> You haven't told me his name.<eos> I must say there have been other nurses, all of them as sure of their talents as you.
That's my son, signorina, not me.<eos> Jakob doesn't want you here.<eos> He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.<eos> There is such power in his silence.<eos> You will feel it.
Jakob doesn't want you here.<eos> He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.<eos> There is such power in his silence.<eos> You will feel it.<eos> You speak very harshly to him.
I didn't... verena.<eos> The nurse, of course.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Let Lilia see you.<eos> You've come to make the boy talk.
Oh, welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome to la rocciosa, my child.<eos> Grazie.<eos> You're very kind.
But I should go.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Make him talk.<eos> I'm sorry. I-i was looking for Jakob.<eos> Do you play?
No, I, uh, never could.<eos> This is your wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> What was her name?<eos> You spent time with Jakob this morning.
Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?<eos> I need to understand what he has been through.<eos> Malvina.<eos> Malvina rivi. You may have heard of her.
I've been looking for you, Jakob.<eos> I'm here to work, not to play hide-and-seek.<eos> No.<eos> I haven't finished yet, Jakob.<eos> You have a very beautiful home.
No.<eos> I haven't finished yet, Jakob.<eos> You have a very beautiful home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do hope you'll be comfortable here.
It seems to give him comfort.<eos> I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?
No.<eos> No, signore, I do not.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> Sometimes I wish I did.<eos> Have you considered taking him away from this place?
Sometimes I wish I did.<eos> Have you considered taking him away from this place?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It was impossible.<eos> It was as you saw last night. He became a danger to himself and to others.
And he's breaking his father's heart.<eos> The boy... Is all that matters.<eos> He is the future.<eos> Look at yourself...<eos> How beautiful you are.
Look at yourself...<eos> How beautiful you are.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> They're strong, like hers.<eos> He will not speak to please you.
The boy will speak when the time is right.<eos> He's waiting.<eos> But he's waited long enough.<eos> Surely that is clear to anyone.<eos> When he speaks... Where will you go?
He's waiting.<eos> I wondered if Jakob was still here.<eos> No.<eos> May I see?<eos> If you wish.
Restless, complaining.<eos> She was the worst and also the best.<eos> And this one?<eos> I have not worked in many months.<eos> You cannot finish it, so you abandoned it.
He heard...<eos> When she died, I washed her...<eos> A-and tidied her hair.<eos> The room upsets you.<eos> Oh, you've torn your dress.
Put it on.<eos> Put that one away.<eos> Signore.<eos> Please. I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.
I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you...<eos> I-I think you know what it is I ask.<eos> If I have offended you, I apologize and ask that we forget the matter entirely.<eos> Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.
I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.<eos> I promise.<eos> You're hurting him now.
Let me care for him.<eos> Let me care for them both.<eos> Is it her?<eos> Or is it me?<eos> You wanted to see me?
To take care of Jakob and...<eos> And to take care of you.<eos> The voice is real.<eos> You're mad.<eos> Yes. You said it yourself... Serious condition.
The voice is real.<eos> You're mad.<eos> Yes. You said it yourself... Serious condition.<eos> I should have paid closer attention.<eos> Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell. Now you hear whatever you wish. - No.
Speak.<eos> Speak.<eos> Speak! Speak!<eos> Speak!<eos> What are you doing?
- I must leave.<eos> - No.<eos> Sir, she's given me her illness.<eos> You have a fever. That is all.<eos> You don't have to leave.
- No.<eos> Sir, she's given me her illness.<eos> You have a fever. That is all.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> I want you to stay. Forgive me.
Please.<eos> I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia... where is she?<eos> Lilia.<eos> What do you mean?
Terran Squadron commander, stand down.<eos> That ship is protected.<eos> Unidentified vessel, do not interfere, we are under orders.<eos> I've just given you new orders.<eos> And who are you to issue orders to Squadron X?
I've just given you new orders.<eos> And who are you to issue orders to Squadron X?<eos> Captain Saber Raine, Terran special operations.<eos> Captain Raine?<eos> I must inform you, you are interfering with extermination orders from the rear admiral.
Captain Raine?<eos> I must inform you, you are interfering with extermination orders from the rear admiral.<eos> And I'm telling you, Commander, that order is wrong.<eos> I will bring that ship and its captain in.<eos> You will stand down!
I'm under fire!<eos> Evasive maneuvers!<eos> Commander, your shields have been disrupted.<eos> Stand down!<eos> You just fired on your own forces.
Captain, this is a direct order. Disengage!<eos> I can't obey that order, sir.<eos> This is your last chance, Saber.<eos> That's a negative, sir!<eos> Then you leave me no choice.
Discretely.<eos> If the king dies before we return with his children we will be honor bound to join him in the afterlife.<eos> I have a friend.<eos> If it's happening on Goros, he'll know about it.<eos> I trust you are comfortable.
I'll tell you a secret.<eos> We may be royalty, but we are still warriors.<eos> Our father will not stop searching for us.<eos> But he won't find you, no one will.<eos> - Who are you?
Lorthos is a thug!<eos> Preys on unarmed vessels and isolated encampments.<eos> - We're trying to find...<eos> - Find other Aresians.<eos> And we'd appreciate any information you can provide.
Where are we?<eos> What planet?<eos> What planet?<eos> Goros Prime.<eos> What do you know of our captors?
So you find my hospitality is inadequate?<eos> I find my thirst for revenge unquenched.<eos> The generator is nearly complete but the power source remains unstable.<eos> The equation must be precise.<eos> He says, you should let his hive interrogate the prisoners.
I find my thirst for revenge unquenched.<eos> The generator is nearly complete but the power source remains unstable.<eos> The equation must be precise.<eos> He says, you should let his hive interrogate the prisoners.<eos> They will succeed where you have failed.
And your ships will have the power to unleash my wrath across the universe!<eos> We are an alliance.<eos> We do not serve you!<eos> I have cleared a path through the mires provided you with subjects to modify.<eos> You boast of a once great empire.
I have cleared a path through the mires provided you with subjects to modify.<eos> You boast of a once great empire.<eos> So far I am unimpressed!<eos> He is correct.<eos> You may have initiated this alliance but we have provided all the raw materials and the technology.
It is difficult to kill that which does not truly live.<eos> My construct is not powered by science.<eos> It's powered by the mind.<eos> Alive because I will it into existence!<eos> So you would kill me as a show of your power?
Nearing target area.<eos> Control, is the frequency I gave you set?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Deviant frequency online and sonic projector charged.<eos> Are you at a safe range?
Control, is the frequency I gave you set?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Deviant frequency online and sonic projector charged.<eos> Are you at a safe range?<eos> Please confirm you are at a safe range.
It may not be her.<eos> It is.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> That is disturbing news.<eos> If the threat is as dire as you suggest you will have the full support of the Star Sentinels.
I would like a word in private.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Prince Tyr.<eos> - It's King Tyr now.<eos> As you are well aware, my father died days after my return.
MY CHOSEN.<eos> Rise.<eos> GOD OF DEATH...<eos> POWERFUL SETH I WELCOME YOU INTO THIS MORTAL BODY...<eos> YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR FATE.
MY CHOSEN ONE WAS MURDERED.<eos> YOU WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.<eos> BUT IF YOU CHOOSE HIM... WHY WERE YOU GOING TO KILL HIM?<eos> I WAS NOT GOING TO KILL HIM.<eos> WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN... WHAT YOU MUST KNOW...
Let me just grab a pager for you here, and we'll get you to sit with a banking professional as soon as one becomes available.<eos> What happens with this?<eos> Oh, it's going to light up and vibrate.<eos> The red lights spin around in a circle.<eos> You won't be able to miss it.
Wechsler Steel.<eos> Yeah, I've been phoning them for weeks. I couldn't get a straight answer.<eos> And how about this, uh, foreclosure notice?<eos> Ah. The yellow one.<eos> So you must be in default.
Ah. The yellow one.<eos> So you must be in default.<eos> My mortgage payment tripled.<eos> Overnight.<eos> You were on our teaser rate promo, which expired back in January.
Right? It doesn't last.<eos> Make sense?<eos> And the new rate is quite a bit higher, so the monthly mortgage payment jumped up.<eos> Now, we are required to disclose that possibility at the time of the refi.<eos> - You did.
And the new rate is quite a bit higher, so the monthly mortgage payment jumped up.<eos> Now, we are required to disclose that possibility at the time of the refi.<eos> - You did.<eos> - I did what?<eos> You sold me this crap.
Let me just look at my notes here.<eos> (SNIFFS)<eos> Terms disclosed.<eos> I personally disclosed the possibility of a rate hike during your refi.<eos> Do you remember that?
(SNIFFS)<eos> Terms disclosed.<eos> I personally disclosed the possibility of a rate hike during your refi.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> You told me that the odds on the rate going past the prime rate were extraordinary.
I personally disclosed the possibility of a rate hike during your refi.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> You told me that the odds on the rate going past the prime rate were extraordinary.<eos> But possible.<eos> But you sold me "extraordinary."
But possible.<eos> But you sold me "extraordinary."<eos> - But the "possible" was disclosed.<eos> - Listen, Chuck. My granddaughter and my daughter, they live with me.<eos> She is a nurse's aide, you know, low pay and all that.
- Listen, Chuck. My granddaughter and my daughter, they live with me.<eos> She is a nurse's aide, you know, low pay and all that.<eos> She wanted her kid to go to a better school, so they moved in with me.<eos> - Lots of people doing that.<eos> - Yeah. So you see, I can't lose my house.
She wanted her kid to go to a better school, so they moved in with me.<eos> - Lots of people doing that.<eos> - Yeah. So you see, I can't lose my house.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> You're on the yellow notice.
I follow the book. Just follow procedure.<eos> Just stay calm. Stay calm.<eos> - Follow procedure. - JOE:<eos> Hey!<eos> You're going to get yourself shot!
You're going to get yourself shot!<eos> Gentlemen, it's best to remain silent.<eos> I'm cramping.<eos> Relax, please.<eos> You can sit up.
Pussycat!<eos> MAN 2:<eos> Keep stuffing it in there.<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> You can have this.
Let's go. Come on.<eos> You can have this.<eos> I'm sorry you're a casualty of a corrupt system that no longer serves the people.<eos> Yeah. I've been banking here for 40 years.<eos> You're just an account number.
No, my friend. Not from you.<eos> It is a culture's duty to take care of its elderly.<eos> Chuck here couldn't give a crap.<eos> Chuck.<eos> - Are you Chuck?
Chuck.<eos> - Are you Chuck?<eos> - Yes. I'm Chuck.<eos> I'm Chuck.<eos> Are you the one taking this man's house?
They make a pill for that.<eos> That looks like a gang tattoo to me.<eos> Very detailed.<eos> I imagine the artist did them all.<eos> So, if you find the tattoo parlor, then you'll find the artist, and you've got yourself a bank robber.
Sounds pretty standard to me.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, thanks a lot, old-timer.<eos> You know, we're going to get you an application.<eos> I've watched this TV show called Law and Order, and they solve crimes much quicker than you do.
Right.<eos> Well, thanks a lot, old-timer.<eos> You know, we're going to get you an application.<eos> I've watched this TV show called Law and Order, and they solve crimes much quicker than you do.<eos> You should tune in.
Well, thanks a lot, old-timer.<eos> You know, we're going to get you an application.<eos> I've watched this TV show called Law and Order, and they solve crimes much quicker than you do.<eos> You should tune in.<eos> Well, you know, in the real world, solving crimes takes a little longer than a one-hour television show.
You should tune in.<eos> Well, you know, in the real world, solving crimes takes a little longer than a one-hour television show.<eos> Well, I guess this wraps it up for us, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we need any additional information, then we'll get in contact with you.<eos> Oh. You'll need my address and phone number.
AGENT HAMER: Any other questions?<eos> What an asshole.<eos> Language.<eos> REPORTER:<eos> If you have any information regarding this tattoo artist...
Good night, Joe.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Assholes.<eos> Hey, Willie.<eos> How you feeling?
How you feeling?<eos> Partly cloudy, Doc.<eos> Partly cloudy.<eos> Well, I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> You can.
I won't mind.<eos> The dialysis is working marginally.<eos> You know, a kidney is all that's going to get you well.<eos> Well, I'll look on eBay.<eos> You're way down the list.
It's partially your age, it's partially your insurance. It's partially...<eos> Kidneys aren't that easy to come by.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everybody wants to hold on to theirs.<eos> Have you talked to your daughter?
Oh, let me help you.<eos> Give me the big one.<eos> The whole thing?<eos> The whole damn thing.<eos> You're the boss.
And breasts are better than thighs, don't you think?<eos> It could go either way.<eos> Oh, ham. (CHUCKLES)<eos> So good.<eos> Do you like ham?
Willie, jump in the bloody basket.<eos> I'm not getting in no bloody basket!<eos> (BLOWS WHISTLE)<eos> She's gaining on us.<eos> Hey, you.
Hey, you.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Hey! Halt!<eos> - Halt!<eos> - What are you chasing me for?
JOE:<eos> We can make the light!<eos> We're gonna do it!<eos> SECURITY GUARD:<eos> You're not gonna make the light!
- (ALL YELLING)<eos> Don't make another move.<eos> (CLICKING)<eos> I don't know what's going on in the world anymore.<eos> You were going to make a cordon bleu with chicken thighs?
I don't know what's going on in the world anymore.<eos> You were going to make a cordon bleu with chicken thighs?<eos> That's a crime in and of itself.<eos> I have nothing to say for myself.<eos> Look what you did to Cindy.
Never in all my years has anybody ever walked off with a whole pork loin.<eos> What would your momma say?<eos> Go big or go home.<eos> Had to be the brother.<eos> And why were you running?
What would your momma say?<eos> Go big or go home.<eos> Had to be the brother.<eos> And why were you running?<eos> You didn't steal anything.
No, they were chasing your friends.<eos> He was chasing me.<eos> When somebody chases me, I run.<eos> That's the way it works.<eos> Look, you guys are old. And I'm gonna be there in 40, or 50 years, I get it.
That's the way it works.<eos> Look, you guys are old. And I'm gonna be there in 40, or 50 years, I get it.<eos> Here.<eos> Here are some coupons.<eos> And we double them on Tuesday, but I'm sure you already know that.
Here are some coupons.<eos> And we double them on Tuesday, but I'm sure you already know that.<eos> So don't steal.<eos> It's wrong.<eos> But if you do steal, don't steal from Value Town.
That's not chicken scratch.<eos> I could rob a bank on my own. Make 100%.<eos> I'm sure you can, but this is easy money.<eos> None of the risks.<eos> Only the reward. You show us the ropes, you get paid.
In 20 days, I will not have a roof over my head.<eos> My social security check is a joke and my pension is tits up.<eos> Us three are going to go through with it.<eos> We are going to go through with it.<eos> If you want to make 25% helping us, that's fine.
My social security check is a joke and my pension is tits up.<eos> Us three are going to go through with it.<eos> We are going to go through with it.<eos> If you want to make 25% helping us, that's fine.<eos> But if you don't keep the bullshit to yourself!
I'm going in, Sam.<eos> WOMAN 1:<eos> Where did they go?<eos> WOMAN 2: I don't know!<eos> I thought you had 'em!
ALBERT: Ten seconds.<eos> WILLIE:<eos> No dye packs, no tracers.<eos> JOE:<eos> You got me, see?
WILLIE:<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here you go, ma'am.<eos> No funny business.<eos> Do you know what that means?
JOE:<eos> All of it, son.<eos> ALBERT: 30 seconds.<eos> WILLIE:<eos> Give me everything you've got.
All of it, son.<eos> ALBERT: 30 seconds.<eos> WILLIE:<eos> Give me everything you've got.<eos> You can have her, mister.
Come on!<eos> Hurry!<eos> This is my bank!<eos> ALBERT:<eos> Are you crazy?
ALBERT:<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - Freeze!<eos> - Me freeze?<eos> You don't tell me to freeze.
Are you crazy?<eos> - Freeze!<eos> - Me freeze?<eos> You don't tell me to freeze.<eos> You freeze!
You freeze!<eos> I'm not going to be a victim anymore.<eos> Tell them to freeze too.<eos> ALBERT:<eos> They can hear you just fine.
- Three!<eos> - (YELLING)<eos> (CONTINUES YELLING)<eos> ALBERT:<eos> You're a shit shot, pal.
- (YELLING)<eos> (CONTINUES YELLING)<eos> ALBERT:<eos> You're a shit shot, pal.<eos> Now you're going to meet your maker.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> (STOPS YELLING)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> Those were blanks, you dipshit.
He's not going to stop anytime soon.<eos> (CHUCKLES) He'll eventually pass out.<eos> WAITRESS:<eos> Gentlemen, can I interest you in dessert?<eos> What kind of pie do you have?
It's not the booze.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, it's not the booze?<eos> Hey!<eos> Can you please call an ambulance?
They were disguised as the Rat Pack,<eos> Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> The FBI has just released this surveillance video of the robbery.<eos> If you have any information, please call the number on our screen.
I believe there's a reward.<eos> A reward?<eos> Yeah. I need the money.<eos> My grandma got locked up last night.<eos> You know how it is, right, brother?
"I've got nothing to lose.<eos> "What's the worst that can end up happening?<eos> "I can end up spending the last years of my life<eos> "in some country club style prison, rent-free."<eos> You go to school for that?
Well, Mr. Garner, we seem to be missing one hour of your existence.<eos> Between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.<eos> The same hour that three elderly gentlemen robbed 2.3 million dollars from the Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Wow, that's some hefty payday.<eos> You were working the haunted house ride between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.?
The same hour that three elderly gentlemen robbed 2.3 million dollars from the Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Wow, that's some hefty payday.<eos> You were working the haunted house ride between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> And you never left that ride?
I go there...<eos> Couple of times a week at least.<eos> For years.<eos> He's a regular.<eos> You seeing anybody?
Oh, thanks, Joe.<eos> I needed a hat.<eos> JOE:<eos> And that's where I was for most of the carnival.<eos> You can ask anyone who bought a ticket.
- Al?<eos> Garner?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's here?<eos> You know, in the cotton candy booth, he tried to sell me cocaine.
Yes, I've had stomach issues for years from all the drinking I used to do.<eos> It's called diverticulitis, and the doctor says I should probably have a section of my colon removed.<eos> I don't really like that idea.<eos> (PEOPLE SHOUTING IN DISTINCTLY)<eos> So from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., give or take, you were going to the bathroom?
Then what happens?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Look out!<eos> JOE:<eos> Would you mind washing this dirty laundry for me?
Yeah.<eos> It was almost perfect.<eos> Except let me tell you a little something about criminals.<eos> They always make one stupid mistake that ends up screwing up the whole plan.<eos> I'm going to need you to take a ride with me, Harding.
Can I go home now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> JOE:<eos> Oh,<eos> I thought you might not be coming.
I thought you might not be coming.<eos> Well, here I am.<eos> So, what's good here, Joey?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> Why do you come?
He has all his shots.<eos> Rabies, distemper, Bordetella.<eos> He's been neutered.<eos> All the papers are in the proper order.<eos> You take your cut?
(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)<eos> FBI.<eos> Behind you.<eos> Six o'clock.<eos> Agent Hamer, would you like a bad coffee?
Agent Hamer, would you like a bad coffee?<eos> I'm a soy latte man, Mr. Harding.<eos> I'm lactose intolerant.<eos> You left that behind at evidence.<eos> How did you find me?
Special Agent Hamer, FBI.<eos> Jesus Garcia.<eos> Queens.<eos> (DOG WHINES)<eos> Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding?
Yeah.<eos> JESUS:<eos> You have to watch his little razor blades.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We don't want you to bleed to death.
We don't want you to bleed to death.<eos> I got to get this little guy back to the house before my granddaughter gets out of school.<eos> What a nice surprise for her.<eos> It'll knock her socks off.<eos> Do you have a dog now, Agent Hamer?
It's on you now.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Sala'am aleikum.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> You've traveled a long way.
Sala'am aleikum.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> You've traveled a long way.<eos> Please. I insist.<eos> You'll have to forgive the less-than-tasteful decor.
All of it?<eos> Gentlemen, please.<eos> Please.<eos> We're all friends here.<eos> I understand you are anxious, here, in your enemy's territory.
Gentlemen, please.<eos> Please.<eos> We're all friends here.<eos> I understand you are anxious, here, in your enemy's territory.<eos> But I assure you that is precisely why you are safe.
No one would dream of looking for you here, right under their noses.<eos> Of course mistrust is healthy when conducting these sorts of transactions, but rest assured, gentlemen, nobody wants to die today.<eos> We are honest criminals.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
There's actually a very funny story.<eos> You didn't let me get to the funny part.<eos> That was definitely gunfire.<eos> - Agent Cooper, stand down!<eos> - You want to stop me, shoot me.
- You want to stop me, shoot me.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Wait.<eos> My finger's on the trigger button.<eos> If you shoot me, this whole place becomes a memory.
My finger's on the trigger button.<eos> If you shoot me, this whole place becomes a memory.<eos> Now, lower your weapon and walk away.<eos> - No.<eos> - What do you mean, "no"?
- No.<eos> - What do you mean, "no"?<eos> I mean, "no."<eos> I will not lower weapon.<eos> You do understand what will happen if I push this button?
Okay, so just to be clear, you're perfectly happy for me to kill us, your friends, your family, and millions of innocent people, have I got that right?<eos> Da.<eos> Because button does nothing without key.<eos> That's a good point.<eos> You hit good... For a lady.
Drop your weapon!<eos> Agent Cooper?<eos> Agent Cooper, come in.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Who are you and what are you doing here?
Agent Cooper, come in.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Who are you and what are you doing here?<eos> Simon templar. And, at the moment, hiding.<eos> Well, Simon, you're interfering with a government operation.
Since when does the FBI have jurisdiction in Russia.<eos> It's a joint task force.<eos> - Who's coming?<eos> - Coming?<eos> You set off a homing device on the nuke.
It's a joint task force.<eos> - Who's coming?<eos> - Coming?<eos> You set off a homing device on the nuke.<eos> - Who are you trying to contact?
You set off a homing device on the nuke.<eos> - Who are you trying to contact?<eos> - Look, agent Cooper, we can sit here with you continuing to not believe me and be turned into Swiss cheese or we can, I don't know, do something to try and survive.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> What are you doing?
- Cover me. - Wait.<eos> Stop.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> I need some backup in here.<eos> You want to reload?
You want to reload?<eos> I wait.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - You're under arrest.<eos> - Are you serious?
Where am I going?<eos> The airport.<eos> He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.<eos> I've got you a charter flight. Wheels up in an hour.<eos> Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.
He was a proud man.<eos> He would never stoop to begging, as I have.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Your father would be very proud of you.<eos> The lengths to which you have gone to help your people, Mr. president, will go down in history.
Your father would be very proud of you.<eos> The lengths to which you have gone to help your people, Mr. president, will go down in history.<eos> And remember, it takes courage to ask for help.<eos> The generosity you have shown my country has been overwhelming, and it will certainly help the healing process, but sadly, it's still not enough.<eos> Did you ever think that 2.5 billion dollarswouldnotbeenough?
It motivates me to this day.<eos> It brought me here, to you.<eos> And I'm incredibly grateful that it did.<eos> All right.<eos> You'll have access to the bank accounts at midnight.
Should we be doing this?<eos> I mean the 2.5 billion isn't blood money.<eos> It's going for aid to people in need.<eos> Now don't start growing a conscience, Arnie.<eos> You haven't had the experience.
Now don't start growing a conscience, Arnie.<eos> You haven't had the experience.<eos> He asked you about your ring, didn't he?<eos> It practically sealed the deal.<eos> How did you know he would?
He asked you about your ring, didn't he?<eos> It practically sealed the deal.<eos> How did you know he would?<eos> It's a conversation starter.<eos> - What did you tell him?
I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.<eos> I almost gave it to him.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's pathetic, just like the man I took it from.<eos> You've kept it all these years, it must mean something to you.
All right.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> Time's a-wasting.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Simon templar, you're the most peculiar thief I know.
Time's a-wasting.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Simon templar, you're the most peculiar thief I know.<eos> Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> You have the list?
Eight hundred thousand to doctors without borders.<eos> - Seven hundred fifty thousand to migrant assistance.<eos> - Um- 1.5 million to children's hunger fund...<eos> Listen...<eos> You want to give all this money to children?
- Um- 1.5 million to children's hunger fund...<eos> Listen...<eos> You want to give all this money to children?<eos> Th-they are so little. Maybe they don't eat so much.<eos> Your money. You're the boss.
- Yes, darling.<eos> I might have been wrong about the beard.<eos> It makes you a little, dare I say... Older.<eos> Goodbye, darling.<eos> You, gentlemen, were the only ones who got perfect scores on your exams.
It makes you a little, dare I say... Older.<eos> Goodbye, darling.<eos> You, gentlemen, were the only ones who got perfect scores on your exams.<eos> I am most surprised at you, Mr. templar.<eos> You had perfect grades.
Goodbye, darling.<eos> You, gentlemen, were the only ones who got perfect scores on your exams.<eos> I am most surprised at you, Mr. templar.<eos> You had perfect grades.<eos> You did not need to steal the answer sheets.
I am most surprised at you, Mr. templar.<eos> You had perfect grades.<eos> You did not need to steal the answer sheets.<eos> I never looked at the answers, sir.<eos> And yet you felt compelled to break into the master's office... we didn't break in, sir.
You did not need to steal the answer sheets.<eos> I never looked at the answers, sir.<eos> And yet you felt compelled to break into the master's office... we didn't break in, sir.<eos> I made an impression of the key.<eos> So you admit it?
And yet you felt compelled to break into the master's office... we didn't break in, sir.<eos> I made an impression of the key.<eos> So you admit it?<eos> There's nothing to admit, sir.<eos> You caught us. Which would have never happened if you'd stuck to the plan.
I need protection.<eos> For me and my family.<eos> Before I tell you anything.<eos> I need your assurance that we will be protected.<eos> How'd you get this number?
Before I tell you anything.<eos> I need your assurance that we will be protected.<eos> How'd you get this number?<eos> That is the least interesting detail that I have information about.<eos> Okay, you have my attention.
That is the least interesting detail that I have information about.<eos> Okay, you have my attention.<eos> Last night, 2.5 billion dollars intended for relief in Nigeria was diverted to several untraceable bank accounts.<eos> H-hang on.<eos> How do you know this?
It's totally gross.<eos> God! Why do you always have to be so mean?<eos> Okay. I'll try.<eos> I don't speak that language.<eos> Are you here for my dad?
We know that the fans are already blaming him for the charges of trying to leave out of town.<eos> All right, that's all we've got time for.<eos> Now moving to headline news at the top of the hour with our very own Fiona krinchauf.<eos> It's a helpless feeling, isn't it, Arnie?<eos> You take from me, i take from you.
While I've got all the time in the world, but, unfortunately, your daughter doesn't have that luxury.<eos> Please...<eos> We... her wellbeing is entirely in your hands.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Because I like you, you've got 48 hours.
Zooey!<eos> - Help!<eos> Help me! Zooey!<eos> Daddy, they're gonna kill me.<eos> As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.
- Help!<eos> Help me! Zooey!<eos> Daddy, they're gonna kill me.<eos> As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.<eos> Have you got my money yet?
As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.<eos> Have you got my money yet?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.
Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.<eos> How can I trust you?<eos> Frankly, I don't see you have much of a choice.
- One guard at the door.<eos> - What kinda safe am I hitting?<eos> Keller 9000.<eos> If he has the account data, it will be in there.<eos> You are a very clever girl, Ms. holm.
Mr. valecross, how do you do?<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> I understand you have information from you regarding the assets of...<eos> - no, I don't.<eos> - You don't? Well, then why did you call the FBI?
- no, I don't.<eos> - You don't? Well, then why did you call the FBI?<eos> Regarding your emp... i must have dialed the wrong number, inspector..<eos> I no longer work for the bici.<eos> Were you stealing from them?
- You don't? Well, then why did you call the FBI?<eos> Regarding your emp... i must have dialed the wrong number, inspector..<eos> I no longer work for the bici.<eos> Were you stealing from them?<eos> Did they catch you? Threaten you?
I no longer work for the bici.<eos> Were you stealing from them?<eos> Did they catch you? Threaten you?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, inspector.<eos> - You made your trip for nothing.
The room right next to valecross' suite.<eos> Now, be nice to the bodyguard.<eos> Morning.<eos> Housekeeping.<eos> If you could do your thing, please, Ms. holm?
Simon?<eos> This is a very thoughtful gift, Mr. valecross.<eos> I've been looking for my father's ring for a long time.<eos> May I show you something?<eos> Now, would you mind telling me why you lured me here?
This is a very thoughtful gift, Mr. valecross.<eos> I've been looking for my father's ring for a long time.<eos> May I show you something?<eos> Now, would you mind telling me why you lured me here?<eos> I figured you wouldn't wanna talk with a guy like me, but
May I show you something?<eos> Now, would you mind telling me why you lured me here?<eos> I figured you wouldn't wanna talk with a guy like me, but<eos> - maybe for 2.5 billion dollars you would.<eos> - You figured right.
Now, would you mind telling me why you lured me here?<eos> I figured you wouldn't wanna talk with a guy like me, but<eos> - maybe for 2.5 billion dollars you would.<eos> - You figured right.<eos> Unless you're gonna cut me a check, what can I do for you?
My daughter's been kidnapped.<eos> Well, the FBI's in the building.<eos> Why not talk to them?<eos> If I let the FBI handle this, I'll never see my daughter again.<eos> My sympathies, Mr. valecross, but when you launder cash for the world's most corrupt dictators, that kind of thing tends to happen.
They'll kill my daughter.<eos> She doesn't deserve that.<eos> That's why I need you. To handle the exchange. To help us get away safely.<eos> Please.<eos> You're the Saint.
It's okay. It's okay.<eos> The account numbers... Are in your ring.<eos> The key is a nomad.<eos> Please... Save my little girl.<eos> Where did you get the ring?
Good luck.<eos> I've heard you've been having some troubles at school.<eos> Don't be ashamed, Simon.<eos> It happens to the best of us.<eos> What are you?
It happens to the best of us.<eos> What are you?<eos> - A head doctor?<eos> - A head doctor?<eos> You know, a psychiatrist.
Loosen up a little on the grip.<eos> That's it.<eos> Lesson one:<eos> Never take your eyes off your opponent.<eos> - Can you teach me to do that?
I had the situation well in hand.<eos> A beautiful woman in chains, three dead bodies, sixty miles south of Baghdad.<eos> I can't wait to hear this one.<eos> You know, if you let me put my hands down I might be able to find the key to those chains.<eos> - You're British?
- Special forces?<eos> - Motorcycle holiday.<eos> In Iraq?<eos> Well, the gas is very cheap here at the moment.<eos> Do you have a name?
- There's another one.<eos> - Yeah, there's another one.<eos> FBI. Whoa!<eos> Special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> You must be captain Miller.
Special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> You must be captain Miller.<eos> And I'm, I'm garces.<eos> Detective actually.<eos> You know, the guys down at the precinct said you, you might be here.
And I'm, I'm garces.<eos> Detective actually.<eos> You know, the guys down at the precinct said you, you might be here.<eos> - Yeah, this is our spot.<eos> - I got the call you'd be showing up.
Detective actually.<eos> You know, the guys down at the precinct said you, you might be here.<eos> - Yeah, this is our spot.<eos> - I got the call you'd be showing up.<eos> You could've let me finish my lunch.
Insurance investigators, here to appraise the estate.<eos> You keep her busy, I'll scan the electronics for signs of the nomad.<eos> Mrs. valecross, so sorry for your loss.<eos> We represent the holders of your husband's life insurance.<eos> Are you Simon templar?
- Come in.<eos> I heard what happened to Arnie on the radio... When I was coming home from work.<eos> When I walked into the house, the phone was ringing.<eos> It was the kidnappers.<eos> They said you'd be coming, and if I called the police, they'd kill zooey.
I heard what happened to Arnie on the radio... When I was coming home from work.<eos> When I walked into the house, the phone was ringing.<eos> It was the kidnappers.<eos> They said you'd be coming, and if I called the police, they'd kill zooey.<eos> Until that moment, you had no idea she had been taken.
Until that moment, you had no idea she had been taken.<eos> No. I thought she was out with friends.<eos> Zooey and I never really got along.<eos> She thought I was too young to be with her dad.<eos> Mrs. valecross... How much did you know about Arnie's banking activities?
She thought I was too young to be with her dad.<eos> Mrs. valecross... How much did you know about Arnie's banking activities?<eos> I knew the men Arnie represented were evil.<eos> I knew he helped them steal and hide billions from the countries they ruled.<eos> But, you know, recently...
But, you know, recently...<eos> I don't know, maybe through my influence, he... He had a change of heart.<eos> He wanted that money to go back to those countries. Back to those people just so they could have better lives.<eos> But I feel so guilty, like I'm responsible for what happened to my husband and zooey.<eos> You shouldn't blame yourself.
Well, that container of assault rifles in Mali?<eos> I thought that blew up rather nicely.<eos> Shall we set the exchange? The girl for the money?<eos> I need a bit more time.<eos> So why don't you send the girl home to mum as a sign of goodwill, and Patricia and I will keep looking for the money.
I thought that blew up rather nicely.<eos> Shall we set the exchange? The girl for the money?<eos> I need a bit more time.<eos> So why don't you send the girl home to mum as a sign of goodwill, and Patricia and I will keep looking for the money.<eos> You know I can't release her without cash in hand.
Didn't know you two were acquainted.<eos> Before your time, darling.<eos> I only got a partial trace. Not enough to get his exact location.<eos> The money?<eos> Can you get the money?
I'm sorry, you gotta stop.<eos> I can't take that.<eos> What? -The yelling.<eos> I cannot take the yelling.<eos> You told me to-to stay close to these guys.
I can't take that.<eos> What? -The yelling.<eos> I cannot take the yelling.<eos> You told me to-to stay close to these guys.<eos> It's just that if you rear end them, guess what?
I cannot take the yelling.<eos> You told me to-to stay close to these guys.<eos> It's just that if you rear end them, guess what?<eos> They're gonna know we're behind them! - I never tailed anyone.<eos> - How are you a detective?
Garces, go after her!<eos> She's faster than him!<eos> Hey, out of the way.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Where are you gonna go now?
She's faster than him!<eos> Hey, out of the way.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Where are you gonna go now?<eos> You're under arrest.
Where are you gonna go now?<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Really, fernack?<eos> Three guns?<eos> You only have two hands.
Are we done here?<eos> Very good.<eos> Sonali.<eos> - Ciao.<eos> I thought you said you weren't one to take a punch.
And yet you go, charging to the rescue, heart on your sleeve.<eos> Can you keep this safe for me while I'm inside?<eos> Giving me a ring without taking a knee?<eos> Well, I'd hate to ruin this wonderful friendship that neither one of us deserve.<eos> Will you agree, Ms. holm?
I've got Doyle flying in to plant the hotspot.<eos> If I have to, someone's getting tased.<eos> Just get in there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.
If I have to, someone's getting tased.<eos> Just get in there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.<eos> Um... I was just wondering if you could show me where the restroom is.
Sorry to disturb you.<eos> Um... I was just wondering if you could show me where the restroom is.<eos> No.<eos> Okay... guess I'm just gonna have to hold it.<eos> But you got a bad attitude, pal.
Honestly. Who fitted these locks?<eos> Give me a minute, darling.<eos> Doyle's got a problem.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, i can explain. I can explain.<eos> - You know what?
Okay, okay, okay, i can explain. I can explain.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Talk to her. - She'll explain.<eos> She'll explain.<eos> No, seriously. You should have a conversation with her.
- You know what?<eos> Talk to her. - She'll explain.<eos> She'll explain.<eos> No, seriously. You should have a conversation with her.<eos> You want me?
Charmed.<eos> FBI.<eos> - Where's your server room?<eos> - It's in the basement.<eos> You, black jacket.
FBI.<eos> - Where's your server room?<eos> - It's in the basement.<eos> You, black jacket.<eos> Wipe your nose, grab your gun, you come with me. - Yes, sir.
Hello.<eos> Hand me the bag.<eos> Fernack, if I do that, an innocent girl is going to die.<eos> Saving people's lives is my job, not yours.<eos> Whatever you say.
Marius will kill them both if we don't stop them.<eos> We?<eos> - I'll call it in.<eos> - Come on, believe me.<eos> If you do that, they are already dead.
If you do that, they are already dead.<eos> It's your call.<eos> These are the account numbers you will use for the transfer.<eos> One question.<eos> When did you lose your mind?
These are the account numbers you will use for the transfer.<eos> One question.<eos> When did you lose your mind?<eos> Get it done.<eos> You really think you're something, don't you?
You really think you're something, don't you?<eos> British accent. Designer clothes. Hot little sidekick.<eos> She's not my "side-kick," she's my associate.<eos> A position I'd like her to retain.<eos> You do know we're riding into a trap, don't you?
Ex-wife!<eos> Were you gonna mention this?<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> You're gonna be okay, but you cannot make a sound, okay?
Come here, you little bitch.<eos> The famous templar family ring.<eos> Poor little Simon...<eos> His mommy and his daddy shot dead right before his eyes.<eos> How do you know about that?
The famous templar family ring.<eos> Poor little Simon...<eos> His mommy and his daddy shot dead right before his eyes.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> How do you think valecross got this in the first place?
Let the girl go.<eos> Saving the girl won't bring your parents back.<eos> Who killed them?<eos> Who killed my parents?<eos> You, Simon templar, are just a pawn in a bigger game.
Templar.<eos> Templar?<eos> Templar?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the information we have at this time.<eos> - Um, Mr. president. - President ibaka... Do you know any detail surrounding the missing funds' sudden reappearance?
He's not my thug.<eos> Your man recommended him for the job.<eos> Look, we can lay blame later on.<eos> Right now, I need help disappearing for a while.<eos> You can try, but you better hurry.
Your man recommended him for the job.<eos> Look, we can lay blame later on.<eos> Right now, I need help disappearing for a while.<eos> You can try, but you better hurry.<eos> You are not leaving me to take the fall for this.
- I have someone - I want you to meet.<eos> Someone very special.<eos> His name is Xander.<eos> - Xander.<eos> Take whatever you want.
- Xander.<eos> Take whatever you want.<eos> Jewelry, silverware...<eos> We don't have any money in the house.<eos> You, of all people, should know that money is the motivator of lesser minds.
To wipe every last templar from the face of the earth.<eos> It's only me you're after.<eos> Leave my family, my wife, out of this.<eos> My father asked you for mercy, not for himself, for his family. And you gave him none.<eos> I'm glad it's you, Simon.
It ought to be you.<eos> But there's more than just me out there.<eos> The brotherhood will be coming after you.<eos> I'll worry about that when you're dead.<eos> You can't do it.
But there's more than just me out there.<eos> The brotherhood will be coming after you.<eos> I'll worry about that when you're dead.<eos> You can't do it.<eos> You're still a little boy concerned with "honor."
You can't do it.<eos> You're still a little boy concerned with "honor."<eos> I'm no assassin.<eos> I'm a templar.<eos> You're weak. Like your father.
I'm a templar.<eos> You're weak. Like your father.<eos> He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.<eos> But I'd rather be "weak," than whatever it is you are.
He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.<eos> But I'd rather be "weak," than whatever it is you are.<eos> Good luck, Xander.<eos> You're gonna need it.
He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.<eos> But I'd rather be "weak," than whatever it is you are.<eos> Good luck, Xander.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> You do understand, don't you, that with one phone call, i won't spend a single day in jail.
You're gonna need it.<eos> You do understand, don't you, that with one phone call, i won't spend a single day in jail.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Hands up.<eos> You're under arrest.
Special agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Pleasure to see you again.<eos> Wish I could say the same.<eos> I see you've brought a friend with you.
I see you've brought a friend with you.<eos> Yes, this is my associate, agent dora Lee.<eos> Based just on what I've tapped into during his file transfers in the last half an hour, he's got enough connections to terror groups and suspect funds to keep homeland security busy for a long time.<eos> What are the charges?<eos> -What makes you think we're charging you with anything?
Whoa! Is that true?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I saw Cole loading the Abrams.<eos> Sergeant Harper, are we staging?<eos> I know what you know, chutsky.
Army's kept me in a cage for six weeks, sergeant Harper.<eos> Ooh, time to let me out.<eos> - It's not a problem.<eos> Get the stick, huh?<eos> What are you doing here?
Ooh, time to let me out.<eos> - It's not a problem.<eos> Get the stick, huh?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, whatever you tell me to, sergeant.
What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, whatever you tell me to, sergeant.<eos> That's a very good answer.<eos> But that's not what I mean.<eos> You're a smart guy.
That's a very good answer.<eos> But that's not what I mean.<eos> You're a smart guy.<eos> Smarter than most of these boys.<eos> Why aren't you being all the fuck you can be somewhere else, huh?
- Yeah, no shit.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to flank.<eos> All right. Well, Charlie team's got a... A team across the way.<eos> Oh, chutsky, you want it?
Help me out. God damn.<eos> - He okay?<eos> - Fuckin' do something.<eos> Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.<eos> - All right, ocre, you're with me. - Yeah.

Noble lion, this is eagle two.<eos> Sniper fire is too heavy.<eos> I'm suggesting an air strike.<eos> Over.<eos> - What the hell are you doing? - What a clusterfuck of a...

Uh, eagle four, this is eagle six.<eos> Whatever the delay, pick up the fuckin' pace.<eos> Over.<eos> Eagle six, this is eagle four.<eos> Why do you hate me when I love you so much?
Small village up north. Outskirts of baqubah.<eos> I mean, a Toyota filled with dead terrorists... Doesn't seem like a big problem, sir.<eos> No, the big problem is the big fucking hole we left in their water station when the apaches fired on them.<eos> Command wants some of our guys to attach to the sf team on the ground.<eos> You'll report to a captain syverson and run water to the town.
Are you a grown man?<eos> Then make your own decisions.<eos> Can we at least get the sat phone to call home? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll make it happen.<eos> Hey, sergeant, you done?
Yeah.<eos> I mean, my mom thinks I work in the kitchen.<eos> I told her... It's stupid. I told her everyone calls me private okra.<eos> Okay. But your dad, right?<eos> He was in. You could talk to him. He gets it.
I told her... It's stupid. I told her everyone calls me private okra.<eos> Okay. But your dad, right?<eos> He was in. You could talk to him. He gets it.<eos> He went awol when I was six.<eos> That burn you up?
Burton's tough as nails, and chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm...<eos> Look, chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it.<eos> I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture.<eos> And if I don't go?<eos> If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.
And if I don't go?<eos> If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.<eos> And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> You can't come out here and outsource your decision to me.
If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.<eos> And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> You can't come out here and outsource your decision to me.<eos> If you're in, here's the sat phone. You got a call to make.
Okay, where the fuck are your plates, private?<eos> - There's not enough to go around.<eos> - But... somebody cough up a plate.<eos> Here, take one of mine.<eos> No, Burton, you're top gun.
Snipers so much as see a bit of light, they will start popping shots.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Who wants the bunk by the window?<eos> Ocre.<eos> You're up top.

Coming in.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Show me your hands! Show me your hands!<eos> Get out of the car! Get out of the car!<eos> Machmoud, where the fuck are you?
I got a bad feeling about this guy.<eos> Ocre, cut him loose. Let's go, cut him loose.<eos> Look, this is, uh... This is for your trouble and your little girl there, okay?<eos> We're sorry for the trouble.<eos> Okay, but hey, hey, hey. You can't drive this road anymore, okay?

Sheikh's only ever talked to me, so I'll make the introduction.<eos> Take your boots off when you get inside.<eos> Have some chai.<eos> And after chai, get down to business.<eos> He... he don't like that you bring more soldiers to his home.
The captain and... and his men, they're gonna keep everybody safe.<eos> He say baqubah is two different cities.<eos> One during the day belongs to the us, and one at night belongs to other people.<eos> Uh, he say his people do not trust the Americans.<eos> When the night comes, you cannot protect.
No water.<eos> He say you destroyed the water, you fix it. It's your problem.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome. Hello.<eos> You deliver water?

No one will help us.<eos> Maybe you are asking the wrong people. Mr. Matt!<eos> Mr. Matt!<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You're gonna have to talk me through this.
And you think a schoolteacher is the answer?<eos> All due respect, sir, we're down a tanker and we lost a man yesterday.<eos> I gotta activate these guys.<eos> Okay? And we can't do this on our own. I'm just...<eos> I'm requesting you hear the private out.

Could you explain to the people here what we're doing, why we're here?<eos> - They know.<eos> - Yeah, but they won't help.<eos> Working with the Americans is very dangerous.<eos> How can you guarantee their safety?
- Yeah, but they won't help.<eos> Working with the Americans is very dangerous.<eos> How can you guarantee their safety?<eos> Well, they won't be seen collaborating with us. Everything goes through you.<eos> You talk to them. You bring them to the pumping station.

Will you just say it even if you don't mean it, Anne? Just say it.<eos> No, never mind.<eos> Okay, Anne.<eos> You take care too.<eos> Hey, phone's free if you want.
You know, maybe... Maybe my bullet's waiting out there.<eos> Or maybe my bullet is cancer. Gonna hit me 50 years from now.<eos> Oh, but that's not up to me.<eos> So why worry?<eos> Sure you're up for this, huh?

Sergeant Harper...<eos> Three weeks' leave to return with us in riyadh.<eos> Roger, sir.<eos> Private ocre.<eos> What do you say we get you back on level ground?
It'll take you to the balad flightline and a c-130 will take you back to the states.<eos> I'm happy to waive my leave, sir.<eos> If it's all the same, I'll stay.<eos> The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son.<eos> You're going home, private.
How?<eos> No, please, someone tell me how my fuckin' job is done here,<eos> - because I don't see how it's...<eos> - God damn it, private!<eos> You're dismissed.

It's, uh, god's plan.<eos> Then he asked if I smoke.<eos> I said no.<eos> So, uh, he gives me these and said maybe I should consider starting.<eos> How about you? What you thinking about?
- Yup.<eos> I start thinking about that, and all this other shit starts rushing back, you know?<eos> I haven't even thought about home for a long time.<eos> Did I tell you some captain told me to blouse my boots today?<eos> Can you believe that shit?
You know, we fucking had it, sergeant.<eos> The people were with us.<eos> The water was gonna flow.<eos> It wasn't ours to have, ocre.<eos> - You got nothing to feel guilty about. - No, but...
The people were with us.<eos> The water was gonna flow.<eos> It wasn't ours to have, ocre.<eos> - You got nothing to feel guilty about. - No, but...<eos> Okay? For whatever you did or whatever you didn't do.

No, I...<eos> I broke my own hand back in Kuwait. I slammed it in a Hummer door.<eos> Just... trying to get out of all this shit.<eos> Well, now you can.<eos> Hey, you want these?
- The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.<eos> So you say phase and I say insurrection the only response to insurrection is to crush it.<eos> Quickly. - Stephanie, purple is definitely your color.<eos> Chase, good luck on that first chair open audition.<eos> Sarah, your Blanche DuBois was transcendental. Hey, you, me, Magic the Gathering. Fifth period, whoo!
Okay. Hi.<eos> - [Carol] Hi.<eos> - You must be David, of course you are.<eos> Who else would you be? (laughs awkwardly)<eos> You wouldn't bring a date to dinner, right?
- No, no way. You were practically undressing me with your eyes.<eos> - Undressing you?<eos> Mister oh I don't let many people behind the candelabra.<eos> - I don't care, do what you want.<eos> - I have been looking for you all day.
- Even if Obi-Wan ends up having to chop off his best friend's legs and his best friend ends up turning into some mouth-breathing, goth cyborg who eventually kills him?<eos> - Yeah, even then.<eos> Jodi.<eos> There's one thing that I do know.<eos> Nothing great ever happens when you're sitting on the sidelines.
I didn't know you'd served in the army.<eos> I haven't.<eos> How could I?<eos> I've been in the fucking jail for 20 years.<eos> - You not fucking notice? - Of course, of course.
I've been in the fucking jail for 20 years.<eos> - You not fucking notice? - Of course, of course.<eos> Diminished responsibility.<eos> If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility, I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy... Did you mention it?
If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility, I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy... Did you mention it?<eos> The diminished responsibility. Did you mention it?<eos> - At the hearing?<eos> - Aye. Did you?
- I felt it was more constructive...<eos> - Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!
- Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.
I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.<eos> So you gonna press that little yellow button or no?
- This is for you.<eos> - What?<eos> It's a recording.<eos> A keepsake so the memory need never fade.<eos> - Who are you?
- Who are you?<eos> - I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.
10% of your salary per annum.<eos> Paid monthly on a rolling, indefinite basis.<eos> You disgusting shit!<eos> I will not stand for this!<eos> Naturally, you'll have to lie to your wife.
Welcome to Edinburgh.<eos> - Welcome to Edinburgh. - Hi. Welcome to Edinburgh.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Where are you from?
You got to see old Simon, man.<eos> You know how it was, Spud.<eos> You and Simon was like that, man.<eos> Hello, Frank.<eos> How are you feeling this morning?
Where the fuck am I going to go, all these tubes stuck to me?<eos> Give a man a little bit of dignity for once, eh?<eos> Aye.<eos> All right, Frank.<eos> You're a good man, Mr. Wilson.
No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.<eos> What do you want?
No.<eos> Not for 20 years.<eos> That's really good.<eos> Well done.<eos> So, are you the woman in the video?
That's really good.<eos> Well done.<eos> So, are you the woman in the video?<eos> My face is not seen.<eos> Do you have any identifying marks?
Every morning just the same Since the morning that we came<eos> To this poor provincial town<eos> Good morning, Belle!<eos> Good morning, Monsieur Jean!<eos> Have you lost something again?
Ah, if it isn't the only bookworm in town.<eos> So, where did you run off to this week?<eos> Two cities in Northern Italy.<eos> I didn't want to come back!<eos> Have you got any new places to go?
Thank...<eos> Hello?<eos> Sorry to intrude.<eos> I'm just a traveler... seeking shelter from the storm.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.
Beautiful.<eos> Extraordinary.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> He was talking about me.<eos> Well, wherever you are... I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.

A man, or a mantle clock?<eos> Ready, miss?<eos> - Trust me.<eos> You must forgive first impressions.<eos> I hope you are not too startled.
I'm talking to a candle.<eos> Candelabra, please.<eos> Enormous difference.<eos> But consider me at your service.<eos> The castle is your home now... so feel free to go anywhere you like.
It has been so long since I have performed.<eos> I can barely even remember how.<eos> Another cavity.<eos> Maestro, your wife is upstairs... finding it harder and harder to stay awake.<eos> She's counting on you to help us break this curse.

Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> Oh! It's so good to see you.<eos> You saved our lives, mademoiselle.
Are those two yours?<eos> Yes they are.<eos> They seem to be getting along.<eos> I think we should either, or it will get weird.<eos> Listen, we're camping there if you want to come in later, Roasting marshmallows at the campfire.
I think we should either, or it will get weird.<eos> Listen, we're camping there if you want to come in later, Roasting marshmallows at the campfire.<eos> Is a good idea.<eos> Great!<eos> He told me He told me You have a good family.

Can someone tell me what's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips.<eos> Everything indicates that there is a guy who has been looking for years.<eos> They think he's responsible for the kidnapping Of at least 5 girls.<eos> You think he got my Missy?
Solve some things in the city.<eos> Mack.<eos> Yes?<eos> Do not forget that we love each other.<eos> And you do not know anything about it?
And you do not know anything about it?<eos> Well, it has no seal.<eos> Do not.<eos> If it has no seal, it has not been delivered.<eos> Do you want your mail, since you're here?
How about presentations?<eos> I'm Elousia.<eos> I have many names, But this is one of my favorites.<eos> Or you can call me like Nan calls.<eos> Do you know Nan?
You can start there.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Caution.<eos> This one is deadly.<eos> What are you doing here if it's poisonous?
Yeah, I'm a writer.<eos> Cards.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Uh... romantic ones.<eos> So, yeah, I'm a poet, if you've got to label me.
I mean...<eos> I could see her pupils dilate.<eos> I had her hooked.<eos> Then she asked,<eos> "Well, if you're so famous, what have you written?"
I was just about to ask for a meeting.<eos> Good luck, pal.<eos> Well, who's to say it's not good news?<eos> We'll keep our fingers crossed.<eos> Styvesan, I'm so glad you made the time.
Just the truth, all right?<eos> 'Cause that's what cards have been missing.<eos> Besides, I've heard complaints about the glitter.<eos> You know, I campaigned for a stronger glue about two years ago.<eos> - Ray, why don't you have a seat.
Class it up.<eos> Quarters.<eos> That's your idea.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to put quarters in a romance card.
I'll double it.<eos> Okay, Ray, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to take your guild card.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ray, why don't you, um, get your stuff some other time, okay?
I'm gonna have to take your guild card.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ray, why don't you, um, get your stuff some other time, okay?<eos> We'll keep it safe for you.<eos> What are you looking at?
All right, gentlemen:<eos> Fight!<eos> Go, Shitfoot.<eos> Mr. Ray!<eos> Hey, Mr. Ray, I know you're in there!
Go, Shitfoot.<eos> Mr. Ray!<eos> Hey, Mr. Ray, I know you're in there!<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> And the giraffe baby will be at the city zoo for just two more weeks, so you'd better get down there.
Rent.<eos> That's it?<eos> Just "rent"?<eos> No "Good morning, Ray."<eos> Have you noticed the flowers I planted?"
Listen, I cut a tendon.<eos> They don't heal so fast.<eos> I can't ply my trade.<eos> And you can't write with the other fingers?<eos> You're gonna have to figure out a way to pay me.
And you can't write with the other fingers?<eos> You're gonna have to figure out a way to pay me.<eos> So?<eos> You want me to blow you?<eos> Hey, watch what you're saying.
The same.<eos> Look, I got a business proposition for you.<eos> - You been writing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What have you been working on?
Thanks.<eos> Hey, I might need to get into the office, get some of my old notes and such, okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> After hours.<eos> Make sure you use the back door, the one with the broken lock.
- I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?
I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're not cuckoo, are you?
You're not cuckoo, are you?<eos> I...<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm Ray. - I'm Jill.<eos> You're not Ray Wentworth, are you?
- I wrote that.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm a weirdo for cards.<eos> That's why I come here.<eos> How many cats do you have?
Hey.<eos> "Now I get a piece.<eos> Thanks for sharing."<eos> Thanks for sharing.<eos> That is so sad, don't you think?
That's a person who's asking for so little.<eos> You still got that awesome tattoo?<eos> Yep.<eos> Hasn't washed off yet.<eos> What are you doing here?
Seeing how awful these are is a real pick-me-up.<eos> Ah, yeah, it's pretty gross.<eos> I actually work here.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't walk around all the time in a red smock with a name tag?
These are the worst.<eos> I hate optimistic people.<eos> They bum me out with their upbeat attitude.<eos> All they ever do is make me feel more alone.<eos> Are you real?
I hate optimistic people.<eos> They bum me out with their upbeat attitude.<eos> All they ever do is make me feel more alone.<eos> Are you real?<eos> So, why did you quit writing?
So, why did you quit writing?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I just quit being good at it.<eos> Yeah, well, you'll get it back.<eos> You gotta have the feelings first, and then you can write about them.
Yeah.<eos> Shitfoot?<eos> Ray?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, um, do you think that...
Shitfoot?<eos> Ray?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, um, do you think that...<eos> Do you think that, um... we could, uh...
You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."<eos> Stupid.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
Can I see a badge?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have a gander.<eos> It's pretty, isn't it?<eos> What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?
What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?<eos> Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.
Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.<eos> You punched me in the throat!

- You think that I...?<eos> - He was your competition, right?<eos> You got somebody watching over you.<eos> For now.<eos> But you've got to deliver.
For now.<eos> But you've got to deliver.<eos> Deliver what?<eos> Oh, I'll tell you what.<eos> You get out your feather pen, and you write a nice little card that'll open my girlfriend's legs again.
Shoot.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh... uh, I got an idea.<eos> How about a yard sale, then?<eos> You can put price tags on everything here.
My bed frame.<eos> That's a thousand bucks right there.<eos> I got all this small stuff, like the kitchenware and, uh, my shoe horns.<eos> The Christmas ornaments.<eos> You put all that on one card table right in the middle of the room and a little sign that says,
People will go nuts.<eos> Everything for a hundred bucks.<eos> On the table.<eos> I mean, well, name your price.<eos> And what about you?
And what about you?<eos> Well, see, I still... I get to live here while it goes on.<eos> It's kind of like a living showroom.<eos> Never been done.<eos> You're crazy.
Well, he talked about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I pushed him around. I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.<eos> Did you attend the company picnics, huh?
Did you attend the company picnics, huh?<eos> Christmas party?<eos> No, I hate holidays.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, wait, you're in the greetings industry.
Anyway.<eos> Wait.<eos> Gundy has a brother?<eos> I guess.<eos> I've just been feeling so lonely, without Orwell's voice buzzing in the air, you know?
Seriously?<eos> Yeah, of your house.<eos> Can I use it?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> What are you doing with the lady, huh?
Yeah, of your house.<eos> Can I use it?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> What are you doing with the lady, huh?<eos> You getting bi-curious, huh?
You getting bi-curious, huh?<eos> God!<eos> Where's the goddamn card?<eos> This just keeps getting weirder.<eos> Who are you working for?
I couldn't get that fucking cross into the ground.<eos> It's a lot tougher than it looks.<eos> Besides... hating a whole race of folks, now that's an awful lot of work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you don't hate anyone now?
It's a lot tougher than it looks.<eos> Besides... hating a whole race of folks, now that's an awful lot of work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you don't hate anyone now?<eos> So, who do you hate now?
So you don't hate anyone now?<eos> So, who do you hate now?<eos> Elitists!<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what them are, fancy man?
You own AAAAA Greetings.<eos> Mmm. And Paper Hearts.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, that belongs to my brother, Dilly.<eos> Well, Mr. Wentworth, they tell me that you were Card Writer of the Year in 2005, '06 and '07.
No, no, no.<eos> No, that belongs to my brother, Dilly.<eos> Well, Mr. Wentworth, they tell me that you were Card Writer of the Year in 2005, '06 and '07.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Also that you're divorced, you live alone, and you like to watch Bumfights.

Said there was only one ever better.<eos> Yeah, well, his wife is distraught.<eos> Mmm. Someone ought to send her a card.<eos> Fuck cards!<eos> Did you have him killed?
Mmm. Someone ought to send her a card.<eos> Fuck cards!<eos> Did you have him killed?<eos> That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.
That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?
I thought Styvesan worked for you.<eos> Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.
Well, my father used to say, "Fair is where you end up."<eos> Write the card, Raymond.<eos> Why me?<eos> I have a sixth sense about these things, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> You've been a fool for love before.
Write the card, Raymond.<eos> Why me?<eos> I have a sixth sense about these things, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> You've been a fool for love before.<eos> You've got the gene for it.
You've got the gene for it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.
I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I never believed in the first place, but you, you wake up every morning disappointed to find the world the way it is because you're a dreamer.
Give it to 'em.<eos> Get your reward.<eos> Don't worry, I will.<eos> Ray!<eos> Tell me you got something for me!
Yeah. The real one's right here.<eos> You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it! I didn't write it for you.<eos> I'm gonna give it to the person I wrote it for, and you can suck my dick, okay?
There.<eos> The children are gone.<eos> Now, let's us adults have some straight talk.<eos> Where's the card, Mr. Wentworth?<eos> You killed Taft.
Now, let's us adults have some straight talk.<eos> Where's the card, Mr. Wentworth?<eos> You killed Taft.<eos> Taft was writing a card for my competition.<eos> You mean your brother.
The blind luck of the firstborn. But not me, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> I had to fight and claw my way for everything.<eos> Now, where's the card?<eos> No.<eos> You get nothing.
No.<eos> You get nothing.<eos> Because of Taft?<eos> Come on, Raymond, he was your competition.<eos> Why did you have to kill him?
You get nothing.<eos> Because of Taft?<eos> Come on, Raymond, he was your competition.<eos> Why did you have to kill him?<eos> Tell me, sir... what do you know about holidays?
A woman goes through nine months of excruciating pregnancy, and tops it off with a small human awash in her own blood.<eos> And what did it take to have Christmas and Easter?<eos> Biggest holidays of them all, the top two.<eos> It took the greatest man who ever lived to be crucified.<eos> Do you understand, Mr. Wentworth?
The universe cries out for sacrifice, and I'm simply following the template.<eos> Ray.<eos> He's serious.<eos> That little girl, she's...<eos> You needed a muse.
You needed a muse.<eos> Now... when my junky nephew and Jill bore a child,<eos> Of course, I was foolish enough to let her stay in the child's life.<eos> It was a tangled web indeed, but now I intend to clear the situation up, once and for all.<eos> You can have it.

- No, no, no.<eos> - Well, stop bloody staring at him, then.<eos> Looks like he's been in the wars.<eos> Well, thank you for your considered medical opinion.<eos> Maybe, next time, I'll get the doctor to drive us and you to do the operation. - How about that?
Great.<eos> No, no, that... that can't be right.<eos> I paid 300 last month.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but our system is a hundred percent accurate.<eos> You've missed your payments, which total 600 pounds, so...
I paid 300 last month.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but our system is a hundred percent accurate.<eos> You've missed your payments, which total 600 pounds, so...<eos> Oh, oh, let's just all bow down to whatever your system says, shall we?<eos> Can you check it again for me?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but our system is a hundred percent accurate.<eos> You've missed your payments, which total 600 pounds, so...<eos> Oh, oh, let's just all bow down to whatever your system says, shall we?<eos> Can you check it again for me?<eos> Look, if you can pay the 600 now, then we can stop the added interest on the account, but until then, my hands are tied.
Can you check it again for me?<eos> Look, if you can pay the 600 now, then we can stop the added interest on the account, but until then, my hands are tied.<eos> Young man, I don't have 600 pounds.<eos> I don't have 300 pounds.<eos> You have my 300 pounds, but you've lost it.
Everyone's saying it's iBOY.<eos> Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's going on with you?<eos> It's just... this pain in my head...<eos> I just... I need the pieces...<eos> You've gotta find some way... I just...
Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's going on with you?<eos> It's just... this pain in my head...<eos> I just... I need the pieces...<eos> You've gotta find some way... I just...<eos> - You need to operate.
These fragments have moved a lot deeper into your brain tissue.<eos> - There's just no safe way that we can...<eos> - What if I pay you?<eos> Well, then I'd be in private practice, but I'm afraid I would still have to say no.<eos> You've got to help. Things haven't been the same since it's happened.
Online.<eos> - Rendezvous with the Atromitos should appear shortly.<eos> - We have a welcome message from Nordham sent the day we left.<eos> -Greetings from Earth.<eos> Where I am now years older, but you're feeling like not even a day has passed.
- Rendezvous with the Atromitos should appear shortly.<eos> - We have a welcome message from Nordham sent the day we left.<eos> -Greetings from Earth.<eos> Where I am now years older, but you're feeling like not even a day has passed.<eos> I have no doubt that you are going to be successful in recovering the cargo.
- Something's wrong.<eos> The Atromitos is drifted too close to Titan's atmosphere.<eos> - Duncan, close the gap, quickly.<eos> - Their hull is going to rupture.<eos> - Anderson, can you access the ship's mainframe?
-Increase kill thrusters.<eos> -The magnetic tow line is holding.<eos> Atromitos is lifting.<eos> We're in the clear.<eos> - Stop touching. You're confusing the bio signs.
- We're putting you in charge of getting information from O'Neill.<eos> -Why me?<eos> -You have a PhD in psychology.<eos> - Come on, that was just something I did to take my mind off my Cauchy Kowalevski-thesis.<eos> - Congratulations. You are still the more qualified than anyone else.
-You have a PhD in psychology.<eos> - Come on, that was just something I did to take my mind off my Cauchy Kowalevski-thesis.<eos> - Congratulations. You are still the more qualified than anyone else.<eos> - What about the ART?<eos> Have you accessed their memory banks?
Since we're gonna be here for a while can we not do something about these fucking weeds?<eos> - I recommend transferring O'Neill to the recreation room.<eos> There is only one way in or out of the room, but it is a larger space and doesn't feel like he's in prison.<eos> -That's fine.<eos> - I hope you had a good sleep.
- I recommend transferring O'Neill to the recreation room.<eos> There is only one way in or out of the room, but it is a larger space and doesn't feel like he's in prison.<eos> -That's fine.<eos> - I hope you had a good sleep.<eos> Have you been able to establish contact with the Atromitos?
- My father always said it was a waste of time to take a second PhD.<eos> In psychology, of all things.<eos> Now and, not in none of my years of study did we discuss the mental effects off deep space isolation following a traumatizing event.<eos> Whatever it was that happened, it must have been terrible.<eos> So many people that you knew, I'm sure you developed some good friendships.
Wouldn't deprivation work?<eos> By dangling a carrot, we can... withdrew it whenever we want.<eos> Giving us more psychological control.<eos> -Oxygen level's 21%, nitrogen, 78%.<eos> - Was that you?
- Negative.<eos> - This is Anderson. Can anyone hear me? - Linden here.<eos> What's going on.<eos> -Trying to fix it.<eos> Duncan, can you hear me?
- Only voice or hand-print recognition from one of us will open it.<eos> -He has taken the pulse rifle, though.<eos> - I'm headed to cargo bay Duncan, check the machine room.<eos> - Machine room is secure. I am in the cargo bay wing now.<eos> What do you want?
-He has taken the pulse rifle, though.<eos> - I'm headed to cargo bay Duncan, check the machine room.<eos> - Machine room is secure. I am in the cargo bay wing now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Do you want us to get off the ship?
- I'm headed to cargo bay Duncan, check the machine room.<eos> - Machine room is secure. I am in the cargo bay wing now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Do you want us to get off the ship?<eos> Do you have something you... want to tell me?
- I have this handled.<eos> - O'Neill, our kind treatment is by virtue of our good disposition.<eos> Make no mistake, though. Our patience is not limitless.<eos> Go on, pull the trigger.<eos> - What are you doing?
-Can you turn it off?<eos> - O'Neill is more lucid than he's been letting on.<eos> - What were you doing in there?<eos> - What were you doing in there?<eos> You knew he could harm you.
You knew he could harm you.<eos> - I was trying to get him to talk.<eos> And he almost did.<eos> - I feel like we're being played.<eos> - You wanted me to handle this.
I repeat: everything else is secondary.<eos> Thank you and good luck.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - In the cargo bay, I asked if you wanted to tell me something.
Thank you and good luck.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - In the cargo bay, I asked if you wanted to tell me something.<eos> You almost answered.
Artists do what they do for different reasons.<eos> But most will tell you that they create in order to reveal something about themselves.<eos> About the world, that they observe, or both.<eos> In your paintings, I see serenity on one side, and chaos on another.<eos> The question is not why you made these creations but for whom.
The question is not why you made these creations but for whom.<eos> -Recreation Room, camera A.<eos> - What's wrong, Orson?<eos> - I forgot why I came here. - Forgot?<eos> When was the last time you forgot anything?
- I forgot why I came here. - Forgot?<eos> When was the last time you forgot anything?<eos> - The irony is I don't even remember the last time I forgot something.<eos> -You know Mandarin, right?<eos> What do you make of this?
- The irony is I don't even remember the last time I forgot something.<eos> -You know Mandarin, right?<eos> What do you make of this?<eos> -Unable. Belief. Near.<eos> It's... it's gargled, but where'd you get it?
See what you can make out of it, okay?<eos> What did O'Neill say to you?<eos> - He said that while we are not able to always be close to each other in his mind we are together every moment.<eos> - You have used your time to learn some Mandarin.<eos> You think that because Lulu was built in China that you are communicating in her native tongue?
You think that because Lulu was built in China that you are communicating in her native tongue?<eos> You are aware that Lulu has no language preference? She's a machine.<eos> Something finally got to you.<eos> We treat all living things with humanity and respect, but to us Lulu is hardware.<eos> Bearing that in mind, maybe you can figure out a way to talk to me.
-Yeah, thanks.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - Yeah, I think I can manage now.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - What do you mean?
- I don't know. A couple of hours, a day.<eos> Whenever he wakes up.<eos> Did I say "when he wakes up?"<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know what we were thinking.<eos> Because you weren't thinking.
I'm sorry, I don't know what we were thinking.<eos> Because you weren't thinking.<eos> Zimmer assured me he would have all the bugs out of the system by the end of the day.<eos> But apparently his mind was focused on primal indulges also.<eos> - You think this is my fault?
- As am I, but I think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - This mission will not be compromised by delinquent behavioral issues.<eos> We need answers.<eos> -Hey, Orson.<eos> - Have you ever known an ART to lie before?
"the obvious is the predestination and inevitability of his every action."<eos> - So when is the right time to contemplate the meaning of our existence?<eos> - I have never heard of an invalid who randomly recites Tolstoy.<eos> In Russian, no less.<eos> So that either makes you the most unique case study in human history - or this whole psychologically traumatized thing is a charade.
I'm betting the latter.<eos> - You have to promise that what I say now will stay between us.<eos> - Finally, a language I understand.<eos> - And to our upcoming discussion out without a hint of irritation.<eos> -What are you saying?
Everything else is secondary.<eos> I repeat, everything else is secondary. - This is exactly the same thing he said before.<eos> - It's a recording.<eos> I'm getting the same message every two hours.<eos> - You've sent our previous messages, right?
- Yes! - Well, send them again, without encryption.<eos> Someone has to respond.<eos> Honestly, what is wrong with you?<eos> - I don't know, I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> - You have never behaved this irrationally before.
- We've gotta get the cargo out of here, now!<eos> We'll destroy anyone that tries to stop us.<eos> -Operations are fully online.<eos> -Do not get too excited about it.<eos> What have you found?
-The crew did not randomly go crazy.<eos> There was a dispute about the cargo that led to war in factions.<eos> Over profits, no doubt.<eos> I don't think that the cargo is what we've been told.<eos> - And you?

- If it wasn't for people like him we wouldn't even be here.<eos> - If it wasn't for people like him, we might not exist at all.<eos> -Focus on what we came here for.<eos> -Clever messages.<eos> I suppose it would have been too much trouble for you to come out and tell us these things?
The name of your ship Teleios in Greek means "perfect",<eos> -Yes, it does.<eos> - Named after its crew of flawless humans.<eos> We don't name our ship.<eos> Don't suppose you protested the name, either.
We don't name our ship.<eos> Don't suppose you protested the name, either.<eos> - You've made your point about language acumen.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> -Maybe you missed the Tolstoy quote.
Which is no different that what he's told us so far.<eos> He's told us a great deal.<eos> -Do it.<eos> - Does anyone care what I think?<eos> - What do you think, Duncan?
-Do it.<eos> - Does anyone care what I think?<eos> - What do you think, Duncan?<eos> -No permanent damage.<eos> I see you've taken advantage of Zimmer fixing voice control.
- I didn't tell you you could get up.<eos> The AH-320s have most of their vital functions well protected.<eos> Except, there is a soft spot, right... here.<eos> But you already knew that, right?<eos> Because you have been doing some changing up here.
-See?<eos> That wasn't so hard.<eos> -It shouldn't have come to this.<eos> -What does a compound do?<eos> - I have already told you all you need to know.
That wasn't so hard.<eos> -It shouldn't have come to this.<eos> -What does a compound do?<eos> - I have already told you all you need to know.<eos> - You've seen how that hardly works.
There's a set of tools in the cargo bay.<eos> - Zimmer, report to the bridge.<eos> Zimmer, report!<eos> -Goddammit, open the door.<eos> What are you doing?
- Zimmer, report to the bridge.<eos> Zimmer, report!<eos> -Goddammit, open the door.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?
- Can we get dimensions?<eos> I want to make sure this is not another game.<eos> - I don't think he'd be screwing around after what he's been through.<eos> -We only have a short window.<eos> - Zimmer, you are coming with me on the landing pod to Titan.
The liquor was flowing.<eos> -He is choking.<eos> - The compound that we got from Titan, the wonderful compound that was supposed to fix the atmosphere, one microscopic bit on someone's glove got through quarantine and into the water supply.<eos> One spore made all our water lethal.<eos> What do you expect a batch of this could do with the water supply on Earth'?
Two sides emerged.<eos> I remained silent. Those who tried to stop the compound from returning to Earth - were slaughtered by those who couldn't unleash themselves from the masters of their paycheck.<eos> We hate the villain, but we still respect them.<eos> There's no respect for cowards.<eos> - Yet you were the only one to survive. How?
They already had the cure.<eos> What they needed was the disease.<eos> These were the same jackasses who designed all you awesome, perfect GC humans.<eos> -Incoming transmission.<eos> - This will probably the last time you hear from me.

-Incoming transmission.<eos> - This will probably the last time you hear from me.<eos> By now you may be experiencing feeling, emotions things you have never known before.<eos> Fear, anxiety, anger... forgetfulness.<eos> Things you never really supposed to have.
GCs have never known emotions so they don't know how to control them.<eos> And so the downfall is fast.<eos> The earth is burning.<eos> Regular humans are being hunted down and harvested for their blood to keep GCs temporarily stable.<eos> Before long... you will all be irreversibly losing your minds.
- Assuming all goes well -16 hours.<eos> - O'Neill is a murderer.<eos> - Faulty DNA or not, I am still the first officer.<eos> We wait!<eos> -Whatever you say.
- We'll continue to degenerate.<eos> The longer you wait, the worse it is gonna be for all of us.<eos> - Meditate, run on a treadmill, masturbate, I don't give a shit. Just keep it together.<eos> -You 're out of your mind.<eos> Are you just going to stand there for 16 hours?
How are we supposed to believe anything Glen Crest is telling us?<eos> - We will complete this mission, Zimmer.<eos> There's no option. No possible recourse but success.<eos> -Define success.<eos> - I know you think I'm a monster, but I have no hidden agenda.
- Zimmer's judgment's been clouded by a vagina.<eos> Better than clouded by sadism.<eos> Either O'Neill dies or we go insane and we die.<eos> It's one versus five. It's simple math.<eos> - You're not allowed to abstain, Duncan.
- Am I going to die? - Yes.<eos> - At least please tell me why.<eos> - There was a code programmed to our DNA that's mutating.<eos> Your blood is the last chance we have for survival.<eos> So you're just human, after all.
- Don't trust him like that. I don't trust Orson.<eos> Even if he's psychologically deranged, that would be suicidal.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> - Draw your own conclusions.<eos> - What did you see?
- Clearly, it is possible, idiot.<eos> - We don't have time to argue.<eos> - Turn rifles to maximum.<eos> So we won't have any effect against Lulu's surge protector.<eos> You two guard the hallway.
Your fighting bot or your mechanical mistress?<eos> I'll admit even I underestimated the depth of your depravity.<eos> - I gave her the fighting chip and she is not my mistress.<eos> -Excuse me. fuck toy.<eos> - Are you ready?
- I didn't alter her physically.<eos> -You expect me to believe that?<eos> It doesn't matter now, does it? - No.<eos> - Sometimes terrible mistakes can only be made right by equally terrible choices.<eos> - What are you talking about?
My IQ was on par, but my uneven disposition put me in the failure column.<eos> I was extremely emotional, written off as a lost cause.<eos> I learned to control my "undesirable" behavior.<eos> That's why the DNA mutation hasn't affected me as much as the others.<eos> -What made you decide not to kill me?

- You said you didn't alter Lulu physically.<eos> - I don't know if she can be reprogrammed.<eos> - She gave herself sexual characteristics. Why?<eos> -So we could get closer.<eos> - She lied when I asked her what you had said to her. Did you program her to lie?
- I'm staying.<eos> When I was young, I nearly killed someone in rage.<eos> They hadn't even done anything wrong, I just...<eos> I just couldn't control my temper.<eos> I may seem fine now, but you're not safe with me.
Tell your story.<eos> Tell everybody what happened here.<eos> - Tell who?<eos> What kind of place am I going back to?<eos> -Do what you do best.
USA!<eos> USA!<eos> USA! USA!<eos> Wolverine.<eos> I knew it was you. - Oh, fuck.
Wolverine.<eos> I knew it was you. - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Please!<eos> I'm in trouble!<eos> You're the only one that could help!
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.<eos> I know I said June, but I need the boat now.<eos> Why would that mean the price go up?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know you wanted 70...
The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!<eos> Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!<eos> And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?
Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!<eos> And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.
Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> You're the man who puts me to sleep.<eos> We both could use some sleep. No! No!<eos> What are you doing to me?
Charles.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> What are these?<eos> You remember what they are.
What are these?<eos> You remember what they are.<eos> The shots mellow the seizures.<eos> The pills keep them from happening.<eos> How about you blow on them to make them safe?
The shots mellow the seizures.<eos> The pills keep them from happening.<eos> How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.
There are forces trying to kill them.<eos> - Forces?<eos> - They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles, a long time.<eos> There are no new mutants.<eos> Understand?<eos> Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere.<eos> You always thought... we were part of God's plan.
We need to get out of here.<eos> Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?
Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!<eos> The people after you, they're on my ass now!
Here, take this.<eos> It's $20,000.<eos> Here.<eos> Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.
You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.<eos> They will be waiting.<eos> They will give you anything.<eos> Where did you get this?
My boyfriend.<eos> He wants to kill me and take her.<eos> And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside. I know you want to help us.
He wants to kill me and take her.<eos> And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside. I know you want to help us.<eos> You don't know anything about me.
- We have to be there Friday.<eos> - Or what?<eos> Or we miss our chance to cross.<eos> Please.<eos> You have to. Please.
- We're communicating.<eos> Communicating.<eos> Take these now.<eos> We have to get out of here. It's not safe here anymore.<eos> And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?
Laura!<eos> Honey, you wanna stay where you are.<eos> You wanna see your friends, right?<eos> Command, stop.<eos> You said alive or dead.
You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.<eos> I believe you're thinking of someone else.
Last ride.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Stop it.<eos> For God's sake, I can do this myself!<eos> Yeah, well, you're not doing it. Just get on with it.
These, too.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Not okay!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, do you sell phone chargers? Uh...
A soldier who will not fight is useless.<eos> Inside this building, they are working on something new.<eos> Something they think is better than the children.<eos> Something they say is without a soul.<eos> Would you like to hear my full lab report, Dr. Rice?
We are going to save as many children as we can.<eos> I read about a place, up north.<eos> A place for mutants.<eos> They call it Eden.<eos> If you are watching this, it means that I am dead.
There is no more money.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her. But she is your child.
Shit.<eos> Knock yourselves out.<eos> I'll tell you what. Eight grand...<eos> I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires... mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.<eos> I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget the paperwork.
Knock yourselves out.<eos> I'll tell you what. Eight grand...<eos> I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires... mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.<eos> I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget the paperwork.<eos> Well, you still need new tires, man, they're bald.
Knock it off.<eos> I said, knock it off!<eos> She's a child, Logan.<eos> And, point of fact, she's your...<eos> How long has it been since you took your meds?
How long has it been since you took your meds?<eos> Tell me, how long has it been?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Two days.<eos> You saw what happened yesterday.
Two days.<eos> You saw what happened yesterday.<eos> If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.
You saw what happened yesterday.<eos> If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!
Language, Logan.<eos> And you're screaming at a machine.<eos> Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet, she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?<eos> She can learn to be better.<eos> You mean, better than me?
We should help them.<eos> No, we have to keep going.<eos> Someone will come along.<eos> Someone has come along.<eos> Hey, uh, you need a hand?
We don't live far from here.<eos> - Uh, no, thanks.<eos> - That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.
- Uh, no, thanks.<eos> - That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
- That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.<eos> He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
Be nice.<eos> Now, you know we got company.<eos> That's wonderful. Everybody, have a seat.<eos> Nate, sit up.<eos> James, why don't you sit at the end of the table?
Thank you.<eos> This is delicious.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - It's so good.<eos> Where are you all headed?
And live off what?<eos> The Lord will provide.<eos> I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher.<eos> All the same, I'd love to travel someday.<eos> And I bet you will.
I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.<eos> Uh, it was great.<eos> But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?<eos> Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.<eos> The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.<eos> We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
It's great. Logan.<eos> Logan!<eos> You still have time.<eos> Charles, the world is not the same as it was.<eos> We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.
We won't need it.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?
Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?<eos> Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right?
Looks that way.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> A friend with a big mouth.<eos> I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.
A friend with a big mouth.<eos> I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> Then you know the drill.
- I have a lawyer now.<eos> Two.<eos> - Three. - Ah.<eos> You all right, boss?<eos> You know the drill.
Get the hell out of here.<eos> - You okay, boss?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Go!<eos> You've had training.
So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.<eos> Logan...<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!
There's so few of you left.<eos> Nice to meet you, too, Doc.<eos> But I really got to get on my way.<eos> No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.
No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine. - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine. - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.
I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.<eos> Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.
I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.<eos> Maybe I can run some tests.<eos> Look, Doc.<eos> You seem like a nice guy, all right?
Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.<eos> Maybe I can run some tests.<eos> Look, Doc.<eos> You seem like a nice guy, all right?<eos> You wanna save a life, save your own.
I'll take you there.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Let's go to fucking fantasyland.<eos> We understand the importance of containment, Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can't leave a war zone behind like you did in Juárez.
Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all little killing machines.<eos> Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.<eos> Not all.<eos> I was told you want these assets off-board, dead or alive.<eos> Are you changing my brief?
And you see that pass?<eos> That's the border.<eos> That's where we will be safe.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Laura told me all that you did for her.
That's the border.<eos> That's where we will be safe.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Laura told me all that you did for her.<eos> She was lucky to have you.
Waste this dick, Logan!<eos> Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.<eos> You will not survive further wounds.
I'm sorry, I don't know why I was resisting that.<eos> - Yeah, so it's a new machine.<eos> - No shit.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.
It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.<eos> Right, so you got your drink selections down here. And flavors, you got hazelnut...
That's basically the same thing.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - So I just pick "Americano", right?<eos> And then you can go medium, light, dark.<eos> You look like...
- Whatever.<eos> - So I just pick "Americano", right?<eos> And then you can go medium, light, dark.<eos> You look like...<eos> Or not look like, you would want...
And then you can go medium, light, dark.<eos> You look like...<eos> Or not look like, you would want...<eos> I'll go with medium.<eos> And then you hit "brew."
Oh, I've literally never seen that before.<eos> - Oh, yeah. You want more?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Why did you open the door?
One more step and you'd have been covered in paint.<eos> They've been putting 'em all over the place.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> It's like a trip wire and...<eos> Oh, my God. You just saved me, man.
Holy crap.<eos> It's like a trip wire and...<eos> Oh, my God. You just saved me, man.<eos> Why aren't they this ambitious with their classwork, huh?<eos> All right. You know what?
I'm this close to going up there and going postal on the whole goddamn administration.<eos> This close.<eos> Yikes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you know what? Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.
Yeah, I mean if you wanna...<eos> You're gonna have to take the manual out, because I think...<eos> All right, I'm gonna start from the beginning.<eos> First I'm gonna power on the...<eos> - Was that you?
No, I didn't push the button.<eos> - That was you.<eos> - No, that wasn't me.<eos> I'm not pushing the button yet.<eos> Are you sure you're not hitting it by accident, or...
Maybe I'll just power on the...<eos> - Farewell, you bastard.<eos> - A-ha!<eos> I think I see what's going on here.<eos> Mr. Strickland, you are the victim of a senior prank.
Who did it?<eos> It was you!<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Give me that phone!<eos> I don't have one. You just broke mine, remember?
And I got a goddamn mariachi band following me around wherever I go!<eos> I offered them $100 and they still won't leave.<eos> I think they thought it was a tip.<eos> And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?
Yeah.<eos> How about you, Strickland? Huh?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Like I said before, Tyler, I was too busy working out that piece of shit VCR that this school is still using.<eos> I know you teachers all like to stick together. I get it.
I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it.
Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...
He did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...<eos> He did it.<eos> That's what happened, was you...
I mean, you did do it, so...<eos> He did it.<eos> That's what happened, was you...<eos> 'Cause he, you know, chopped the desk.<eos> Which you probably shouldn't have done.
That's what happened, was you...<eos> 'Cause he, you know, chopped the desk.<eos> Which you probably shouldn't have done.<eos> Did you mean to do it?<eos> Was it an accident? Or did you wanna say it was an accident?
'Cause he, you know, chopped the desk.<eos> Which you probably shouldn't have done.<eos> Did you mean to do it?<eos> Was it an accident? Or did you wanna say it was an accident?<eos> You know what it was?
The technology is outdated on the VCRs. That was a great point. Yeah.<eos> And the kids were pushing him with the pranks.<eos> They're out of control this year, sir.<eos> I've never seen anything like it, really.<eos> You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.
You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.<eos> And maybe just, you know... Don't fire him.<eos> I am so sorry he fired you.<eos> That's such a shitty situation he put us in.<eos> And, you know, I feel somewhat responsible, you know.
I am so sorry he fired you.<eos> That's such a shitty situation he put us in.<eos> And, you know, I feel somewhat responsible, you know.<eos> I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.
E.E. Cummings said that.<eos> And words are gonna matter for you guys.<eos> Uh, um...<eos> Yes, Nathaniel.<eos> Is it true you're gonna fight Mr. Strickland?
Yeah.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Well, because this is all your fault.<eos> How?<eos> You're the one who tattled.
It's not the same exact situation, Neil, because you don't have a wife and kids, so you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> Listen... I...<eos> Come on, man, you gotta help me out here.<eos> Look, this has been a huge day for me, Mr. Campbell.<eos> Do you know how many hits we've got on the newspaper website?
Hey.<eos> Back so soon?<eos> - Yeah, I'm gonna need another one.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, and do you mind spreading this one around a little bit?
- Yeah, I'm gonna need another one.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, and do you mind spreading this one around a little bit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, man, did you hear about this teacher fight?
You know this completely contradicts your statement, right, Campbell?<eos> Look, we can get caught up in the whole statement game.<eos> Who said what and what they meant by what they said, and what words mean when people say them, and, you know, who's making a statement and what the statement means, and whose statement has something to do with something that someone else says.<eos> And, see, statements get...<eos> You know? And then...

And, see, statements get...<eos> You know? And then...<eos> You said he chopped it with a fucking ax.<eos> Yeah, I know I said the chopping thing, didn't I?<eos> Yeah. But you know what? I was looking at the AV system, and I heard the crash and, you know, I did...

I was looking at the AV system, and I heard the crash and, you know, I did...<eos> You know how when you do one of these and you're like, "Oh, my God."
I'll tell him he can keep his job for now.<eos> Oh!<eos> Sir, thank you so much. That is fantastic news.<eos> I wouldn't get too happy, Campbell.<eos> Because you're still under review, and you put me through a lot of shit today.
I am a teacher.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's actually another teacher who's gonna beat me up after school,<eos> - so that's why I'm calling.<eos> - I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just told me?
Okay. My name is Andrew Campbell. I'm a teacher at Roosevelt High School.<eos> There's another teacher here who wants to have a fist fight with me after school. So, I need help.<eos> Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...
There's another teacher here who wants to have a fist fight with me after school. So, I need help.<eos> Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...<eos> You're a grown man. Now go on and take that ass-whoopin'.
Be a good boy.<eos> Sell me some drugs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just relax.<eos> What do you want?
Then why are you asking me what do I want, Neil?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, Neil.<eos> Sell me an eighth of Molly or whatever it is.<eos> Do you even know what molly is?
It's my goddamn car!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Fuck me.<eos> God damn!<eos> Why are you kicking it?
- Yeah. Fucking animals.<eos> - Fucking animals.<eos> - Yeah, little... Little... Little animals!<eos> Right.<eos> Listen. Since I ran into you,
Right.<eos> Listen. Since I ran into you,<eos> I have to tell you, we moved your interview back to 2:15.<eos> I actually have to go to my daughter's elementary school to do a talent show dance thing with her by 2:30.<eos> So you want me to accommodate the fact that you're gonna skip out of campus in the middle of the fucking day.
So you want me to accommodate the fact that you're gonna skip out of campus in the middle of the fucking day.<eos> Good point. Sorry, sir. Yeah.<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> Good.<eos> And could you take your foot off my car?
Okay, guys.<eos> What seems to be the trouble here?<eos> Strickland was smoking marijuana.<eos> And he has molly in his bag.<eos> And who are you?
That's great!<eos> You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Sorry, sir. That nod was not for you.
You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Sorry, sir. That nod was not for you.<eos> You can sit back down.
- Yeah, no. Go back.<eos> - Anymore?<eos> At all! Yeah, no.<eos> Guys, there's no fights today.<eos> Didn't you hear?
The fight is back on.<eos> Come on, man. You might have done the same thing in my position.<eos> This time I'm gonna kill your ass.<eos> Just take it easy. Take a deep breath, okay?<eos> Hey! You two.
Come on, man. You might have done the same thing in my position.<eos> This time I'm gonna kill your ass.<eos> Just take it easy. Take a deep breath, okay?<eos> Hey! You two.<eos> The molly you tried to pin on each other is aspirin.
Oh!<eos> Uh, uh...<eos> Superintendent Johnson and I were just talking about his fishing trip to Alaska.<eos> I caught a halibut.<eos> You... You caught a halibut.
I caught a halibut.<eos> You... You caught a halibut.<eos> Well, congratulations, sir.<eos> I... I'm sitting out there and missing my daughter's...<eos> You know what? I don't wanna cause trouble. Could I just make my teacher's statement now?
We're done here.<eos> Anyway, it's an executive course right by the airport, right?<eos> Okay, thanks for the job, I guess.<eos> Step tight. Pop!<eos> You know.
Anyway, it's an executive course right by the airport, right?<eos> Okay, thanks for the job, I guess.<eos> Step tight. Pop!<eos> You know.<eos> I'm sorry though. What cuts are you gonna make?
You know.<eos> I'm sorry though. What cuts are you gonna make?<eos> It's none of your business, Campbell.<eos> Well, no, it is my business, right?<eos> I... I teach at the school. So, what are you gonna do?
I'm sorry though. What cuts are you gonna make?<eos> It's none of your business, Campbell.<eos> Well, no, it is my business, right?<eos> I... I teach at the school. So, what are you gonna do?<eos> I mean, you gonna cut buying new books or are you gonna shorten the school year?
All right?<eos> I think, in fact, I'm tired of always saying I'm sorry.<eos> I asked you guys a direct fucking question.<eos> What cutbacks are you gonna make?<eos> Campbell, this doesn't concern you, okay?
I think, in fact, I'm tired of always saying I'm sorry.<eos> I asked you guys a direct fucking question.<eos> What cutbacks are you gonna make?<eos> Campbell, this doesn't concern you, okay?<eos> You're just a teacher.
Wow!<eos> Really? I'm just a teacher?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!
I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.
In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.<eos> And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.<eos> And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school. So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip, I will walk right in here and I'll punch you right in the fucking teeth, Tyler.
Who's the loser now, Trisha?<eos> Bully this, bitch!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> I was unaware of the lyrics and... And the strong language in that song, so I do apologize.<eos> But you know what?
What the hell, man?<eos> You're just gonna walk away?<eos> Just gonna leave like this?<eos> On these terms?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
You're just gonna walk away?<eos> Just gonna leave like this?<eos> On these terms?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Who are you? I...
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.<eos> You here to fire everybody again?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that I don't want you here. But why are you here?
You here to fire everybody again?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.<eos> I don't wanna be here any more than you want me to, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that I don't want you here. But why are you here?<eos> Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.
Shoot.<eos> So, this is a tough one for me, you know? 'Cause I didn't leave on great terms and...<eos> Boy, it sucks when your job's in someone else's hands like this.<eos> Enough of your shit, okay?<eos> Are you gonna come back or not?
I'm a weirdo.<eos> You know my style.<eos> Yeah. I'm stressed out, too.<eos> My neighbor got a cat.<eos> - Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
Yeah!<eos> But boo-fucking-hoo!<eos> I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm. So what do you teach here?
We can make war or make babies<eos> That's not technically a song. That's kinda like a rap.<eos> It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there
It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did! It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there<eos> - moving.<eos> - Because you make me nervous.
A goat is a lion's prey, not business<eos> Well, no business is small.<eos> And no faith is greater than any business.<eos> My mother taught me.<eos> My loss is great, and I have little time to compensate I have a right to their blessings lf you agree, we'll take it and leave.
Hey, gymnast!<eos> Excuse me. Who invited you here?<eos> - Excuse me...<eos> - Beat the drum!<eos> Whose guest are you?

Fix a meeting with Pasha. I'll talk to him.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Sorry, sir. Bobby was having breakfast.<eos> Let him go I can't.<eos> Who are you talking about?
Always!<eos> Devji.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir.<eos> - Will you do me a favour? - Tell me, sir.

Majmudar has tasted blood lt was Jairaj's stuff, soon it will be ours.<eos> Don't take him lightly.<eos> A huge consignment is due.<eos> Inspector Majmudar wants to see Raees.<eos> You look different in the picture, sir
Bhai, the police picked up Four-eyes in a murder case.<eos> - Some Salim Shooter ls Raja with you?<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> Sir.<eos> You'll have to release Raees.
O Laila.<eos> They call you Laila.<eos> That's you! Laila. You are everyone's dream date.<eos> Sir, this is the beginning of Organised crime lf Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?

You are everyone's dream date.<eos> Sir, this is the beginning of Organised crime lf Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!
Sir, this is the beginning of Organised crime lf Raees isn't stopped now, he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.<eos> After this terrible incident under your jurisdiction, are you teaching me?<eos> Now you give me in writing why I shouldn't be transferring you!<eos> You can transfer me anywhere I won't spare Raees.<eos> You can take that in writing!
Why don't you express it, too?<eos> Please do.<eos> You are going to kill me some day,<eos> Your defence indeed is deadly.<eos> You are the beginning. You are the end. The story of my love is all about you.
Jai Hind, sir!<eos> Sir, sweets from Surat.<eos> It's your favourite, isn't it?<eos> What's up, Ramlal? You're taking good care of me.<eos> - Do you want leave?
For a Hindu father, you give your son a Muslim name. Secularist, eh!<eos> Not I, sir.<eos> Raees has become a father.<eos> He has sent you an invite.<eos> - Make sure you reply to him. - Sir.
The mill shut down.<eos> The owner even refused compensation.<eos> He's gone!<eos> 'So what if five laborer's die? '<eos> 'You will employ twenty-five more' 'to fill your coffers' - Bhimani Seth.
You helped us get our money and saved our families.<eos> This is the least we could do for Faizan.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Jai Hind, sir.<eos> Why are you moving the vehicle from the crime scene?
- Get Damla. - Sir<eos> Jai Hind, sir.<eos> - Sir, Damla Seth can't come. - Why not?<eos> He's away in Fatehpura.<eos> - You may go. - Sir.
- There's ice-cream for everyone, guys. - Okay, sir.<eos> Raees, he is Mr Hasmukh.<eos> He is into construction.<eos> He executes all the government projects I wanted you to meet him.<eos> You know Damla Seth.
He executes all the government projects I wanted you to meet him.<eos> You know Damla Seth.<eos> - Aasiya, this is the CM. - Hello.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> You drink like a fish here, and in the parliament, you take to sloganeering 'Ban liquor, save Gujarat'
The CM has bought a property near Maninagar.<eos> - He has assigned me to construct a building.<eos> - Great.<eos> But the hitch is, it's occupied.<eos> Encroachers, you know.
Encroachers, you know.<eos> And... he wants your company to get the place vacated. Can it be done?<eos> Surely, if it's the CM's wish I'll take 30 percent.<eos> Deal, Raees.<eos> You are right, sir.
Deal, Raees.<eos> You are right, sir.<eos> Damla is here with Raees.<eos> The Chief Minister and Pashabhai are also here.<eos> You quit the city but you haven't forgotten Raees.
He is a constant pain in my neck.<eos> He's a police officer, not a pawn I can play around with.<eos> He arrested Damla.<eos> Majmudar has started a fire in Kutch.<eos> The fames could torch me and eventually reach you.
Order hundred, sir.<eos> involuntarily, Raees pulled me closer to him. From this spot, I could hear his very heartbeat.<eos> From this point to that,<eos> Twenty acres of land has been transferred to you.<eos> You have made a huge investment.
- Did you send for me, sir? - Yes, Popat.<eos> Hot news.<eos> Before it cools down, break it to the press.<eos> 'Raees issues an open threat' 'lf Pasha takes out a procession, it will be his final journey'<eos> You torched his castle, and he has no idea what hit him!
All your hands are tied.<eos> That's why I came here to reason with you.<eos> Make sure you don't give me an opportunity.<eos> Never. I never gave you one.<eos> Hang on, SP lf you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you I'll book a place for you in my world.
In Uttar Pradesh, rioters targeted a train carrying passengers returning from Hajj.<eos> Several people are being reported killed.<eos> The incident has provoked communal riots in many parts of the country.<eos> Police have imposed indefinite curfew in several districts l don't want riots in my city.<eos> You will handle Zone 1, Shambu.
There are no eyewitnesses to place Raees on the port, sir.<eos> Damla shot himself, while Nawab is absconding.<eos> - We can never prove it in court.<eos> - Let the court do its job, Majmudar.<eos> You go and arrest him.
He's a master at destroying evidence.<eos> Last time he was jailed, he came out a politician.<eos> God knows what he'll try this time.<eos> Even I want Raees, sir.<eos> To maintain peace, war is a must this time, sir i can't give what you seek in writing, Majmudar.
Come, Bhaijaan.<eos> Who called?<eos> It was Raees, right?<eos> Why did you call him here, Sadiq?<eos> What are you going to do with Raees?
Enough of the adoration! Let's go.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Take him away.<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?<eos> Would you have spared my people if I didn't?
- Take him away.<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?<eos> Would you have spared my people if I didn't?<eos> I had to return to save my flesh and blood.<eos> But what you are about to do, Mr Majmudar...!
What happened?<eos> You don't trust the system anymore?<eos> Or, yourself?<eos> Both, perhaps.<eos> Can you live with my blood on your hands, Mr Majmudar?
Amen<eos> In trying to save my people, I've burned down the entire city!<eos> I'm not sure if I was right or wrong then.<eos> But Raees' words ring in my ears even today.<eos> Can you live with my blood on your hands, Mr Majmudar?
- _ - My brother is a murderer.<eos> No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research. I'm not a hero.<eos> I'm a high-functioning sociopath.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.<eos> You know what happened to the other one.
'Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me? Did you miss me?<eos> ' I've only been gone four minutes.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.<eos> What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death! And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...<eos> Are those ginger nuts?<eos> - Oh, God...<eos> - Love ginger nuts.<eos> Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.<eos> Utterly.<eos> No need for stimulants now, remember?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You're high as a kite!
Natural high, I assure you. Totally natural.<eos> I'm just... ♪ ..glad to be alive!<eos> What shall we do next?<eos> What's your name? Vivian.<eos> - What would you do, Vivian?
Who is supposed to have shot him, then?<eos> Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.<eos> - That's not what happened at all.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.<eos> If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.<eos> That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.<eos> No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.<eos> You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you<eos> - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.
I told you<eos> - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.<eos> Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- Wait. Wait?<eos> !<eos> Of course wait. I'm the target - targets wait.<eos> Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up, I'll know when it begins. I always know when the game is on.<eos> Do you know why?
Rosie for short.<eos> Didn't you get John's text?<eos> No. I delete his texts.<eos> I delete any text that begins "Hi."<eos> No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
I delete any text that begins "Hi."<eos> No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Phone!<eos> And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.<eos> All right, good girl, good girl.<eos> Good girl.<eos> I'd better finish this, hadn't I?<eos> - Hey. - Afternoon. He says you've got a good one, Greg?
- The son who was in Tibet.<eos> DNA all checks out.<eos> Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.<eos> - Have you got a lab report?
What?<eos> The body in the car, dead for a week.<eos> Oh, this is a good one.<eos> Is it my birthday?<eos> You want help?
- Yes, please.<eos> OK. - One condition.<eos> Take all the credit.<eos> It gets boring if I just solve them all.<eos> Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway. He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!<eos> Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.<eos> - Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.<eos> - Definitely a sore spot.<eos> So you take all the glory, thanks...
- Definitely a sore spot.<eos> So you take all the glory, thanks...<eos> - OK!<eos> - ...thanks all the same.<eos> Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?
- OK!<eos> - ...thanks all the same.<eos> Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?<eos> It's driving me nuts.<eos> Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Greg. What?<eos> Greg.<eos> It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened? John, you amaze me.
Greg. What?<eos> Greg.<eos> It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened? John, you amaze me.<eos> You know what happened?<eos> Not a clue. It's just you normally say that at this point. Hmm.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood?<eos> - Oh, good, great. Yeah, amazing.<eos> - Getting any sleep?<eos> - Christ, no.<eos> You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- I think he needs winding.<eos> You know, I think that really might be it.<eos> No, don't get it.<eos> Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah?<eos> - You know me. - 'Hey, hello.'
Well, I believe that I can.<eos> But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes. I...<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Mr Holmes?<eos> Sorry, you were saying?
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?<eos> - Well, yes.<eos> - And the porch where it was smashed, I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,<eos> - so I assume it's permanently lit.<eos> - How did you notice that?
- Exactly. - Why?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Wouldn't be fun if I knew.<eos> Mr Holmes, please!<eos> It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
Could you take a photo and send it?<eos> There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.<eos> One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy. Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?
- Oh, my God!<eos> - Surprise!<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.<eos> You said he'd felt unwell?
Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it?<eos> What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?<eos> I can't stand it, never can.<eos> There's a loose thread in the world.<eos> It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
How did she die?<eos> - Hypothermia.<eos> What?<eos> I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...<eos> Will you two please keep it down?
What?<eos> I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...<eos> Will you two please keep it down?<eos> ! - Sorry. - Sorry.<eos> Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished. Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter.<eos> Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.<eos> How the hell...?<eos> Ah... e-cigarettes.<eos> Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.<eos> If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things. But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.

Yeah? It's been there since nine this morning.<eos> - Has it? Where were you?<eos> - Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.<eos> What about my girlfriend? - What? - You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
What about my girlfriend? - What? - You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.<eos> It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.<eos> But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.<eos> If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.

I thought you'd done something clever.

- Oh, I think you'll like it.<eos> That is the bust, isn't it? The one that was broken.<eos> No, it's another one, different owner.<eos> Different part of town.<eos> You were right, this is a thing. Something's going on.
No, it's another one, different owner.<eos> Different part of town.<eos> You were right, this is a thing. Something's going on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.
- To see Toby.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> - Right, are you coming?
Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> - Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> - Who told you?
- Have a good time.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - She's not the one.<eos> Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.<eos> Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Well, you're about to solve a big one.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.<eos> And you need to get to bed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?<eos> You were on the run. Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
And you need to get to bed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?<eos> You were on the run. Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.<eos> You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.

You're out of time.<eos> - Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> - Who? I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.<eos> You think you understand.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> - Who? I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.<eos> You think you understand.<eos> You understand nothing.
The problems of your future are my privilege.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She...<eos> She destroyed it. She?<eos> You know her!
She...<eos> She destroyed it. She?<eos> You know her!<eos> You do, don't you?<eos> You know the bitch? !
Betrayed us all.<eos> Mary.<eos> This is about Mary?<eos> Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?<eos> - 'Armed police, you're surrounded!
Do it now!<eos> I'm leaving this place.<eos> If no-one follows me, no-one dies.<eos> 'Lay down your weapon.'<eos> You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.<eos> She's a dead woman walking.<eos> She's my friend.<eos> And she's under my protection.<eos> Who are you?
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'<eos> Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> - Can you hear a squeaking?
She said relax.<eos> Did you have a nice time in London?<eos> It was OK, I guess.<eos> But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?
- Everything OK, madam?<eos> - I think I'm dying.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right. Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.<eos> I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.<eos> I swear I will.'<eos> Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> You're completely at my mercy.
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.<eos> Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.<eos> I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead. I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.<eos> You found her but I found you.
What, you think I care if I die?<eos> I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.<eos> Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.<eos> I swear to you, Ajay.<eos> What did you hear, Ajay?
I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.<eos> Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.<eos> I swear to you, Ajay.<eos> What did you hear, Ajay?<eos> When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
Come here, darling, it's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.<eos> How many more times?<eos> Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
Thank you.<eos> This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.<eos> How many more times?<eos> Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.<eos> And you're basing all this on a code name?
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.<eos> And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.
AGRA went in. - Yes. - And they were betrayed.<eos> Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.<eos> I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Yeah. I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.<eos> Although she does seem to enjoy them.<eos> Well, I'll have to give that a go.<eos> Got a lot to catch up on.<eos> 'You think you understand.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.<eos> Well, I'll have to give that a go.<eos> Got a lot to catch up on.<eos> 'You think you understand.<eos> You understand nothing.'
I just come here to look at the fish.<eos> I knew this would happen one day.<eos> - It's like that old story. - I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?<eos> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
- Hello, Mary. - Hey.<eos> - John?<eos> - On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?
Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?<eos> Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.<eos> Why did you betray us?
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.<eos> Lady Smallwood gave the order.<eos> But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.<eos> Seemed to do the trick.<eos> And you thought your troubles were over.
The hostages were killed. AGRA too.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> My secret was safe. But... apparently not.<eos> Just a little peace.<eos> That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
Really, I understand.<eos> So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away.<eos> I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?
So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away.<eos> I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?<eos> After what you did? !
OK.<eos> London Aquarium.<eos> Yes, now.<eos> I was never a field agent. I always thought I'd be rather good.<eos> Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - For a secretary.<eos> - What?<eos> It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.<eos> They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat.<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?

Yes, your little flat.<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.<eos> That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
- Sherlock... - Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.<eos> A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.<eos> - Sherlock, don't.<eos> - Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.<eos> That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.<eos> So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.<eos> To prove how good you are.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.<eos> All except Sherlock Holmes.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
Mary...<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> You made a vow.<eos> You swore it.<eos> 'You've been having dreams.
You made a vow.<eos> You swore it.<eos> 'You've been having dreams.<eos> A recurring dream? '<eos> Do you want to talk about it?
This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.<eos> Everything's hopeless.<eos> Irretrievable.<eos> I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.<eos> Look after little Rosie.<eos> I'm just going to, um look through these things.<eos> A case?<eos> Oh, you're not up to it, are you?
I'm just going to, um look through these things.<eos> A case?<eos> Oh, you're not up to it, are you?<eos> Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson. Yes.<eos> Yes, I expect you're right.
Yes, I expect you're right.<eos> I'll make some tea, shall I?<eos> - Mrs Hudson?<eos> - Yes, Sherlock?<eos> If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident... - Yes?
I'll make some tea, shall I?<eos> - Mrs Hudson?<eos> - Yes, Sherlock?<eos> If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident... - Yes?<eos> - ...would you just say the word Norbury to me?

News crews have not yet been allowed into the site.<eos> She's ready for you.<eos> ...military forces illegally breached Iranian airspace and killed 45 innocent workers here, most of whom lived in the nearby town.<eos> - An FRAS broadcast...<eos> Hope you don't mind meeting in here. My schedule's quite full.

And made off with what we were supposed to destroy, I'm afraid.<eos> Not only do they possess the bio, but we, and by extension Washington, look like international war criminals.<eos> I haven't felt rage like this from all sides in my entire duration.<eos> I'm prepared to accept any penalties for violating protocol, ma'am.<eos> I'm glad to hear you say it, Sergeant, but that won't be necessary.
Sergeant Stratton, please.<eos> This way.<eos> You should have gone back. For the birth at least.<eos> And let you have all the fun?<eos> You Stratton?
This way.<eos> You should have gone back. For the birth at least.<eos> And let you have all the fun?<eos> You Stratton?<eos> You must be Marty's replacement.
I've been going over your file.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you too, sir.<eos> You can cut the "sir".
Thank you.<eos> I've heard a lot about you too, sir.<eos> You can cut the "sir".<eos> Everyone calls me Stratton.<eos> You served two tours in Afghanistan with MAKO 30 at Takur Ghar.
- Pretty hairy.<eos> - It was interesting.<eos> - Was Marty your company CO?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Were you close?
- He was a very good man.<eos> I saw in your file that you turned down three other assignments and a promotion for this one.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> You go where you think you can do the most good, right?<eos> If I get a hint that you're here looking for vengeance for Marty, I'm gonna send your arse back to the States.
You go where you think you can do the most good, right?<eos> If I get a hint that you're here looking for vengeance for Marty, I'm gonna send your arse back to the States.<eos> - I can handle myself.<eos> - I don't give a shit.<eos> Your mind goes anywhere other than the moment at hand, you're a risk.
- I don't give a shit.<eos> Your mind goes anywhere other than the moment at hand, you're a risk.<eos> I'm not getting my arse shot off 'cause you're pissed off about Marty.<eos> - Is that clear? - Crystal.<eos> You've been called to MI6.
Your mind goes anywhere other than the moment at hand, you're a risk.<eos> I'm not getting my arse shot off 'cause you're pissed off about Marty.<eos> - Is that clear? - Crystal.<eos> You've been called to MI6.<eos> - Are you Petty Officer Monroe?
- Is that clear? - Crystal.<eos> You've been called to MI6.<eos> - Are you Petty Officer Monroe?<eos> - Yes. Welcome to the Special Boat Service.<eos> You'll be joining Sergeant Stratton.
Not cancer research?<eos> Cyclosarin.<eos> Satan's Snow.<eos> And I think we both know that it wasn't destroyed but stolen and transported from Iran.<eos> Look, here's what I think. If you were going to arrest me, I would already be on a transport to an American pit where they would pour water down my throat, but here I am, so why don't you just get to the point?

Where or when?<eos> You mean like don't be in Times Square on the 9th at 2:30?<eos> No.<eos> He pays, I make. People die, not my problem.<eos> You're responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.
No.<eos> He pays, I make. People die, not my problem.<eos> You're responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.<eos> You're about to be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands.<eos> I'm no different to you.
No, please, please.<eos> Not my boy, please.<eos> Do you have the target in your sights?<eos> I have a clear shot.<eos> Ok, you look for a drone guy.
He makes dentist stuff, drills, micro...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He has a workshop across the Tiber.<eos> That's all I know, I swear. That's all I know. Please.<eos> Why don't you speak to your boy, tell him Daddy's alright?
- Good answer.<eos> - Greco?<eos> - Greco.<eos> So what's the deal with Stratton?<eos> What do you mean?
- Greco?<eos> - Greco.<eos> So what's the deal with Stratton?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You've worked with him before.
Reserved, I suppose.<eos> Keeps his cards close to his chest.<eos> Reserved.<eos> Marty never described him as reserved.<eos> - You knew Marty?
It's gotta be him.<eos> That's Barofski.<eos> - We should grab him right now. - Wait.<eos> He's useless to us without the bio.<eos> You've brought some friends.
He's useless to us without the bio.<eos> You've brought some friends.<eos> Different definition of trust, I see.<eos> No, just a little precaution.<eos> I'm sure you could understand.
See?<eos> That's him, right there.<eos> The target location is preset on all four drones.<eos> Within a two-mile radius of the target, enter the launch code, GPS will lock.<eos> You then have five minutes.

You know well, Gregor, no one else could have done this for you the way I did.<eos> But I've been working hard on these drones and want to make sure I'm compensated properly, no?<eos> Hey, he found it. Shit.<eos> Who is watching?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been going over Barofski's file.<eos> One name:<eos> Sergei Orlov?<eos> Barofski's handler back then.<eos> You knew him?
For his revenge.<eos> So Barofski's gone rogue and kept the bio for his own use.<eos> Come on, Stratton.<eos> Stop dancing around it.<eos> Why don't you ask me?
This may be personal.<eos> Strike a blow to his former boss?<eos> Or I could still be in love with him.<eos> Working with him from the inside.<eos> Stratton, you're my best and brightest.
I trust you'll figure out which.<eos> What is this?<eos> I figured after Rome, I'd be relieved.<eos> Just thought I'd get a head start.<eos> You're under my command until further notice.
What is this?<eos> I figured after Rome, I'd be relieved.<eos> Just thought I'd get a head start.<eos> You're under my command until further notice.<eos> Look, you gave me a shot and I blew it.
He's had ample time to arrange transport out of Italy.<eos> Barofski's murders in Ukraine are likely a statement.<eos> After all these years, he's out for vengeance, telling the Russians, "I can destroy you. "<eos> Since this image could very well be Moscow, I'm going to have to share this intel and ask for their help.<eos> Cummings, you'll coordinate that effort once I have clearance from Downing Street and Washington.
Since this image could very well be Moscow, I'm going to have to share this intel and ask for their help.<eos> Cummings, you'll coordinate that effort once I have clearance from Downing Street and Washington.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Let's hope Barofski's not too far gone.<eos> You're in shock, Agent Cummings, as you should be.

Yes, ma'am.<eos> Let's hope Barofski's not too far gone.<eos> You're in shock, Agent Cummings, as you should be.<eos> Your handler Orlov is dead and now you're my mole, my MI6 traitor.<eos> In case you doubt the danger you're now in, I have a duplicate of this file ready to send to your esteemed boss, Gisela Sumner.
In case you doubt the danger you're now in, I have a duplicate of this file ready to send to your esteemed boss, Gisela Sumner.<eos> Your task is to return the device that your colleagues stole from me in Rome.<eos> It holds a secret that must not be discovered by them.<eos> The longer it remains with your agency, the greater the risk to my mission.<eos> I will have my revenge and you just may survive if you do as I say.
Thank you.<eos> Morning.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Ah, Cummings. The PM and Washington are back-channelling any joint investigation with the Kremlin.<eos> - You and I liaise. - Of course, yes.
- Ma'am.<eos> - Ah, Cummings. The PM and Washington are back-channelling any joint investigation with the Kremlin.<eos> - You and I liaise. - Of course, yes.<eos> Sooner the better.<eos> I think I may have found what you've been looking for, though, ma'am.
Do the Russians even have a word for "plan"?<eos> There's Miller, finally.<eos> What...<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You just shot your own... Who...
Who the fuck are...<eos> Shaolin.<eos> I guess that kung fu didn't come in too handy over there.<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> No, you can't do this! No!
I guess that kung fu didn't come in too handy over there.<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> No, you can't do this! No!<eos> Spirit of cooperation.<eos> You're Stratton, right?
I am Borodin Pavel. This is Agent Volkov.<eos> I'm slightly more interested in Mr Miller.<eos> No offence.<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> Do you have the module?
Sir?<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir, are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you speak English?
My name is Nance.<eos> Do you have any food?<eos> Of course.<eos> We have plenty of food.<eos> How long have you been here?
Here, come sit here.<eos> We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.
We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.<eos> Are you alone here?
Just you.<eos> Are you alone here?<eos> When everyone disappeared, i left the city.<eos> I thought if the world is going to end, I will come here where shortly I'll join them.<eos> Were you in Iceland when it happened?
Were you in Iceland when it happened?<eos> Is this your place?<eos> This is my cabin.<eos> But in previous life i was a fisherman.<eos> What have you been doing?
This is my cabin.<eos> But in previous life i was a fisherman.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> I made my bed.<eos> Well you don't have to join your family just yet.
We each occupy our own distinct space.<eos> It's worse alone on the sea.<eos> I don't get why...<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why are you so determined to give up?
She left you?<eos> She didn't need to.<eos> She was already absent.<eos> But soon I spent more and more time on the sea.<eos> There was nothing you could do?
There was nothing you could do?<eos> How is that fair?<eos> The world is the world.<eos> You cannot fault it for not behaving as you believe it should.<eos> So you don't believe that we've been led here to find each other?
I left you a message this morning about rescheduling today's appointment.<eos> But he should have something available in the coming weeks.<eos> (DOOR OPENS)<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Al, you're looking well.
(DOOR OPENS)<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Al, you're looking well.<eos> WILLIS:<eos> So you didn't get the message, Randa?
- For the fifth time?<eos> I must've missed it.<eos> It'll be quick.<eos> Okay, don't get comfortable.<eos> You got five minutes.
It'll be quick.<eos> Okay, don't get comfortable.<eos> You got five minutes.<eos> I'm late for a meeting.<eos> So, what imaginary monster are you hunting this time?
BROOKS:<eos> Listen, Senator, Landsat is sending a mission to the island.<eos> We could piggyback on that operation.<eos> With your permission, of course.<eos> What're you hoping you'll find?
Listen, to be honest, we don't know for sure what's there.<eos> Okay?<eos> But I will tell you what we do know.<eos> Tomorrow night, the Russian Novosat passes over this sector. And in three days, they're gonna have the same images we have.<eos> So whatever's there, you want us to find it first.
Washington notified the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese today that the withdrawal...<eos> CHAPMAN:<eos> Sir?<eos> Chapman.<eos> You need anything, Sir?
Chapman.<eos> You need anything, Sir?<eos> All good.<eos> Roger that.<eos> So what're you gonna do when you get back to the world, Chapman?
Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.<eos> This is Packard.<eos> Packard, it's General Ward.<eos> You and your boys up for one last op?
Packard, it's General Ward.<eos> You and your boys up for one last op?<eos> I would not be opposed to that, Sir.<eos> Your orders to head home are already processed.<eos> Sure you don't wanna take some time?
(EXHALES)<eos> Now there's a man worth talking to.<eos> CONRAD:<eos> An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.
CONRAD:<eos> An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.<eos> Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitos.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the atabrine for the malaria, but what about the other bacteria?

Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitos.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the atabrine for the malaria, but what about the other bacteria?<eos> We haven't even started on the things that want to eat you alive.<eos> We'll double that.<eos> You have no idea how dangerous this is.
I think Mr. Conrad should be fairly compensated.<eos> Here's to profit during peacetime.<eos> CONRAD:<eos> One question.<eos> You came here looking for a tracker.
You came here looking for a tracker.<eos> Who or what am I tracking?<eos> This is all the information that we have.<eos> Okay? There is no map. Only satellite images.<eos> So we need someone like you, with your skill, your unique expertise in uncharted jungle terrain, to lead us on our ground expedition.
Okay? There is no map. Only satellite images.<eos> So we need someone like you, with your skill, your unique expertise in uncharted jungle terrain, to lead us on our ground expedition.<eos> We're just scholars and scientists. We need someone with experience. In case things go sideways.<eos> Men go to war in search of something, Mr. Conrad.<eos> If you'd found it, you'd be home by now.
Mason Weaver is a woman?<eos> Last time I checked.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Two years in country.<eos> Where you been?
Where you been?<eos> Embedded with MACV-SOG.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Ah, you were in the shit.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.
Embedded with MACV-SOG.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Ah, you were in the shit.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.<eos> You're not actually gonna blame the people without guns for losing the war, are you?
Mr. Brooks.<eos> Simple, really.<eos> We'll use explosives to shake the earth and create vibrations, helping us to map the subsurface of the island.<eos> We'll fly in over the south shore and then strategically drop seismic charges to better help us understand the density of the earth.<eos> You're dropping bombs?
Three days later, the refuel team will meet us here on the north end of the island.<eos> That may be our only safe departure window for an unknown period of time.<eos> So, tip for everybody, don't miss it, please.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> What are you doing down here?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.
You weren't listening in class.<eos> Seismic charges for the geological survey.<eos> Uh-huh. You believe that?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Have you met Colonel Packard yet?
Yeah.<eos> The guy's wound pretty tight.<eos> Well, the man's a decorated war hero.<eos> That's the package they come in.<eos> And you?
How did British special forces get dragged into this?<eos> - Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> They offered me money.<eos> You don't strike me as a mercenary.
- Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> They offered me money.<eos> You don't strike me as a mercenary.<eos> You don't strike me as a war photographer.
Maybe we should consider postponing the mission.<eos> How far away is this island?<eos> 50 miles, maybe more.<eos> Take us closer.<eos> You wanna launch, you do it from here.
How far away is this island?<eos> 50 miles, maybe more.<eos> Take us closer.<eos> You wanna launch, you do it from here.<eos> Can you punch through that, Colonel?
I'm sure the Landsat inspector will be inspired by your courage.<eos> No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.<eos> This is only a map survey.<eos> To one of the last uncharted areas on the face of the Earth.<eos> And you wanna call it on account of rain?
No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.<eos> This is only a map survey.<eos> To one of the last uncharted areas on the face of the Earth.<eos> And you wanna call it on account of rain?<eos> Stay on the boat if you want to.
PACKARD:<eos> This is Fox Leader to Fox Group.<eos> It is time, once again, for the Griffin and ant show.<eos> As usual, remember, hold onto your butts!<eos> MALE ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Attention, pilots. You are cleared for takeoff.
Launch, launch, launch.<eos> (SOLDIERS CHATTERING ON RADIO)<eos> PACKARD: (ON RADIO) Combat formation.<eos> Keep visual.<eos> Fox Five, let me know when you close.
(SOLDIER WHOOPING)<eos> PILOT:<eos> Copy all, Fox Three.<eos> Heading 0-9-0.<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Copy all, Fox Three.<eos> Heading 0-9-0.<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?<eos> The seismic response is incredible.<eos> Hey, Randa, you're not gonna believe this.
I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know, or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.<eos> But today...<eos> So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> Who are you?
Ancient species owned this earth long before mankind.<eos> And if we keep our heads buried in the sand, they will take it back.<eos> My agency is known as Monarch.<eos> We specialize in the hunt for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.<eos> You knew that thing was out here?
And now here it is.<eos> 28 years, 11 months and eight failed attempts to get back to the world, and instead the world comes to me?<eos> (CHUCKLING) Ain't that a crack?<eos> They never smile.<eos> Did you crash here?
Nieves, now is not the time. All right?<eos> What lands here tends to stay here.<eos> As far as I can tell, this ship washed up about 10 years before I did.<eos> - WEAVER:<eos> You've been here since '44?
And you better hope he does.<eos> Because the lwis say once Kong goes, then the big one comes up.<eos> Then it's, "Goodnight, Irene." (CHUCKLES)<eos> Listen, there's a refueling team coming to the north end of the island in three days.<eos> You should come with us.
- PACKARD:<eos> We did that.<eos> We hook up with Chapman, there's enough munitions on that downed Sea Stallion to finish the job.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> You know why I carry this instead of an M-16?
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> CONRAD:<eos> Okay.<eos> So, we've got 48 hours to make it to the north shore.<eos> Slivko, do you know what you're doing back there?
- I don't know.<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd pick the Cubbies over the Tigers any day.<eos> Who do you think would win in a fight? A tiger or a cub?
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> What kind of music is that?<eos> What happened to swing?<eos> Benny Goodman?<eos> You're like a time-traveler, man.
Benny Goodman?<eos> You're like a time-traveler, man.<eos> I'm telling you, this is the new sound.<eos> I don't know if I'm gonna like whoever's under this beard.<eos> I really hope that thing you call a boat can get us upriver in 36 hours. Because if we miss that window, we're, literally, up a creek.
It felt good.<eos> Then I thought he was crazy when he said the earth was full of monsters.<eos> I can't tell when I'm talking<eos> - or when I'm not talking.<eos> - You're talking.
Colonel Packard, this mission to the crash site is folly.<eos> I understand going after your man. But the rest of it...<eos> This is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.
I understand going after your man. But the rest of it...<eos> This is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> You set this in motion when you put this place on the map.
Got a telegram from her the day before I got shot down.<eos> She said we just had our baby boy.<eos> I got a son out there.<eos> Grown man I've never met.<eos> Yeah, she definitely thinks you're dead, man.
Hey!<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> CONRAD:<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You'd be surprised how long people wait.
Never thought I'd see you guys again.<eos> - I thought you were crazy.<eos> - I wish I had been.<eos> - What's your count?<eos> - What you see is what I got.
Good to see you, fellas!<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> We picked up a hitchhiker.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th Pursuit Squadron of the 15th.<eos> You've been here since World War ll?
If we follow this river, we'll make it to the boat, and we'll make it to the north shore in time.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> But we're not leaving yet.<eos> Still got a man out there, Conrad.<eos> Wait a second. You got someone out there?
We have an old saying here.<eos> "East is best, west is worst!"<eos> That's why we say it!<eos> You know, southwest...<eos> We could talk about that. But you're gonna need a lot more guns if you're gonna go west.
We'll cross through and make it to the highest point west.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> This place is a real no-no, Sir.<eos> We need to be going to the north side right now.<eos> And you're welcome to do that, my man.
By yourself.<eos> I'm not leaving Jack out there.<eos> Now, who's with me?<eos> We can make it.<eos> You're mighty right, we can make it.
(SCREECHES)<eos> (ALL PANTING)<eos> MARLOW:<eos> Now, look, Colonel.<eos> You may outrank me, but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.
I'm sorry, Colonel Packard.<eos> Chapman is dead.<eos> Doesn't change a thing!<eos> We're still going to that crash site.<eos> What's at that crash site that you want so badly?
Kong didn't kill Chapman.<eos> But he did kill these men!<eos> My men!<eos> MARLOW:<eos> You can't kill Kong, Colonel.
He's right, Colonel.<eos> We can't kill Kong.<eos> Now, that other creature? That's the threat.<eos> And there are more of them down there.<eos> If you take away a species' natural competition, they'll proliferate out of control.
Nuts!<eos> You hear me?<eos> This is nuts!<eos> Please!<eos> You need to listen to us!
This is nuts!<eos> Please!<eos> You need to listen to us!<eos> We're not at war, Colonel.<eos> You're making a mistake.
Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!<eos> - CONRAD:<eos> Not our fight.<eos> Whose side are you on, Captain?
- CONRAD:<eos> Not our fight.<eos> Whose side are you on, Captain?<eos> Okay, Colonel.<eos> You'll find your Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.
All right?<eos> Saddle up!<eos> Let's go kill this thing!<eos> - (SIGHS)<eos> - Steve, you running with the big dogs or staying on the porch?
Make sure those get back to his family.<eos> Dear Billy... Your dad was one of the best to ever do it.<eos> CONRAD:<eos> There's water close by.<eos> Are you lost?
(GUNS COCK)<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> (GASPING)<eos> Conrad, which way are we going?<eos> You three need to go back to the boat.
Kong was just defending his territory.<eos> We are soldiers!<eos> We do the dirty work, so our families and our countrymen don't have to be afraid!<eos> They shouldn't even know a thing like this exists!<eos> You've lost your mind.
(BIRDS CAWING)<eos> (ROARS)<eos> (PROJECTOR WHIRRING)<eos> CONRAD:<eos> You just gonna sit there?
Is this fun for you?<eos> I promise I won't tell the Russians.<eos> - I promise I will tell the Russians.<eos> - She's gonna tell the Russians.<eos> Why are you keeping us here?
Welcome to Monarch.<eos> (CHUCKLING)<eos> This island is just the beginning.<eos> There's more out there.<eos> What do you mean, "more"?
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?
I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.<eos> You just said you woke up.
Why can't some things be unacceptable? And we can just say that.<eos> I only mean it's okay.<eos> I'm letting my daughter down.<eos> How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.
I'm letting my daughter down.<eos> How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.<eos> And Rosie just lost her mother.<eos> You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.
You just lost your wife.<eos> And Rosie just lost her mother.<eos> You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.<eos> No, I'm failing to.<eos> So, there is no one you talk to? Confide in?
John, look at me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Is there anything you're not telling me?
You know that, don't you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> No.<eos> What are you looking at?
Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> No.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You keep glancing to my left.
There is a difference between looking away and looking to.<eos> - I tend to notice these things.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.<eos> That's not necessarily a good thing.<eos> Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?
Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.<eos> That's not necessarily a good thing.<eos> Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?<eos> I haven't seen him. No one's seen him. He's locked himself away in his flat.<eos> God knows what he's up to. Do you blame him?
Has he attempted to make contact with you?<eos> No!<eos> How can you be sure? He might have tried.<eos> No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that's not something you can fail to notice.<eos> Well, now. Won't you introduce me?
I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.<eos> Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?
I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.<eos> Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?<eos> No. Do you own an American car?
Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?<eos> No. Do you own an American car?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - No, not American. Left hand drive. That's what I mean.<eos> No. Why do you ask?
No. Why do you ask?<eos> Not sure actually.<eos> Probably just noticed something.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Of course, you don't own a car. You don't need one. Do you?
Not sure actually.<eos> Probably just noticed something.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Of course, you don't own a car. You don't need one. Do you?<eos> No visitors. Okay, how do you know that?
Hang on a minute. I was looking out of the window.<eos> Why was I doing that? I don't know.<eos> -Me neither. Must've had a reason.<eos> It'll come back to me.<eos> Presumably, you downsized when you left your job.
-Me neither. Must've had a reason.<eos> It'll come back to me.<eos> Presumably, you downsized when you left your job.<eos> And maybe when you ended your relationship.<eos> - You can't know that.
Coat.<eos> I don't have a coat.<eos> -Yes, well I just noticed, I wonder why.<eos> - Are you talking to her?<eos> - So, what do you think?
I have to drink a cup of tea.<eos> This cup of tea...<eos> - Code? - It's a cup of tea.<eos> Because you might prefer some coffee.<eos> You're my last hope.
Congenital. It just means...<eos> Handbag.<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it. Do you hear me?
Off it.<eos> Off it!<eos> Sorry.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?
- Your skirt. - My skirt?<eos> Look at the hem of it!<eos> That's what I noticed. Sorry. I'm still catching up with my brain.<eos> It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, do you see them?
Look at the hem of it!<eos> That's what I noticed. Sorry. I'm still catching up with my brain.<eos> It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, do you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving.
Those markings, do you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving.<eos> You were in the passenger seat. I came in a taxi.<eos> There is no taxi waiting in the street outside. That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.

So thank you for confirming my hypothesis.

So thank you for confirming my hypothesis.<eos> I don't really need to check that the angles are consistent with self-harm, do I? - No.<eos> - Then you can keep your scars.
- Then you can keep your scars.<eos> I want to see your handbag.<eos> Why?<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> You said I was your last hope, and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home.
You said I was your last hope, and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home.<eos> And a gun.<eos> - Chips.<eos> - Chips?<eos> You're suicidal. You're allowed chips.
Trust me. It's about the only perk.<eos> Sherlock!<eos> Are you going out? I think I remember the way.<eos> It's through there, isn't it.<eos> You're in a state! Look at you!
It's your brother.<eos> He's left his flat.<eos> Was it on fire?<eos> Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> You see the fold in the middle?
He's left his flat.<eos> Was it on fire?<eos> Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> You see the fold in the middle?<eos> For the first few months, you kept this hidden. Folded inside a book.
Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> You see the fold in the middle?<eos> For the first few months, you kept this hidden. Folded inside a book.<eos> Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease.<eos> So, obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house, at the level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.
The past few months, it's been on open display on a wall.<eos> Conclusion? Relationship is over.<eos> The paper has been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells. So, it must have been on display in the kitchen.<eos> Lots of different spices.<eos> You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash. Yet, you're still cooking to impress.
Lots of different spices.<eos> You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash. Yet, you're still cooking to impress.<eos> You're keen, and kitchen is the most public room in any house.<eos> And since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this,<eos> I have to assume you don't have any.

Yet, you're still cooking to impress.<eos> You're keen, and kitchen is the most public room in any house.<eos> And since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this,<eos> I have to assume you don't have any.<eos> You've isolated yourself.
You should answer it.<eos> It's Mycroft.<eos> Might be about Sherlock.<eos> Of course it's about Sherlock. Everything's about Sherlock.<eos> How did you know my kitchen was tiny?
By instinct, we place them at eye level, where there's natural light.<eos> The sun's only struck the bottom two-thirds, but the line is straight.<eos> But, because the top section is unaffected, we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.<eos> If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded.<eos> Top to bottom, but no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith. So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.
The room's small.<eos> - Big brother is watching you.<eos> - Literally.<eos> We can keep tabs.<eos> You didn't have to come in.
He's probably still in shock.<eos> Everybody dies.<eos> That's the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do.<eos> How can it still come as a surprise to people?<eos> You sound cross.
How can it still come as a surprise to people?<eos> You sound cross.<eos> Am I going to be taken away by security again?<eos> I have, I think, apologised extensively.<eos> You haven't made it up to me.
You haven't made it up to me.<eos> And how am I supposed to do that?<eos> - Sex. - I'm sorry.<eos> Sex.<eos> How did you know I wasn't getting any?
This one comes from the very first night.<eos> You can see the pen marks over it.<eos> I think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory so you tried it again later.<eos> I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.<eos> How do you know he didn't notice?
How do you know he didn't notice?<eos> Well, 'cause he would have done something about it.<eos> Would he?<eos> -Wouldn't he? Isn't that what you people do?<eos> - Well that's interesting. - What is? - The way you think.
Not sure.<eos> We keep losing visual. Mostly, we're tracking his phone.<eos> Don't call us. We'll call...<eos> I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Can you stop ringing my damn phone?
I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Can you stop ringing my damn phone?<eos> Sherlock has left his flat. First time in a week.<eos> - So I'm having him tracked.<eos> - Nice. That's very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.
Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern.<eos> The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.<eos> It didn't the last time, and I assure you it won't... With Sherlock.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Please phone me if he gets in contact. Thank you.
The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.<eos> It didn't the last time, and I assure you it won't... With Sherlock.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Please phone me if he gets in contact. Thank you.<eos> Do you still speak to Sherrinford?
- What is?<eos> Culverton Smith, all this charity work.<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> Do you know why I'm gonna take your case?
So, that happened, I don't doubt it, but how can that word be a name? A name you instantly recognise that tore your world apart.<eos> Okay, well, how?<eos> No idea yet.<eos> But I don't work for free.<eos> You take cash?
Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.<eos> You know, death, it's something that happens to everybody else.<eos> Your life is not your own.<eos> Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you're...
* My little master, who will find me... *<eos> Sorry, I...<eos> Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> You said your life turned on one word.
Faith!<eos> You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you. Anyone.<eos> - You're not what I expected.
Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> - What is wrong?<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you know where you are?
Why shouldn't he be?<eos> - What is wrong?<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Are you drunk?
But if you are rich, and powerful, and necessary...<eos> Anyone.<eos> What if you had the compulsion to kill and money?<eos> What then?<eos> Well now. Won't you introduce me?
Anyone.<eos> What if you had the compulsion to kill and money?<eos> What then?<eos> Well now. Won't you introduce me?<eos> Right, you there!
What if you had the compulsion to kill and money?<eos> What then?<eos> Well now. Won't you introduce me?<eos> Right, you there!<eos> Stop right where you are!
Right, you there!<eos> Stop right where you are!<eos> - John.<eos> - Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?
What's wrong? -Hello?<eos> My name is Mycroft Holmes. I'm speaking from the Cabinet.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - It's Sherlock.<eos> You've no idea what I've been through.
"I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start!"<eos> "The game's afoot."<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I have a cup of tea?<eos> Did you call the police?
These pictures. They're that man on the telly, aren't they?<eos> - What pictures?<eos> - They're everywhere.<eos> These pictures?<eos> You can see them too!
Culverton Smith, This I think is relevant from this morning.<eos> He's publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.<eos> Christ.<eos> Sherlock on Twitter. He really has lost it.<eos> Don't you dare make jokes.
Don't you dare!<eos> I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you?<eos> Are you having an earthquake?
I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> For goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you?<eos> Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John. You need to help him!
-Nope.<eos> He needs you!<eos> Somebody else.<eos> Not me.<eos> Not now. Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.
I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken.<eos> But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson.<eos> You will not have me.<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?

Because I'll tell you something, John Watson.<eos> You will not have me.<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?<eos> They don't matter, you do.<eos> Would you just see him, please, John?
Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?<eos> They don't matter, you do.<eos> Would you just see him, please, John?<eos> Or just take a look at him as a doctor.<eos> I know you'd change your mind if you did.
Now I need your handcuffs.<eos> I happen to know there's a pair in the salad drawer.<eos> I've borrowed them before.<eos> Get over yourself.<eos> You're not my first smack-head, Sherlock Holmes.
- How did you get him in the boot?<eos> - The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me. Twice!<eos> And you know why they dropped you, dear?<eos> Because they know you.
Is this a new person? I'm against new people.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> She's my therapist.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Do you do block bookings?
For God's sake!<eos> I'm the widow of a drug dealer. I own property in Central London. And for the last bloody time, John,<eos> I'm not your housekeeper.<eos> I'm so sorry. I answered your phone, you were busy.<eos> I think you'll want to take it.
This one's filthy.<eos> I mean, I'm aware of this morning's developments.<eos> Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.<eos> Sorry, did you say all still meeting?<eos> You, me and Mr Holmes.
You, me and Mr Holmes.<eos> I sent a car. It should be outside.<eos> Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one...<eos> When you're ready.
I sent a car. It should be outside.<eos> Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one...<eos> When you're ready.<eos> When did Sherlock give you this address?
When did Sherlock give you this address?<eos> - Two weeks ago.<eos> - Two weeks?<eos> Yes. Two weeks.<eos> How did you know where to find me?
She's more used to dead people.<eos> It's bound to lower your standards.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything any more.<eos> - Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing. No.
It's bound to lower your standards.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything any more.<eos> - Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing. No.<eos> You're going to have to buck up a bit, John. You know that, don't you?
- My God, he knows you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> I'm in your head, John.<eos> You're disagreeing with yourself.<eos> - Are you ready, sir?
Yeah, he is.<eos> -Yeah, okay, right.<eos> He is. But he's our monster.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
-Yeah, okay, right.<eos> He is. But he's our monster.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.<eos> But did you know... I'm a...
What? Sorry?<eos> Beyond what? Dangerous.<eos> And action!<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
Beyond what? Dangerous.<eos> And action!<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.<eos> But did you know... I'm a cereal killer?
- Brilliant, isn't it?<eos> Brilliant?<eos> Safest place to hide.<eos> Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes. Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.
Safest place to hide.<eos> Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes. Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.<eos> - Hospital?<eos> - Culverton's doing a visit. The kids would love to meet you both.
- Hospital?<eos> - Culverton's doing a visit. The kids would love to meet you both.<eos> I think he's sort of promised.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you'd just like to come this way.
What's the point? I needed a hug.<eos> What do you think, Mr Holmes?<eos> Cereal killer. It's funny 'cause it's true.<eos> See you at the hospital.<eos> You can have this back now.
You can have this back now.<eos> - Have what back?<eos> - Thanks for the hug.<eos> I sent and deleted a text.<eos> You might get a reply but I doubt it.
- It's password protected.<eos> - Please.<eos> We're going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes. Aren't we?<eos> No. No, not endless.<eos> Need another hit, do you?
We're going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes. Aren't we?<eos> No. No, not endless.<eos> Need another hit, do you?<eos> It can wait until the hospital.<eos> You involved, much?
Yeah, I'm John Watson.<eos> Dr Watson.<eos> - I love his blog. Don't you?<eos> - His blog?<eos> - Don't you read it?
- His blog?<eos> - Don't you read it?<eos> - You mean my blog?<eos> Say what you like about addiction, the day is full of highlights.<eos> Mr Holmes, you're feeling better.
- Great... - It's my blog.<eos> It is. He writes the blog.<eos> - It's yours?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You write Sherlock's blog? - Yes.
- One murder. - Ten suspects.<eos> - Ten.<eos> Yeah. - All of them guilty.<eos> - Sherlock.<eos> And what do you call that one, John?
But most killers kill someone they know.<eos> You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.<eos> Um, Mr Smith. Um, I'm just, wondering maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children.<eos> Nurse Cornish.<eos> - How long have you been with us now?
Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.<eos> They tend to be social outcasts.<eos> - Educationally sub-normal.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know. The ones you've caught.

If the Queen was a serial killer, I'd be the first person she'd tell. We have that kind of friendship.<eos> A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.<eos> Where are we going now?<eos> -I want to show you my favourite room.<eos> No, let's go in here.<eos> So have you had another one of your little meetings?
Anyone ever opt to remember?<eos> Some people take the drip out.<eos> Yes, some people have the same urges.<eos> Now, come on. Wasting time.<eos> Indeed you have, I estimate, 20 minutes left.
Sorry?<eos> -I sent a text from your phone, remember?<eos> It was read almost immediately, factoring in a degree of shock, and emotional decision, and a journey time based on the associated address. I'd say that your life as you know it has 20 minutes left to run.<eos> Well, no. 17 and a half, to be precise, but I rounded up for dramatic effect.<eos> So please do show us your favourite room. It'll give you a chance to say good-bye.
Other than yourself?<eos> H.H. Holmes.<eos> Relative of yours?<eos> Not as far as I know.<eos> You should check.
Everyone out.<eos> Mr Smith, we're actually in the middle of something.<eos> Saheed, isn't it?<eos> Saheed. Yes.<eos> - How long have you been working here now?
- Five minutes?<eos> - Come back in ten.<eos> Saheed.<eos> This time, knock.<eos> How can you do that? How...
- Come back in ten.<eos> Saheed.<eos> This time, knock.<eos> How can you do that? How...<eos> How are you even allowed in here?
There was a ceremony.<eos> You can watch that on YouTube.<eos> The Home Secretary was there.<eos> So, your favourite room. The mortuary.<eos> What do you think?
You just find a beach and...<eos> If you wanna hide a murder, you wanna hide lots and lots of murders, just find a... hospital.<eos> Can we be clear? Are you confessing?<eos> To what?<eos> The way you're talking.
To what?<eos> The way you're talking.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> You mean, am I a serial killer?
Well, it's true.<eos> I do like to mess with people, and yes, I am a bit creepy but that's just my USP.<eos> I use it to sell breakfast cereal.<eos> But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?
But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> - Are you really a doctor?
There are two possible explanations for what's going on here.<eos> Either I'm a serial killer, or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs.<eos> Delusional paranoia about a public personality.<eos> That's not so special. It's not even new.<eos> I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time because you're too high to know what's real any more.
I apologise.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic.<eos> Nineteen and a half minutes.<eos> The footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two. The third of course, will be the end of a walking cane.
Nineteen and a half minutes.<eos> The footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two. The third of course, will be the end of a walking cane.<eos> Your daughter Faith's walking cane.<eos> Why would she be here?<eos> You invited her.

You sent her a text.<eos> Or, or, or, technically I sent her a text, but she's not to know.<eos> Um, let's see if I can recall. "Faith, I can stand it no longer."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.
But I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.
We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.
You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.<eos> You maintain an impressive facade.

Dad?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What was that text?<eos> Another one of your jokes?<eos> Who are you?
What's happening?<eos> What was that text?<eos> Another one of your jokes?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who the hell are you?
Sherlock Holmes. Surely you recognise him.<eos> My God.<eos> Sherlock Holmes?<eos> I love your blog.<eos> You're not her. You're not the woman who came to Baker Street. Erm, well, no.
Have we?<eos> Sherlock?<eos> So who came to my flat?<eos> Well, it wasn't me.<eos> You look different.
Sherlock, you okay?<eos> - Watch him. He's got a knife.<eos> - Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel.<eos> You picked it up from that table. I saw you take it.
We did see it coming.<eos> We always saw it coming.<eos> But it was fun.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Sir. You probably wanna see this.
He's going to get the best of care.<eos> I might even move him to my favourite room.<eos> Culverton Smith, earlier today.<eos> In Nottingham...<eos> He's right you know, you probably saved his life.
You've got your disapproving face on.<eos> Well, seeing as I'm inside your head, I think we can call that self-loathing.<eos> Where is she? Where is Mrs Hudson?<eos> She'll be up in a moment.<eos> - What are you doing?
Are these spooks?<eos> Are you using spooks now, to look after your family.<eos> Hang on, are they tidying?<eos> Sherlock is a security concern. The fact that I'm his brother changes nothing.<eos> - Yeah you said that before. - Ask him.
Who are you talking about? -Atta boy.<eos> Nobody.<eos> I misspoke.<eos> - He's lying.<eos> - You're lying.
Mycroft Holmes.<eos> What are these dreadful people doing in my house?<eos> Mrs Hudson I apologise for the interruption.<eos> As you know, my brother has embarked in a programme of self-destruction, remarkable even by his standards, and I'm endeavouring to find out what triggered it.<eos> - And that's what you're looking for?
- So to speak.<eos> - And you've had all this time?<eos> Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply.<eos> So, if we could be about our business.<eos> You're so funny, you are!
You're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever. Poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean he knows you're an idiot. But that's okay, 'cause you are a lovely doctor.

Everybody out now.<eos> All of you!<eos> This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.<eos> Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally, they do not have a single spark of human decency.<eos> Get out of my house. You reptile.
I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so, if you don't want to talk,<eos> maybe you want to dance!<eos> Major, come on.<eos> Answer me.<eos> I thought you said no trouble.
You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.<eos> Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.
I know you.<eos> I saw you on TV!<eos> The President gave him a medal.<eos> That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.
Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple backflip on a BMX bike before? All of you?<eos> No.<eos> We don't play on bikes.<eos> You don't play on bikes.
You don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?<eos> We're soldiers, hotshot.<eos> Not slackers.<eos> Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system.
Why?<eos> What's it do?<eos> - Brainwave scrambler?<eos> - It killed Gibbons.<eos> All you need to know.
You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.<eos> Sweetheart, this is not a game.<eos> You are all my soldiers now.
Hell, no.<eos> I dropped your soldiers over Eastern Europe.<eos> So, why did you leave Lassie behind?<eos> This is my operation!<eos> You will listen to me.
Shut up, "hero"!<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Okay, I actually have what you want.
Let me guess.<eos> Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy programs.<eos> No.<eos> The world's too stupid to realize that Moscow wasn't a bluff.<eos> Okay, Triple-X, you will base out of an NSA safe house.
Looks like East 404 Congress Street.<eos> He's on the top floor.<eos> I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> I can jam the signal, but only for a few minutes, so hurry.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.
Let's go!<eos> Shit.<eos> He's trying to reconnect it.<eos> Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite.<eos> You have to hurry.
- Clear out, let's go!<eos> It's showtime.<eos> I guess we're on the same team now.<eos> Give me one.<eos> You know me.
Hurry up, over there!<eos> I go low.<eos> I'll go high.<eos> See if I can't find G.I. Joe.<eos> Are you getting this interference?
All right.<eos> So what? So maybe they chopped the money then and there, and then went their separate ways.<eos> Or maybe they left two trails to confuse us.<eos> I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!
Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> You and Sally deserve better than this. I mean that.
Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes.<eos> The owner of the bank, Judge Dawkins, could not be reached for comment.<eos> But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB is anything but over.<eos> As for the victim, Chris Morrow.<eos> Hey! Listen, you've got to come and get this money out of here and give me that tape. Then just get lost to wherever the hell you guys are getting lost to.
Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie take you, Douglas, as you are to love and to cherish to have and to hold until death do us part.<eos> Frances Millner, Douglas Grotsky, take hands.<eos> You may now kiss as husband and wife.
I honestly thought they wouldn't let you travel out of state.<eos> Well, you know.<eos> Hello!<eos> Thank you for inviting me.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Now, I got a few things that I'd like to say.<eos> Well, it's hard to believe any relationship that had its start at McCormick's 80s Karaoke Night could possibly amount to anything more than a one-night stand but it did and here we are and it's perfect.<eos> I guess, you know, to all those who want to see how it's done, how people can and should be there for each other, look no further than table one.<eos> You're a better couple than we've seen in our family in a long, long time.
She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.
I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.
You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nobody knows what happens after you die.<eos> You are Romeo and Juliet and we all wish you the same happy ending.
And the girl?<eos> She started to cry.<eos> I think I didn't describe it appealingly.<eos> We'll work on the wording before you try again.<eos> You're coming with me.
Yeah, baby<eos> Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.
You're the Kepps, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My mom says your fries are better than the ones in all of my dad's diners.<eos> Well, that's not what I thought I'd leave with here today, but it's something, so thank you. Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.
So why are we slaughtering them, Vortigern?<eos> BILL:<eos> Was not the Prince friendly with the Mages at one time?<eos> Did he not study with Mordred himself?<eos> What are you implying?
BEDIVERE:<eos> Where would we be without Merlin and the Mages who helped him?<eos> Where are they now?<eos> Why do they not show themselves?<eos> You know where they are, Lord Mercia.
They speak it better than you.<eos> JACK:<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> Back up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?
Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.<eos> If you can catch him, so can we.
She's from one of the oldest families in England.<eos> She can tell us.<eos> Sire.<eos> Do the people love me?<eos> I love Your Majesty, and if I represent the people, then you have your answer.
Get out the window.<eos> - (DOG BARKING)<eos> - They're here, move!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Oi, you two, in the back!
My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.<eos> Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.<eos> You've got the wrong man, sire.
(CHANTING CONTINUES)<eos> (CHANTING STOPS)<eos> Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.
They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.
What is it that you want?<eos> I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.
But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.<eos> (GRUNTING AND YELLING)<eos> But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.
You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to get me to do something razzle-dazzle with that sword.
Wet Stick, meet Percival.<eos> Rubio, meet Back Lack.<eos> Sir Bedivere, who runs this aristocratic family of cave dwellers, meet Blue, son of Back Lack.<eos> The infamous Goosefat Bill needs no introduction.<eos> So, you think you can take down Vortigern?
ARTHUR:<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.<eos> They'll start by telling us...<eos> If you're intending to galvanize the people of this country against the current king, there has to be a realistic strategy.
And what are we to be called, Bedivere?<eos> "Knights of the Bordello"?<eos> (LAUGHING)<eos> - Or "The Ladies of the Knight." - (CONTINUE LAUGHING)<eos> Have you finished?
- Or "The Ladies of the Knight." - (CONTINUE LAUGHING)<eos> Have you finished?<eos> I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.
- When?<eos> - Three days from now.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Looks like your plan worked.<eos> You need to be careful.
Come on!<eos> Move!<eos> - Fight!<eos> - Second rank!<eos> You two, down here.
Come on, boys!<eos> Search them dwellings now!<eos> Get through them doors!<eos> It's not gonna be easy getting out of here now.<eos> You can't stay here long.
BACK LACK:<eos> Have a look at this situation, would ya?<eos> The king of all England himself has made the effort to visit a commoner.<eos> A man from nowhere, and today, my last day.<eos> You look well, and I feel poor.
No, sir.<eos> Then you wouldn't mind if I cut his ears off?<eos> BLUE:<eos> They're not my ears.<eos> Do what you want with them.
She's back at the cave.<eos> All right.<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?<eos> I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.
Blue!<eos> - Blue!<eos> - MISCHIEF JOHN:<eos> Hello!<eos> You took your time getting here.
It was my turn to cook tonight.<eos> I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.
I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.
Light!<eos> Ready!<eos> Loose!<eos> While I understand there's been a change in the leadership of this nation,<eos> I am confident that you will still honor the agreement made by your predecessor and my king.
GREYBEARD: May I remind you, a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling the seas, surrounding your island.<eos> It would be unwise to displease my king.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.<eos> Sir Bedivere, if you would?
...or I'll step off this throne, and you can deal with me as the man you previously met.<eos> Arise, Sir Percival.<eos> And we can see how that goes.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Sir William, if you would?
I trust you are comfortable.<eos> My comfort is irrelevant.<eos> Where is my brother?<eos> He has been enjoying my hospitality.<eos> You will tell me what I want to know and with that knowledge I will conquer the universe.
Our father will not stop searching for us.<eos> But he won't find you, no one will.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I am Sinjin!<eos> But you, along with all living creatures need only call me Master!
Unworthy.<eos> I don't need you to tell me about my past.<eos> I lived it.<eos> We're here now.<eos> You need my help, and I need to know you got my back.
I don't need you to tell me about my past.<eos> I lived it.<eos> We're here now.<eos> You need my help, and I need to know you got my back.<eos> Or are your personal feelings more important than those lives you swore to protect?
I haven't actually been to the ruins per se but I've seen them from a distance.<eos> It's the perfect place to keep someone prisoner.<eos> Then that's our destination.<eos> It's not safe to travel at night.<eos> You can stay here till morning.
I think we'll stick to the schedule.<eos> Thanks, Jax.<eos> I'm sorry about your rock guy.<eos> It's okay. I have more in the mines.<eos> If you survive this I expect intel.
Guess my gas propelled projectiles don't look so bad now, do they?<eos> Just saying.<eos> You knew this would happen?<eos> This area is strange on tech.<eos> That's why I gave you the coordinates I did.
No by the time the generator is operational I will have what I need from him.<eos> And your ships will have the power to unleash my wrath across the universe!<eos> We are an alliance.<eos> We do not serve you!<eos> I have cleared a path through the mires provided you with subjects to modify.
So far I am unimpressed!<eos> He is correct.<eos> You may have initiated this alliance but we have provided all the raw materials and the technology.<eos> And the technology.<eos> You have such little minds.
Go!<eos> Commander Voss, please respond.<eos> Scheduled check in time has elapsed.<eos> Recovery protocol one initiating.<eos> - Who are... who are you?
We're lucky this was a small band.<eos> We need to move out.<eos> Commander!<eos> Father.<eos> You must finish the mission.
Impossible!<eos> Our home is Ares...<eos> Ares, is not your world.<eos> Your ancestors took refuge there after the greatest galactic war the universe has ever seen.<eos> You are children of Goros.
- Release her!<eos> I am not a prisoner, Ryll.<eos> These are friends.<eos> I'm here on a secret mission.<eos> A mission you can now assist me with.
Something's not right, Princess.<eos> Those who stand beside you are friends to no one.<eos> Where is Prince Tyr?<eos> The prince is dead.<eos> And you have sworn loyalty to the crown. To me.
Where is Prince Tyr?<eos> The prince is dead.<eos> And you have sworn loyalty to the crown. To me.<eos> I'm ordering you to put your weapons on the ground and stand down.<eos> - What are you doing?
Let me spell it out for you.<eos> I see.<eos> We have been searching for you.<eos> The king is very ill.<eos> You must return to Ares with us immediately.
- Can your weapons take that ship out?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> - Maximum power.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> And now you die!
Since when has earth had a problem with shooting first and asking questions later?<eos> Please, Ambassador Steele, we must all be united in this effort.<eos> We have to be proactive, not reactive.<eos> Do my ears deceive me?<eos> The Aresian empire the lunar council of the Ghost Nebula even the sentinel sisters. You are all actually afraid.
No, no, I just meant that this machine wasn't built for a Smurf of your, well, origins.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> Brainy.<eos> Hey, you know what?
- Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.

Brainy.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> And, I assume, Clumsy.<eos> - All good.<eos> - What are you guys doing out here?
Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.

That's not even convincing.<eos> When I find those Smurfs, I will ground them for a month of blue moons.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Have you ever seen something so beautiful?
- Sounds awesome!<eos> - Use this.<eos> - Grab on!<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.<eos> Thanks for asking, but...<eos> I'm still evil, so...<eos> Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.
Garga-what?<eos> He's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic.<eos> And he knows about your lost village.<eos> "Lost village"?<eos> You're the ones who are lost, not us.
Wait, where are your boys?<eos> You won't find any boys here.<eos> I am Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.<eos> This is called an introduction.<eos> So, now, you go.
There's no way he could survive.<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.<eos> Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.
Doesn't she look great?<eos> It's like she's one of us now.<eos> She should stay with us forever.<eos> One, she always looks great.<eos> And two, this is getting a little out of hand, don't you think?
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> I wasn't born yesterday, you know.<eos> Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me.
It's another jailbreak!<eos> - No, Gargamel.<eos> No.<eos> - Quiet down.<eos> You'll all get your turn.
Someone just made that up, right?<eos> I feel sorry for whoever "Matte" is.<eos> "Look development artists"?<eos> Yes, of course, let's develop some looks.<eos> Like maybe a really angry look, because you two totally ruined my plans.
No pie?<eos> We're watching our waistlines.<eos> Plus we're shit broke.<eos> Okay. Well, don't tie up my table all day. I gotta make a living here.<eos> Did I tell you those guys in the bank had machine guns?
I've got 30 days.<eos> Who's taking your house?<eos> The bank.<eos> They're taking your house and you didn't tell us?<eos> What are you gonna do?
I just don't want to do it in prison.<eos> Nobody's going to prison.<eos> What exactly is happening here?<eos> Willie's in.<eos> You're both out of your minds.
Give me that list.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait here.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing with my list?
I drive you there. I drive you back.<eos> That makes me a getaway driver.<eos> Oh, don't flatter yourself. You drive like my grandmother, and she drove a horse and buggy.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Just for that you can walk home.
Just for that you can walk home.<eos> Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.<eos> You're not going to make us walk!<eos> Hell I'm not.<eos> Oh, boy. You guys are going to be great bank robbers.
Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.<eos> You're not going to make us walk!<eos> Hell I'm not.<eos> Oh, boy. You guys are going to be great bank robbers.<eos> You just got busted robbing Value Town!
We're practically eight-oh.<eos> (DOGS BARKING)<eos> JESUS:<eos> Now, I don't know you from Adam.<eos> How does Jesus know you're cool?
I find this one in a drainage ditch.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> People have no heart these days.<eos> So what makes you think you can pull it off?
Well, I don't know.<eos> Thought we'd give it a go.<eos> "Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just give it a go."<eos> You could get life!
- Heh.<eos> This food is excellent tonight.<eos> They must've changed recipes.<eos> Same crap.<eos> You got the munchies.
Yeah, but what if we get less?<eos> I'm not going to go through this twice.<eos> Hey!<eos> That's our bank right there.<eos> Wait a second, you're going to rob your own bank?
I've got 20 days before I lose my house.<eos> JESUS:<eos> Robbing a bank is an art form.<eos> Ten different people will take the same place ten different ways.<eos> You need to come up with a plan that is special for you.
- (LAUGHING)<eos> - Magic.<eos> Good.<eos> JESUS:<eos> You have to be in great physical shape.
JESUS:<eos> You have to be in great physical shape.<eos> Now I realize you guys are 4,000 years old.<eos> That is fabulous.<eos> But under those masks, you're going to need to feel like you're 20.
But under those masks, you're going to need to feel like you're 20.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Now this is crucial. You have to have a solid alibi.
Everything's on the damn Internet.<eos> Set your stopwatches to two minutes.<eos> And walk it like it's the real deal.<eos> 4 minutes, 54 seconds.<eos> Right now, you would all be in the back of a cop car.
And walk it like it's the real deal.<eos> 4 minutes, 54 seconds.<eos> Right now, you would all be in the back of a cop car.<eos> Your guns are only there for the worst-case scenario.<eos> You need to know how to shoot, but the last thing you want to do is shoot anybody.
Stand guard.<eos> Keep watch.<eos> You know how to handle a gun?<eos> (EXCLAIMS AND GRUNTS)<eos> The more you practice, the better you'll be.
Keep watch.<eos> You know how to handle a gun?<eos> (EXCLAIMS AND GRUNTS)<eos> The more you practice, the better you'll be.<eos> And come showtime, you will stroll out of that bank with more money than you've ever seen.
Thank you.<eos> You folks are popular.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the cocaine.<eos> You've got cocaine?
Yes.<eos> He's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck.<eos> May you enjoy every minute of every moment you have.
But I've run his picture through every facial recognition database I could tap into and the only other time he ever appears is in an NSA surveillance photo with sheik Muhammad al khabiri, a terrorist financier who's now enjoying a lifelong vacation<eos> in a CIA black prison somewhere.<eos> Something oddly familiar about him.<eos> Lemme guess.<eos> You rowed together at Oxford.
A girl's been kidnapped.<eos> In order to save her, we need to buy some of your gear.<eos> - We have cash.<eos> - We pay retail.<eos> - You two are okay. - All right.
So... what'd the doc say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> - Did you see armored's rolling out?
Fuckin' salt stains under my arm and shit.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> We've got fuckin' backup.<eos> You lose, motherfucker!
Do not play him.<eos> Turns out he's a goddamn prodigy.<eos> Come on.<eos> This one's me.<eos> Have you guys had much contact with the tribal leader?
Come on.<eos> This one's me.<eos> Have you guys had much contact with the tribal leader?<eos> Sheikh's a waste of time.<eos> You ladies are in here.
- Turn it up!<eos> No, all the way up!<eos> It's taking forever.<eos> That's as good as it gets.<eos> Well, can't you engineer, brain something up to make it go faster?
But if we don't have help, there's not gonna be any water.<eos> No water.<eos> Tell him, machmoud.<eos> No water.<eos> He say you destroyed the water, you fix it. It's your problem.
We're gonna pay, okay?<eos> We have money.<eos> We will pay.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> He say you don't understand him or his people.
Right, sergeant Harper?<eos> See how the soil won't clot?<eos> No water means it can't form. If it can't form, it can't be fertile.<eos> Even before you guys came here, sunni farmers in the north would steal the water from the shiites in baqubah.<eos> How'd you stop it from happening?
- Whoo! - I'm glad I'm not even watching you guys.<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> Let's go. Get back to your posts.<eos> You're good and clean.
- Yeah. The mission's a loser.<eos> Even machmoud knows it.<eos> He said they were fighting over the water before we got here.<eos> If we put it back to normal, that's just what normal is.<eos> Okay, guys, you got tonight. You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.
I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that. (giggles)<eos> - I'm here. - Took you long enough.<eos> - One center cut rare, three meatball subs, extra sauce, a hard boiled egg and a Kombucha.<eos> - I'm going to die a virgin and you don't even care. - Shh.<eos> - Are you guys selling band candy or something?
We know that there has been some bad blood between us throughout the years, but we are seniors now and there is no reason why we can't finish off the school year being civil to each other.<eos> We thought that if we came and spoke to you like adults, we could come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement.<eos> I applaud your courage.<eos> Okay. - Wait what?<eos> - It didn't occur to me until this exact moment that I kind of respect you.
Um I'm at school right now and you know, it is really, really not that bad.<eos> Oy vey. - Oh my god, have you seen Jodi's Instagram feed? Someone tagged a photo of her on a box of tampons.<eos> That is really not right.<eos> - Oh my god.<eos> - That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney. Even for you.
I mean, don't the ladies like it messy?<eos> - Oh, Herb.<eos> Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.<eos> (doorbell rings) - Oh no. - Relax.<eos> Awkward doesn't suit you. - Yes. No awkward.
(feet scuffling) (yelling)<eos> - Nerd fight! (record scratching)<eos> ("Green Equals Go" by The Phantoms) - [Mindy] No!<eos> (chuckles)<eos> - Where have you been? - In Europe, proms don't start until 11.

Simon.<eos> Simon!<eos> How could you let him go?<eos> I'm not finished yet. I'm not finished with him!<eos> The fuck are you staring at?
The Protestants won.<eos> But 400 years later, the uncompromising and victorious loyalists now feel estranged from the modern, secular United Kingdom.<eos> The sectarian songs have been banned, but they still gather and remain loyal to the victory of 1690, and to a simpler, less tolerant time.<eos> But if nothing else, history has shown us very clearly these are people whom it is unwise to provoke.<eos> You aren't from 'round here, are you, lads?
These are not goals. These are political statements.<eos> It's still there.<eos> I've been there myself several times.<eos> _ You know nothing. You understand nothing.<eos> _ You live in the past.
_ You know nothing. You understand nothing.<eos> _ You live in the past.<eos> _ Where I come from _ the past is something to forget<eos> _ but here it's all you talk about.<eos> _ You are clearly so in love with each other _ that I feel awkward in your company.
I'm his girlfriend, but it's business, really.<eos> Simon is not a good person.<eos> But I like him.<eos> More than he likes himself, I think.<eos> Right, but if you're not...
I ought to fucking kill you.<eos> Fuck is this?<eos> Get in.<eos> It's Mark and Simon, right?<eos> Do you know who I am?
- No, Mr. Doyle.<eos> - Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen. And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two,<eos> I've done some due diligence on you, and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.
"Place was empty, soon to be demolished."<eos> Some size o' station this was.<eos> Used to be steam engines to all over from here.<eos> "An old drunkard, whom Begbie had been looking at, "lurched up to us, wine bottle in his hand."<eos> What're you up to, lads, eh?
June.<eos> Franco Junior.<eos> Can I come in for a moment?<eos> There's something I have to do tonight, and then I'm going away.<eos> One way or another, it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Who's got her?<eos> A beast!<eos> A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!<eos> My daughter's life is in danger.<eos> Why do you laugh?
Winter in June?<eos> Crazy old Maurice!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> The beast is real.<eos> Do you understand?
Slow down before you break your handle.<eos> - Heads up, Mrs. Potts. - Oh.<eos> - Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!
Idiots!<eos> You can't talk to us like that. I forbid it.<eos> Am I too late?<eos> Shame, I was really going to tell him off this time.<eos> Oh, Master, you've returned.
It's dangerous!<eos> You have to help me.<eos> You have to stand.<eos> No! I'm sure this is the way.<eos> Do you hear those wolves?
"We should have a dance tonight." I never imagined she'd actually say yes.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> No, Master.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> The rose has only four petals left which means tonight... you can tell her how you feel.
Do not be discouraged.<eos> She is the one.<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that!<eos> There is no "one."<eos> You care for her, don't you?
Yes, and when the moment's just right...<eos> Well, how will I know?<eos> You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.
Well, how will I know?<eos> You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.
You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!
Thank you.<eos> Well, Master, I have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork.<eos> True love really does win the day!<eos> I let her go.<eos> You what?
Well, Master, I have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork.<eos> True love really does win the day!<eos> I let her go.<eos> You what?<eos> Master, how could you do that?
I told you!<eos> Sacré bleu!<eos> Invaders!<eos> Ruffians!<eos> Well, there you go.
Yes, pretty little boys.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> Go, be free!<eos> Be free. Be free!<eos> How do you like your tea?
Maestro, you were so brave.<eos> Goodbye, my love.<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> Chip!<eos> Have you seen Chip?
First aid.<eos> For bee sting we'll use mud, right, Josh?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mother, can not you even leave your seminary?<eos> Come on, you guys are gonna have fun!
I'll take it to my brother this weekend.<eos> He knows a therapist we could try, and...<eos> I thought maybe you could go along.<eos> I'm sure that's the last thing she wants.<eos> I think you'd better go.
Dreaming or not.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> I told you all about Josh, Kate, and Nan.<eos> But if you are real... Then you already know everything I will say. Even before I say it, right?
Want to take a look?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look at this one.<eos> Amazing.<eos> I understand that you are all connected.
Each one establishing what he thinks Be good and evil.<eos> And when his good is in conflict with the evil of the neighbor, Discussions arise.<eos> Wars explode.<eos> Because everyone insists on playing God.<eos> You should not do any of this.
What is that?<eos> It is not "what".<eos> And who".<eos> Children of the Pope of all languages, tribes and nations.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, We see it as color and light.
Kate needs you.<eos> She blames herself for Missy's death.<eos> You had to deal with your own guilt.<eos> But the time to blame is over.<eos> When I get back, I still want you in my life.
Father.<eos> He became a child again.<eos> Very well! Or maybe the child who never could be. Staying in confidence and wonder.<eos> I would not be surprised if, from time to time, Mack took off his shoes. Just to see if...<eos> Well, you know.
Harold Lamb.<eos> Oh, I know who Harold Lamb is.<eos> Oh, yeah. So you know the guy that draws Optimistic Owl.<eos> He knows me.<eos> Ladies, um, do you guys want to get a booth, maybe, um, talk about some poetry?
- You started the engine.<eos> - I didn't fucking start that!<eos> So who done it, then, bruv?<eos> I didn't start that!<eos> - I know what you did. - What the fuck?
- Stop fucking revving the car, bruv!<eos> Hey, yo, there's smoke coming from the car, fam!<eos> Open the fucking door!<eos> There's smoke coming out!<eos> - Why did you attack the Walkers? - We got told to!
They're gone.<eos> Oi, they're gone.<eos> That was fucking close, bruv.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You fucked up.
- What happened was fucked up, I admit...<eos> - You don't get to talk about it!<eos> Fuck you, Ant!<eos> Fuck all of you!<eos> Tell me you're ashamed.
- Honestly, I'm ashamed.<eos> - I'm ashamed.<eos> I swear that I'm ashamed.<eos> - No!<eos> You're scared!
- I'm ashamed.<eos> I swear that I'm ashamed.<eos> - No!<eos> You're scared!<eos> If you were ashamed, you wouldn't be able to even look at me.
I don't know what happened to you.<eos> Well...<eos> I have to admit I was expecting you to be rather more restrained than this, young lady.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Boys, can you come out here, please?
Gonna get some green for this shit right here, homes.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Those are chrome-plated lugs.<eos> You're gonna strip them.
That's what these are for.<eos> Eating his curds and whey.<eos> Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her. And frightened Miss Muffet...<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!<eos> It's not about what you do.

Friends, I have good news for you today!<eos> It's not about what you do.<eos> It's not about your deeds.<eos> You can't live up to God's rules.<eos> He knows that you can't.
No, not so much.<eos> Less.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Hey, what is it?<eos> Where did you get that?
Hey! Hey, pal.<eos> How long have I been out?<eos> How long have I been in that bed?<eos> Two days.<eos> You've been sitting here for two days?
How long have I been in that bed?<eos> Two days.<eos> You've been sitting here for two days?<eos> Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.<eos> You can't do that. You can't just stay here.
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.<eos> We had to wait.<eos> It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.
We had to wait.<eos> It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.<eos> You need to get out!
She says it's yours.<eos> That's why you did it, right?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Look, I don't need it.<eos> You do, okay?
Oh, yeah.<eos> Wait up!<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> You hold it right there.
Shit don't even voice activate.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up. You're moving on.
"It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up. You're moving on.<eos> For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.<eos> So, um, I want you to remember something.
I know.<eos> It's gonna be epic!<eos> Whoa!<eos> What's happening here?<eos> You don't just come on my field mowing nothing.
Principal Tyler said we have to mow here.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for you.
- For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for you!
I'm... I'm sorry, though. Who else knows about this?<eos> You guys hear Strickland is gonna fight Campbell?<eos> Yeah, he's gonna whip him bad.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> What are you guys doing now?
Without a doubt.<eos> What are you guys doing now?<eos> We just chalking the field.<eos> Well, your lines are a little off, but I appreciate the hard work, kids.<eos> Let me tell you something. Kids your age sometimes can turn out to be douchebags, but you guys come from good stock.
No!<eos> - Dude, let's go!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> You guys are not allowed to leave campus.
- Dude, let's go!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> You guys are not allowed to leave campus.<eos> You need the proper paperwork to leave!
- Hey!<eos> - What?<eos> - I know! What are you...<eos> What is this?<eos> Why are you guys here?
You're the nice guy, and then people are like, "Hey, I'm gonna stomp on that guy."<eos> You're spinning out, okay? Everything really is okay.<eos> I don't know why you don't believe me.<eos> Just 'cause you're acting kinda nervous and...<eos> Well, you caught me off guard!
- All right.<eos> - Look, why?<eos> Because actions have consequences, and everybody around here seem to forget about that.<eos> These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.
Yeah, you ratted on me.<eos> Now you got to pay the price.<eos> I'mma kick yo' ass at the end of the day in front of everybody.<eos> And you can consider this my final lesson.<eos> Yeah, you guys should fucking fight.
You're a grown man. Now go on and take that ass-whoopin'.<eos> I'm asking you for help and...<eos> Fuck!<eos> It takes courage... To become...<eos> People when you're older.
Your teachers are fucking nuts!<eos> Man, this is fucked up. He's having a breakdown.<eos> - We can't prank him.<eos> - Shh!<eos> And you're gonna say, "Hey, I'm a nice guy.
This shit is getting violent.<eos> I look like a fucking minion!<eos> Holy cow!<eos> They got both of you, huh?<eos> Man, I gotta get pranked. All right, you know what?
I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> I thought you guys knew how it worked.
How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.<eos> Well, if you do, you should have told me.
Hey!<eos> It's a bloodbath in there.<eos> Holly, Ms. Monet... We all got fired.<eos> No!<eos> You, too?
Raees, you read.<eos> Read!<eos> Gujarat...<eos> - ln the north of Gujarat... - Come here<eos> I don't want to, but you boys compel me to beat you. Hush.
We women must work to make ends meet.<eos> Help us, Raees.<eos> We want to buy sewing machines and fend for ourselves.<eos> But the banks aren't giving us loans.<eos> Can you make bags?
But the banks aren't giving us loans.<eos> Can you make bags?<eos> Bags?<eos> That's not a big deal.<eos> All right then, I will give you sewing machines.
It's a fantastic scheme, Raees.<eos> - Right, friends? - Of course.<eos> But the amount is too big for all of us.<eos> Qasim, who is asking for the entire amount?<eos> You don't need to pay the entire amount now.
Qasim, who is asking for the entire amount?<eos> You don't need to pay the entire amount now.<eos> You have to pay only half the amount.<eos> And the rest in ten years.<eos> You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years ls ten years too short a period?
You have to pay only half the amount.<eos> And the rest in ten years.<eos> You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years ls ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive I guarantee you.<eos> This is my neighbourhood, you are my people.
You can pay in monthly installments for the next ten years ls ten years too short a period?<eos> Don't worry, don't be apprehensive I guarantee you.<eos> This is my neighbourhood, you are my people.<eos> You own your house from the very first day.<eos> All of you will get the deeds of agreement. I guarantee you that.
- Pick up the swine's family!<eos> - We are innocent! - Please let us go!<eos> - Find each one of them!<eos> Where's Raees?<eos> Thrash all of them till you find Raees!
Merry Christmas!<eos> I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.<eos> You know what happened to the other one.<eos> Miss me?<eos> 'Did you miss me?
I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.<eos> You know what happened to the other one.<eos> Miss me?<eos> 'Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
- Catherine.<eos> - Uh, yeah, we've gone off that. Have we? - Yeah.<eos> - Oh. - Well, you know what I think...<eos> - It's not a girl's name.<eos> Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.<eos> - Must feel very different...<eos> - Sorry, what?<eos> Yes, well, you know how it is. All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.<eos> - Are you two having a little joke?
What kind of a life would that be?<eos> Besides, I have the strangest feeling...<eos> Miss me?<eos> - That's mine.<eos> You two take a... bus.
- Oh, hi, Stella.<eos> - Greg.<eos> You, uh...?<eos> - Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so... - Right, right, right...<eos> Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
- No one. - Or they're very, very small.<eos> - Zero, charges set.<eos> - Roger.<eos> Out. Sending the heli to RV2 now.<eos> You need to make your way through the lab building to the rear exit.
I'm afraid the rage on this is just getting started.<eos> Aggy, where's the chopper?<eos> 30 seconds out, Stratton.<eos> Hold on. Come on! Hold it tight.<eos> Did you find anything I didn't report?
Look, here's what I think. If you were going to arrest me, I would already be on a transport to an American pit where they would pour water down my throat, but here I am, so why don't you just get to the point?<eos> We need information.<eos> You were hired to build a biological weapon recently.<eos> Look, I am not gonna bullshit you.<eos> I know what you do. You know what I do.
Then don't do it.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You see over there?<eos> That's what you're looking for.
I wanna say this is the longest nightmare that I have ever had.<eos> But I just... I don't know what happened.<eos> Atleast... Atleast we're here together.<eos> Can you please close the blinds?<eos> Where did you all go?
May I have some water?<eos> Yes, of course. Can you get him water, please?<eos> My name is Riley.<eos> My name is Nance.<eos> Do you have any food?
Let's get some food.<eos> Here, come sit here.<eos> We thought we were alone.<eos> So... There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.
They say that god only...<eos> He just must have more to say these days.<eos> Well it's still good to know that we're not alone.<eos> We hadn't been alone. It's worse.<eos> You and I.
SLIVKO:<eos> You hear that, boys?<eos> We're scientists now!<eos> (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)<eos> You guys are not scientists.
BROOKS:<eos> An emergence point for whatever lives below.<eos> Ancient species like what we just saw.<eos> I thought he was out of his mind.<eos> This is Slivko. Do you read?
This is Slivko. Do you read?<eos> Anybody out there?<eos> We're headed north to the exfil location.<eos> Everyone here seems way too calm right now.<eos> Do you copy?
Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> (MARLOW CHUCKLING)<eos> You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.
Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> (MARLOW CHUCKLING)<eos> You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.<eos> But you're real.
(ROARING)<eos> (CHAPMAN YELPS)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> MARLOW:<eos> You probably noticed a lot of weird things on this island.
There's no crime, no personal property.<eos> They're past all that.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> So, good news.<eos> They say you can shack up here.
- I like the name, so...<eos> - That seems like a great name.<eos> I've never said that name out loud before.<eos> It sounds stupid now that I say it.<eos> You call them whatever you want.
They come from the vents deep down.<eos> That's why Kong got so mad.<eos> (ROARS)<eos> Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.<eos> I tell you what. You're lucky he's out there, too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.
- We're gonna get out of here.<eos> - In three days?<eos> - Yes.<eos> (BOTH LAUGH)<eos> You can't get to the north end in three days.
That was something.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> That thing looks like it's made out of pure tetanus.<eos> I know she ain't pretty to look at, but it's nothing a couple of extra hands can't fix.<eos> Unless you got a better idea, I suggest we get cracking.
(ALL LAUGHING)<eos> (GASPS)<eos> I guess this is goodbye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're ever in Chicago, look me up, I guess.
MARLOW:<eos> This is a good group of boys.<eos> We're all gonna die together out here.<eos> You're a good group of boys to die with, I'll tell you that much.<eos> (LAUGHS) You shouldn't have come here.
(LAUGHS) You shouldn't have come here.<eos> Don't forget to tell me this is a bad idea.<eos> This is a bad idea.<eos> MARLOW:<eos> Yeah, you smell that?
Ants. Big ones.<eos> There's one.<eos> Sounds like a bird, but it's a fucking ant.<eos> PACKARD:<eos> Gather up everything you can, including those seismic charges.
It's that way.<eos> Wait for us till dawn.<eos> If we're not back by then, just go.<eos> (SCOFFS) You ain't gotta twist my arm.<eos> Where are you two going?
Hey.<eos> (COUGHING)<eos> You're okay.<eos> (WEAVER BREATHING SHAKILY)<eos> So what do you think, fellas?
Roll up your sleeves.<eos> Come on, roll up.<eos> This is obscene.<eos> All I'm doing, Faith dear... - ...is getting something off my chest. Without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you. But... You will forget it.
All I'm doing, Faith dear... - ...is getting something off my chest. Without getting it on yours.<eos> What you're about to hear me say may horrify you. But... You will forget it.<eos> If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your blood streams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.
I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be... corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal. And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.
I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal. And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.
Please, be aware that one of you is a high ranking police officer.<eos> One of you is a member of the judiciary.<eos> One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.<eos> Two of you work for me. And one of you of course, is my lovely daughter. Faith.<eos> You are the people I need to hear me.
My God. I love your blog.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Right.<eos> Here he comes. The internet tech.<eos> You all know Sherlock Holmes.
No one's untouchable.<eos> No one?<eos> Look at you all.<eos> So gloomy.<eos> Can't you take a joke?
Well, there must've been some build-up. He didn't just suddenly do it.<eos> Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel.<eos> Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> -But I thought you two were, were old friends!
Shot me during a session.<eos> - Only with a tranquiliser. - Mmm.<eos> Still had 10 minutes to go.<eos> Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.
Also, cowboys in black hats.<eos> Darth Vader.<eos> Don't be alarmed.<eos> I'm here now, I'm here now.<eos> Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
No!<eos> You all right?<eos> Interesting.<eos> All right, there you go. You got what you wanted. - And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.
And the driver's asleep.<eos> No, I understand, but... Where did you come from?<eos> Where did the plane take off?<eos> My nan's.<eos> And where are you going?
Victor Trevor.<eos> We played pirates.<eos> I was Yellowbeard and he was...<eos> He was Redbeard.<eos> You were inseparable.
What do we do now?<eos> Uh, yeah. I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S. I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.<eos> Because I know who you really are.
That's awful!<eos> Bad news, baby!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.
- Genius!<eos> - Home run!<eos> You still got it, boss!<eos> Yay. Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.<eos> So have you learned anything from them?
- A.<eos> - B.<eos> - C.<eos> - D.<eos> No, what have you learned about the new puppy?
- Weeks!<eos> Weeks! Three weeks!<eos> For three... evers!<eos> Grounded?<eos> You're gonna stay in this house with your baby brother... until you learn to get along.
So this whole place is run by babies?<eos> Yep. My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?
So help me, I will nail his diaper to the wall!<eos> Have we heard anything from that little Boss Baby... that we sent down to the T empletons?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You're fired!<eos> You're all fired!
- Get back here!<eos> - No!<eos> No way.<eos> Come on!<eos> Tim, what are you doing in here?
- So cute.<eos> - That's so sweet.<eos> Way to keep your eyes on the prize, Templeton.<eos> We find out what the new puppy is, and I go home.<eos> You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?
Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified... in-house childcare expert.<eos> - Don't be nervous, buddy.<eos> - It's only overnight.<eos> We'll be back before you know it.<eos> Besides, you boys are in great hands.
Believe me...<eos> Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.
My parents always hold my hand during takeoff.<eos> Boy, the stocks are crazy today.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.<eos> As you can see, I've switched off the seat belt sign.<eos> What are you two boys doi ng up here?
Right.<eos> Excuse me, ladies.<eos> Can we get a ride home?<eos> Jimmy's been sick, and he needs his expensive medicine.<eos> Where do you live, sweetie?
- We won?<eos> - We won, we won, we won! - We won!<eos> Yes!<eos> Victory nap!<eos> You ruined everything!
Victory nap!<eos> You ruined everything!<eos> It's not fair! It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.<eos> Impeccable, both physically and mentally.<eos> We control the DNA of our progeny... germinating them in birthing pods.<eos> I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.<eos> Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson... in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
Family reunion.<eos> Yay. I understand she is your sister.<eos> She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.<eos> Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.<eos> Do with her as you please.
That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.<eos> An unorthodox genealogy.<eos> A hybrid that seems particularly... reckless.<eos> You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags... but that isn't true at all.
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
You son of a...<eos> Hey! - I've had it with you!<eos> - No!<eos> Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.<eos> Set me free, you'll need my help.
It made it easier for thieving'.<eos> Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.<eos> I thought Yondu was your father.<eos> We've been together this whole time... and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?<eos> You look exactly alike.
I don't know where I came from exactly.<eos> First thing I remember is flickering... adrift in the cosmos utterly... and entirely alone.<eos> Over millions of years... I learned to control the molecules around me.<eos> I grew smarter and stronger.<eos> And I continued building from there... layer by layer... the very planet you walk on now.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> You're scum!
Listen!<eos> Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.<eos> I should have told you earlier.<eos> I'm stupid.<eos> You are in danger.
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.<eos> All right, okay!<eos> Good.<eos> Wait. Fight a what?<eos> Who are you people?
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.<eos> Ego will have won him to his side by now.<eos> - Then we just go.<eos> - No! - He's our friend.<eos> - All any of you do... is yell at each other.
Ego will have won him to his side by now.<eos> - Then we just go.<eos> - No! - He's our friend.<eos> - All any of you do... is yell at each other.<eos> You are not friends.
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.<eos> You said you were gonna eat me.<eos> That was being funny!<eos> Not to me!<eos> You people have issues.
We.<eos> Are.<eos> Groot.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Wait, where are you going?
Are.<eos> Groot.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> You were supposed to be my lift home.
Gardner, you need to come with me now!<eos> No.<eos> We're here to help!<eos> You're putting yourself in great danger!<eos> Why can't you just leave me alone!
You're my father.<eos> Is this some kind of scam?<eos> No, he's not lying.<eos> It's the truth, I swear.<eos> I just wanted to meet you. Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, how scary is that?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I could never do that. Look... Just to meet you.<eos> And he's dying.<eos> I don't know who you are, or why you're doing this.
Animal Magic!<eos> He's the "very healthy" guy!<eos> All the other super pigs were on flat land, accessible by car.<eos> Japan's one was five minutes from the airport.<eos> And you... I notice that you had to leave the fucking mountaintop super pig till the end, because you knew that the climb would rile me.
You sent them the money!<eos> Actually... they wouldn't let me buy Okja.<eos> So I bought you this gold pig instead.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Hey, did you hear that?
Are you ready to meet the winner of this contest?<eos> Yeah!<eos> The best super pig on the face of the earth?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Are you ready?
Yeah!<eos> The best super pig on the face of the earth?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to meet somebody else first.
Two-Face!<eos> We need that door open, baby!<eos> Catwoman.<eos> Meow, meow.<eos> You're in!
♪ Ladies, it's okay if you stare ♪<eos> ♪ Why? ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause I'm a billionaire ♪<eos> Get it together, guys!<eos> You're making me look bad in front of Batman!
Hey, Mom.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I saved the city again today.<eos> I wish you could have seen me.
Let's hear it for Batman!<eos> Who I wish was here right now.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's listening.<eos> I'd like to ask all of you a question.<eos> Are you fed up with crime?
I'm a really bad person.<eos> But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?
Over here.<eos> Oh, leave that to me.<eos> Don't wanna jinx us, but I'll be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight.<eos> Going up, ma'am?<eos> No. You're going down!
Oh. Could live without it.<eos> Engine four!<eos> That I do need to fix.<eos> Good news. Our bathroom problem is solved.<eos> You three wait here while I go fix the engine.
We need to help him.<eos> I'm with you, Grandpa!<eos> Get off my Padre!<eos> Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.<eos> What are you two doing here?
You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What? Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.<eos> Guys, you're all un-timeouted!
- So, guys, listen up!<eos> Taking the Projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.<eos> - A family battle mission!<eos> - Right.<eos> Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.
Respect!<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,<eos> "I hate you, Joker"?<eos> Not once.<eos> Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.
I think I'm ready.<eos> We are disappointed.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> There are discussions about your loyalty.<eos> Why? I'm doing everything you ask.
Enough!<eos> The dojo is a place of respect.<eos> And who the hell are you?<eos> Maybe you wanna test me and find out.<eos> You chatter like monkeys.
We don't want you here.<eos> listen... okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.<eos> You can't deny what's mine. What my father meant for me to have.
How did they get this?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Did you steal it?<eos> That is immaterial.<eos> You know that it will hold up in court.
you double my payday.<eos> you know that?<eos> But I like you.<eos> You ready for the fight of your life?<eos> You better be! Hey!
Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?<eos> I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?
Are you willing to kill Danny Rand so that the Iron Fist might live?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> When does the real warrior get here?<eos> These childish insults are getting tiring.<eos> It's like you all trained on the same playground.
You know what to do.
Have you stopped to consider that this idea totally sucks?<eos> It doesn't suck, okay?<eos> Kinda harsh, Claire.<eos> Not really.<eos> For all you know, you're walking into a trap in Angjo...
I'm going, too.<eos> This isn't just your fight, Danny.<eos> They came at me in my home.<eos> They attacked my hospital. They killed my friend.<eos> I don't want you guys in any more danger.
That's gonna be one awkward-ass flight.<eos> Look, I don't know, okay?<eos> It's a long way to China.<eos> I'll figure it out before we get there.<eos> If you don't trust me, then don't come.
- I don't know. - Say it.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - We're gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're such children.
You're safe.<eos> You okay, there?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> "The frog in the well never understands the sea."<eos> Where are you taking him?
When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed.<eos> Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> You were just teenagers.
You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile. You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
I bet he did.<eos> are you hungry?<eos> I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> I guess you guys don't order a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.
Why would you think that? like a komodo dragon?<eos> Or like Pete's Dragon?<eos> I don't... I don't know who Pete is.<eos> But think infinite.<eos> So do you have to kill it?
Calmed the storm inside me.<eos> - I've seen Danny do that.<eos> - It's how we were trained.<eos> You don't let emotions cloud your actions.<eos> So you just... lock it all away.
You let me think that I was actually doing something to stop them.<eos> We were.<eos> okay?<eos> I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?
right?<eos> No.<eos> No more traps. No more interrogations.<eos> This has to be done the way it should have been from the start.<eos> You're talking about murder.
Seriously?<eos> Where's Bakuto?<eos> Are we still in the compound?<eos> Is this detention?<eos> Why won't you answer me?
She's running from them.<eos> - She's on our side.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Then she can help us blow up the whole compound with Bakuto and his minions inside.<eos> You can't do that.
She's still with them!<eos> - This asshole was your best friend?<eos> - Look, just calm down!<eos> The both of you!<eos> - You're behaving like animals.
Done.<eos> - Can Joy and I leave now?<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.
Danny said he's coming.<eos> He will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes to go.<eos> Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.
How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> Good. What hospital are you at?
Nothing.<eos> Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.<eos> you know me...
It was wrong for me to leave the way that I did.<eos> I also need to complete my training.<eos> There's still so much I don't know about being an Iron Fist.<eos> look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.
look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.<eos> that's... not a good thing.<eos> Your first instinct to a problem is to respond with violence.<eos> I guess what I'm saying here is... you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.
And if this turns out to be a bust... I promise...<eos> I'll let it go... Forever.<eos> Fine.<eos> I wanna see the map.<eos> You guys are the best.
My grandpa was the key founder of the science museum.<eos> That probably means whatever this key unlocks is in that building.<eos> And these blueprints are for the science museum.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, easy there, kids.<eos> Did you not see the sign that says, "no running".
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, easy there, kids.<eos> Did you not see the sign that says, "no running".<eos> Where do you think you are, an amusement park?<eos> Don't answer that, son. That's a rhetorical question.<eos> You are in a museum of science, a hallowed institution for learned people.
You're one of those.<eos> one of those kids who thinks they get a free pass in life.<eos> That's your generation.<eos> My generation had to grow up way faster than yours.<eos> You don't know what it's like to have to pay your dues.
Sweetheart, we don't talk about that.<eos> Barf-o-rama.<eos> All right, listen, I've got to get back to work.<eos> You guys have fun, okay?<eos> -Okay. -I'm so glad you're here.
I did the cooking tonight, so get ready to enjoy.<eos> What'd you make, mom?<eos> Paella.<eos> I think.<eos> You know, sweetie, it was really nice to see you guys today. You haven't been coming down lately.
Adventure Club!<eos> So, good to see you guys.<eos> To what do I owe the honor of this little visit?<eos> Can I guess?<eos> You want to get a gift.
So, good to see you guys.<eos> To what do I owe the honor of this little visit?<eos> Can I guess?<eos> You want to get a gift.<eos> You need the perfect present for the perfect person who has perfectly everything from this perfect store.
You need the perfect present for the perfect person who has perfectly everything from this perfect store.<eos> It is the perfect store.<eos> This is our favorite shop.<eos> I know.<eos> You're my favorites. My best customers.
Why?<eos> What is the meaning of the interest in this matter?<eos> No reason, really.<eos> Just idle curiosity.<eos> Well... You know what?
We can't just give up now.<eos> What?<eos> What about what Ozzie said?<eos> Ozzie is a grownup. He's being overly cautious.<eos> You know how adults can get.
Like save the science museum.<eos> We grew up going to that place our whole lives.<eos> It's gave us so much.<eos> This is an opportunity to give something back.<eos> Besides, aren't you curious?
Ricky.<eos> Ricky, wait! Listen, sweetheart, I am giving my speech to the municipality tonight for the science museum, and it would really mean so much to me if you were there, okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> Slow down!<eos> Can you believe it?
-Yeah?<eos> I've got to go back to the science museum to finish some stuff up for the fundraiser tomorrow.<eos> -We'll be fine.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Okay. All right. Clean up when you're finished, okay, sweetie?
They're clear across town.<eos> And the hero enters riding on his hipster jeans.<eos> Okay, Langley, you win.<eos> You take this and get the heck outta here.<eos> You two know each other?
-No, I didn't.<eos> -Yes, you did.<eos> No, I didn't. Look, well, if I did, I lied.<eos> Just chalk it up to a valuable lesson in a life of crime.<eos> You guys wait here.
He told me that all I had to do was get close to this woman... And her son and find out anything I could, and if I did that, then he'd let me go free forever.<eos> It seemed so easy.<eos> That is until I met that woman... And her son.<eos> Hey, you blew it, kid.<eos> You had your chance. You haven't heard the last of me, Ricky Martin.
Is there anything else I need to know?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, let's be honest, I was never a very good criminal anyway.<eos> I mean, look at me. I just wanted to say, good job. And that I'm sorry for everything.<eos> You guys were right.
In fact, we did a lot of work with your grandfather.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Someone you know thought that maybe we should meet.<eos> It's really nice seeing you follow in your grandfather's footsteps.<eos> All of you, keep up the good work.
What's happening?<eos> All units, we got a 10-66.<eos> Requesting backup immediately.<eos> - I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can. Hey!
All units, we got a 10-66.<eos> Requesting backup immediately.<eos> - I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can. Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?
- I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can. Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?<eos> - Shit!<eos> - You're not gonna steal from my store!
It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why do these people have a picture of K'un-Lun?<eos> And what else did they know?<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> You guys start over there.
I can't help you if you won't tell me who.<eos> I should never have come here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You can't have this.
Now!<eos> Hey there, assholes.<eos> - You with the Hand?<eos> - No!<eos> - What are you doing in there?
All of their power stems from their ability to bring back the dead.<eos> Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
- Bad news.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Elektra?<eos> Come on.<eos> Who are you people?
No, but you should worry about the possibility of death.<eos> From what I hear, we all should be worried.<eos> We're close now.<eos> And the Iron Fist has returned to New York.<eos> I heard you were unable to secure him.
Past tense.<eos> He's retired.<eos> You know what? We are not talking about this, all right?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.
- Not much longer.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because this is happening.<eos> What are you doing in New York?<eos> There's nothing you can do to make me betray my own.
- Put us through brutal trials.<eos> It's called discipline.<eos> It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.
It's called discipline.<eos> It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.
Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.<eos> Believe me, this will drown you.<eos> What do you want with our city?
It always has.<eos> - What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?
- What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?<eos> Nothing you can do can make me serve you. Do you understand?
- Why do you want Danny Rand?<eos> Nothing you can do can make me serve you. Do you understand?<eos> Do I understand?<eos> You are the dumbest Iron Fist yet.<eos> Tell me what you want with me.
Afraid and alone.<eos> The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?
The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?
I wouldn't say that.<eos> When you're done with that, I'd like to talk.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?
We have our weapon.<eos> Let's talk about your weapon.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> What did you do to Elektra?<eos> You dug up her grave.
Not on my watch.<eos> Hey, stop. You can't undo this.<eos> Admit it.<eos> - Elektra's still in there.<eos> You failed.
What do you mean?<eos> To keep the Iron Fist as far from them as possible.<eos> It sounds crazy, but I don't think we have any other way.<eos> I dedicated my life to this fight.<eos> You need me.
And how do you know?<eos> His heartbeat didn't waver. Not for a second.<eos> And where was his heartbeat when he came up behind me?<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> You know how they can operate.
Listen, Stick, maybe we should just... uh, let him lay low, or just...<eos> Maybe we should just hide him.<eos> We're running out of time!<eos> They're hunting our friends, our families, and they're not gonna stop there.<eos> You heard what he said.
I've already lost one city.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna try and keep me here against my will?
This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.<eos> You fight to defeat us.<eos> We fight to get back what was once ours.<eos> And what is it that you want?
We fight to get back what was once ours.<eos> And what is it that you want?<eos> To return to K'un-Lun.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You destroyed it.
We are not the same.<eos> I know.<eos> But in the end... and this is the end... you'll do what everyone else does for me.<eos> You'll serve.<eos> Where are you taking me?
Do not underestimate me!<eos> Kill Luke Cage.<eos> Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.
I was able to keep the most important operation in our history running while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.<eos> I have proven myself to be the one and only true leader...<eos> His name is Matthew.<eos> And my name... is Elektra Natchios.<eos> You work for me now.
Is that a challenge?<eos> We will do what is needed to preserve our organization.<eos> This is not our first coup.<eos> It is your first without the substance.<eos> Is that a gamble you're willing to take?
- Unfortunately.<eos> We're here for Danny Rand.<eos> The Iron Fist belongs to us.<eos> Well, we're not leaving here without him.<eos> Then I guess you're not leaving.
- What happened here?<eos> No time to explain.<eos> - Like hell there isn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> You got a minute before the full force of the NYPD is here.
This is our chance to shut 'em down for good.<eos> They will come back.<eos> Again and again.<eos> But these could end them forever.<eos> I get that you have a history with these people.
The more I think about it, the less I like our odds.<eos> Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...<eos> For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.
I shouldn't know what my friend sounds like when he's having sex.<eos> I'd rather hear him screaming while he burned in a fire.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Just get some water.<eos> Uh, I... I didn't know you were here.
Sorry to surprise you here.<eos> We didn't... - We didn't mean to...<eos> - Oh, it's cool.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you, uh...
Okay.<eos> What are you, uh...<eos> Sorry. - I'm just super out of breath. Uh...<eos> - Oh. It's okay.<eos> How long have you guys been here?
Whoa! God, man, I feel like I'm in a video game right now.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> This is, like, unreal right now.<eos> - God, it's so weird...<eos> - What are you two doing?
I feel like I forced you to come out here and now you're stuck.<eos> It's fine, dude. You didn't force me to do anything.<eos> Hey. Let's take this conversation to the conversation pit.<eos> - Hey, look at that now.<eos> - Oh, you guys have a telescope.
Think about all the people who are fucking tonight. - Yeah.<eos> - Like, nine months from now, there's gonna be all these Springwood lockdown babies running around.<eos> Hey, guys, what if we took this up on the roof? And maybe I could find, like, a route to my car.<eos> Yeah, sure, I like that idea.<eos> What do you think?
God, it's nights like this I wish I had a remote-control drone.<eos> - Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go to the left. Go to the left.<eos> Hey, what the fuck are you two doing down there?
- Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go to the left. Go to the left.<eos> Hey, what the fuck are you two doing down there?<eos> Are you crazy?
- Thanks for doing this, holt.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Gentlemen, get ready to be kicked, bitten and bucked off.<eos> The most important lesson you can learn here is Patience.<eos> These are wild animals, they've never interacted with humans before, so you're going to have to earn their trust and respect.
- Good luck.<eos> Gentlemen, get ready to be kicked, bitten and bucked off.<eos> The most important lesson you can learn here is Patience.<eos> These are wild animals, they've never interacted with humans before, so you're going to have to earn their trust and respect.<eos> You're gonna be handling them, training them.
But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.<eos> Today you will be shoveling their shit.<eos> All right, gentlemen, follow me to your pile.<eos> Good, kick it up there.<eos> All right, boys, about 40 more of these and you're done.
Good enough for me.<eos> But if you're still waffling', buddy, take a look at this.<eos> Looks like your new security system overloaded the junction boxes, Ms. Stella.<eos> Thank you, Colton, I'll fix those immediately.<eos> Don't you people have jobs?
- Where are the horses?<eos> What, you were supposed to save the horses.<eos> You are in over your head.<eos> I suggest that you find a less expensive hobby and stop wasting my damn time!<eos> You have not failed.
He's gonna be fine.<eos> He has to be okay.<eos> We haven't had any time.<eos> We need to have more time.<eos> You're going to have plenty of time.
And he is happy with you.<eos> And that's all i ever wanted.<eos> Turn it up. Newsreader".<eos> Christian grey and his colleague ros Bailey have been found safe and well and are, at this moment, on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell are you all doing here? Christian?
Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.<eos> I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.<eos> I was expecting a small family gathering.<eos> Thanks, Mia.<eos> But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.
Forever Young,<eos> I make people around wondering, so I moved,<eos> And I continue to live,<eos> So what's still super powers do you have?<eos> You see,
Prepare helicopter, We're there,<eos> I see you again,<eos> Good morning my friends, You look alright,<eos> There was a time when we happy together,<eos> You forget, I know all your weaknesses, Kuratov,
The attack is ready,<eos> Tornado rocket attack them, Wait,<eos> Guardian is still in there,<eos> I need more time, I had an important task for them,<eos> You certainly would never have my offer,
The government gave the house as well as repairs to damaged homes,<eos> I think silence is golden,<eos> The silence I think is very valuable,<eos> They want to know, you have proof, ,<eos> You guys are awesome, but not only the super powers that make you great,
Pull the seats the doors the battery..<eos> It ain't the motor, take it off<eos> - Laughing gas?<eos> - Nah, Fed. This is cuban NOS.<eos> You guys are crazy
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone<eos> They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got<eos> So, we wanna engage with maximum speed<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got<eos> So, we wanna engage with maximum speed<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind<eos> Number one, I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed<eos> Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective<eos> There are two things I want you to keep in mind<eos> Number one, I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet<eos> And number two, You go out there, you do your job. And you take 'em down
Bomb's away<eos> Split now!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> - Great plan Tez<eos> - Just so you know You miss some
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done<eos> We're not... teaming up with this guy<eos> Let's get one thing clear<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, you crew... Your little family.
We find Toretto together as a team<eos> When this is all over, you have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face<eos> Wait a minute, guys.<eos> I think Decker's actually onto something<eos> How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
But just before we get into all of that, Let me ask you one question<eos> - You can ask me anything<eos> - Anything<eos> What's my last name?<eos> When you guys figured it out, then I guess you can let me know
And now.. he always will be<eos> I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe<eos> Who will never give up on me<eos> He's beatiful<eos> You've heard me say. "That you never turn your back on family"
No, it's cool.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Did you get my message?<eos> - What message?<eos> The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
- Yeah, come on in.<eos> - After you.<eos> - Yeah, welcome, welcome.<eos> Mi casa... Heh heh.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
Go check the drawer.<eos> The odds-and-ends drawer.<eos> All right, I'm just saying be specific.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> Can I get you guys something? Are you sure?
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?<eos> Here's an idea. Maybe you could sort it out with them - at your favorite strip joint...<eos> - That happened at a bachelor party! They're strippers!<eos> They climb all over you! You can't stop them!<eos> You guys know!
- Gary, it's fine.<eos> - I mean, you know, we're not even... - I know. We're not, but still, I promise you on my...<eos> I wouldn't... And, Mr. Gallo, - I would never...<eos> - Yeah, good. I'll rest easy now.<eos> You guys are the best.
- No, never.<eos> - It's a little bit too, like...<eos> - Axe body spray?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?
Hey, I heard you guys are playing this weekend, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I don't know if that's gonna happen.<eos> - Yeah, I saw you play, like... like a year ago at the River Room.<eos> You were really good, kind of like...
- Bye-bye.<eos> Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?<eos> Yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.<eos> - I don't know what your problem is with me.<eos> - I told you guys about Marty here, right?
Hey, did you find Ginnie? Was she at the cafe?<eos> - No.<eos> - Aw, bummer.<eos> Bummer.<eos> - You don't think she got kidnapped?
- I can't get unbuckled.<eos> - Gary, just stay with the car.<eos> Windows are dark.<eos> Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.<eos> When you and Ginnie lived together, where did you hide the spare key?
- I will fucking murder you! - You don't know her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't fucking know her.<eos> I will fucking kill you!<eos> Do you hear that, you motherfucker? ! I have a gun!
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Nice work, guys.<eos> I love you!<eos> All right, you two.
Yeah, I...<eos> Martin, would you please open your eyes?<eos> - That girl is clearly here for you.<eos> - We met up before the show.<eos> - Did you, now? - Yeah.
A good man!<eos> Behold!<eos> A man of his calling!<eos> Behold, a witness to God's deep love for us all.<eos> Mrs. Geary, I do not wish to be indelicate, but did you pay the grave-diggers the extra shilling?
Sir?<eos> Mr. Delaney, is it?<eos> Sir?<eos> - James Delaney, is it?<eos> - Who are you?
See, I have the advantage, I have read the will.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning I need to piss and need no-one to hold my cock.<eos> Begging the lady's pardon.<eos> How came you to know that your father was dead?
Hear that?<eos> Bile and bitterness.<eos> Not a single tear from anyone at the graveside.<eos> I didn't hear any piss at the leather.<eos> Perhaps you had no need, or perhaps you came out here with-- With a purpose?
Not a single tear from anyone at the graveside.<eos> I didn't hear any piss at the leather.<eos> Perhaps you had no need, or perhaps you came out here with-- With a purpose?<eos> James...<eos> - Who are you?
James...<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.<eos> Smallpox butchered me down to the bone and, yes, I have other business than pissing.<eos> You know, in all of London, only your father believed you were still alive.
But he would talk to you, stand on the north bank of the river and call out to you on the other side.<eos> Yes, I know, I heard him calling.<eos> I'll speak plainly. Your father drew up a will of which I am executor.<eos> In it, you are his only heir.<eos> But, James, if you came home expecting fortune, there is none.
Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.<eos> And if you are ever short of two shillings, please do not hesitate to ask, as Africa also served me incredibly well.<eos> Well, then you will have no need for legacies now, will you?
If the will has not been read and Nootka is so strategic to us, why don't we just... burn it?<eos> Even if I did, the son would have natural priority over the daughter, according to God's law.<eos> And his return was purposely in a public way.<eos> Hardly the action of a savage.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Thoyt, you may leave us.
Where's your propriety, Brace?<eos> Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why? Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?
Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> - You needed a brother. - Still do.
How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> - You needed a brother. - Still do.<eos> But a broken down, bent, buckled old butler will have to be sufficient.<eos> You look the same.
Apart from you.<eos> You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.<eos> I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> James...<eos> You could have written to your father just once.
And all the while, these gulls hovered around picking at him.<eos> Gulls only come if there is meat.<eos> Oh, aye, meat there was.<eos> Men of affairs, they call themselves.<eos> Don't you want to know what it is they wanted, these gulls?
And he would talk to you, James.<eos> And he would talk to Anna.<eos> Salish.<eos> My mother's name was Salish.<eos> You know things only he and I knew.
This Nootka Sound is a curse.<eos> It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Please don't talk to me of sense, Brace, because if it is you, I might believe it.<eos> And I have sworn to do very foolish things.<eos> If you're looking for money, those accounts are ten years old.
How much do you make here?<eos> With the workers in the yard and the boats that moor at the wharf... we make ã10 a day.<eos> I can give you five and whatever you like.<eos> Boys, girls, suck, fuck...<eos> You have two hours to get out.
Not kneel down beside them.<eos> Try again, this time reflecting the disgust you naturally feel now you know the truth.<eos> The dogs here live off the flesh from suicides jumping off Blackfriars Bridge.<eos> Never known one go tamely to a man's hand.<eos> Must be some witchcraft you picked up somewhere.

What do you want?<eos> You think your father's kid feeds himself.<eos> I heard you done a lot of evil over there.<eos> Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.

Now you're back, I want payment.<eos> If it wasn't for us, that kid would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.<eos> Mr. Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're a liar just like your father.
- How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.<eos> You don't even ask how your own blood fares.<eos> If you don't approve of me steadying my nerves with Madeira, then perhaps you should consult the directory of the Royal College of Physicians, see you know many others of them will agree to carry out this kind of work.
I did as others did and as others had me do, and we are all owned, and we have all owned others... so don't you dare stand there and judge me.<eos> Today, I have work to do.<eos> The horizontal chamber contains the gas from the stomach contents.<eos> Now... the moment of truth.<eos> As you see, the flame has formed a reflective surface on the glass, what is known as an arsenic mirror.
You're quite right, he doesn't belong in this world.<eos> I decided to bring it in person.<eos> Now, this is for the past, the present and the future.<eos> Take me to the boy.<eos> I want to see if you're lying to me or not.
Now, this is for the past, the present and the future.<eos> Take me to the boy.<eos> I want to see if you're lying to me or not.<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Do you want to talk with him?
Yes, sir, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Do you want to talk with him?<eos> No, I'm not a fit man to be around children.<eos> Fate can be hard, so you put money aside for his future in case he grows up to be rash, like me.<eos> Will you wish to see him again?
James Delaney.<eos> Benjamin Wilton, records,<eos> Abraham Appleby, our delegate from Christ, and this is Sir Stuart Strange,<eos> Chairman of the Honourable East India Company across the surface of the entire Earth.<eos> You don't remember me.
Abraham Appleby, our delegate from Christ, and this is Sir Stuart Strange,<eos> Chairman of the Honourable East India Company across the surface of the entire Earth.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> One remembers those one looks up to more readily than those you look down upon.<eos> I believe you were a cadet.
Chairman of the Honourable East India Company across the surface of the entire Earth.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> One remembers those one looks up to more readily than those you look down upon.<eos> I believe you were a cadet.<eos> Yes, you were my commander.
I wonder if Mr. Appleby might be allowed to finish a sentence?<eos> We are told that in your father's will, you were bequeathed a piece of territory which lies just here.<eos> As you will see, the small piece of land your father bought off the Indians is now by virtue of geography a point of contention between His Majesty's Government and the cursed United States.<eos> So...<eos> Ah, Mr. Delaney, you've been in Africa for a number of years, so you may be unaware that Britain and the United States are currently at war.

Before your unexpected return, we had agreed a figure with your half-sister.<eos> Her husband drove a particularly hard bargain.<eos> I'm sorry, no. Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> Open the envelope.<eos> Are you deaf?
The terrible shadow? The beast with a million eyes and a million ears?<eos> Conquest?<eos> Rape?<eos> Plunder?<eos> I studied your methods in your school. And I do know the evil that you do because I was once part of it.
Conquest?<eos> Rape?<eos> Plunder?<eos> I studied your methods in your school. And I do know the evil that you do because I was once part of it.<eos> - Are you sure you won't take a brandy?
Mr. Delaney...<eos> I'll give you one last chance to behave like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Please.<eos> The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading with slaves.<eos> For the safe.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?
I thought they would be less likely to return.<eos> Of course, they do return... as ghosts.<eos> Now I'm older...<eos> How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?
How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?
No.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> I was rescued by an African... who saved me... and he cured me... and he showed me to myself.<eos> The things I did in Africa make your transactions look paltry.<eos> I witnessed and participated in darkness that you cannot conceive.
No, I did not.<eos> I was rescued by an African... who saved me... and he cured me... and he showed me to myself.<eos> The things I did in Africa make your transactions look paltry.<eos> I witnessed and participated in darkness that you cannot conceive.<eos> And will you be including that in your account to the Royal Commission?
I witnessed and participated in darkness that you cannot conceive.<eos> And will you be including that in your account to the Royal Commission?<eos> No. Luckily, I'm not being tried for that today.<eos> They serve good hock to traitors.<eos> Perhaps you'll be served the same.
No. Luckily, I'm not being tried for that today.<eos> They serve good hock to traitors.<eos> Perhaps you'll be served the same.<eos> I understand you asked poor, sweet Godfrey to write an account, too. Hmm.<eos> I assume you want to make some sort of a deal?
One living witness.<eos> In one hour, I will be interviewed by the King's private secretary, three attorneys and half a dozen clerks.<eos> They will want it in writing.<eos> And at midday, Godfrey, poor, sweet Godfrey...<eos> He will deliver his own account to the Royal Commission, confirming how you concealed your ownership of this ship and its cargo... by committing treason.
So that's one living witness and one account from an East India Company clerk, prepared to give information heard under a raised hand.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I remember it all.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> You have four hours.
Good boy.<eos> Wilton!<eos> Pettifer!<eos> Ah, fuck it!<eos> Gentlemen, there are things I need you to do.
You ladies are going on a tour of the grounds.<eos> At the point of a bayonet, if necessary.<eos> Bring her!<eos> Come on!<eos> I want to know where you're taking us.
Out!<eos> The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.<eos> Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.
Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.<eos> There's still plenty of cocks left for you to suck.<eos> The agreement is that you take the ladies away in the coach and I walk back to the house and report that they were kidnapped.
He then saw a man arrive in a boat.<eos> "Moving like a ghost," Wasn't he?<eos> It was this ghost that killed your Winter, as she slept.<eos> The man then got back in the boat, Temple followed him along the foreshore, where he was met by someone on the other side.<eos> They were in a carriage, like the one you just came out of.
Full house.<eos> Shall we refer our opinions to Dr Gin?<eos> Who on earth is that?<eos> Countess?<eos> I thought you'd be alone.
Who on earth is that?<eos> Countess?<eos> I thought you'd be alone.<eos> Well, as you can see, I am not.<eos> What do you want?
Well, as you can see, I am not.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, I believe we have an appointment.<eos> My only appointment is with intoxication.<eos> As you may recall, I represent a company which produces products which restore and enhance female beauty.
As you may recall, I represent a company which produces products which restore and enhance female beauty.<eos> And also a certain feminine product, which you may prefer to discuss in private.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Pixie, perhaps as well as medicine for your poor, worn-out chuff, the lady may have something to repair a faulty memory.<eos> Do you have a beauty product which would bag me an admiral?
And also a certain feminine product, which you may prefer to discuss in private.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Pixie, perhaps as well as medicine for your poor, worn-out chuff, the lady may have something to repair a faulty memory.<eos> Do you have a beauty product which would bag me an admiral?<eos> I have a product which would allow you to accommodate an entire fleet, without discomfort, admiral and rear admiral.
My products include paints and oils, but in particular powder.<eos> And for those of us who have secrets, marks, blemishes... we have ways of preserving those secrets.<eos> Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?
Not for long.<eos> He sails today. And he requires the letter for safe passage, the codes for the flags.<eos> And I get the Treaty in return?<eos> No.<eos> You see, there's a letter which we will send to Solomon Coop, revealing that you titillate and intoxicate on behalf of the Americans.
And I get the Treaty in return?<eos> No.<eos> You see, there's a letter which we will send to Solomon Coop, revealing that you titillate and intoxicate on behalf of the Americans.<eos> If I fail to return, it will be delivered by midday.<eos> James Delaney also says to tell Colonnade that you do, indeed, have a leaky ship.

I'm ready.<eos> No, you're not. I'm not finished.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Come on! So, erm, now the witness is sewn together... we can begin.<eos> Please confirm that you are James Keziah Delaney of Chamber House, Wapping Wall, London... lately accused of conspiring with the members of the Secret Society of Correspondence... against His Majesty The King.

Witnesses vanish. Testimonies, they burn.<eos> Demands will be met, and pride will be swallowed.<eos> And when morning becomes afternoon<eos> Then I will become a free man.<eos> How would you know that?
Off my streets!<eos> On you.<eos> Brighton, Martinez, shut the street down, we're expecting visitors!<eos> Come on, shift it!<eos> Everyone else, you heard the man, off the streets!
Oh, but it will!<eos> It always does.<eos> Delaney would not make a deal with you.<eos> The record will show that the EIC cooperated with your commission into the sinking of the Influence, fully and without reservation.<eos> You're an idealist.
But the difference between Delaney and me is that I always make sure I have one last ace to play.<eos> Good day, Mr Chichester.<eos> I swear... this will not stand.<eos> God!<eos> You look like you need laudanum.
You look like you need laudanum.<eos> I have an hour.<eos> I need to be on the water by high tide.<eos> You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.
I have an hour.<eos> I need to be on the water by high tide.<eos> You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.
You have people with you?<eos> Mr Delaney, I'm sure that you're probably expecting me to hand you your letter of safe passage.<eos> But, I'm afraid, it isn't going to be that simple.<eos> Nothing in this war between cousins is simple.<eos> There's just a small hurdle that you have to leap over first.
Take a look.<eos> It's a deed of transfer.<eos> Transferring my title to Nootka Sound to the East India Company?<eos> And your friend, Stuart Strange.<eos> When I first met you, you told me that a sheep can be meat, but it can also be wool.
And your friend, Stuart Strange.<eos> When I first met you, you told me that a sheep can be meat, but it can also be wool.<eos> At first, the code eluded me.<eos> But then I realised, it's not even a code, is it?<eos> You're simply somebody's meat boy.

Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.
How is your religion these days, Coop?<eos> My what?<eos> Your religion, your faith.<eos> After many years in your service, it is in rags and tatters, Your Highness.<eos> And have you spoken about all this with God?
Fuck Nootka!<eos> Fuck wills! Fuck treaties!<eos> I'm the head of fucking state!<eos> And by the command of His Majesty Kill him.<eos> Where are you keeping everyone?
He's a doctor.<eos> Is the powder on the ship?<eos> 55 kegs onboard, 15 on the dock and two in the water.<eos> Right. Well, when we are 60 and ten, I need you to take the pilgrims and put them on the ship before the ebb.<eos> Where are you going?
Right. Well, when we are 60 and ten, I need you to take the pilgrims and put them on the ship before the ebb.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To explain the plans.<eos> I don't want you to tell them the plans.<eos> Besides, you're not coming.
To explain the plans.<eos> I don't want you to tell them the plans.<eos> Besides, you're not coming.<eos> What?<eos> Brace, you have always been my father's man, in my father's world.
We're headed to my mother's now.<eos> James, tell me this, too, is mercy.<eos> I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.
James, tell me this, too, is mercy.<eos> I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.
Britain and the United States are currently at war.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.<eos> You have two hours to get out.
Execution?<eos> Of Delaney.<eos> I told you to take care of it.<eos> It is taking a little longer than I anticipated.<eos> If you open up that ball of paper, you'll see notice of your dismissal from the East India, dated two days hence.
You marched with Tremain. Now you can march with me.<eos> March where?<eos> For what bloody purpose?<eos> For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.
Hang it in the meat locker.<eos> Just keep the powder out of the steam.<eos> Bloody madhouse again!<eos> While we're on the subject of housekeeping, I mean to have a word with you about food.<eos> You're hungry? No.
From a man in Feather Lane.<eos> Look, it was cheaper than the tavern and, er, your father only gave me coppers.<eos> What man?<eos> A man who's since died... and his wife since left.<eos> Why do you ask?
"Say he falls in, the current takes him, how about that?"<eos> So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard" "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."
Solomon Coop, your Highness.<eos> How is your TOE this morning?<eos> My toe is the first item of business.<eos> You evidently don't read the papers.<eos> You mean the blockade?
Fuck them!<eos> Now, the red crosses are the positions of the American ships.<eos> They are attempting to blockade our trading routes to the West.<eos> And the blue crosses are the Royal Navy ships, um, preparing to engage.<eos> Why did you make the Americans red?
It was a premonition.<eos> The shrimps were the American ships.<eos> Hear me, Coop.<eos> I am lying in the ocean like a whale and no-one in my Privy Council will raise a musket barrel!<eos> You sail this close to my nose, a kind of classless rebels, and you show me red crosses.
13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.
He sleeps on this ship alone?<eos> He takes a particular girl abroad and does mean things, but there's no-one else.<eos> Are you tricking me?<eos> No.<eos> They say you was in Africa.
The current here heads for Gravesend.<eos> You know navigation.<eos> Yes. Us larks all want to be sailors.<eos> That's his sloop. Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?
Yes. Us larks all want to be sailors.<eos> That's his sloop. Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?<eos> Because...<eos> What are you going to do?
The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?
Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...
Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.

Mr Delaney?<eos> The Felice Adventurero - it's all yours now, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Help me! Captain!<eos> Holy Christ! Where the hell have you been?
I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.<eos> I believe that would lead to anarchy.<eos> Are you not ever hungry?
I ate in the whorehouse.<eos> To qualify as food, it needs to be solid.<eos> I made some coffee - that'll be stone-cold.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Where the hell are you going now?
They said you were a doctor.<eos> A sheep is a sheep, but also meat and wool.<eos> This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?

You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.<eos> No?<eos> No, we change the codes when we think that perhaps the scum British have overtaken it.<eos> And you do not trust the name Colonay?<eos> What do you want?
He was trying to push his jelly up a whore.<eos> Carlsbad will know my name and know my business.<eos> I'm afraid you've used the wrong words.<eos> Get out.<eos> Do you treat sickness of the mind, Doctor?
I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.<eos> Post for you, madam.<eos> I intend to begin by reading your father's last will and testament, and then I shall try to reason with his creditors.<eos> Have you decided yet what you will do with Nootka?
Yes, I will use it for trade.<eos> With whom?<eos> There are only savages at Nootka.<eos> Then I will trade with them.<eos> I hear you bought a ship.
The shackles were all cast in London.<eos> The East India don't deal slaves.<eos> No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.
No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.<eos> And what connections are they?<eos> Mr Thoyt... you have been my father's lawyer for the past 40 years.

And in all that time, you reported every detail of his most intimate business to his enemies at the East India Company.<eos> You are their whore.<eos> The same as almost everyone else in this city, apart from those who are actually labelled a whore.<eos> Come on, James.<eos> When you left London, the East India was a trading company.
The Prince Regent fears it.<eos> No government in the world dares to stand up to it.<eos> It owns the land, the ocean, the fucking sky above our heads.<eos> It has more men and weapons and ships than all the Christian nations combined.<eos> You think all who submit are evil.
The King and Company after your head.<eos> It's all rabble - pitch makers, carpenters.<eos> Your father didn't pay any bills for four years.<eos> They feel deeply aggrieved and talk of seizures.<eos> I'm not being at all fanciful when I ask if you are armed.
Mr Delaney died a widower.<eos> He is survived by two children, both present at this division.<eos> Of his daughter, Zilpha Annabel Delaney, now Zilpha Annabel Geary, there is no mention in this last will and testament.<eos> To his son, James Keziah Delaney, is left the only existing assets of the Delaney estate, including the Nootka trading post and landing ground on the Pacific north-west coast of the Americas, in what was formerly Spanish America.<eos> Whatever you have, you will sell...
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.

He was very, very proud.<eos> Why Dublin?<eos> Well, he was on business.<eos> Yes, but your business is here, isn't it?<eos> You're an actress who appeared on stage at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden in a play called The Painted Savage.
Well, if my likeness was in there, the drawer wasn't empty.<eos> If the paperwork from Dublin is validated, Miss Bow will have a legal claim against his estate as widow.<eos> Mrs Delaney is my name.<eos> Bow was the name that I used for the stage.<eos> Are you a good actress?
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
"Lorna, it is in a moment"<eos> "that I would leave this cursed house by the river"<eos> "and go to the Americas with you and live there, naked and savage," "and yet, we would have each other and be together."<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Do you possess any other documents of his?
Here.<eos> Thoyt, sit down.<eos> So, gentlemen... tell us of this widow.<eos> Can none of you read?<eos> Or are you all too busy trying to catch my eye and only pretending to read the agenda before stretching your necks again?
Thoyt, sit down.<eos> So, gentlemen... tell us of this widow.<eos> Can none of you read?<eos> Or are you all too busy trying to catch my eye and only pretending to read the agenda before stretching your necks again?<eos> You, what's your name?
Who claims to be the widow.<eos> The marriage is confirmed and is legal.<eos> What is the significance of this, Mr Godfrey?<eos> It's not written down.<eos> You have to work it out.
I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> As Horace Delaney's widow, I also own half of the trading post at Nootka Sound.<eos> And I believe Nootka is of value to the King.<eos> If you are in contact with the King, then you are already in grave danger.
Let all else lie.<eos> You take the minutes and you log every meeting.<eos> I want that information.<eos> You think your father's kid feeds himself?<eos> Now you're back, I want payment.
Open this door, by order of the King!<eos> James! James!<eos> They are here! James, for God's sake!<eos> What's happening? !<eos> They will want you to sign their papers or you will hang.
They are here! James, for God's sake!<eos> What's happening? !<eos> They will want you to sign their papers or you will hang.<eos> Hang for what? Saving my honour?<eos> ! You must hold out.
Look at me.<eos> These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India - and they will free you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You must go with them now.
The Duke was given the wrong name.<eos> Each ribbon represents a reason not to comply.<eos> As each ribbon is untied, a reason disappears.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> Under English law, as Delaney's wife, you have the legal right to contest his will, on the grounds of insanity.
Congratulations.<eos> And finally... an agreement to assign your share of the Nootka trading post, smoke house and tanning factory to the possession of the British Crown.<eos> Or... a conviction for attempted murder, for which you hang.<eos> No, this really is terribly simple.<eos> Exposed as you are, in this hell. You're weak.
Exposed as you are, in this hell. You're weak.<eos> Men of all kinds.<eos> Your hands shackled.<eos> A key and a pen are your only weapons.<eos> So, you take this pen in your hand, you sign your name and I turn the key and you dress and you leave... with £1,000 for your trouble.
! Oh, James. James.<eos> My God.<eos> I see.<eos> So soon.<eos> You can go.
My wife is a strange fish.<eos> I talk to her about my work, when we sit up in bed at night.<eos> Her belief is that James Delaney is in league with Satan.<eos> I believe that to be true, too.<eos> So, as we... explore ways to make you change your mind... these next few hours... we will be doing God's work.
I have a question. It concerns chemistry.<eos> I hope now is not inconvenient.<eos> Wait!<eos> I wrote a fucking book about chemistry.<eos> If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.
So, ejaculate.<eos> Then, we can talk of business.<eos> Is that gold?<eos> Has the semen yet turned to poison?<eos> I believe you invented a chemical process for verification.
Is that gold?<eos> Has the semen yet turned to poison?<eos> I believe you invented a chemical process for verification.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what exactly is it you would use me for?
- She's back, yes? - Aye.<eos> How does she seem?<eos> The same.<eos> But then, she's an actress.<eos> You knew they were coming to take her, didn't you?
I have things to do.<eos> We're all just part of the plan, aren't we, sir?<eos> Buy her some flowers.<eos> Flowers.<eos> You said I'm a weakness.
In the cell, I called you "James".<eos> I think that surprised them most.<eos> Certainly surprised me.<eos> If your intervention had been ten minutes later, I would have been raped.<eos> But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?
I think that surprised them most.<eos> Certainly surprised me.<eos> If your intervention had been ten minutes later, I would have been raped.<eos> But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?<eos> You see me as I am.
But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?<eos> You see me as I am.<eos> All of those that I gather are damned.<eos> It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.
You see me as I am.<eos> All of those that I gather are damned.<eos> It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.<eos> Is that why you let it happen? To teach me a lesson?
It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.<eos> Is that why you let it happen? To teach me a lesson?<eos> No. That was to teach the King a lesson. And the Company.<eos> But if you're absolutely resolute on staying... then I may agree to incorporate you into the organisation.
No.<eos> I will join the League of the Damned.<eos> A group of people who are drawn together, with a willingness to do exactly as I say.<eos> We are the ships, you are the river.<eos> First, I need you to bring me a trunk full of my father's belongings.
Do you own this farm?<eos> Ask no more questions now and talk to me only of chemistry.<eos> My simple question is, is it possible to achieve it here?<eos> If you mix the pigeon shit and the cow shit at a ratio of around 60:40 in favour of the pigeon.<eos> I'd have to do tests. Then, if you burnt all that stack of wood today, you could soak the ash in 50 gallons of human piss and leave it for a minimum of a year. Then, my friend, you would, indeed, have gunpowder.
The bat caves of Burma, where the bat shit refines itself, or the warehouse of the East India Company at Wapping Wall.<eos> Except, they're not selling, at the moment.<eos> War going on. Two wars, actually.<eos> Or have we already won one of them?<eos> You're hired, Mr. Cholmondeley.
And as for your saltpetre, I will get it for you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I told your friends... Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> How the hell can you walk around a house this old without making a noise?
I told your friends... Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> How the hell can you walk around a house this old without making a noise?<eos> Because I own it, and I know every creak in it and I can move around it without waking it up.<eos> When was the last time you set foot inside a church, sir?
How the hell can you walk around a house this old without making a noise?<eos> Because I own it, and I know every creak in it and I can move around it without waking it up.<eos> When was the last time you set foot inside a church, sir?<eos> The lady asked me to wake her because she had a costume fitting.<eos> I guessed you wouldn't want her going out.
The lady asked me to wake her because she had a costume fitting.<eos> I guessed you wouldn't want her going out.<eos> No, the lady is free to come and go as she pleases.<eos> The Crown will protect her from the Company. And the Company will protect her from the Crown.<eos> - And you are the joint in the seesaw.
By the way, I found your red roses in the mud when I threw out the oyster shells.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.<eos> Countess Musgrove is, let me think, sir... 1,550 places above you in the social hierarchy of London.
- Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.<eos> Countess Musgrove is, let me think, sir... 1,550 places above you in the social hierarchy of London.<eos> Her husband is a little, fat German prick and she fucks...<eos> You forgot to wake me.
She also allows and even encourages the closed and turning waltz.<eos> A ball.<eos> And why would she invite a man who cannot dance?<eos> Perhaps she likes oddities and curiosities.<eos> Or if she knows you're in the house in the light, you cannot be outside lurking in the garden in the dark scaring people.
- Aye, sir.<eos> The Americans. Wanting a place on the seesaw.<eos> Well, it is an invitation for two.<eos> Miss Bow?<eos> Do you dance?
It's the devil.<eos> Now, amongst other things, I am also a doctor.<eos> And I'd say the lady is in danger of catching more than just a chill out here.<eos> Your half-sister. Am I right?<eos> You're quite a prize, Mr. Delaney, quite a prize.
I was told what you did to our first resort.<eos> Opened him up like a bull.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Now, I make no moral judgments.<eos> And besides, Carlsbad said to say that you can have her.
Move, move!<eos> Get out! Go!<eos> You know James Delaney? No.<eos> What?<eos> You mean in the way that no-one really knows James Delaney?
- We were children... - Oh!<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I were to have intentions regarding James, would I need to be wary of you?<eos> No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.
If I were to have intentions regarding James, would I need to be wary of you?<eos> No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.
And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.<eos> I want you to bring the trunk with my father's belongings tomorrow.

You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.<eos> I want you to bring the trunk with my father's belongings tomorrow.<eos> I thought you might have gone.<eos> Oh, you mean you waited? For me?
What will the gorilla do with the lady, one wonders.<eos> Eat her, perhaps!<eos> Oh, where did they go?<eos> Countess, I know this is business.<eos> And I think I know who you are.
Carlsbad.<eos> Oh, it seems we have one... but not the other...<eos> Where is my gorilla?<eos> Get back in there, Lady Musgrove, and find that humping gorilla of yours.<eos> I was told you wanted tea. A monopoly.
Get back in there, Lady Musgrove, and find that humping gorilla of yours.<eos> I was told you wanted tea. A monopoly.<eos> - Fanciful, of course.<eos> I want to meet with the Embassy in Paris.<eos> Oh, no. You assign to the United States, where someone will kill you.
I know I will have my satisfaction.<eos> I declare it! I challenge James Delaney to a duel.<eos> At dawn... to the death.<eos> To the death.<eos> Do you accept?
What is it you're looking for?
As is your name in mine. Carlsbad.<eos> If they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I challenge James Delaney to a duel, to the death.<eos> Do you accept?
I don't have one.<eos> The code requires you have a second.<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Let's just say this woman is yours and she is late.<eos> Could you not find a boat like a normal person?
According to the Irish code of 1777, any man wounded will be tended by the doctor.<eos> And no second shot will be fired by either gun.<eos> Gentlemen, take up your positions.<eos> The aggrieved party, at the nearest point.<eos> When I drop this handkerchief, you will walk towards each other.
For champagne?<eos> Or potatoes?<eos> Or both?<eos> So, how did it resolve itself?<eos> Did you both see sense?
So I shall hear through gossip?<eos> As I hear about you.<eos> So, how was the party?<eos> Well, it was entertaining.<eos> And how did you end up in the duck pond?
Soldiers in blue.<eos> Running by the window.<eos> Out there on the foreshore.<eos> Stopping the river traffic and searching every barge going east.<eos> You see, Miss Bow, last night there was a robbery.
The lady and I will take our breakfast on the foreshore this morning, thank you.<eos> And, when they come, let them in.<eos> You can open every door.<eos> We have nothing here to hide.<eos> You will hang.
We have nothing here to hide.<eos> You will hang.<eos> They will catch you and hang you.<eos> I need you to bring me the trunk with my father's belongings today.<eos> Explain how you will not hang.
The Company can cause me a lot of difficulties, but only the King can have me hanged.<eos> The Crown will choose to make a deal.<eos> So I will not hang.<eos> Look, I'm very happy to admit that I don't want James Delaney to die.<eos> But can you also admit that you don't want James Delaney to die?
Brace!<eos> Brace, can you come and help me?<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> Bloody soldiers raided the house.<eos> Did you hear me shouting?
I've asked the Weasel for some sailcloth to cover it against the rain.<eos> I've already breakfasted on a little of it.<eos> The quality's exceptional.<eos> Almost as good as the bat shit distillations of Burma.<eos> Why don't you just fix the roof?
The quality's exceptional.<eos> Almost as good as the bat shit distillations of Burma.<eos> Why don't you just fix the roof?<eos> Because a canvas sheet would protect the powder perfectly well and be much cheaper.<eos> And you think she's beautiful?
I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> I know which one of you it is.<eos> And I want you to know that there will be no place for that man on my ship when we sail to the New World.
But only the Company are aggrieved, so no-one can take you to the clink or to the poultry tower.<eos> So, if a Company man comes calling, they have no legal jurisdiction.<eos> So you get word to me.<eos> And I will deal with it. In my way.<eos> And in return... you choose.
He'll be East fucking India.<eos> Let it be known along the Wapping Wall, it was the work of the devil Delaney.<eos> Ready?<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing here, at whatever the hell time of night it is?
What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.<eos> Everybody's scared of you.<eos> Thankfully.<eos> Did you find out how much the Company are offering as reward?
Did you find out how much the Company are offering as reward?<eos> Work faster.<eos> Steady as we go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?
Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.<eos> How would you know that?
No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.<eos> How would you know that?<eos> Because I read them.<eos> Have you even looked at them?
Have you never bought a soul for beads?<eos> I'm told Your Majesty has some paperwork regarding the East India?<eos> Some little Scotsman in the War Office who wants to crawl up my arse dug it up and brought it to me.<eos> In time of war, a failure to secure His Majesty's gunpowder against the enemy is a criminal offence, and the same goes for saltpetre.<eos> You wish to charge the East India with negligence? Worse.
In time of war, a failure to secure His Majesty's gunpowder against the enemy is a criminal offence, and the same goes for saltpetre.<eos> You wish to charge the East India with negligence? Worse.<eos> We could allege potential complicity within the organisation.<eos> We need to shake the impasse.<eos> Why do you always look down your nose at my plans?
We need to shake the impasse.<eos> Why do you always look down your nose at my plans?<eos> I'm not.<eos> We should prosecute over the lost saltpetre.<eos> You are jealous of the little Scotsman.
I'm assuming this disease is of your own making?<eos> So many soldiers and Company men treading heavily in your footsteps, I thought I'd make this place a little less attractive to them.<eos> That's why we've also moved down here.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> What do you want?
So many soldiers and Company men treading heavily in your footsteps, I thought I'd make this place a little less attractive to them.<eos> That's why we've also moved down here.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You have something I need.
Beyond that, an area of low land.<eos> Hatchett's Ground they call it.<eos> A tannery. A windmill. And hidden just behind that, a cattle farm with a water wheel.<eos> No organisation is watertight, James.<eos> You're just lucky it's our pot the informant pissed in and not the Company's.
As in your premonition.<eos> The French, blew Mauritius almost in half.<eos> And where do we get this chlorate?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You need to ask a far more important question, which is, where will you get a chemist insane enough to work for you if you decide to add fucking chlorate to these vats?
And where do we get this chlorate?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You need to ask a far more important question, which is, where will you get a chemist insane enough to work for you if you decide to add fucking chlorate to these vats?<eos> We either get the chlorate, or we will all hang in about eight days.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?
We either get the chlorate, or we will all hang in about eight days.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> He is, isn't he?<eos> They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.
Mr. George Chichester, Esquire.<eos> I don't.<eos> In the day?<eos> Or the night.<eos> For nine years, Mr. Chichester, you have been writing to my office on an annual basis.
And, sir... 76 children.<eos> All lost.<eos> Drowned.<eos> And what is your interest in the sinking?<eos> Did you have relatives aboard?
Did you have relatives aboard?<eos> Mr. Coop, even though I am black,<eos> I am not related by blood to every slave stolen from Africa.<eos> So, The Sons of Africa.<eos> You write on their behalf.
I write on behalf of humanity.<eos> As a man concerned with injustice.<eos> Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.
Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?
Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.<eos> Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...
From the Prince Regent himself.<eos> Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...<eos> You will improve your game.
Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...<eos> You will improve your game.<eos> You have to improve your fucking game!
Those bastards at the palace have opened a royal commission into the sinking of The Influence.<eos> The-The-The Influence? Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.
The-The-The Influence? Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?
Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?<eos> A commission is not the King, so they can't subpoena, so you will deal with it and treat them with disbelief.<eos> They have appointed some educated blackamoor to prepare the evidence.<eos> Now, you take your coat off, go into your office and you write to him.
I sent word of your offer, with my own recommendation that we accept.<eos> Accept what?<eos> Nootka landing ground in return for the tea trade to Canton.<eos> And safe passage through your blockade.<eos> But you must assign the treaty before you leave London.
A book from a Mr. Cholmondeley for Miss Bow.<eos> It came by post, with a letter.<eos> She obviously has an admirer.<eos> She asked me a lot of questions today.<eos> And did you give her a lot of answers?
She obviously has an admirer.<eos> She asked me a lot of questions today.<eos> And did you give her a lot of answers?<eos> I told her nothing.<eos> And yet, you have so much to tell.
We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.<eos> No, no absolutely not.<eos> He's...<eos> You must keep him all to yourself.
I shan't hinder your advances.<eos> Zilpha. My love. My love.<eos> This is a holy man of God.<eos> He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.
It is my belief that some very powerful men were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves and were complicit in the deaths of those slaves.<eos> The bellmen and the newspapers tell me there's a new source of prime grade powder in town.<eos> Our guns will fall silent in ten days.<eos> We need the powder in eight. I need more gunpowder.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?
There is a ceremony of exorcism, which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> My mother's name was Salish.<eos> My father had her sent to Bedlam insane asylum.<eos> Mooning about in the chill. Staring into your head.<eos> You're as bad as your da.
He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.
Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.
The worst. Busiest in the head.<eos> Doesn't drink. They should not be dropping him on us like a black cannonball.<eos> Mr. George Chichester.<eos> Ah. Gentlemen.<eos> How good of you to see me.
A cat in the middle of the desert, with no nose.<eos> But what what an extraordinary achievement, gentlemen.<eos> When you think that the pyramids and the great Valley Of The Kings and the Sphinx were all manufactured by men with skin almost as dark as my own.<eos> It almost defies all your Our current views of nature.<eos> You are very well travelled, sir.
That is why it sailed with only a skeleton crew.<eos> And this scarcity of crew is almost certainly the reason why, within four days, the ship ran aground.<eos> Help yourself to breakfast.<eos> It's been two days.<eos> Why are you not looking for him?
Well, I-I shall call on Mr. Thoyt.<eos> Perhaps we can glean some knowledge from him.<eos> Oh, if there's any darkness, that articled pimp will know about it.<eos> And then I intend to visit Zilpha Geary.<eos> Why are you not worried?
Oh, if there's any darkness, that articled pimp will know about it.<eos> And then I intend to visit Zilpha Geary.<eos> Why are you not worried?<eos> He won't be dead, and he won't be happy.<eos> You can depend on that.
They were singing that rhyme long before Mr. Delaney returned to London.<eos> "Before Mr. Delaney returned to London."<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> That golden age.<eos> You want to know where he is?
His Majesty's Government wants to know where he is.<eos> I'm afraid we cannot help you.<eos> Miss Bowe, my husband and I would now like you to leave.<eos> Of course.<eos> Perhaps you be so kind as to order me a carriage?
Six people in Rotherhithe.<eos> It's as if the disease is not transmitted by air or miasma, but by false rumour.<eos> Then it is the same as religion.<eos> Or patriotism.<eos> You have no God, certainly no country.

Or patriotism.<eos> You have no God, certainly no country.<eos> What do you have?<eos> Powder.<eos> When will you deliver?
Yes, it's very sad, it's a whole family.<eos> Been dead for days.<eos> We haven't heard about that.<eos> We've being instructed to transport them under the cover of darkness. So as not to alarm the populous.<eos> Oh, cholera, you say?
A man in London who can be relied upon.<eos> Hm.<eos> Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.<eos> You stink of cow shit.
Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.<eos> You stink of cow shit.<eos> It's horse shit, actually.<eos> We thought you might have left for good.
We thought you might have left for good.<eos> And would that be good?<eos> I visited your sister to ask where you were.<eos> Three days and not a word?<eos> Did you think it would go unnoticed?
They're offering £10 to anyone with information.<eos> Making threats.<eos> Money being offered it's only a matter of time, James.<eos> You tell me one thing that isn't just a matter of time.<eos> They say you're going to sell the gun powder to the Republicans.
Money being offered it's only a matter of time, James.<eos> You tell me one thing that isn't just a matter of time.<eos> They say you're going to sell the gun powder to the Republicans.<eos> Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.
We are leaving now, because we have being betrayed.<eos> No excuses.<eos> The talking is done.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You, again.
Mine!<eos> I need a ship!<eos> Just give me a fucking ship.<eos> James.<eos> What are you doing?
Brace, what's the matter?<eos> The truth.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> You are now one of us.<eos> You'll risk the life of your son?
James, this powder is not ready to be moved because it is unstable.<eos> We are leaving because we have been betrayed.<eos> Sir Stuart just wants you to know... it's war.<eos> The gloves are off.<eos> James, what are you doing?
Mr. Cholmondeley?<eos> Miss Bow.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A bastard.<eos> I thought, in all your charity, you might extend some sustenance and some shelter to this poor, unfortunate boy.
Thank you.<eos> Take into your loving arms this purest flake of snow, my daughter, my light, my love... my Winter.<eos> I thought I might find you here.<eos> A gentle soul, taken from us all too soon.<eos> You've a heart, at least.
I'm just looking for a ship.<eos> Watching what comes and goes.<eos> Raise her up to your heavens and set her free by your light.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen. I know you didn't do it.

The ones who used to sing to me.<eos> Was it my hand...?<eos> Brace!<eos> God's sake.<eos> I received a message that you wished to speak with me.
Was it my hand...?<eos> Brace!<eos> God's sake.<eos> I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.
God's sake.<eos> I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?
After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.<eos> I need to be clear that you're not a spirit, like the others.
First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.<eos> I need to be clear that you're not a spirit, like the others.<eos> No. I'm a rationalist.<eos> I'm carrying out an investigation as part of a Royal Commission.<eos> I heard that you don't drink, that you don't fuck whores and, erm... that you're squeezing Sir Stuart Strange on behalf of the King.
I'm carrying out an investigation as part of a Royal Commission.<eos> I heard that you don't drink, that you don't fuck whores and, erm... that you're squeezing Sir Stuart Strange on behalf of the King.<eos> - On behalf of justice.<eos> - Oh, justice. Hello.<eos> You believe in justice?
- On behalf of justice.<eos> - Oh, justice. Hello.<eos> You believe in justice?<eos> I do.<eos> And yet you're a rationalist.
I do.<eos> And yet you're a rationalist.<eos> What kind of rational man believes in justice?<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.<eos> Mr. Delaney... I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.

Mr. Delaney, perhaps I should come back during daytime.<eos> Oh, no, no, there's no use.<eos> I am always like this.<eos> Please, carry on.<eos> You travelled to the Volta as a slave and then began to deal slaves.
Oh, no, no, there's no use.<eos> I am always like this.<eos> Please, carry on.<eos> You travelled to the Volta as a slave and then began to deal slaves.<eos> You stole diamonds from a fellow slaver and then returned to London.

You stole diamonds from a fellow slaver and then returned to London.<eos> I have done much worse things than... stealing diamonds.<eos> Yes. I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.
Where's Brace?<eos> In his room.<eos> He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked. He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.
Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.<eos> Come out, or I will come in there and drag you out.<eos> Talk to me about the rats.<eos> Every house has rats.<eos> Hmm. But after you bought so much arsenic... from the apothecary in Rotherhithe...
I kept them.<eos> It was a kindness.<eos> For who?<eos> We couldn't go on, James.<eos> But you did.
It was a kindness.<eos> For who?<eos> We couldn't go on, James.<eos> But you did.<eos> You were dead.
Everyone was at his throat.<eos> He was burning his own flesh!<eos> He had no need to go on.<eos> Nothing left to live for.<eos> So you did him a kindness.
He had no need to go on.<eos> Nothing left to live for.<eos> So you did him a kindness.<eos> I put an end to his pain.<eos> You did him... a kindness.
So you did him a kindness.<eos> I put an end to his pain.<eos> You did him... a kindness.<eos> I killed him!<eos> You came back too late!
You did him... a kindness.<eos> I killed him!<eos> You came back too late!<eos> For both of us.<eos> You are wanted urgently downstairs.
Send him in.<eos> It's a woman, sir.<eos> Actually, two women, sir.<eos> Let me get this clear.<eos> You were witness to the division of gunpowder and you heard, with your own ears, that a proportion of this said powder was to be sold to a citizen of the United States of America?
Actually, two women, sir.<eos> Let me get this clear.<eos> You were witness to the division of gunpowder and you heard, with your own ears, that a proportion of this said powder was to be sold to a citizen of the United States of America?<eos> Not sold, but given. On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> And you witnessed this, too?
Not sold, but given. On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> And you witnessed this, too?<eos> - She will have to say it, sir. - Yes, yes.<eos> You'll have to say it out loud.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.
- She will have to say it, sir. - Yes, yes.<eos> You'll have to say it out loud.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?
Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?<eos> In gold.<eos> And silver.<eos> And you're a British citizen?
In gold.<eos> And silver.<eos> And you're a British citizen?<eos> German by birth, British by marriage.<eos> And you?
Sir?<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Go?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You are far, far too precious to go anywhere.
No, no, no, no.<eos> You are far, far too precious to go anywhere.<eos> And as accessories for a crime against the Crown, there will be due process.<eos> Take them.<eos> You'll be held in a secure place until your pardon can be exchanged for your testimony in court.
Get off me!<eos> Where is he?<eos> They would not be denied, sir.<eos> This is the Prince's house.<eos> You should have dragged them out on their arses.
This is the Prince's house.<eos> You should have dragged them out on their arses.<eos> Stuart Strange is a Knight of the Realm, I could not lay<eos> - a hand on him.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?
There's someone I need you to see.<eos> "In the event of a conviction for high treason, compassing the death of our Lord the King, then the law of 'Corruption of Blood' will take precedence over all other.<eos> All land, property, chattels and investments of the guilty party will pass without hindrance to the Crown.<eos> And by dint of 'Corruption of Blood', all family members of the guilty party will be deemed corrupted and any claim to land, property, chattels or investment... will be null and void."<eos> So... you've not only delivered us Delaney, it appears you've delivered Nootka Sound to the King.
...the ladies who are to give the crucial evidence against James Delaney are now in the protective custody of the East India Company.<eos> Their whereabouts are... known to just a handful of trusted directors so, to ensure their safe delivery, we humbly suggest you assign a monopoly.<eos> The trade in sea otter pelts for tea between Nootka and China.<eos> In favour of the loyal and... honourable East India Company.<eos> The King gets the land. You get the tea trade.

You get the tea trade.<eos> You got lucky with a whore, Stuart.
Goodness, your hand is cold.<eos> I have been on the heath.<eos> I'm not sure I can go through with this.<eos> Let us at least sit and talk.<eos> You lead a very interesting life.
How long have you worked for the East India Company?<eos> I have only been clerk for 12 years.<eos> I have no idea how many years it was going on for...<eos> No, but you were present during the meeting when Sir Stuart concealed the facts about the sinking of the Cornwallis.<eos> Would you agree to testify?

When my ship is ready, I will send for you.<eos> James, for God's sake, you don't have a bloody ship!<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Right, ladies, you might want to leave this place.
Oh, here he comes.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Me.<eos> Right.<eos> I suggest that you leave very quickly... and very, very quietly... or you can stay... for the extreme violence that is coming your way.
- Your choice.<eos> - Come on, ladies.<eos> He must be taken alive... by order of His Majesty King George!<eos> In here, Captain!<eos> James Keziah Delaney, you are hereby charged with high treason, compassing the death of our Lord the King!
Mr. Delaney...<eos> His Majesty seeks information.<eos> I really have no taste for this, so perhaps we can conduct this business like gentlemen.<eos> They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.
Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope.<eos> A line between life... and death.<eos> We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.
A line between life... and death.<eos> We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.<eos> The Americans.<eos> The places you met. Code names, signals.<eos> The location of the powder you gave them.

So...?<eos> I will give you all the information that you request... but in return, I will need a single meeting with<eos> Sir Stuart Strange of the East India Company here, in a cell, and in private.<eos> News of my arrest will already be spreading.<eos> Those people that you seek... they will already be fleeing London.

One, maybe two hours.<eos> Well, in that case, Mr. Delaney, Sir Stuart Strange is busy.<eos> Give us the Americans and then we'll stop!<eos> Sir!<eos> What did you say?

Well, you're not a player. No.<eos> Not of this game.<eos> Look, do you mind? I've got a shot to make.<eos> So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?
And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...<eos> I've told you, I have nothing to say to you.<eos> ...someone who will swear on oath that it was you who organised the loading of human cargo onto the Cornwallis bound for Antigua.

No.<eos> I have another witness.<eos> Where exactly are we going?<eos> Fuck!<eos> We are aware that you have a certain... capacity for pain... which is why we've invited Dr. Ling.
Delaney was arrested at the Molly House.<eos> Delaney will have put Godfrey up to this.<eos> He'll have hidden him in the dark places where Delaney is king, where giving up Delaney is treason.<eos> Mr. Delaney?<eos> Do you have anything to say to me?

My God, look at you.<eos> Well, your plan worked...<eos> you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?
Maybe the fishes, maybe not.<eos> The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.

In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.<eos> No?<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think?
No?<eos> Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think?<eos> Or Malay?<eos> When you came in here with bits of a man's flesh between your teeth... we kind of had a silent deal.

I stitch you up and you give me information.<eos> Tell me what you want in return for Nootka.<eos> What's your price?<eos> I don't have a price.<eos> So what do you want?
Well, you tell Carlsbad... from me... that I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly... on the trade of furs for tea from Fort George to Canton.<eos> A monopoly.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> You should have said that from the start.
That's what I want.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> You should have said that from the start.<eos> Could have saved yourself a lot of pain.<eos> And you just said...
All the tea in China.<eos> You should have said that from the start.<eos> Could have saved yourself a lot of pain.<eos> And you just said...<eos> "she"... didn't you, when you said Carlsbad?
I'm in too fine a mood to discuss the East India.<eos> James Delaney, a private individual, has recently inherited a piece of land...<eos> Nootka Sound.<eos> Now, this piece of land naturally affords the possibility of a direct trade route with China.<eos> If you care to look more closely, you will see that the piece of land in question lies along the line of our disputed border with the Americans.
- Erm, well, we think not.<eos> A republican?<eos> An adventurer of very poor repute.<eos> Stories of madness, savagery, theft and worse.<eos> Then, Mr. Coop... he is a man that you will be able to do business with.

So, when the carpenter comes, tell him I want all the windows boarded up and that river hatch, I want that closed too.<eos> So... we are besieged.<eos> I suppose I can use the same carpenter to board up the windows that your father used when he was under siege and he can put the same old nails in the same old holes.<eos> You can sit there with the same old gun cocked on your lap.<eos> And when you sit there with that same look of defiance on your face, I will ask you the same old question...

And when peace comes and this border is drawn, it will not be by soldiers but by more fucking lawyers... hundreds of them, from both sides.<eos> And every scratch and claim staked will be cited as legal precedent.<eos> And not only can we not resolve this disaster by killing Delaney, it is now in our urgent interest to keep the bastard alive.<eos> Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?

Winter, what are you doing here?<eos> This is where I come to sleep sometimes.<eos> You sleep here?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw you do for the Malay.

and at the moment one only has to say "the Company" with a certain degree of disgust to get his undivided attention.<eos> Forget India.<eos> Tell him to put India to one side.<eos> The King will not move on India.<eos> The Regent does what you and your coven say.
Forget India.<eos> Tell him to put India to one side.<eos> The King will not move on India.<eos> The Regent does what you and your coven say.<eos> You seriously underestimate him.
You seriously underestimate him.<eos> I underestimated Delaney.<eos> Look at this.<eos> He's written a will.<eos> - You have 104 spies in London... and we have 202.
They're all mine.<eos> Don't spoil the bloody game, Stuart.<eos> I just know everything.<eos> Always assume I just know.<eos> Then you know we have a problem that cannot be solved with a musket or a knife.

I suppose you would call it a pincer movement.<eos> He says he's happy for the Nootka trading post, the smoke house and the tanning factory to be incorporated into the territory of the British Crown, but only if we give him a monopoly on the trade in smoked sea otter pelts from...<eos> Canton?<eos> Curiously, the word "tea" does not appear in the letter.<eos> So you'll write back to him and tell him to go to hell.
Canton?<eos> Curiously, the word "tea" does not appear in the letter.<eos> So you'll write back to him and tell him to go to hell.<eos> Well, perhaps, before I write to Delaney, we should speak about India.<eos> You'll allow this savage to determine our American policy?
You'll allow this savage to determine our American policy?<eos> Our American policy is simple...<eos> Restitution of all lands taken by force.<eos> West of Michigan, the line of the border will be determined by lawyers, which means almost certainly that Delaney can give us Vancouver.<eos> And, in return, you would sell out the East India?
Settle your dispute with the King regarding Bombay and we can talk.<eos> It all seems rather neat and terribly simple to me.<eos> You do realise this whole business is about revenge.<eos> And why would James Delaney hate the India so?<eos> What the hell did you do to him, Stuart?
God save the King!<eos> ♪ Long live our noble... ♪ Begging pardon, Sir, the show is almost done.<eos> Should any girl in the chorus have taken your eye, Sir, they're sixpence each for one hour.<eos> Any girls who spoke are a half crown.<eos> There are boys in the chorus too, Sir, if you prefer.
My servant wants to shoot you in the face.<eos> Your servant is also now half mine.<eos> So did I just burn advice or did I burn speculation?<eos> You actually burnt a letter of intent.<eos> And what do you intend to do... with my house?
Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.<eos> The only people who would benefit from your death are the Americans, but you're already in negotiations with the Americans, so surely once the boards have gone we could put curtains up.

You should know that I am a very dangerous man.<eos> I was told that, too.<eos> And who keeps telling you all this shit?<eos> I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.
- I'd like a river view.<eos> - Granted.<eos> Go on now. Make her a fire in my mother's old room immediately.<eos> I hate to see these things caged up.<eos> If you are in contact with the King then you are already in grave danger.

- I underwrite for Lloyds.<eos> No.<eos> I'm willing to take care of the insurance of your ship.<eos> I can make sure the hull is tarred properly... They don't miss a layer and pocket the change.<eos> The salt and worms will get through and you'll sink off Africa.
In my profession, we believe in luck.<eos> In the business of ship insurance, luck is the Goddess of Profit.<eos> Your luck, Mr. Delaney, is poor.<eos> Your record is poor.<eos> You sink ships.

Your record is poor.<eos> You sink ships.<eos> You're as good as a hole in the hull.<eos> I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa.
I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa.<eos> A slave ship?<eos> I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.<eos> And whilst you're here, this document will show you... that my ship is already insured by an insurance broker by the name of Cope.

She can seem so cold, at least, she used to.<eos> Now I know the secret in her head.<eos> And it makes me so hard... and so angry.<eos> And she likes it.<eos> Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.
- Not before a performance.<eos> - There'll be no performance tonight.<eos> There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.

- Hurry up!<eos> - Vestris!<eos> Vestris!<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> If you're here just for a wank, pull your pudding and get it over with and let the rest of us enjoy Shakespeare!
Please, share my carriage.<eos> Come, come.<eos> If you could take me to Old Street, I'll find a cab.<eos> You looked to be fleeing from someone.<eos> You were following me?
Come, come.<eos> If you could take me to Old Street, I'll find a cab.<eos> You looked to be fleeing from someone.<eos> You were following me?<eos> You have many suitors among the rabble, I imagine, and I, for the longest time, have been one of them.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.

I'm the fucking Duke of Richmond.<eos> That bitch is dead.<eos> That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.

You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.<eos> We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.<eos> In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.<eos> We're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.<eos> You got that Lexus?
Sir.<eos> Where you boys headed?<eos> Back to our patrol base, sir.<eos> Sasquatch.<eos> Where you coming from?
Back to our patrol base, sir.<eos> Sasquatch.<eos> Where you coming from?<eos> Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?<eos> Where have you just been?
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Well...<eos> Attention on deck!<eos> So why the long faces?<eos> You just got back from Italy.
- Well...<eos> Attention on deck!<eos> So why the long faces?<eos> You just got back from Italy.<eos> I'm guessing you ate some sensational food, saw some antiquities?

General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.<eos> I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.<eos> Those boys, they need me.<eos> I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.<eos> But you boys are at the coal face.
That's like telling the bad guys all they gotta do is wait out the next 18 months and then we'll be gone!<eos> And so he just told an auditorium full of young American soldiers the war they've been asked to fight these last eight years has been nothing more than one great monumental waste of everybody's time.<eos> That was a clusterfuckingly stupid fucking speech!<eos> Thank you, Greg.<eos> Well, you heard him.
That's close of fucking business.<eos> Boss, you good with this?<eos> Sure, Pete.<eos> We're not in theater.<eos> You boys earned it.
USA! USA!<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> It's like one phone call.<eos> Hello, they won't let us take off.<eos> Can you fix it?
Okay, listen up.<eos> This is going to be tough.<eos> I'm not gonna mince words about that.<eos> This will be tough.<eos> This will probably be the toughest mission that any of you all will experience.
This will get ugly.<eos> We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!

Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?<eos> I need ANA guys going in first.<eos> Trey!<eos> You take those first two guys with you. Copy?<eos> You two, up!
Go in.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen up.<eos> We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.<eos> Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
Is this really that bad?<eos> I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.<eos> But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?<eos> It's hip.<eos> And you guys...

Yeah.<eos> Hello, Kate.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was looking at pictures on Emma's Facebook.<eos> Not to sound creepy, but it was a way to make sure that you're both okay.
NBC's Cummins reports.<eos> You've reached the Murray O'Hairs.<eos> Leave a message. Hey, it's Luke.<eos> It's, uh, 10:00.<eos> Where are you?
Recognize anyone?<eos> No, Mother.<eos> Shh. I think someone's coming.<eos> Check their restraints.<eos> You wanna tell us what the hell we're doin' here?
I don't think you know whose weeds you're pissing in, buddy.<eos> - I said shut up.<eos> - I heard you.<eos> I chose to ignore you.<eos> Who are you working for, huh?
- Mother, please.<eos> - I think we're good.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Cocksuckers, you're not gonna get away with this!<eos> Don't you know who I am?
- Yes, I just might...<eos> - Stop it, both of you!<eos> God damn it, I have to pee.<eos> Hey, people!<eos> If you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna piss all over your floor!
There's too much red tape...<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I said, "Just a sec."<eos> Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?<eos> You can find everything that you've been searching for in Christ.
And that is to pray, ourselves.<eos> The plaintiffs in the case, self-described atheists Madalyn Murray and her teenage son Bill, were unapologetic.<eos> I don't understand why people are so upset.<eos> This is about religious freedom.<eos> You can still keep the faith, people. Just keep it to yourselves.
The center has a printing press, library and recording studio for her syndicated radio series.<eos> I do love a good fight.<eos> And taking on God and the church is... well, kind of the ultimate, isn't it?<eos> So, as long as there's a fight to be had, I'll still be a squeaky wheel.<eos> Well, there you have it, people.
I had this sudden rush of sorrow.<eos> Because I understood.<eos> I understood the, uh... the hatred and the... the self-pity that she was feeling.<eos> Because that's what I was feeling.<eos> But I come here, and I... I see others, much worse situations than me, and... you overcome, and you accept them.
You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.<eos> I love you two.<eos> Everything I've ever done, I... I've done for you kids.<eos> Bill, too.<eos> What do you say?
Yes, I'm threatening you.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> This is what I'm gonna do about it.<eos> I'm gonna use my free speech to make sure the kids of this town don't end up degenerated like the mayor.<eos> You people talk and talk and do nothing!

This is what I'm gonna do about it.<eos> I'm gonna use my free...<eos> Shut that off, and do your homework!<eos> Degenerated like the mayor.<eos> You people talk and talk and do nothing!

I'm saying that we aren't even official until we have at least three members.<eos> Three members.<eos> How hard can that be?<eos> ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪<eos> You guys shouldn't be hanging out in the hallways.
This is a triangle.<eos> - Holy...<eos> - Ghost!<eos> Okay, I just want to say don't be intimidated by these guys, okay?<eos> You guys have done such amazing work these last few weeks, and you have something they don't, okay?
Using the speaker's logic, I'd argue that being short has a lot to do with how doomed you are in life.<eos> Contestant 89, you were supposed to argue the opposition to your own prepared topic.<eos> Welcome to a tale of witchcraft, where Puritan Mary Warren stands before the courtroom unsure of whether or not telling the truth will set her free, or set her on fire.<eos> So get ready.<eos> And if you feel flames, don't pull the fire alarm.

Hotels, food, expenses.<eos> The entrance fees were, like, 100 each.<eos> Pool, furniture repair.<eos> Your club was never even approved.<eos> You don't even have a faculty Advisor.
Who the hell are...<eos> Who the hell is she?<eos> I work in cafeteria for seven years.<eos> Sir, we never intended...<eos> You all have parents on the school board.
Sir, we never intended...<eos> You all have parents on the school board.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You're lucky that I don't suspend you all for fraudulently representing our school.<eos> You all have two weeks of detention, and no more clubs.
Yeah.<eos> - So?<eos> - So this is the opposite of that.<eos> Solomon needs us.<eos> I mean, I always knew you guys had a big house, but... whoa.
- Come here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm grounded.<eos> You can't be here.
We won't rest until Mary Rodgers' real lines are put back into the school play!<eos> We won't stop until the newspaper can write about issues that actually concern the student body.<eos> We won't stop... until people are held accountable for their actions.<eos> Try and stop us!<eos> You can't possibly stop us from...
- instantly.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Guys, look.<eos> Are you guys students here?
Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this<eos> - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.<eos> No, you can't. You won't be able to find me.
If we get caught stealing school supplies, it's a great idea.<eos> Okay, now.<eos> Can't we just buy a lightning rod?<eos> Sure, if you've got $2500.<eos> What are you doing here?
Plugs and wires? Are...<eos> Are you making a Taser?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> - You saw them, didn't you?<eos> - You should be in class.
Visitors?<eos> I can't believe we have visitors.<eos> Oh, Caleb will be so happy to see you.<eos> It's been such a long time since he's had anyone to play with.<eos> Oh, you must be thirsty.
I'm trying.<eos> What the hell is wrong with this place?<eos> Lenore?<eos> Could you unlock the door, please?<eos> Now that you're here, you need to stay.
People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.<eos> No one can help you.<eos> If they want to leave, they're going to leave.<eos> They'll go, and they'll go, and there won't be anything you can do about it.
They'll go, and they'll go, and there won't be anything you can do about it.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Go.<eos> Caleb, can you help us find a way out of here?<eos> You have to stay because Mommy said so.
I know, it's not the perfect plan.<eos> But we need the bad part of the plan to make the good part work.<eos> You think she knows it's a bad plan?<eos> Anyone would know this is a bad plan.<eos> Which is why I have to ask you one more time, are you sure you don't wanna change your minds?
I just put them back the way I found them.<eos> Okay. Send him back.<eos> Hold on. I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> I also know about things I'm betting you don't.
I don't have a Caleb.<eos> Go.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Mommy says you can go now.
Logic.<eos> Life experience.<eos> Liam, what are the odds that he'll get taken?<eos> What if Stiles isn't there?<eos> What if there's no Beacon Hills for you to come back to?
So I could use this.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not our pineal gland, I hope.<eos> We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a Hellhound.
Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.<eos> So we should stay here.<eos> Is that what you're thinking?
We're not making that deal.<eos> I hold all the cards.<eos> You're locked in a jail cell.<eos> You have no cards.<eos> You want me to tell you about Douglas.
He wants his own supernatural army.<eos> We're not letting you through that rift.<eos> "Not letting" me?<eos> I see.<eos> You still think you have a say in the matter.
I knew you were gone.<eos> Liam, you and Lydia get to the bunker.<eos> The whip. It didn't take you.<eos> I don't think they're trying to take us. I think they're trying to kill us.<eos> Why aren't you running?
He's my responsibility.<eos> Noshiko gave me the sword.<eos> It's so awkward when Mom and Dad fight.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You both are right.
Right?<eos> Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.
It's not going to blow up.<eos> They ride the lightning.<eos> We can use that to catch one and keep him there until we figure out what they want.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> You're trying to catch a Ghost Rider.
I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?<eos> Oh, that's right, I can't.<eos> We better hurry.<eos> You did it.
What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.
But first we have to get in.<eos> You have no self-preservation instincts.<eos> How are you my daughter?<eos> Ask him again.<eos> What do you want from us?
We are the Wild Hunt.<eos> We hunt forever.<eos> Those who hunt with us hunt forever.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Tell us what you want.
Tell us what you want.<eos> We are the Wild Hunt.<eos> Those who hunt with us hunt forever.<eos> That clarifies things. What do we have to do to get everyone back?<eos> Do you want something from us?
That clarifies things. What do we have to do to get everyone back?<eos> Do you want something from us?<eos> Why's he looking at Scott?<eos> He figured out Scott's the Alpha.<eos> There must be something you want.
Stiles?<eos> Lydia...<eos> Where is he?<eos> It was working.<eos> You saw him, right?
- What is it?<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.
I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.<eos> Just in case. In case Stiles Ecomes back?<eos> If there's any hope, you need to keep trying.
The train.<eos> It's coming.<eos> Okay, and how do we stop that?<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> But you can divert it.
Or not.<eos> Nope, not easy at all.<eos> Attention, all passengers, the train will be arriving in 12 minutes.<eos> Me?<eos> You want me to stop them?
We have to give Scott more time.<eos> Look at him. We...<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.
But not impossible.<eos> Noah.<eos> Your bullets can't hurt me.<eos> Fire again.<eos> Where are you going?
You should've cuddled. You should've cuddled, bro.<eos> Chacho, I'll kill you!<eos> Here we go.<eos> Get at it, girls!<eos> Are you cat fighting? Come on, girls! There you go.
What are you doing here?<eos> Hey.<eos> Get outta here.<eos> We question the guard from the armored truck.<eos> After you interview Barton, find out if someone named "LT" works here.
Who are they gonna call?<eos> Different cops?<eos> They're heading south on Stadium Way.<eos> I'm on Stadium Way.<eos> Where are you guys?
No, no, no!<eos> You little shit!<eos> Get over here, you punk bitch!<eos> - Jon!<eos> - What are you doing?
- Suits?<eos> - You're gonna love this.<eos> - What were you guys saying?<eos> - Huh?<eos> What were you guys saying?
- What were you guys saying?<eos> - Huh?<eos> What were you guys saying?<eos> Uh, they just said they liked the bikes.<eos> Oh, you guys built them, so, cool.
Man, what is that? Four, four-fifty?<eos> That's "World's Strongest Man" shit.<eos> I think it's 350.<eos> You guys kinda caught me in the middle of it.<eos> Why don't you come back in an hour and a half or so, when I'm gone?
Thanks.<eos> - Yeah, it's over here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Back up, you're on Ponch's pinky!
- Let them do their thing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, um... Hey, Ponch?<eos> - Mm-hmm?<eos> Could you maybe speak in Spanish, so I don't understand what you're saying?
Okay.<eos> What's next?<eos> "Take me, take me.<eos> I can't stand it!"<eos> How did you even get in here?
There's no stopping her.<eos> Tell Holt that...<eos> Please pick up the phone.<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to...
Please pick up the phone.<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to...<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to do.
You know what to do.<eos> Holt, what's going on?<eos> I just had the strangest conversation in my life with that weird girl.<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to do.
The cemetery.<eos> Look for her name.<eos> Come on, pick up.<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to do.
Hey, what happened? What happened? What happened?<eos> I saw something.<eos> The well.<eos> - We were just looking...<eos> - I know who you're looking for.
- I can... I can take...<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'm fine, son.<eos> I know every corner of this house.<eos> So, you're looking for the girl.
I had a vision.<eos> An image of that grave that led me here.<eos> And inside the grave, I saw a vision of a well.<eos> A vision.<eos> So, you want to know about Samara Morgan.
Selfish reasons.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.<eos> Colleague to colleague?<eos> You all think I'm like you. I am not like you.
We are the flow.<eos> What you offer is existential crisis aversion.<eos> Don't look over there, look over here.<eos> Don't listen to that, listen to this.<eos> You provide a product, an innovative distraction and you keep innovating it and you keep providing it.
You're old as fuck.<eos> Things are never going back to the way that they were.<eos> The times, they are a changing.<eos> You can't fight progress.<eos> Then why are you here?
Not really.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You could have, but...<eos> People create gods when they wonder why things happen.<eos> Do you know why things happen?
You want to know how to make good things happen?<eos> Be good to your god.<eos> You give a little, you get a little.<eos> The simplicity of that bargain has always been appealing.<eos> That's why you're here and that's precisely why I matter.
We have the firepower.<eos> You have the swords and knives and hammers and stone axes.<eos> We don't fight, we win.<eos> You die out either way.<eos> You are the passenger pigeons and thylacines.
It did?<eos> Yeah. It came outta nowhere. We got it pretty good.<eos> Yeah, it must have frucked you out, big time.<eos> Frucking weird.<eos> Well, you know what I say?
They're destroying the ecosystem.<eos> I see a dead deer on the side of the road, I think to myself, "That's a start."<eos> I don't even understand that.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm just sayin'.<eos> You know what, I am grateful for what you've done today.
You know what, I am grateful for what you've done today.<eos> I don't like 'em.<eos> We got that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. All right, you guys look so wiped out.
She puts me under once... The sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.<eos> Okay, fall back, Dean.<eos> It's a service we provide.<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> - Thank you, though. Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here - for the big get-together.
Oh, my God. Thanks, George.<eos> It's Rose's grandfather's party.<eos> My dad would throw a shindig once a year.<eos> Get all his friends together, bocce ball, badminton...<eos> Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this?
Who he really is?<eos> She long dead.<eos> She wouldn't give it up for Johannes up there so he threw her off the boat.<eos> Did you know your momma couldn't swim?<eos> You all need to work on that.
Let me tell you a story.<eos> "Once upon a time, a man got fucked."<eos> Now, how is that for a story?<eos> 'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.

For a fucking purple shirt?<eos> The only good news is the tobacco your grandkids are gonna farm for free is gonna give a shitload of these white motherfuckers cancer.<eos> And I ain't even started yet.<eos> A hundred years later. You're fucked.

I like him.<eos> He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Comp Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.
Said you needed him.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> No, no, no. No. Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?<eos> So you stay and you eat.
He's attending secret talks with one of our agents there.<eos> We lost contact to them 24 hours ago.<eos> The government has organised a conference where interim president Haim is to sign the reunification accord.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> Then you really are screwed.
He earned a buck on the fall of the Wall.<eos> Locke is the best.<eos> Say... Do you need to inform anyone?<eos> Well, the dacha will suffer a bit...<eos> Boys, am I glad to see you.
- It's my wife...<eos> Yes, your wife!<eos> But Mr von Gütersloh... please do take your money.<eos> Boys...<eos> What are you doing here, anyway?
-Welcome.<eos> Seeing you all again after 30 years...<eos> Harry.<eos> You're looking good.<eos> Say... you're still in business?
I still have a good one.<eos> First we inspect the hotel. Right.<eos> Locke?<eos> You're buying the joint.<eos> - You can't just buy a hotel.
It's like a mosquito bite.<eos> Here.<eos> It'll lead us to the hostages.<eos> Well, then... cheers.<eos> But you are taking me along, right boys?
Here.<eos> It'll lead us to the hostages.<eos> Well, then... cheers.<eos> But you are taking me along, right boys?<eos> You'll need me in any case.
Well, then... cheers.<eos> But you are taking me along, right boys?<eos> You'll need me in any case.<eos> As a joker card.<eos> You know, chambermaids, switchboard operators...
Good night.<eos> What's between you and this agent?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You nearly wept when you thought he was dead.<eos> Are you a couple?
Harry!<eos> And you?<eos> What floor?<eos> - Twelve.<eos> Did you find out who those men are?
We want Kern and the president.<eos> - Come on!<eos> The president is uninjured.<eos> Everything seems to be in order.<eos> That you're doing all this again...
Damn it all!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> Lower your guns!<eos> What are you all doing here?
Lower your guns!<eos> What are you all doing here?<eos> - We're freeing you, asshole.<eos> Many thanks.<eos> Are you coming along?
There are no leaks at the BND.<eos> Lonski wants a ton of money for the flight.<eos> Up front.<eos> - "See you later."<eos> You have to help me.
Thanks.<eos> - First you have Martha betray me, then you steal my child?<eos> - She didn't betray you, asshole.<eos> We discovered you with our bugs.<eos> And you just happened to become a couple?
We discovered you with our bugs.<eos> And you just happened to become a couple?<eos> I was to find out if she was working with you. Weeks of interrogation.<eos> It just happened.<eos> Sorry, can you take a rain check?
You work with Dumov. - No. You confessed.<eos> - Rubbish.<eos> You must have revealed my route.<eos> The route.<eos> You know how it is.
I'm not emotional about anything.<eos> I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.<eos> She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.<eos> I still don't know what you want me to do with her.<eos> You told me that you take in people who need help.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel. Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.<eos> And now it's exploring what comes after this life.<eos> Seeing what's next.<eos> How old are you?<eos> You are all part of the same thing.
Well, yeah.<eos> That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.<eos> Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Where are you guys going?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...<eos> We need a cadaver.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.<eos> What are you doing with my body?<eos> Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.<eos> We do still have a little time to prep a redo.<eos> Redo? Guys, come on. You almost fried the body.

Okay, thank you, Toby.<eos> Thank you, my boy.<eos> Well, hello to you all.<eos> As always, it's a pleasure.<eos> When you all first got here, you... You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
- Yes.<eos> We need to tell him that it works.<eos> What?<eos> What works?<eos> - What are you doing?
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.<eos> - You got to see your mom again.<eos> - I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
Okay.<eos> - That too fast?<eos> - No. Row.<eos> I don't know what my brother told you, but, we're not looking for card players.<eos> What are you looking for?
It's just me.<eos> I said it's just me.<eos> Why do I have the gun?<eos> So Amanda's playing hockey now, huh?<eos> You got to get up at the crack to get that...
Yeah.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hello, Eddie.<eos> My name is Detective Frank Winslow.<eos> I know the con you and your brother are running.
We just made $20,000!<eos> Oh, I can't believe Judge Banks bought it.<eos> Yeah. I got a question.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If the company's so strapped, how do you guys post bail?
Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Uh... - Marius.<eos> - Th-this is, uh...<eos> Marius, just don't... don't bother.<eos> You're blown.
I'm just... I'll tell you, though, I am very curious about how this was all going to go down.<eos> So you were going to get me to keep putting my money on the table, supposedly drawing the whale in deeper, hmm?<eos> And then the whale spots the cheat. The cheat and the whale have what, a shoot-out?<eos> That's it?<eos> - Huh? - Yeah. How do you get the money, though?
Charlie, show him the gun.<eos> They're blanks.<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's...<eos> This guy. You know the problem with blanks, though?
This guy. You know the problem with blanks, though?<eos> They don't sound like a real bullet.<eos> Here.<eos> Now compare that to the real bullet.<eos> - Do you hear the difference? - Oh!
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
And then I'm the one telling these girls,<eos> "I've done more interracial than regular scenes, and I'm good."<eos> But it's a fear factor for a young girl, and of course, when you look up to your agent, he's been teaching you things, you're gonna believe what he says.<eos> Then when they finally do do interracial, when they're not getting enough work doing other things, they get paid more money for it.<eos> Going to the post office myself. 'Cause I want you all to get your books. And I want you to enjoy them.
He has masturbated to me.<eos> When he looks at me, and we make eye contact, and that twinkle happens, and he remembers all those moments, it's a feeling, it's an adrenaline rush, it's a thing, right?<eos> I have to be so aware that I put it out there.<eos> Who would I be to say,<eos> "No, I don't want any of you to talk about this anymore.
I go, "What you talking about, man?"<eos> I said, "I'm in theater, I'm doing legitimate theater."<eos> I'm not no porno star."<eos> They go, "Yes, you are."<eos> I go, "What are you talking about?"
So, I freed a lot of dicks and pussies.<eos> That's howl feel about it. Know what I mean?<eos> Real talk. That's real talk.<eos> Years ago, I did a play on Broadway called "The Wiz,"<eos> and that's the black production of "The Wizard of Oz" if you people don't know.
Um, at this point in time I have.<eos> I won't do any anals or gangbangs, and that's pretty much it.<eos> And the only reason is, is it's more, like, a business thing than anything else.<eos> I figure I have to have something left when... to market a little bit later on.<eos> So, you'll probably see me doing it a little bit later, but not quite yet.
I've not had any issue with my past being negative.<eos> It's actually been the exact opposite.<eos> I've utilized all the tools and connections and things like that in whatever new businesses that I start now.<eos> I am very happy that I was a pan of the "golden age of porn."<eos> 'Cause, you know what?
And I'm giving some love to Dennis here at the BunnyRanch.<eos> There it is.<eos> And a lot of love to a lot of fans out there?<eos> Yeah. Anybody can come, swing on by and we'll have a good time.<eos> There you go. So, are you...
The same opportunities are not available now that were then.<eos> I produced an all-girls line for Vivid called "Chasin' Pink"<eos> and my budgets were $30,000. I mean, that was considered gonzo.<eos> My "gonzo," my $30,000 "gonzo."<eos> I mean, have you seen the stuff that's up there?
Double penetration. I did that... three years later?<eos> So, I took my time with it.<eos> It took me 17 years before I did my first interracial scene.<eos> So, I took my time so that I wasn't burnt out and people weren't burnt out.<eos> Are you following me again?
So, I took my time with it.<eos> It took me 17 years before I did my first interracial scene.<eos> So, I took my time so that I wasn't burnt out and people weren't burnt out.<eos> Are you following me again?<eos> Told you to stop following me.
I'm gonna head up to my room.<eos> Homework.<eos> Clay, school emailed again today.<eos> Which explains why Dad showed interest in my life.<eos> You two are dangerous when you coordinate.
Which explains why Dad showed interest in my life.<eos> You two are dangerous when you coordinate.<eos> You know I hate being the kind of parent who asks if you want to talk about anything, but... if you want to talk about anything...<eos> I didn't really know her, Mom.<eos> Didn't you two work together at the Crestmont?
Clay's here!<eos> I win!<eos> You owe me five dollars.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You bet on me? - Against you.
I was being kind.<eos> She kind of was.<eos> I think I want a beer too.<eos> Okay, then, Princess Leia.<eos> Oh, my God, you're both nerds.
Hannah's doing her homework.<eos> Oh, hi, Mrs. Baker.<eos> Yeah, she was totally just helping me with it.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What are you working on?
Thirty minutes seems like an awfully long time for two trains going full speed, huh?<eos> Eisenhower Park.<eos> Rocket slide.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know what you're all thinking.
So, thank you, Justin.<eos> Sincerely. My very first kiss was wonderful.<eos> Porter wants to see me about Hannah.<eos> Probably about this fucking lawsuit.<eos> Did you get to first base, Justin?
In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.<eos> I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.<eos> In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
Why isn't he here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Porter pulled him in yesterday, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.<eos> Is everything okay with you guys?<eos> You're together, right?
Will your parents freak?<eos> My dad would freak.<eos> Yeah, my mom might, but my dad's a cop, so as long as I stand up straight and pass P.E., go shooting with him...<eos> Wait, your dad's a cop?<eos> And you go shooting with him?
- Fuck Justin.<eos> - You don't even have to talk about it.<eos> Ever.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you guys take that Vocational Interests and Aptitude Test?
You all right?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You heard him, boys.
Why did you and Hannah fight?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> You're a guy.<eos> You guys were friends.
Did you?<eos> Alex. "Take the 'A' Train," with your solo.<eos> All right, well, I guess if I'm gonna be happy, may as well do it with the Duke.<eos> Alex, we hadn't talked since you two got together.<eos> And then it seemed like maybe you might not be together anymore.
I try not to be a dick.<eos> Yeah, we all try.<eos> So, did you do it? What Hannah says you did to her and Jessica.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - What are you doing?
I'm recruiting Clay for the Illuminati.<eos> You want to join?<eos> Alex, you should not joke about the Illuminati, first of all.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What are you guys talking about?
What were you thinking?<eos> Seriously!<eos> Hannah, you know you can't be in here.<eos> Why not?<eos> You've all been staring at my ass all day.
You coming, Standall?<eos> Or are you too hot for us now?<eos> Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!<eos> Watch the downbeats. Yeah? Yeah?<eos> I know you can count.
They thought it was funny and stuff.<eos> My dad was relieved that I had male friends.<eos> Also, didn't totally suck at school that Justin Foley liked me back then.<eos> Okay, back then.<eos> Why are you friends now?
Clay gets it, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sid Vicious, born John Ritchie, bassist for the Sex Pistols, and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen.<eos> Nice.<eos> But you know how the story ends, right?
I think we're handling it our own way.<eos> Don't forget your keys.<eos> Good luck with your store.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, hey, whoa, whoa! What are you guys doing?
They'll be fine.<eos> I think this place will probably charge the card if we move it.<eos> Wow.<eos> You said you wanted a nice restaurant.<eos> Um, what are you guys still doing here?
Who does that? Who...?<eos> The whole thing. Like...<eos> Wait. Shut up, wait.<eos> So the whole Justin thing was just a rumor?<eos> I totally thought you guys went to third.
Yes, Marcus, the most important thing right now is your valedictorian speech.<eos> Let's keep that in mind.<eos> You talking about Clay?<eos> Keep your voice down, dude.<eos> Whatever you're doing, I want in.
- The Jeep is a hundred years old.<eos> The Jeep's not a hundred years old. It's not even paid off yet.<eos> Why don't you take the station wagon?<eos> 'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.
Oh, my God.<eos> Did your parents buy you a new car for this dance?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> I didn't know you were rich!
- I'll say it again if that helps.<eos> - No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Is this happening again?<eos> You're back together?
Sorry about him.<eos> Lots of money, just no class.<eos> Right.<eos> You do look amazing, though.<eos> Hey, where'd you guys go?
Come dance with us.<eos> Well, hello there, ladies.<eos> So, are we gonna be seeing an encore presentation tonight, or what?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna try and tell me that these babes right here aren't you guys?
You're gonna try and tell me that these babes right here aren't you guys?<eos> Come on. I know a fine piece when I see one.<eos> Or two.<eos> So, is this a thing now?<eos> Did you guys come here together?
I'm here with my friends.<eos> We could be friends.<eos> - Go! - Go!<eos> Do it.<eos> You think so?
- Go! - Go!<eos> Do it.<eos> You think so?<eos> Uh, you can keep up?<eos> Hey. Maybe you and Hannah are up for some fun later.
Uh, you can keep up?<eos> Hey. Maybe you and Hannah are up for some fun later.<eos> - Me and Hannah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're fun girls, right?
Yeah, for sure.<eos> Hey, where's your girlfriend?<eos> Sorry, which girlfriend is that, exactly?<eos> Your girlfriend from the picture, Laura.<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you now and then.
Oh, shit, Alex.<eos> Alex, seriously, slow the fuck down.<eos> Seriously, Alex.<eos> Ever been to jail before?<eos> Okay, you boys want to tell me why you're going 90 in a 40?
You don't want to do this.<eos> - You think I'm scared of you?<eos> - You should be.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> How many of you remember the Oh My Dollar Valentines?
Marcus Cole, presiding.<eos> Courtney Crimsen, recording secretary.<eos> All members present.<eos> Petitioners, please state your names.<eos> That's you, guys.
It's our job to protect the students of this school.<eos> To protect the students at this school?<eos> Yes, Alex.<eos> That's what the Honor Board is for, to settle disputes among students so they don't spill out into the hallways.<eos> Yeah, the Honor Board, 'cause you're all so honorable.
It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job... I don't think it's healthy for you.<eos> Well... why are you here?<eos> Aren't you and Dad doing anything for Valentine's Day? Ooh!
He buys you flowers all the time.<eos> That's true. He does.<eos> And sometimes he cooks.<eos> Well... he heats things up very well.<eos> Well, I think you guys are so lucky.
So, what?<eos> You're into cheerleaders now?<eos> It's you and Carrie?<eos> Sheri.<eos> You guys make a cute couple.
This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.<eos> They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.<eos> The insider's tour!<eos> All the secrets that you need to know.
They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.<eos> The insider's tour!<eos> All the secrets that you need to know.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> So as you can see, it's one of the finest high school parking lots in the world.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Did you think that I was, like... just friends with Ryan?<eos> Well, yeah, I guess so.<eos> You think I would be friends with a guy like Ryan.<eos> Yeah, would think you would be 'cause apparently you went out.
But next time, a text would be appreciated before you go, and not on the way home.<eos> No, right, of course.<eos> I couldn't reach my phone for a while.<eos> But, yes.<eos> And you can ground me for a month.
I mean, what's your play here, anyway?<eos> My play?<eos> Like it's a game?<eos> Okay.<eos> You threw rocks through Tyler's window.
My play?<eos> Like it's a game?<eos> Okay.<eos> You threw rocks through Tyler's window.<eos> What did you do for Jessica?
And, like, how?<eos> Summer school.<eos> Do I need your permission?<eos> Do you remember what he did to me?<eos> You guys weren't even technically dating.
Scoot over, Clay.<eos> I don't think there's any... room. Whoa.<eos> Are you guys playing?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> So you guys just like to watch?
HANNAH: There are three stories to tell about that night.<eos> I'll tell this one first.<eos> How did I end up in that bedroom? That's another story.<eos> But for now, Justin, you'd been with the same girl all night.<eos> But I'm not gonna call her out by name. Even though, if you were at that party, you already know.
But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
Singular.<eos> Hannah!<eos> Clay!<eos> Hey, Troy.<eos> You two are gonna come over there... and you're gonna play beer pong.
I bet you went down on him.<eos> Sometimes it's better to wait.<eos> I mean, you made the hot list.<eos> They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.
We need to stop texting.<eos> Seriously, if they get our text records, we're done.<eos> Oh, my God, I didn't even think about that.<eos> Spread the word, we all need to meet in person.<eos> Did you guys get subpoenas too?
It's public record now.<eos> Everyone knows.<eos> Nobody knows about anything.<eos> You're gonna keep it that way.<eos> I want in, on whatever you're doing.
I mean...<eos> I don't know, maybe I can get on the phone and explain to him.<eos> What's to explain?<eos> He wants money, we don't have it.<eos> You can use my college savings.
- I deserve to be here.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Because you don't like me?<eos> 'Cause I embarrassed you?<eos> - I'm getting it worse than any of you.
I don't know it.<eos> We can contain this. We have to control the narrative.<eos> You're deluded.<eos> The narrative is, Jess knows Bryce raped her.<eos> You guys would make shitty chess players.
My God, Courtney. You should fucking listen to yourself.<eos> I can't imagine Jess won't want Bryce in jail for life.<eos> Wanna know what's worse than being a rapist? Hiding behind one.<eos> Fucking justifying a fucking rapist, that's worse.<eos> You want to get the story straight?
I thought you were more responsible than this.<eos> - We trusted you!<eos> - It's a few hundred dollars.<eos> It's $743.<eos> You can have my last check from the Crestmont.
Baker Pizza at your service.<eos> Oh, my God, you are amazing.<eos> But then, I was surprised to see myself at another party.<eos> Yes, thank you, Hannah!<eos> You're gonna get grease in the water.
You gotta watch that temper, bro.<eos> You telling me to watch my temper is like Justin Foley telling me to lay off the weed.<eos> Where is that guy, anyway?<eos> No clue.<eos> You figure your shit out?
Just checking.<eos> No!<eos> No way in hell.<eos> That was not the deal.<eos> You people swore you could take the Saviors out. And you failed.
Your courage was inspiring.<eos> Hey, don't you work for me?<eos> Aren't we friends?<eos> Gregory, we already started this.<eos> - You started it.
How many people here can fight?<eos> "We"?<eos> I don't even know how many people we have, Margaret.<eos> And does it even matter?<eos> I mean w-w-what are you gonna do?
Hey.<eos> So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.<eos> A bunch of us do.<eos> Enid says that you want Gregory to get us to fight the Saviors with you.
Enid says that you want Gregory to get us to fight the Saviors with you.<eos> Is that true? - Yes.<eos> - Do you think we can win, that we really could beat them? Us?<eos> I do.<eos> Well, Enid says you could show us the way. - I'm ready.
Negan has outposts.<eos> The geography, the distance works against us.<eos> We gotta get back.<eos> If they come looking for Daryl, we need to be there.<eos> You don't have to get back.
Sometimes others.<eos> Line up. Okay.<eos> This is a waste of time. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Maybe you're right.
And it's a dangerous world.<eos> We don't usually allow a pack of strangers to waltz through our door.<eos> We want to make the world less dangerous, and we are all here to show the King how serious we are about that.<eos> The car stays outside.<eos> You gotta hand over your guns.
We only have two.<eos> Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.<eos> Whatever you're trying to start here, another protection pact, a trade, none of it matters if we don't start dealing with the real problem... the Saviors.
Maybe.<eos> Morgan?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> How do you know each other?
We all serve the Saviors.<eos> Alexandria already fought them once, and we won.<eos> We thought we took out the threat, but we didn't know then what we know now.<eos> We only beat one outpost.<eos> We've been told you have a deal with them, that you know them.
Alexandria already fought them once, and we won.<eos> We thought we took out the threat, but we didn't know then what we know now.<eos> We only beat one outpost.<eos> We've been told you have a deal with them, that you know them.<eos> Then you know they rule through violence and fear.
We can help each other.<eos> Don't interrupt the King.<eos> We brought you into our confidence.<eos> Why did you break it?<eos> Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.
It was lives, arms, legs.<eos> The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy, but it is peace.<eos> I have to hold on to it.<eos> I have to try.<eos> Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire, the King is sympathetic to your plight.
But it still pissed me off. What the hell are you telling me for?<eos> We both had sex with the same dead guy.<eos> It doesn't make us friends.<eos> You can change his mind, but you won't.<eos> Then you can stay.
What now?<eos> We gotta unwrap the secondary explosives... the dynamite, the RPGs.<eos> Make sure these casings are not messed up, and do not mess them up, either.<eos> This thing could still blow.<eos> You all heard her.
Make sure these casings are not messed up, and do not mess them up, either.<eos> This thing could still blow.<eos> You all heard her.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You can load the explosives into the trunk as long as they're in good shape.
Okay.<eos> Tara, Carl, come on!<eos> Rick...<eos> All right.<eos> Sasha, Jesus, can you get back to the Hilltop on foot?
We can.<eos> We're the ones who live.<eos> Lose the car?<eos> It's somewhere safe.<eos> - You didn't find anything.
We didn't know he was gone till right now.<eos> Then this should be easy.<eos> Now, everyone find a buddy.<eos> Gonna have to follow us around.<eos> If he's here, we really need you all to see him die.
bring something back. We'll find more.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not here for a pick-up.<eos> Good thing.<eos> But that day is coming, so you best do whatever you need to.
Gabriel's one of us.<eos> I have to.<eos> What's going on with the Saviors, that isn't this.<eos> If Rick is taking on the Saviors, that is everything.<eos> W-What if they find out while you're gone?
You're sick with this stick, man.<eos> Jerry!<eos> Hey... do you want to head to the infirmary?<eos> No. I'm okay.<eos> Hey. Where'd you go in them trucks?
Hey. Where'd you go in them trucks?<eos> I need to speak to Daryl alone. That okay?<eos> Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You went to see them, right?
There'll be more.<eos> Or those... they're gonna ride back this way later.<eos> We'll have another chance.<eos> But we're running out of time.<eos> If you and your people want to move against the Saviors... you need to do it soon, and you need the Kingdom.
I know... that Carol, living on her own like that... she might as well be dead right now.<eos> She gets hurt, she dies, if she catches a fever, if she's taken out by a walker... if she gets hit by lightning... anything... anything happens to her, I'll kill you.<eos> I would die for the Kingdom.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> Are you a collective, or does one lead?
I'm Rick.<eos> We own your lives.<eos> You want to buy them back?<eos> Have anything?<eos> Well, you have one of my people.
Well, you have one of my people.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> I want to see him first.<eos> Then we can talk.<eos> The boat things you took got taken.
The boat things you took got taken.<eos> Saw them, so we took the rest.<eos> And we took him.<eos> Well, then you know we have nothing to buy back our lives with.<eos> That's what you'll have soon... nothing.
That's what you'll have soon... nothing.<eos> Because me and my people already belong to that group who took those supplies from the boat.<eos> They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors... either they kill you or they own you.
Let us go, or I will kill her!<eos> Away from Tamiel now.<eos> The Saviors, they... they have other places, other communities.<eos> They have things... food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.<eos> Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.
They have things... food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.<eos> Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.<eos> Away from Tamiel.<eos> Your words now.<eos> If you join us and we beat them together, you can have much of what's theirs.
Want something now.<eos> Rick... can do anything.<eos> This group?<eos> They found me... here, so far from our home.<eos> What do you need?
Rick!<eos> The walls!<eos> Use them!<eos> You believe us now? !<eos> Just tell us what you want... and we'll get it.
You know we will win?<eos> Oh, I know it.<eos> After, we get half of what's won.<eos> Oh, you'll get a third.<eos> And we're taking back what you just stole from us.
And the guns.<eos> Waited by the boat long time. Want something for it.<eos> So it's this.<eos> Jars and guns, guns and jars.<eos> You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you? Long time.
We don't bother.<eos> You had that... thing down there for someone to prove themselves?<eos> No.<eos> His name was Winslow.<eos> What were you gonna do with Gabriel?
I hate this.<eos> Welcome home, haircut.<eos> There's more at the library.<eos> A lot more.<eos> You, uh...
Welcome home, haircut.<eos> There's more at the library.<eos> A lot more.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You have a library?
What do you want?<eos> - Can I have lobster?<eos> - No, you can't have lobster.<eos> What the hell do you think this is?<eos> Do you have canned pasta and tomato sauce?
Say hello.<eos> H-h-hello.<eos> You got a name, asshole? Eugene.<eos> Now us.<eos> Who are you?
Problem is, they don't keep.<eos> They fall apart.<eos> Like that poor sack of... pile of shit there.<eos> So, Dr. Smarty-pants, how do we keep them on their feet?<eos> You, um... smelt on the regs, correct?
They fall apart.<eos> Like that poor sack of... pile of shit there.<eos> So, Dr. Smarty-pants, how do we keep them on their feet?<eos> You, um... smelt on the regs, correct?<eos> I saw that among the legacy equipment on the floor that you possess an operational smelter.
And I was a licensed therapist.<eos> You know, before.<eos> Mm. While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.<eos> Would you care for more microwave popcorn?
How much does she weigh?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Maybe... 120.<eos> Why?<eos> If you could get me her exact weight, I could guarantee a semi-precise T.O. pain-free D.
Better than that.<eos> You can call next, but it might be a while. Oh.<eos> Did you make the pills?<eos> I did.<eos> But you can't have them.
We told her that you were gonna help us, and she says that she...<eos> Pump your brakes, Red.<eos> Do not insult my intelligence, Frankie.<eos> Said pills aren't for Amber. Said pills are for Negan.<eos> That's why you wanted two.
Give us the pills, or we'll tell Negan about it.<eos> We'll tell him that it was your idea to make them and that you tried to get us to help.<eos> That would be a tactical error on your part.<eos> They'll believe me over you for the same reason he believed Dwight over the doctor.<eos> You're replaceable to him.
We found supplies.<eos> Expect us?<eos> We cleaned some.<eos> We oiled some.<eos> You can do the rest.
Everyone stay down. Get your guns up.<eos> Somebody blocked the road.<eos> Can't be for anything good.<eos> Your Majesty, stay inside.<eos> Take a look if you want, but keep your guns up.
It is mere luck we are not all insane.<eos> It isn't luck, Your Majesty.<eos> How's that?<eos> The world does drive people crazy now.<eos> But... you made us another world.
It isn't luck, Your Majesty.<eos> How's that?<eos> The world does drive people crazy now.<eos> But... you made us another world.<eos> You're late.
I want your guns, too.<eos> We did not agree to that.<eos> Well, you got a choice --<eos> Same one that's been there since the beginning, I guess.<eos> You can give up your guns, or you can try to use them.
We should give them over, Your Majesty.<eos> "Ehh, we should give 'em over, Your Majesty."<eos> Or maybe I'll just shove this down your throat.<eos> Give Morgan his stick back.<eos> Then you can have the guns.
You know the answer.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Give them your guns.<eos> We took your guns just now because things are about to get emotional.<eos> You guys have proven that you don't do so good with emotional.
It's fine.<eos> Give them your guns.<eos> We took your guns just now because things are about to get emotional.<eos> You guys have proven that you don't do so good with emotional.<eos> You're short.
It's possible.<eos> It's real.<eos> It's happening now.<eos> And the problems have to end...now.<eos> You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.

You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> We'll get you twice the tribute in an hour.<eos> Right now...is the only time that matters.<eos> And right now... you haven't held up your side of the bargain.
Get in the truck!<eos> Don't say a goddamn word!<eos> We need to get back.<eos> No.<eos> Right now, you have to listen.
We need to get back.<eos> No.<eos> Right now, you have to listen.<eos> For once, be present and listen.<eos> You will make your deliveries on time, every time, and they will be complete.
Right now, you have to listen.<eos> For once, be present and listen.<eos> You will make your deliveries on time, every time, and they will be complete.<eos> It's A's or F's, no I's.<eos> You are gonna show me that you understand by bringing the balance of what you owe tomorrow.
He's dead.<eos> Start walking back now before I kill you.<eos> You say one word or throw one look, I'll kill you right here and now.<eos> Go!<eos> Do you have it?
I didn't.<eos> I do now.<eos> Sasha, don't go... not yet.<eos> Rosita didn't come here to train people.<eos> You're both going after Negan.
Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
What are you talking about?<eos> We need your guns.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna fight The Saviors.<eos> You should join us.
We do whatever The Saviors tell us to do, and they think we're still doing that, but we're not. We're gonna fight them.<eos> And we have other communities beside us, and with Oceanside, we would have an army.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> "Thanks for the guns.<eos> You should join us"?
We are not good, and we are not brave.<eos> Neither you nor me.<eos> She is.<eos> That's why we're in this mess.<eos> Look, Tara, if you take our guns, you might as well be killing us all.
Neither you nor me.<eos> She is.<eos> That's why we're in this mess.<eos> Look, Tara, if you take our guns, you might as well be killing us all.<eos> That's what you'll be doing.
Those hands -- Put them on your head.<eos> Please.<eos> Your people killing my people?<eos> The bombs were outside the walls.<eos> You could've stopped this.
Everybody stay calm.<eos> We don't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> Stay down and listen to what we say.<eos> We want this to go as simply and as peacefully as possible.<eos> All of you can make it that way.
All of you can make it that way.<eos> Get down over there.<eos> Keep quiet.<eos> Now, we made a lot of noise.<eos> We want to wrap this up quick so you can send people to redirect anything coming this way.
Now, we made a lot of noise.<eos> We want to wrap this up quick so you can send people to redirect anything coming this way.<eos> Tara said your forests are relatively clear, so we won't take any chances.<eos> No one needs to get hurt.<eos> This is just about what you have, what we need.
Tara said your forests are relatively clear, so we won't take any chances.<eos> No one needs to get hurt.<eos> This is just about what you have, what we need.<eos> Nobody's taking anything.<eos> You need to let everyone go and leave right now.
It's over.<eos> Just talk to them, okay?<eos> It's not over!<eos> They've forgotten.<eos> You've all forgotten.
But it's that important.<eos> This is your life, all of you.<eos> Remember what it looks like.<eos> Remember what they did to us!<eos> You need to see this.
I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.<eos> Some of us do, but not all of us, and it has to be all of us.<eos> My grandmother thinks you'll all be dead.
Maybe today.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what you're doing.
Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what you're doing.<eos> You're not leaving us any? Nope.
Negan's coming soon.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Three trucks probably. 20 saviors and him.<eos> I can slow them down, bring some trees down in the road, buy a little time for you guys to get ready.<eos> If you can take them out, that's where we start.

The sanctuary?<eos> Where negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
H-hello.<eos> I come salved with the hope that it is my dropped knowledge<eos> Options are zero to none.<eos> Compliance and fealty are your only escape.<eos> Bottom-lining it... You may thrive, or you may die.
No.<eos> We win.<eos> You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named Rick who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed?<eos> It's about you.<eos> You're all gonna wanna put your guns down now.
I mean, I get me, my people.<eos> But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours. And after what he did...<eos> He stepped up.<eos> You people...
But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours. And after what he did...<eos> He stepped up.<eos> You people...<eos> Are animals. Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
He stepped up.<eos> You people...<eos> Are animals. Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.<eos> Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.<eos> So, you don't like Eugene anymore.
- I train you guys.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Lieutenant Steve Valdez will vouch for me... vouch for me.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You're breaking my fucking arm.
Sir, in the future, we can't have you sleeping on the beach, all right? Aah!<eos> Sorry about the gun.<eos> You know, it's dangerous.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Why don't you guys come down to the gym?
All right, gentlemen.<eos> We've been over the rules already.<eos> Protect yourself at all times.<eos> Obey my commands at all times.<eos> Touch gloves now if you want.
I'm good.<eos> - You sure? - I'm ready to fuck him up.<eos> - Sounds good to me.<eos> All right.<eos> You ready?
II've enjoyed my time here.<eos> Thank you guys so much.<eos> It's been a privilege and an honor to fight in front of you.<eos> Thank you, Alvey, Lisa, Joe, Navy St., everybody.<eos> And, thank you guys for watching.
Hi.<eos> I've known her ever since I was little like you. Hi.<eos> These are the neighbors' kids.<eos> Hi, guys!<eos> What are you making?
Hey, don't tell Lisa, huh?<eos> Boys' night out.<eos> Take your vitamins, motherfucker.<eos> We're gonna have some good times.<eos> As you surface... slowly feeling your surroundings... and when you're ready, open your eyes.
Fuck.<eos> Come on.<eos> Terry will set up the camera, make sure you're lit.<eos> - You know how to stream video?<eos> - Yeah. What service do you guys use?
Six folds, huh?<eos> W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000?<eos> You cheap insect [bleep] didn't think I was worth your best equipment?<eos> Man, I told the money bugs.<eos> I said, "You know who this guy is, right?
W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000?<eos> You cheap insect [bleep] didn't think I was worth your best equipment?<eos> Man, I told the money bugs.<eos> I said, "You know who this guy is, right?<eos> You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."
Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid.<eos> Don't know, don't care.<eos> Pull me out.<eos> Hey, pull me out.<eos> Can you hear me?
We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.<eos> What say you, Summer?<eos> I say [bleep] you!<eos> My grandpa was my hero.<eos> You killed him because you were jealous of him.
I say [bleep] you!<eos> My grandpa was my hero.<eos> You killed him because you were jealous of him.<eos> That's pretty obvious from the haircuts.<eos> So do what you want to me, but let my brother go.
And, well... well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero.<eos> He's more like a demon or a super [bleep]up god.<eos> Let's not suck the ghost of his [bleep] too hard.<eos> He was a terrorist, and now he's dead. Oh, yeah?<eos> If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive.

You know he's coming for us.<eos> All right, calm down!<eos> We have his Summer as a hostage.<eos> Obviously, I get her.<eos> You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.
- And it's just sitting there on the books which...<eos> - can't have that.<eos> - Okay then well, thanks for coming in.<eos> - Of course.<eos> And did you think about what I asked?
They said, invitation said "no shoes."<eos> Imagine wearing a suit and no shoes.<eos> Still real nice.<eos> - But small, only like 10 people.<eos> - Ah but you went?
Here we go, and...<eos> So gross.<eos> That's good.<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> You sure you guys don't need any help?
I'm bald.<eos> I miss my hair, but this is awesome.<eos> Instead of washing, rinsing, conditioning, towel drying, hair-fryer drying, and applying hair products for 45 minutes every morning.<eos> I do this.<eos> There, that you can post.
And let's be real.<eos> John can't fight this battle for me.<eos> For a girl who's always trying to make people smile,<eos> I can't be the reason he doesn't.<eos> - So you want to go riding.
- You guys - need anything?<eos> Some hot chocolate?<eos> Want to take the truck?<eos> - No one drives - your truck.<eos> - If you want to take the truck, - you can take the truck.
Because he's been bugging me to spend more time with the family and now everyone will be so focused on what a loser Allison is<eos> - that I'll just slide him in unnoticed. - Over here is where we'll cook things.<eos> Allison is fantastic.<eos> She has a real job and a working vehicle.<eos> I'm glad you're all going to be there.
Do you have other allergies?<eos> It's quicker to list the things I'm not allergic to.<eos> Plums.<eos> I don't even like them that much.<eos> Why are you all drinking in a clump?
Yes, we are.<eos> I told you that drinking game bothers me!<eos> That little bag of soap bothers me.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys suck.
This V.M. Vargas? Yes.<eos> And we should have...<eos> At the time when we needed the loan, we should have come to you.<eos> Any idea what the V.M. stands for?<eos> You borrowed $1,000,000 from a man without knowing his first name. - I know how it...
- It's not a question.<eos> I'm just assessing the level of stupidity.<eos> - Irv, come on, we don't have to...<eos> You get a lot of business from us.<eos> Which, boychik, will stop the moment they arrest you for money laundering.
That... This...<eos> - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital. Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.<eos> You watch too many movies, and you think the deal can always be changed, and it can't.
I can help!<eos> Arby's?<eos> Okay.<eos> You just appear every time a person says Arby's?<eos> Oh, are you guys going for Arby's?
Uh, nothing.<eos> Just a misunderstanding.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> You remind me a little of my husband.<eos> You two would've gotten along really well.
Wait. We have fake books?<eos> Away from the road.<eos> Forty grand.<eos> That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.<eos> My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
Except the dirt.<eos> The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.<eos> Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.<eos> Ten thousand, 20,000.<eos> But here you have, like, what?
It's got swearing and drug use and wait for it, people masturbating.<eos> You think that belongs in high school?<eos> What else was there?<eos> Please, do not feed the animals.<eos> You don't even read the books you're assigned.
The witness was Reverend Paul.<eos> He's half the reason why I'm in this shit.<eos> You don't have to worry about him.<eos> Thanks, Keith.<eos> Well, you had your chance, boys. It was a nice shot.
You don't have to worry about him.<eos> Thanks, Keith.<eos> Well, you had your chance, boys. It was a nice shot.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> But when you come after somebody like me, it's a zero sum game.
Thanks, Keith.<eos> Well, you had your chance, boys. It was a nice shot.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> But when you come after somebody like me, it's a zero sum game.<eos> You either kill me or, well...

He's been telling lies about me.<eos> I'll see what I can find.<eos> And the Lord himself was sent from heaven with a shout.<eos> With a sound from an archangel, and with the voice of God!<eos> Can you hear him?
With a sound from an archangel, and with the voice of God!<eos> Can you hear him?<eos> Come on, worship him.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> Can you hear him?
Can you hear him?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you and Mom work your shit out? Yeah.
Drags you down in the morning...<eos> That ravenous hole in your heart.<eos> Is it loneliness? Is it sadness? Is it lust?<eos> Jesus said, "Blessed are those" "who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."<eos> When you find Jesus, Those empty places inside you will be filled with His love.

I want you to rub something.<eos> Would you rub something?<eos> A little rub and tug.<eos> Today is a No Excuses day.<eos> I want you to make a list of all the things you ever wanted to do in your life but have never got around to.

Today is a No Excuses day.<eos> I want you to make a list of all the things you ever wanted to do in your life but have never got around to.<eos> And then I want you to make a choice.<eos> Will this be a list of regrets, or will it be a list of things to look forward to.<eos> Now, if you're a Christian, you already know the answer.

This is our home.<eos> This is the home of truth.<eos> You know, that's why they don't want us here.<eos> They don't want us to tell the truth. But because you do...<eos> You want the truth. - Paul...
We will fuckin' shoot her in front of you. Get up.<eos> Get up. You stay away from her.<eos> - Either way, it's gonna happen.<eos> - Sit the fuck down.<eos> You're not gonna fuckin' hurt her.
They're just kids!<eos> Let them go.<eos> Let's fucking castrate him now, it's no fun when they're dead.<eos> Damn it! Let's just finish this!<eos> You can kill every priest and landlord in Spain, but you'll never win!

Good morning.<eos> Look who it is! Welcome, Master Lluís.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Try one of the loaves, they're still warm.<eos> You lot keep working.
Don't let your milk get cold.<eos> - Hello. - Good morning.<eos> Mummy, look, it's uncle Juli milk.<eos> Put that back.<eos> What are you doing here?
Come on, girl. Come on, girl.<eos> Just put it down on that... - that desk over there.<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> I'm opening the safe now, so you can step... step over there. Sure. Yeah.<eos> Hey, you guys are back.
He just had it coming out of both ends all afternoon.<eos> I'm Brandon, by the way.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> You ain't no eagle, Josepovitch.<eos> You guys are the best.
I'm going.<eos> Bye, uncle Marius.<eos> Bye, Amanda.<eos> She's great.<eos> You guys are doing such a...
Okay.<eos> Sekou, are you okay?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Hey, I'm back.<eos> You're probably wondering, "How the hell did he get out?"
I admire it.<eos> Nobody wants to be a whistle-blower.<eos> Whatever you give us, we use only as a threat.<eos> Keep him in line.<eos> You threaten, you have to be ready to follow through.
What the hell are they angry about?<eos> I lied for them.<eos> I saved their asses.<eos> Yeah, true, this time around.<eos> But, Majid, you've been dropping missiles on their heads for the past 30 years.
She's here.<eos> Sorry I'm late. No worries.<eos> Come on in.<eos> We're all set to go.<eos> H-Hey, Rob... was it you guys who sent the car for me this morning?
Next time, you ask for half up front.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> You f-- You fucking assholes.<eos> About fucking time.<eos> Assholes-- all of you.
Copy that, sir.<eos> P2, Massey.<eos> What's your position?<eos> Just east of Park on 49th.<eos> Did you have eyes on the event?
What about the guy you were talking to in the supermarket?<eos> - What?<eos> Who?<eos> - The one with the... baseball.<eos> You were talking.
What? No.<eos> I don't... I don't have one. I...<eos> It's... Alice had asked me what John does, and I realized that I don't even know, really.<eos> I... So how can I...<eos> Don't you have guys, like, trained guys for this?
A man who is a lowly slave and who himself must first be saved.<eos> At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.<eos> The doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.<eos> It can be done, Lord, it can be arranged... with your help and guidance.<eos> And you shall have it, Brother Trew, I'm sure.
Erik!<eos> The city, we leave in your hands.<eos> It's ours, it must remain ours. I will ensure it.<eos> You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.<eos> No, Lord. You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.
We are curious.<eos> Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!
Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!<eos> And if he kills you, then so be it!<eos> More fool you!
Hit him!<eos> Go on, hit him!<eos> Lord?<eos> Lord, we are Saxons, it's none of our business.<eos> If it is a fight you want, it can be with me.
Who served with Alfred at Ethandun?<eos> I am.<eos> Praise Him.<eos> Praise God! It is a sign!<eos> You know of Ethandun?
Praise God! It is a sign!<eos> You know of Ethandun?<eos> Not only do we know of this battle, Lord, we have risen because of it.<eos> And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.<eos> You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?
We take care of the horses... and then I find Alfred's priest.<eos> We carry it all, we must.<eos> But what guarantee do we have that he will not steal Alfred's silver?<eos> None. But that's the risk we have to take.<eos> Have you been stealing from Alfred, Father Beocca? Uhtred!
Men belonging to Kjartan.<eos> They are the shepherds, we are the sheep.<eos> - Then it is a trap?<eos> - It is.<eos> You will enter the slave market alone.
I wish to see Guthred. Guthred!<eos> Make yourself known!<eos> Guthred of Cumbraland!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I will decide when you see your man.
Make yourself known!<eos> Guthred of Cumbraland!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I will decide when you see your man.<eos> You will give us the ransom and you will give it now.
Priest... is my man correct?<eos> There are further horsemen?<eos> He is correct, Lord.<eos> But these horsemen, they came from nowhere and asking us to where we were travelling and we prayed that they would leave us, vanish.<eos> You wanted rid of them?
You wanted rid of them?<eos> Believe me when I say this, they were not of this world, Lord.<eos> They were not men, like you and I are men.<eos> What do you mean, they are not men?<eos> Well, why are you doing that?
We were asking his protection, Lord, from the horsemen.<eos> If they're not men, what are they?<eos> Please, to speak of them may summon them.<eos> From where?<eos> - You tell me nothing.
Oh, dear God in heaven, it is him.<eos> It is who?<eos> We come for your souls!<eos> - Your souls.<eos> - Who are you?
Attack...<eos> Attack!<eos> No man shall move, or Sven Kjartanson will die!<eos> You will all hear me!<eos> All of you must leave this place.
No man shall move, or Sven Kjartanson will die!<eos> You will all hear me!<eos> All of you must leave this place.<eos> Go!<eos> Or with one touch of my horsemen, you will be cursed!
Lord, I beg you.<eos> That he fears you is enough.<eos> Let him take that fear to Kjartan.<eos> May we free the prisoners, Lord, search the pens for a friend, the king?<eos> You may.
Guthred!<eos> We are looking for Guthred of Cumbraland, - son of Harthacnut.<eos> - I am Guthred.<eos> - How can I help you? - Lord...<eos> Is it you?
- How can I help you? - Lord...<eos> Is it you?<eos> We have found you.<eos> You have, it seems.<eos> Who are you?
As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.<eos> This is for you.<eos> The king brings me food.<eos> Did Alfred not feed you?<eos> You know of Alfred?
You know of Alfred?<eos> Aye, every Dane in the land knows of Alfred.<eos> And while a slave, some of the men recently captured, they spoke of Ethandun.<eos> They spoke of Uhtred... how he broke a shield wall.<eos> You should pay a skald to write a song. Hm!
I did that in Mercia.<eos> I was drunk and the song was tuneless.<eos> I am indebted.<eos> My words have no tune, but they're sincere.<eos> You have brought me back to life.
I dream of you... as you were.<eos> I dream of nothing but the fire.<eos> My wedding necklace... do you like it?<eos> If any love for me remains inside your shrivelled heart, then take out your knife and kill me.<eos> So you know of the Northmen Sigefrid and Erik?
Robotic skeleton prepared and waiting for brain insertion.<eos> Initiate Project 2571.<eos> Now your eyes are gonna open.<eos> There.<eos> You're safe.
Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Hello, Mira.<eos> I'm Dr. Ouelet.<eos> Do you remember anything about the attack?
What happened?<eos> I was drowning.<eos> There's water!<eos> That's right.<eos> You were on a boat.
Please.<eos> Answer me!<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> You Okay?<eos> You're injured.

What was going on with you at the hotel last night?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You sure?<eos> - Hey, sweetheart, you want an upgrade? - Move.
I'm fine.<eos> You sure?<eos> - Hey, sweetheart, you want an upgrade? - Move.<eos> Move.<eos> - I have anything you want.
- I got your bones. - Thanks, man.<eos> For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people, how come you care about dogs so much?<eos> Don't know. I just like strays, and they like me.<eos> They like you because you feed them.

Meet Major.<eos> Major, Gabriel.<eos> We used to have a dog.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I had you down as more of a cat person.
Major, Gabriel.<eos> We used to have a dog.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I had you down as more of a cat person.<eos> You don't talk about that stuff, huh?
My parents, they died bringing us to this country.<eos> Our boat sank in the harbor.<eos> I almost drowned.<eos> It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't see through it.<eos> You're lucky.
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't see through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
Welcome to Hanka Robotics.<eos> All visitors must display appropriate credentials at all times.<eos> Open and close, please.<eos> You have damaged internal systems.<eos> Maybe next time, you can design me better.
I had two this morning.<eos> - Sound or image?<eos> - Both.<eos> I see it.<eos> Have you made any unencrypted downloads?
The glitches have a different texture to the rest of your code.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your decisions.<eos> I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> You are human.
People see you as human.<eos> Everyone around me seems to fit.<eos> They seem connected to something, something I am not.<eos> - It's like I have no past.<eos> - Of course you have a past.
Everyone around me seems to fit.<eos> They seem connected to something, something I am not.<eos> - It's like I have no past.<eos> - Of course you have a past.<eos> And with time you'll feel more and more connected to it, and to them.
I know.<eos> They could have left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses. Viruses.<eos> She's right.<eos> You'll be exposing your mind to whoever hacked her. You'll be wide open.
I have to get inside her memory.<eos> It's the fastest way to find Kuze.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.
It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.<eos> How come you're the one sweating?
Are you okay?<eos> I know where he is.<eos> I know this place.<eos> They run black market mech.<eos> - You tooled up?
- Yep.<eos> Target's the basement.<eos> I'll lead.<eos> Switching to mind-comms.<eos> - Hope you've been practicing.
Copy that.<eos> We've got it covered.<eos> There's a lot of heat in here for a nightclub.<eos> It's a Yakuza club.<eos> What did you expect?
What did you expect?<eos> I quite like the place.<eos> Why doesn't that surprise me?<eos> I'm gonna have to draw some attention, see if I can access the basement that way.<eos> You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?
You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?<eos> I'm just here for the girls and the beer.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I'm looking for someone.<eos> You been here before?
My mistake.<eos> Why don't you come have fun with us?<eos> We'll have some privacy.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I'll be here when you need me.
She's human?<eos> Your friend.<eos> Now what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?
We have privacy.<eos> Listen.<eos> No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?
No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Been.<eos> If you don't answer, you're gonna hurt my feelings.
Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Been.<eos> If you don't answer, you're gonna hurt my feelings.<eos> Ladriya, do you have Major on comms?
Ladriya, do you have Major on comms?<eos> Got nothing.<eos> Signal's still blocked.<eos> I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so, if you don't want to talk,<eos> maybe you want to dance!
Major?<eos> Where's Batou?<eos> In Enhancement next door.<eos> He's doing well.<eos> You took most of the blast.
You took most of the blast.<eos> I saw him down there.<eos> It was like he waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic-scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.
Since the Deep Dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.
No.<eos> They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.<eos> That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to Deep Dive the geisha.
They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.<eos> That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to Deep Dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.
That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to Deep Dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.<eos> No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.
No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.<eos> I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts, so you should be able to secure them.
I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts, so you should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance, Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.
Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts, so you should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance, Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.
- What else I got?<eos> - They suit you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got night-vision, mile-zoom, and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.
- Yeah?<eos> I got night-vision, mile-zoom, and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll get used to it.
You'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.<eos> Major?<eos> Could you feed the dogs for me?
Major is the future of my company.<eos> If you compromise her systems again, I will burn this section.<eos> Create your own beauty.<eos> Beauty enhanced.<eos> You human?
Create your own beauty.<eos> Beauty enhanced.<eos> You human?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you take that off so I can see your face?
Yeah.<eos> Can you take that off so I can see your face?<eos> What does that feel like?<eos> It feels different.<eos> What are you?
Tell me what they took from me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They never told us.<eos> It feels weird driving with these eyes.<eos> Why do you take that?
But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?<eos> I mean, it's the same price, you know? And doesn't sound so bad.<eos> At least, if you can't play that proper, it sounds... 2571.<eos> Are you prepared to die for 257...
The signal's unstable. Can you get a lock on it?<eos> Think so.<eos> We gotta move fast. We're losing it.<eos> Connecting.<eos> Who are you?
Connecting.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I am shy.<eos> I'm not beautiful like you.
Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I am shy.<eos> I'm not beautiful like you.<eos> Tell me who you are.
Come in.<eos> I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.
I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I am that which you seek to destroy.
Tell me who you are.<eos> I am that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life my name is.<eos> Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?
Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have connected you to a network of my own creation.<eos> When I am finished in this world, my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?
I have connected you to a network of my own creation.<eos> When I am finished in this world, my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became fascinated with you,<eos> reading your code while you were inside that geisha.
reading your code while you were inside that geisha.<eos> Like nothing I had felt before and yet so familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We are not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.
Like nothing I had felt before and yet so familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We are not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> "Innocent," is that what you call them?
"Innocent," is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?
Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?<eos> The first cerebral salvage?<eos> You were born of lessons took from my failure.
I was conscious while they dismembered my body and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell that they had built.<eos> How Project 2571 had failed, and they had to move on<eos> to you.<eos> What a beauty you are.
What a beauty you are.<eos> They have improved us so much since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution, but they have created us to evolve alone,<eos> beyond them.<eos> "Evolution," that's what you call killing everyone who made you?
They have improved us so much since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution, but they have created us to evolve alone,<eos> beyond them.<eos> "Evolution," that's what you call killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution, but they have created us to evolve alone,<eos> beyond them.<eos> "Evolution," that's what you call killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> You're a murderer.
It is self-defense.<eos> Defense of self!<eos> More will die until they tell me what they took!<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?
I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?<eos> Like everyone else.<eos> Do it then.<eos> Do what you were programed to do.
Do what you were programed to do.<eos> What is that?<eos> What is that?<eos> I can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do you see it?
Don't take the medication that they give you.<eos> They use it to suppress your memories.<eos> Your shell belongs to them, but not your ghost.<eos> Your ghost is yours.<eos> Remember that, and maybe you can remember it all.
Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Mira.<eos> My God, you're safe!<eos> You've been gone for hours!
Major!<eos> Mira.<eos> My God, you're safe!<eos> You've been gone for hours!<eos> No one knew where you were.
My God, you're safe!<eos> You've been gone for hours!<eos> No one knew where you were.<eos> What?<eos> You're scaring me.
How many?<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people.
How many?<eos> Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people.<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.
No.<eos> We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you to fight terrorists.<eos> I didn't approve.<eos> It was cruel, but my work, it was important, and you were born.
We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you to fight terrorists.<eos> I didn't approve.<eos> It was cruel, but my work, it was important, and you were born.<eos> You were so beautiful.
You were so beautiful.<eos> Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.
Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.<eos> You built him.
He had a violent, unstable mind.<eos> His cerebral connections wouldn't hold!<eos> - I tried to save him!<eos> - No.<eos> You left him to die.
Is there any word on Major?<eos> Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.
I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.<eos> But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?
You never ask.<eos> But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?
But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man.
Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man.<eos> You follow orders, so if they ordered you to kill me...
No data streaming.<eos> Just<eos> nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?
nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?
- Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I don't know who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?
Her ghost is what failed us.<eos> We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?
She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic, upload your data on the raid, find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.
What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic, upload your data on the raid, find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.<eos> You're deleting everything, aren't you?
I do not consent.<eos> I do not consent.<eos> We never needed your consent.<eos> Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?
He found us!<eos> Target acquired.<eos> No!<eos> Target eliminated.<eos> You came close, you freak.
I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I will always be there with you in your ghost.<eos> Target is in view.<eos> What are you waiting for?
No!<eos> Keep firing.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Aramaki told me you had a name from before.
Please.<eos> Tell him this is justice.<eos> It's what I was built for.<eos> My name is Major, and I give my consent.<eos> You don't have to come here anymore.
Things the world thought were impossible.<eos> Now, that kid needed that drought.<eos> The world needed those empty pools.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday?
But we, my friend, are not at war.<eos> We are at peril.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You on a diet?
You ain't hungry?<eos> It's seven-thirty in the morning.<eos> So? It's lunch or dinnertime somewhere in the world.<eos> Come on, eat up!<eos> You know who does feel safe?
And us, we the people, ended up losing both.<eos> While everybody else is stuck on the ground, we're doing shit on the board nobody's ever even seen before.<eos> Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?
Give me the money!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Goal!<eos> And you say you're no hero.
Hurry up!<eos> Goal!<eos> And you say you're no hero.<eos> I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.
I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.<eos> At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.<eos> Do you want some of this?<eos> Or are you just gonna...
With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications,<eos> corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.<eos> And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?
Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!<eos> Page one!<eos> Shit happens.<eos> You're late!
We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.<eos> - What you doing?
Xander!<eos> Xander!<eos> Hey friend give me a second.<eos> And here we go, we are underway!<eos> I knew you would do it, Xander.
Xander!<eos> Hey friend give me a second.<eos> And here we go, we are underway!<eos> I knew you would do it, Xander.<eos> You brought the world to us.
Go, go, go.<eos> Of course, Xander Cage can't pay the satellite company, just like a regular guy.<eos> What?<eos> And line the pockets of some boardroom billionaires?<eos> You know, these days, a regular guy can't afford to be regular.
Oh, boy.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Down!<eos> Get down! Don't move, asshole!<eos> On your knees now, you son of a bitch!
On your knees now, you son of a bitch!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I want to comply.<eos> I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.
I want to comply.<eos> I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole."<eos> "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?
I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole."<eos> "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!
But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole."<eos> "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!<eos> You're not good at this.
Okay!<eos> Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons! Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.
Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons! Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?
A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> I see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
So, I'm looking for someone.<eos> Since when have we had a business relationship?<eos> I get caught even touching a computer, my ass goes away for 20.<eos> Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.
Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.<eos> Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.
You know I'm good for it.<eos> Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?
Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> What?<eos> I used to think you were the man.
Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> What?<eos> I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now, I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.
I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now, I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nobody knows I'm here.<eos> And you know how I am about keeping secrets.
But now, I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nobody knows I'm here.<eos> And you know how I am about keeping secrets.<eos> So you say, but Interpol's got these new listening bugs.
Real MI6 kind of shit.<eos> Disappear on your skin, under your arms, tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.<eos> Unwrap me, then.<eos> You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.<eos> Lucky for me, you love to gamble.
My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.<eos> Stiff odds?<eos> The things I do for my country.<eos> Like finding needles in a stack of needles.<eos> Even though you're shackled by the Queen, you're still the best in the world.
Do yourself a favor.<eos> Burn this.<eos> The whispers I hear, these ghosts of yours are the real kind of trouble.<eos> They've got training, they've got funding, and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Okay, so, you're worried that I might get hurt?

That's all I'm saying.<eos> Your ghosts are hanging out in the Philippines.<eos> Figures they'd go to the Pacific.<eos> Some jungle rave that's off the grid.<eos> How the hell did you find it so quickly?
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.<eos> How the hell did you find it so quickly?<eos> Undercover work.<eos> Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?
Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?
Turns out there's a new mission.<eos> I'm not gonna destroy the one thing I can use to get what we want.<eos> The whole world is looking for us, Xiang.<eos> Let them come!<eos> You worry about pawn sacrifice.
Let them come!<eos> You worry about pawn sacrifice.<eos> I got my eye on the king.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You forgot the queen.
Holy shit!<eos> Live and in concert, one night only.<eos> This is crazy!<eos> I was at Coachella and Guns N' Roses got back together, but this is way cooler.<eos> Well, I wasn't actually there, but I, like, heard about it, you know?
Breathe.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.<eos> Are you kidding me with those guns?<eos> You're like the frickin' Terminator!
And I'm not talking about the first Terminator, but the second Terminator that goes back to kill the first Terminator.<eos> It was the liquidy metal guy.<eos> Agent Clearidge worked closely with Gibbons.<eos> She'll handle support for the operation.<eos> And I bet a guy like you needs a lot of support.
It was the liquidy metal guy.<eos> Agent Clearidge worked closely with Gibbons.<eos> She'll handle support for the operation.<eos> And I bet a guy like you needs a lot of support.<eos> What are you? Like 220?
It's not like I have a safe word, or anything.<eos> It's "kumquat."<eos> Never really think about it.<eos> Kumquat.<eos> What about you?
Kumquat.<eos> What about you?<eos> No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touché.<eos> You are Xander Cage.
Anything you need, Becky can source it within the hour.<eos> Except for any sort of illegal drugs.<eos> Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.
Not slackers.<eos> Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system.<eos> Am I right?<eos> No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.
What did you just do?<eos> I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?<eos> You know, no one has this number.
I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?<eos> You know, no one has this number.<eos> So, what are you up to these days?
You smell that?<eos> Smells like the same shit in a different suit.<eos> You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.
You will listen to me.<eos> Meeting's over.<eos> Well, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?<eos> Hey, that's super-cinch body armor.<eos> You've got to tighten the strap over here.
Well, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?<eos> Hey, that's super-cinch body armor.<eos> You've got to tighten the strap over here.<eos> I got this.<eos> What are you, my handler?
Hey, that's super-cinch body armor.<eos> You've got to tighten the strap over here.<eos> I got this.<eos> What are you, my handler?<eos> I'm whatever you need.
What are you, my handler?<eos> I'm whatever you need.<eos> I can handle anything.<eos> And I've got a tight grip.<eos> And just so you know, I am not a field agent.
This is a multistage signal disruptor.<eos> It's very, very breakable.<eos> Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're one of them, aren't you?
What could possibly go wrong?<eos> - That is my style, though.<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> You know, actually, I would rather if you didn't...
- Yeah, good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> You know, actually, I would rather if you didn't...<eos> That's refreshing.<eos> You actually know what you're doing down there.
You actually know what you're doing down there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Let them pass!<eos> You need something, man?
30% off the top?<eos> Do I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?<eos> 10%.<eos> 10%?<eos> You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.
10%.<eos> 10%?<eos> You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> Here's what you do.
10%?<eos> You must've been aiming at the other lawless, uncharted island down the block.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> You turn around, go get your boat.
Here's what you do.<eos> You turn around, go get your boat.<eos> You can kiss my ass.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?
You turn around, go get your boat.<eos> You can kiss my ass.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You talked me into it!
You talked me into it!<eos> 18%!<eos> You think this is a flea market?<eos> You think we're in the hood selling TVs and fake watches, or something like that?<eos> What's wrong with you, man?
You think we're in the hood selling TVs and fake watches, or something like that?<eos> What's wrong with you, man?<eos> All right.<eos> Twenty-two and a half.<eos> How you gonna do "and a half"?
I like your style, man.<eos> Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.
Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.<eos> Nicks, you're gonna show 'em how we do it.
Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your earbuds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.<eos> Nicks, you're gonna show 'em how we do it.<eos> You got this?
Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.<eos> Nicks, you're gonna show 'em how we do it.<eos> You got this?<eos> Just watch.<eos> Can you keep this behind the bar for me?
But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?<eos> They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.<eos> MI6?<eos> You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.
MI6?<eos> You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.
You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.
You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.<eos> You're looking for someone.
You're looking for someone.<eos> And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.
And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?
Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?<eos> I'd say you're a couple inches off.<eos> Bit of a stalemate.<eos> Not if you drop the gun.
Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.<eos> And how long do you intend to push your luck?
A damn, strong drink.<eos> So, let's be real and talk about what we all really want.<eos> I'm only here for that.<eos> And in my mind, you guys could walk away nicely.<eos> Unless you want to continue our foreplay.
A grenade?<eos> What is this?<eos> Eastern Europe in the early '90s?<eos> Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?<eos> That's the wrong question to ask.<eos> What's the right question?<eos> "Are you willing to die for it?"
One grenade, three people.<eos> I like the odds.<eos> Two grenades, three people.<eos> I'm loving these odds.<eos> You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?
I'm barely conscious.<eos> Delirious.<eos> Drowning in my own blood.<eos> And all I can hear myself think is, "Today's the day."<eos> "Today's the day you die."
We are all Triple-X.<eos> We just have different agendas.<eos> She wants to destroy it.<eos> I'm gonna use it.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you take it back to the NSA.
Don't move!<eos> Okay, I actually have what you want.<eos> Pandora's Box?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> But you're wrong, though.
Okay, I actually have what you want.<eos> Pandora's Box?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> But you're wrong, though.<eos> You take it from me, and you die first.
Moscow Mule by the bar.<eos> And then Igor on the stairs.<eos> See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.
See where we're going with this?<eos> But none of that matters.<eos> 'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.
Hi, Ivan.<eos> Other Ivan.<eos> Bye-bye, Moscow Mule.<eos> Igor.<eos> That's another one you owe me, X.
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion touched down, man!<eos> X said stay on the boat.<eos> You want to play?<eos> That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.<eos> You want it, come and get it.
It happened again.<eos> Another satellite fell.<eos> Us working as a team.<eos> That's what Gibbons would've wanted.<eos> You in?
Nicks, when I crashed the boat up on shore and saved your life...<eos> Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> ...do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?<eos> Officially, you're deranged.
Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?<eos> How did you get roped into all this?
It's the most important one, actually.<eos> It's when I decided to change the world instead of rage against it.<eos> We found him.<eos> We found Pandora's Box.<eos> Xander, do you copy?
You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Red light! Red light! Red light!<eos> Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?
Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?<eos> Look out!<eos> Wait.<eos> Is this the part where you act the basic bitch and tell me you got your eye on me and that you don't trust me?
Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Tennyson?<eos> Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.
Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.<eos> It's an old Gibbons fail-safe.<eos> You crashed my party!
Hold on!<eos> "Hold on" ain't no goddamn plan!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Hi.<eos> You looking for someone?
You looking for someone?<eos> That's 200!<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> Xander, you got to get to the top floor.
What the hell's going on out there?<eos> Empty.<eos> Adele, Xander's in.<eos> Find the target, light him up.<eos> Gibbons thought you'd be back.
Adele, Xander's in.<eos> Find the target, light him up.<eos> Gibbons thought you'd be back.<eos> To be the hero we needed.<eos> You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.
You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.<eos> This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.<eos> I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?
This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.<eos> I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?
I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?<eos> I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.<eos> Do you have a shot?
You forgot to put deodorant on?<eos> I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.<eos> Do you have a shot?<eos> He thought he had the right to police the world.<eos> Adele, do you have eyes on the target?
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?<eos> I'm switching to thermal.<eos> I was never going to stop downing satellites no matter what happened.<eos> Because this world has turned...<eos> Please, please, please tell me you have a shot.
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Easy.<eos> There's a war out there.<eos> We're at war for our survival, you don't see it?
Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
Let's go, boys.<eos> We recovered Pandora's Box.<eos> They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.<eos> But they're taking Xiang.<eos> And, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.
They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.<eos> But they're taking Xiang.<eos> And, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?
- Get behind there!<eos> What a rush.<eos> Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you you got no manners.
- I've got a plan!<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!
This is all we've got.<eos> Pin 'em! Pin 'em down!<eos> Damn!<eos> I'm out of bullets.<eos> You got any?
They say it's the last great adventure.<eos> Be sure to send a postcard.<eos> I live for this shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Nicks, I hope you got that on camera!
Now I know why.<eos> It's exactly the way I left it.<eos> I took it on a date or two.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.
X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.<eos> To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?<eos> Where do I sign up?<eos> You know, you done pissed on the wrong damn picnic.
I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> We thought we'd end with Augustus' favorite song.<eos> That's an impressive trick.<eos> What?<eos> Think you're the only one who knows how to play dead?
Gotcha.<eos> This is some pretty surreal shit, being at your own funeral.<eos> I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.

And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.<eos> Now what?<eos> You keep being the rebel the world doesn't know it needs.
Let me simplify it for you.<eos> Kick some ass.<eos> Get the girl.<eos> And try to look dope while you're doing it.<eos> You can do "dope," can't you?
Kick some ass.<eos> Get the girl.<eos> And try to look dope while you're doing it.<eos> You can do "dope," can't you?<eos> Sure you can.
Junior, let's bounce!<eos> I'll see you later, X.<eos> I can definitely make that work.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You got me.
You got me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> I'm not a soldier, I'm a baller.<eos> I'll see you later, X.<eos> Sure you can.
Andy, is that you?
Andy, is that you?<eos> Oh, hi, Zeke.<eos> Did you hear anything?
Did you hear anything?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> - Morning, Sally.<eos> - Morning.<eos> You hungry?
Hey. Shh!<eos> Hey, it's just me.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you come down to get some Fruit Loops?
Did you come down to get some Fruit Loops?<eos> Okay, okay. Shh!<eos> Here you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Okay, now can you do something for me?
Okay, okay. Shh!<eos> Here you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Okay, now can you do something for me?<eos> When you go back upstairs, don't tell anybody that you saw Daddy down here, okay?
Won't that be fun?<eos> To have just a little secret between the two of us? All right?<eos> Okay, so remember. Now, shh!<eos> Thank you, Uncle Zeke.<eos> Sally, were you speaking to someone down in the basement?
Hang on.<eos> Mornin'.<eos> He's not answering his phone?<eos> Well, you better tell the Feds to meet us there.<eos> Sally Ann, where do you think you're going?
- But I want.<eos> - Go upstairs now.<eos> Ezekiel! It's the damnedest thing. Someone just stole my car!<eos> - You don't say?<eos> - It's an '87 Cavalier. You should be more surprised.
- What?<eos> Want a ride to work?<eos> Hey, baby, it's me.<eos> Hey, I fucking got it.<eos> When can you get away?
I'll wait for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fuck, Zeke.<eos> Mornin', Harris.<eos> Guess you're ridin' up front, huh?
- Yeah, everything's just peachy.<eos> - How's the shoulder?<eos> Ask a stupid question.<eos> Actually, when the bullet hit me, it didn't hurt as much as you'd think.<eos> Well, you're a tougher man than I am.
Seriously, though, I did see a naked kid.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Enough already, will ya?<eos> - I just. I saw it.<eos> You represent the Bureau.
I don't see how that makes any sense.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm not stranding you, am I?<eos> No, no. I'll hitch a ride with Beavis and Butthead back there.<eos> Where you going?
No, no. I'll hitch a ride with Beavis and Butthead back there.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Oh, I thought I'd swing past the Burton place just to see if Ed thinks twice about leaving Steph behind.<eos> Plus, maybe if I stay there long enough, I can avoid Martha's dinner.<eos> - Can you do me a favor?
- Can you do me a favor?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just keep an eye on those two.<eos> They seem like decent guys. I just. If Andy turns up, I'd rather hear about it first before he gets gunned down.<eos> You really think Andy's still here?
This is Ed.<eos> Leave a message. See what happens.<eos> Shit.<eos> Stephanie? Steph?<eos> - Where the hell have you been?
Yeah, it's just. I'm not much of a gun guy, Steph.<eos> - Become one.<eos> - Jesus, Steph!<eos> And go get that money.<eos> Oh, please, Zeke. You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.
- Become one.<eos> - Jesus, Steph!<eos> And go get that money.<eos> Oh, please, Zeke. You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.<eos> - Aren't you hungry?
And go get that money.<eos> Oh, please, Zeke. You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.<eos> - Aren't you hungry?<eos> - Um, not particularly, no.<eos> - You worried about your brother?
I'm just worried about him.<eos> I know Andy, and he just couldn't do something like this.<eos> Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?
Yeah. Well.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> - I'm giving this town a bath.<eos> - Bath time!<eos> - I thought you wasn't hungry.
- I'm giving this town a bath.<eos> - Bath time!<eos> - I thought you wasn't hungry.<eos> - Oh, I'm starving.<eos> Then why didn't you eat Mommy's breakfast?
Okay.<eos> Hey, Sally.<eos> Do you mind if we drop her off at school on the way to work?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.
No, not at all.<eos> Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That's real nice. That's real nice.<eos> You're a nice little girl.
Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That's real nice. That's real nice.<eos> You're a nice little girl.<eos> You know, I'm a police officer just like you.
Yeah, I, uh.<eos> Stephanie Burton called, said that Ed came and went.<eos> So he just came back here to get his clothes?<eos> - He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?
Have you seen my face?<eos> I called you, remember?<eos> Listen, we got a dead body in a county that doesn't get dead bodies and a cop with a bullet hole in his arm.<eos> This is a big deal.<eos> So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.
Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.<eos> Maybe you come out an old lady.<eos> Hey, maybe you don't come out at all.<eos> Steph, listen.<eos> - No, you listen.
He'll kill me.<eos> - Nobody is killing anybody.<eos> Tell that to Chris Morrow.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> The best way for nobody else to get killed is for you to tell us what you know.
I think Ed was planning to rip those guys off from moment one.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> - Where are you?
So what do we do now?<eos> Sikes.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Mexico. You should check it out.
Drinks are a bit pricey, but the beaches are amazing.<eos> Gosh, I'd really love to, but I'm kinda busy right now hunting down my brother.<eos> Don't bother. I told you, I'm in Mexico.<eos> Jesus, Andy.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?
I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces and hawking life insurance.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that before you took Ed's money.<eos> I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.<eos> Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?
Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.<eos> I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.
We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother. We're talking about you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ed bought me off.<eos> Okay?<eos> You happy?
Fine.<eos> Ed bought me off.<eos> Okay?<eos> You happy?<eos> Andy, you need to turn yourself in.
Turn myself in?<eos> Are you kidding me? With Chris dead?<eos> Now that's fucking felony-murder.<eos> Andy, I can't get you out of this.<eos> You either turn yourself in or you face the consequences.
- That makes sense.<eos> - Hey, who was that?<eos> Martha? - Yeah, sloppy Joes tonight.<eos> I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.
I love a sloppy Joe.<eos> Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.<eos> Who was that? Your brother?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I just don't want you to get yourself into something you can't get out of.
Stop, no, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't hang up.<eos> I'll pay.<eos> I know you're not a whore.
I just.<eos> I just.<eos> I'm desperate.<eos> A thousand dollars?<eos> What, are you insane?
I'm desperate.<eos> A thousand dollars?<eos> What, are you insane?<eos> Stop, stop! I know.<eos> No, you're fine. You're right.
That's awful kind of you to say.<eos> Isn't that nice of him to say, Sally?<eos> What is so funny, little miss giggles?<eos> I swear, sometimes, I don't know what to do with this one.<eos> Are you gonna be my new daddy?
I swear, sometimes, I don't know what to do with this one.<eos> Are you gonna be my new daddy?<eos> Sally, now listen here.<eos> Your daddy is gonna be home very soon safe and sound, okay?<eos> Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy and not small and weak like me.
Sally, now listen here.<eos> Your daddy is gonna be home very soon safe and sound, okay?<eos> Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy and not small and weak like me.<eos> I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?
Your daddy is gonna be home very soon safe and sound, okay?<eos> Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy and not small and weak like me.<eos> I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?<eos> Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?
I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.<eos> Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?<eos> Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?<eos> On second thought, consider yourself lucky.<eos> You are so beautiful.
You name it, he used it.<eos> But this stuff.<eos> I mean, for a thousand bucks, I went straight to the magic man.<eos> Can I have a kiss?<eos> I thought you were still mad at me.
But this stuff.<eos> I mean, for a thousand bucks, I went straight to the magic man.<eos> Can I have a kiss?<eos> I thought you were still mad at me.<eos> No, I was never mad at you. You were young, you needed money. It's an opportunity.
Stop talking!<eos> Our Father, Who art in heaven.<eos> Stop praying!<eos> God!<eos> If you tell one goddamn soul, I will fucking kill you.
A bummed-out crackhead just streaked us.<eos> Okie-dokie.<eos> I think it's time for someone to cut out the hot sauce.<eos> Andy?<eos> Andy, are you awake?
- Ed fucked us is what happened.<eos> - No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> Listen, Chris, I know that something's wrong with you up in the head, but please don't say that Ed wouldn't do that when he just fucking did that!<eos> - No way.<eos> - Jesus Christ, you're stupid.
- Don't be stupid, then.<eos> - What should we do?<eos> - Check the radio.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You dipshit! The news!
All three suspects are considered armed and dangerous.<eos> Sheriff Ezekiel Sikes was shot and wounded as he attempted to foil the robbery.<eos> Ed shot Zeke?<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Hey, where are you going?
Oh, gee, Chris, maybe it was the cops who pulled us over for speeding half a mile from the fucking bank!<eos> - We were making a getaway.<eos> - Ugh! I'll take you.<eos> I'll just drive you.<eos> No, no! Listen, cockbrain, you've gotta get your shit together.
Okay.<eos> Chris, listen to me.<eos> Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns.<eos> Then, you are gonna do nothing.
Chris, listen to me.<eos> Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns.<eos> Then, you are gonna do nothing.<eos> You are gonna say there.
Listen good, okay?<eos> You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns.<eos> Then, you are gonna do nothing.<eos> You are gonna say there.<eos> You're gonna stay put. Do you understand me?
Until tonight.<eos> You are gonna meet me at ten o'clock at Rudy's scrapyard.<eos> Okay?<eos> By then, I should know more of what's going on. Rudy's scrapyard, ten.<eos> - You have a watch?
- You have a watch?<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> - Know how to tell time?<eos> - It's digital.<eos> Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.
- You're not all gone, are you, Chris?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I saw her coming back from the cemetery.<eos> Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house. Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey, Steph, how you feeling?
Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house. Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey, Steph, how you feeling?<eos> - How am I feeling?<eos> Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just shot a cop and split town.<eos> - How are you feeling?
Like, did I see him with a bunch of his scumbag friends sitting around the kitchen table, going over the blueprints of the local bank, talking about how they were gonna rob it?<eos> Yeah, uh, yeah, like that.<eos> Be back in a sec.<eos> You know, I'm just asking questions.<eos> You don't have to be mean.
Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.<eos> What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Chris?<eos> Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!<eos> Chris?<eos> Chris, Zeke Sikes!<eos> If you're in there.
Chris.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Chris, it's Steph.<eos> - Steph, really?<eos> - Where are you?
Adiós.<eos> - Chris!<eos> - Steph?<eos> - Over here.<eos> - Is that you?
Hey, I made it!<eos> Is that.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Chris, have you changed your clothes?
Is that what I think it is?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Chris, have you changed your clothes?<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Since you robbed the bank?
We're going to Mexico.<eos> Oh, well, that's smart.<eos> Ed's a smart guy.<eos> Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?<eos> You want to take a shower?
Ed's a smart guy.<eos> Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?<eos> You want to take a shower?<eos> Uh. Yeah. Okay.<eos> I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.
Rudy's scrapyard at ten.<eos> I got it. Okay. I'll see you there.<eos> Fucking asshole!<eos> Shh.<eos> - What the heck are you doing?
Shh.<eos> - What the heck are you doing?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Oh, nothing. Uh, go back to sleep, honey.<eos> - You're obviously doing something.
- You're obviously doing something.<eos> - It's a. It's a surprise.<eos> That'll be the day.<eos> - Are you all right, dear?<eos> You're shaking.
That'll be the day.<eos> - Are you all right, dear?<eos> You're shaking.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> You're shaking.
You're shaking.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> You're shaking.<eos> Hey, listen, what do you say the four of us go up to the cabin this weekend? We can spend the weekend up there.<eos> You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.
You're shaking.<eos> Hey, listen, what do you say the four of us go up to the cabin this weekend? We can spend the weekend up there.<eos> You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.<eos> I see.<eos> You want to get rid of us so you can host one of your big poker games.

We can spend the weekend up there.<eos> You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.<eos> I see.<eos> You want to get rid of us so you can host one of your big poker games.<eos> Uh, well, I guess you know me too well.
Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all.<eos> I wish. I could be a better husband to you.<eos> It's just a poker game, dear.<eos> You don't have to feel so guilty.
Sometimes, boys just need to be with other boys.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Big day today, huh?<eos> - I suppose it is, yeah.<eos> I thought you'd be more excited.
I thought you'd be more excited.<eos> I don't know.<eos> When I was in prison, I told myself that I'd be done with this life, get on the straight and narrow.<eos> Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?
Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
What are we supposed to do, huh? You tell me, Steph.<eos> - What are we supposed to do?<eos> - Nothing, I guess.<eos> I.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.
- What are we supposed to do?<eos> - Nothing, I guess.<eos> I.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.<eos> What the hell do you want from me, huh?
He had a stomachache and I'm the one who answered!<eos> - I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab!<eos> And you killed my son!
- I was at work!<eos> - So was I!<eos> At a drug lab!<eos> And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.
- So was I!<eos> At a drug lab!<eos> And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.<eos> You only kill people by accident.
I want to get there an hour early so I can get a good seat.<eos> That's great, sweetie.<eos> Wait, tonight? No, um.<eos> Sorry, I can't tonight. I got a football reunion.<eos> You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.
Sorry, I can't tonight. I got a football reunion.<eos> You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.<eos> Is your brother going, too?<eos> We asked him. He's gotta work at the bank.<eos> Oh, well, if he can miss it, then surely you can.
You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.<eos> Is your brother going, too?<eos> We asked him. He's gotta work at the bank.<eos> Oh, well, if he can miss it, then surely you can.<eos> You weren't even on the team when they won. Okay, hey, sweetie. Hey!
You weren't even on the team when they won. Okay, hey, sweetie. Hey!<eos> You know what? I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss your thing tonight, but I have an idea.<eos> What about tomorrow you and me, we go to Funland?<eos> She's got school tomorrow.<eos> You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?
Are you happy now?<eos> - As a fucking clam! - Oh.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> Escorting our state champion quarterback from his meeting with our state champion parole officer.<eos> - Do you mind hopping' in back?
Westmoreland. That was the game that Coach Denton called Reed's goal line play on fourth and one, except we weren't on the goal line.<eos> Yeah, it was an important play.<eos> And I dropped back, and I tossed a pretty little daisy<eos> - right in your waiting mitt.<eos> - It was perfect. You were just so damn excited to finally get your hands on the football, you forgot we were at midfield.
- Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Reggie Cutler.<eos> - Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.<eos> And then, 30 seconds later, you stare up at me and you're like,
- Fuck, that guy was big.<eos> - He just laid you out mid-jiggle.<eos> And then, 30 seconds later, you stare up at me and you're like,<eos> Uh, did we score?<eos> And then you said. You said, Someone scored. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Jesus fuck!<eos> Whenever you're ready with those digits, Judge.<eos> It's, uh. Six, three times to the left, 28, four times to the right, 86, three times to the left.<eos> Three times to the left.<eos> You can kickoff whenever you're ready, man.
Nah, nah.<eos> Bank duty is the sheriff's job.<eos> Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me guarding his precious crop money.<eos> Plus, I don't want to ruin your night.<eos> You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?
Bank duty is the sheriff's job.<eos> Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me guarding his precious crop money.<eos> Plus, I don't want to ruin your night.<eos> You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?<eos> Holy shit! You are.
You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?<eos> Holy shit! You are.<eos> - Is it getting serious?<eos> - No, it's just dinner.<eos> That's how it starts, and then the next thing you know, little Wendys running all around your house.
Chris, Chris.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Isn't that right, Andy? - Five minutes.<eos> Easy in, easy out. You don't even have to leave your car.
Easy in, easy out. You don't even have to leave your car.<eos> Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?<eos> Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.<eos> No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive.<eos> That's why. They probably think that you don't even know how to drive.
Shut up. Just shut up.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> Wow. That's a new one.<eos> Listen, I've. I've been thinking about what you said.
What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> Wow. That's a new one.<eos> Listen, I've. I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> About how you thought you'd left this life behind.
This whole thing was your idea. Chris, Andy, Dawkins. You said they'd all play ball and they fucking did.<eos> Ed, I'm serious.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Don't get skittish on me now, all right?<eos> We got this. Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours when you're a very rich woman.
Just smash it! Smash it!<eos> Smash it!<eos> - Smash it!<eos> - I am! Smash it!<eos> What are you doing?
Good!<eos> Now, go!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Step two: Unlock vault.<eos> Shut the fuck up! Or I'll shoot you in the face!
Let me guess.<eos> Step two: Unlock vault.<eos> Shut the fuck up! Or I'll shoot you in the face!<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> What the fuck do you think is happening?
Yeah, Chris.<eos> It's going real good.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Come on! What is this, The Price is Right?<eos> How many times you gonna spin that dial?
- In the face.<eos> - Do you mind if I finish my dinner?<eos> - Will you just shut the fuck up?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doing?
What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get back! - Just a second.<eos> - Get back! Stay back! Stay back!<eos> I'll shoot! What are you.?
- Get back! Stay back! Stay back!<eos> I'll shoot! What are you.?<eos> Go back! Go back!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?
I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault. Huh?<eos> So, here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> It's 86.<eos> How do you read that as a fucking eight, huh?
I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.
They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight. I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.
We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight. I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.<eos> Come on, Z, you think I'm actually capable of doing something like that?
I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.<eos> Come on, Z, you think I'm actually capable of doing something like that?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed Ed Jr. pretty good.
Jesus Christ.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed Ed Jr. pretty good.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.
You heard me.<eos> - That was a fucking accident, Zeke.<eos> - Hey, shit happens.<eos> Fuck you, Zeke!<eos> You sound like my goddamn wife.
Oh, shit!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.
What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.<eos> And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.
What the fuck is happening, man?<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're robbing a bank, Ed.<eos> And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.<eos> But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins. But probably Chris, then Dawkins.
You're robbing a bank, Ed.<eos> And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me, and then race out that door with the money.<eos> But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins. But probably Chris, then Dawkins.<eos> And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy. What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.
And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy. What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except. None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you doing this?

- Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> Not Brad Dawkins.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.
We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.<eos> Not Brad Dawkins.<eos> He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.<eos> You stole him from us.

You stole him from us.<eos> You stole my baby.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Come on. He was my baby too, okay?<eos> Don't you get it?
Don't you get it?<eos> He wasn't your baby.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Stop saying that. Ed.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?
Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.<eos> And I hoped seeing that beautiful boy could have straightened us out, could have. Could have saved us.<eos> Then you killed him.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - The fuck you are!<eos> - I'm going in there! No!<eos> No, Chris, you're the driver.
- What the fuck? - No, Chris!<eos> No!<eos> - This is really happening, isn't it?<eos> - Zeke, this is really happening.<eos> Are you ready?
Shit!<eos> We were invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding.<eos> We got invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you saying it like that?
We're going.<eos> This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.
This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.<eos> Bina, you're the dummy who voted me into office.
I'm flat-out naked in here, so...<eos> Renzo Eckberg, your manhood is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Your manhood is a glory to God.<eos> Open the door a crack, I'll fling it in.<eos> This could be how you meet the love of your life.

Should I start hanging out at wakes too?<eos> Oh, let's see how the wedding goes first.<eos> You got a letter from someone.<eos> I'm pretty surprised about it.<eos> I didn't know you knew anyone in the free world.
Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie take you, Douglas, as you are to love and to cherish to have and to hold until death do us part.
Oh, my God.<eos> Shit.<eos> You look good, ladies. Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> You're here. That's c...
Shit.<eos> You look good, ladies. Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> You're here. That's c...<eos> Why are you here?
You look good, ladies. Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> You're here. That's c...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Same as you.
Jo Flanagan.<eos> That's Jo with a "J" and an "O" and no "E."<eos> I'm Renzo.<eos> With an "E" and an "O" and no "J."<eos> You have an intense look about you, Renzo.
No, you're not.<eos> Right? No.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Did you not request a singles' table? Because so far, it's slim pickings.
Right? No.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Did you not request a singles' table? Because so far, it's slim pickings.<eos> It was on the RSVP. You put it there yourself.
Dance with the nanny.<eos> Hollywood marriages bust up all the time because of the nanny.<eos> And you know what, Renzo? Even if she is a little older, so what?<eos> There's something to be said for know-how, experience and someone who's seen a lot of things.<eos> You don't want somebody perfect for your first dance. It's just too intimidating.
No.<eos> Not okay.<eos> I could just see you staring at somebody for a minute.<eos> Like a real, true minute which is a long time to stare.<eos> Tells me you got something brewing up here.
Just say something smug and walk away.<eos> No, it wasn't like that.<eos> I just saw you there, and I...<eos> Yeah, well, it was like that.<eos> Also, in order for you to know that I'd been staring at someone for a real, true minute, you had to be staring at me for a real, true minute.
And I... You know, felt nothing.<eos> I felt nothing at all.<eos> Right. So, I misread that entirely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you did.
Do you ever have that?<eos> Kind of day where you think that the things that come so easy to everyone else just seem so elusive?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.
Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What do you say your name is?
Megan-Ann.<eos> Megan-Ann. Okay. I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.
Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear. It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right? You're the nanny.<eos> Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?
- Bina and Jerry Kepp.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?
- Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.
And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?
You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?<eos> So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!
Okay, what's going on, man?<eos> Meanwhile, enjoy the open bar.<eos> Come on, what does that mean?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you leave me a voicemail telling me to tell Francie not to open your RSVP card.

You listened to all those voicemails?<eos> Hey, guys, right here.<eos> Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"? Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.
Hey, guys, right here.<eos> Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"? Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.<eos> You do something big and you can't take it back and it's too late, and then...
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.
Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.
Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.
What?<eos> Why should it even bother me?<eos> Come on! I didn't cheat on you with her.<eos> It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who... After two years, you break up with me over text?
Come on! I didn't cheat on you with her.<eos> It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who... After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?
How does a guy who... After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.
"Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> Oh, my God, you're such an asshole.
You're an asshole.<eos> Oh, my God, you're such an asshole.<eos> You're a ridiculous asshole.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> Before you ruin all this for Francie.
I don't have a ferry ticket till tomorrow, anyway.<eos> Swim.<eos> Think she'll be back?<eos> I vote yes.<eos> Let's chat, you and me.
Just don't make a scene.<eos> Why does everyone keep saying I do that?<eos> Hey, Jerry Kepp.<eos> Uh-huh. Just a hypothetical.<eos> If someone offered you 20 bucks to go up to our room and read your book in the tub, would you? Say yes.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up.<eos> Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.
I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.<eos> I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.
I was Francie's first choice for maid of honor.<eos> I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks. Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?<eos> Tells me you don't know when to stop calling.
That's funny. Last week, I did a search history on our computer.<eos> And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?
And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Why did you come here?
Jerry said he wasn't coming, and then all of a sudden he changed his mind and he won't say why.<eos> Since when does a man need a reason to go to a wedding with his own wife?<eos> See? He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?
See? He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.<eos> Why are you looking at my Facebook?
Tom Fo?<eos> Well, Henry Grotsky owns five diners in Central Ohio.<eos> We own a diner in Central Ohio.<eos> Everyone who owns a diner in Central Ohio is Facebook friends.<eos> You'd know that if you paid attention.
Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Renzo, pick up...<eos> Not now, big fight.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look lost.
Not now, big fight.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look lost.<eos> I do?<eos> If you need help, just ask us.
If you need help, just ask us.<eos> Sorry, "If I need help"?<eos> Do you? Do you need my help?<eos> Why would I need your help?<eos> Well, you have no one.
But today, I'm only going to ask for her hand in this dance.<eos> And the rest of her, along with her body.<eos> Good.<eos> No, I don't think that's...<eos> You don't want to dance, right?
O-M-G!<eos> Oh!<eos> That's mortifying that I would forget.<eos> Nanny Jo.<eos> Well, you've had a lot on your plate.
Good to see you again, Donny.<eos> People do weird things at weddings.<eos> What was I ever thinking?<eos> It's so weird, one day you can be 100%, the next...<eos> Are you hungry?
Take it.<eos> I'll find Mr. Manny myself.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> I should go somewhere.<eos> Yeah, I mean... You should be traveling the world. Hmm.
I should go somewhere.<eos> Yeah, I mean... You should be traveling the world. Hmm.<eos> I've never actually been outside the country.<eos> It almost happened after high school but I had to get a job answering phones at a car dealership and my supposed friends couldn't wait.<eos> So now I find myself thinking that this guy... You, guy seem like the kind of person who, in fact, did not have to get a job at Lukazey's Toyota and has been to Europe or some such and knows where one goes to...
Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.
It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?
No one's really named Huck anymo...<eos> Okay.<eos> Huck, we are in a grand ballroom full of tables.<eos> I'm at the very worst one.<eos> Would you care to join me?
I shouldn't.<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?
Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.<eos> You're crashing the wedding?
Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.<eos> You're crashing the wedding?<eos> You gotta stay for the food.
Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.
But what's done is done.<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> He ended it with a text message when you told him you were pregnant.
Can we just forget about it?<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone. If you even go...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If you even go through with the pregnancy.
Jerry, stop.<eos> She said she's done with it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> No. For once, I'm not gonna do the thing I immediately regret.<eos> Renzo, if I gave you a couple hundred bucks, could you get a hooker to wait in Teddy's room?
They don't provide them.<eos> You guys probably already know this, but that's not a question you're supposed to ask a fancy place like this unless you're a successful businessman.<eos> Which I am.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You looked like you got sick.
Hello.<eos> Jerry Kepp.<eos> Diner associate on the Grotsky side.<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?
Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?
I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.
I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.<eos> Wait, what did you say?
She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.
No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.
Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.
You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.<eos> So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a... That I was just a joke?
Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.<eos> So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a... That I was just a joke?<eos> It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!
It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now. Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.
And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.<eos> That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.
What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.
I was in prison because I stole $125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.

Just following.<eos> Honestly, it still sounds better than junior prom, honey.<eos> Junior prom is a horror show.<eos> Well, if the thinking was for me to see people at their most happy, I would have to say that seems to be a huge miscalculation.<eos> Did you just break another chair?
I just wanted to say sorry.<eos> I take things too far.<eos> Usually, I'm the only one who gets hurt, but it didn't work out like that today, so I'm sorry.<eos> Join us.<eos> Or do you have somewhere else to be?
Are you a potter?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You're a pothead.<eos> You got a table with a lot of your friends
Bina took over her family's diner.<eos> And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.
And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.<eos> You renamed the family diner after yourself.
That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?
So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> Oh, it wasn't for myself.<eos> My friend Eric, who's an absolute sweetheart, a lovely bloke, his wife was very sick and needed an operation.<eos> Well, then you saved a life.
On account of the fact she didn't exist.<eos> I don't think he'd ever been married.<eos> What?<eos> He made it up just for the money.<eos> You just called him a sweetheart!
My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.<eos> And if you want to dance now, we can just turn on the radio and just dance.
I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.<eos> And if you want to dance now, we can just turn on the radio and just dance.<eos> I don't think so, but thank you.<eos> You smiled

You smiled<eos> You smiled<eos> And then the spell was cast<eos> Now here we are in heaven<eos> 'Cause you are mine
The world feels almost perfect right now.<eos> Crap!<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!
Crap!<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?
You love weddings?<eos> Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly,<eos> Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.
Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly,<eos> Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.
You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly,<eos> Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.
You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?
When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?<eos> You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.
So, who did you call, Bina?<eos> You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.<eos> You're arranging to meet with Henry Grotsky after the wedding's over?<eos> Maybe back in the ballroom after the happy couple is gone and I'm upstairs in the room?<eos> You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.

No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?<eos> Bina!<eos> Walter, would you come with me, please?
Goodbye.<eos> I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.
Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
Sorry.<eos> God, that's so weird.<eos> Walter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are you going?
Where are you going?<eos> I gotta go and help with the hors d'oeuvres in the Woodside ballroom.<eos> Why?<eos> Understaffed.<eos> So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.
Why?<eos> Understaffed.<eos> So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.<eos> I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?
So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.<eos> I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?<eos> Bad timing? It is bad timing, I realize that now.<eos> If I tell you this, will you stop walking with me?
I was a junior counselor.<eos> She was a senior counselor.<eos> Honestly, Renzo, it's no big secret.<eos> Camp does most of the seducing.<eos> Less often than you think.
Well, for me, I was okay at dancing.<eos> Probably better than okay.<eos> So we danced.<eos> And that's it. That's all it takes.<eos> Find out the one thing you're good at, make sure the girls know about it.
My understanding of women seems poor right now.<eos> I'd say go with your gut.<eos> Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?
Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?
Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?<eos> What if you went away with someone better?
Well, that's not what I thought I'd leave with here today, but it's something, so thank you. Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.<eos> It'd be great if it did.<eos> Cousin Walter?<eos> I'm glad you could come.
No.<eos> I felt like we weren't even in the same place, you know?<eos> No. It's the same wedding no matter what table you're at, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.
Gonna head out. Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> You look so beautiful. Thank you.
And congratulations or best wishes or whatever you're supposed to say.<eos> And this was great.<eos> Bye, guys.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.
Bye, guys.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that. Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...

If you'll let me.<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.
What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?
Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
It's crazy! It is!<eos> It so is!<eos> It's crazy!<eos> After everything.<eos> Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!
Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!<eos> Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up. What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.<eos> You screw up all the time.
It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.<eos> What are you saying?
Showing up is 90% of love.<eos> Yeah, and not being an asshole is the other 10%.<eos> He didn't show up.<eos> I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> And the people we were supposed to become together, they never showed up.<eos> Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?
No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> And the people we were supposed to become together, they never showed up.<eos> Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?<eos> Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?
Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?<eos> Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?<eos> We shout at each other in front of strangers all the time.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Would you do that for me?
The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> The Jerry you married what?
That's life!<eos> You're ridiculous and a mess!<eos> And you still hope that you'll find someone who'll think that you're okay enough to be loved.<eos> Is that what life is? Yeah, it is.<eos> And it's really weird that you don't know that by now!
Well, I don't know which way we're going.<eos> Wasn't there a shortcut here?<eos> We missed it.<eos> I showed up.<eos> Oh, I heard what you said to the dumb girl at table seven.
Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?
Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, my Lord!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there? It was...
Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there? It was...<eos> What did you do? It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.

Okay.<eos> Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.
Hey. Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Please don't slam the door, even for that.<eos> Ringo?<eos> You're gonna make him fat.
You're gonna make him fat.<eos> Oh, yeah, I am.<eos> Well, we are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.<eos> Here he is.<eos> The world's best dad when you don't forget our baby in the empty apartment.
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?<eos> Are you listening?
- Don't.<eos> Be silent. And hear me.<eos> This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.<eos> Let the words you speak be the words that call me back to you.
I promise I'm not like the others.<eos> I'm much worse.<eos> Please look at me, Jakob.<eos> I'd like to help you.<eos> Do you understand?
Jakob doesn't need to answer me.<eos> I think he understands that.<eos> Enough.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Now you may go.
I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?<eos> Tomorrow, perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see... That if you wanted to speak, you could.
Tomorrow, perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see... That if you wanted to speak, you could.<eos> Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing...<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.
To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see... That if you wanted to speak, you could.<eos> Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing...<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.
Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing...<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.<eos> I know a little something of what it feels to be apart from the world.<eos> I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you...
She took me with her everywhere.<eos> Nobody knew her as I did...<eos> Knew her moods, her needs.<eos> How I loved her.<eos> Jakob, was it you?
Nobody knew her as I did...<eos> Knew her moods, her needs.<eos> How I loved her.<eos> Jakob, was it you?<eos> If it was, then all you've done is tell me you're afraid.
I await your decision.<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob!<eos> Help me down.<eos> You scared me, Jakob.
But you've helped me realize something.<eos> I can't leave you.<eos> I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours, listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.
I want to hear you speak.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> I care about you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You wish to leave?
Angelica...<eos> La signora malvina.<eos> Jakob?<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> I think you're afraid that if you speak, the voice will cease.
It's strange...<eos> The sounds.<eos> One could imagine almost anything.<eos> But she's not there.<eos> I want you to stop this.
I know it, Jakob.<eos> I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
Of course.<eos> I-I'm a fool to speak lightly of it. Forgive me.<eos> - Jakob will be waiting.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Now, if you were to play, it would mean only what you wanted it to mean.
Perhaps your silence wouldn't horrify her as it does me.<eos> It is said that a true performer cares only for the love of her audience.<eos> Perhaps... Your silence is a fitting tribute.<eos> More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob...
But she is suffering. She is tired.<eos> And she is trapped.<eos> Jakob, we must help her.<eos> We must help her.<eos> You know what you must do.
Stop, Jakob!<eos> Jakob, no. No, no, no.<eos> It's time.<eos> It's time.<eos> You have to let her go.
You have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> Jakob. No, it has to be now.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> He will send me away if you don't speak.
Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> UTHER:<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.
UTHER:<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.<eos> UTHER:<eos> Then you'll have to fight me for him.
I'm scared, Uther.<eos> UTHER:<eos> I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?
I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?<eos> You must tell me where we're going.<eos> Why do you not answer me?
When the blood of a loved one is spilt in these waters, my desire must be met.<eos> SYREN 1:<eos> There is no ambiguity, my Lord.<eos> We kept our side of the covenant.<eos> It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.
There is no ambiguity, my Lord.<eos> We kept our side of the covenant.<eos> It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?<eos> With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.
SYREN 1:<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.
Yes, gentlemen?<eos> A turner come down this way.<eos> We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.
A turner come down this way.<eos> We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?
I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> What did I tell you about this establishment?<eos> He touched me, sir.<eos> Well, you should count yourself lucky.
What did he want in here?<eos> JACK:<eos> Resistance are on the move again.<eos> Hit a branding barge upriver.<eos> Anyone in the house you don't know?
He's bleeding.<eos> Took an arrow on the way out.<eos> What would happen to a man who hits the king's barge upriver?<eos> JACK:<eos> Well, you know what would happen.
Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> (PEOPLE SCREAMING)<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.
You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.<eos> In the back room, now.<eos> What's this all about, Jack?<eos> What's it got to do with us?<eos> Do you have any idea who that man is?
Do you have any idea who that man is?<eos> For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.
Your name keeps coming up.<eos> In what circles?<eos> My mum's sewing circle.<eos> I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.<eos> What circles do you think?
My mum's sewing circle.<eos> I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.<eos> What circles do you think?<eos> Now, tell me a story about a girl called Lucy, a Viking called Greybeard, and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.<eos> Are you writing a book?
- Art.<eos> - We heard he'd had some trouble with the...<eos> - Vikings.<eos> Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them.
Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them.<eos> - I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.
They speak it better than you.<eos> JACK:<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> Back up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?
Morning, Art.<eos> (CLAPS) We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike? Which Mike?<eos> You're giving me a headache.
I'm sorry, Art. It won't happen again.<eos> I promise.<eos> You're all right, Mike.<eos> Why have enemies when you can have friends?<eos> - Where'd you put the money?
- What money?<eos> - Money?<eos> - What money?<eos> Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?<eos> You're all over the place.
- What money?<eos> Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?<eos> You're all over the place.<eos> You can't keep your questions in a straight line.<eos> I'm trying to tell a story here and you keep interrupting.
You're all over the place.<eos> You can't keep your questions in a straight line.<eos> I'm trying to tell a story here and you keep interrupting.<eos> Anyway, I don't have any coffers.<eos> Once you've taken your share, and I've looked after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.
Anyway, I don't have any coffers.<eos> Once you've taken your share, and I've looked after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.<eos> Mike and the furs.<eos> So we're back to that story, are we now, Jack?<eos> - What are you doing, Mike?
Don't pass it to me, Mike.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Give it to Wet Stick.<eos> I'm Back Lack.<eos> What are you giving it to me for?
He's coming back.<eos> Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.
- My Lucy? - WET STICK:<eos> That can't happen, Jack.<eos> That can never happen, Jack.<eos> You see, she's a friend of mine.<eos> So you're gonna have to sort her out.
They had to pay.<eos> How'd you get money from a Viking?<eos> I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> - You're paying and then you're leaving.
- (SPEAKING NORWEGIAN)<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.<eos> You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that... Or I'll have to put an arrow through your lard-loving thigh.<eos> (LAUGHS AND SCREAMS)<eos> You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?
The same furs, as it happens, that Flat-Nose Mike tried to hide from us.<eos> More is always better than less, Mike.<eos> Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.<eos> I got 50 seasoned men of war.<eos> You could shave a pig on the edge of our blades.
More is always better than less, Mike.<eos> Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.<eos> I got 50 seasoned men of war.<eos> You could shave a pig on the edge of our blades.<eos> If you were unarmed, where'd you find the blade to put to his throat?
But I'm leaving with a year's wages.<eos> Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity. Lucy got a year's worth of wages. And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.<eos> Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.
- (BELL TOLLING) - (MEN CHATTERING)<eos> (BREATHING HEAVILY)<eos> BACK LACK:<eos> Wake up!<eos> WOMAN: (WHISPERING) You must control it.
WOMAN: (WHISPERING) You must control it.<eos> (INAUDIBLE)<eos> Wake up!<eos> Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!
Jack's Eye was telling the truth.<eos> Those red beards are connected.<eos> So, what?<eos> So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.
So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The Blacklegs are coming.<eos> And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.<eos> You gotta go now.
Oi, you two, in the back!<eos> Kick the door down!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - (WOMEN SCREAMING)<eos> - Are you ready?
Yeah, of course.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, fellas?<eos> Hello, boy.<eos> What are you doing out at this time?
I work on the boats, sir.<eos> Out on the first tide.<eos> The boats, eh?<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> And you're about the right age.
The boats, eh?<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> And you're about the right age.<eos> Show us your brand.<eos> Have you not been tested?
Have you not been tested?<eos> I'm always at sea, sir.<eos> Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.
I'm always at sea, sir.<eos> Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.<eos> Just not the one you think.
Guess that's what you get when you don't pay up.<eos> Taking the kids now.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> What's he got them all penned up out here for?<eos> Well, when you see the king, why don't you ask him?
All right, where do you want me?<eos> Trigger, I think we got one here.<eos> TRIGGER:<eos> Bouncing on my knee.<eos> Where do you think I want you?
(RUMBLING)<eos> (WHINNYING)<eos> (YELLING)<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> That's everything you know about him?
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.
I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.<eos> Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.
Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.<eos> You've got the wrong man, sire.<eos> I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.
The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.<eos> I'm nothing but the bastard son of a prostitute.<eos> You and I have a lot more in common than you think.
I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.<eos> While you were asleep, we've been busy.
Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.<eos> While you were asleep, we've been busy.<eos> I know what kind of a man you are.
I know your story.<eos> And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand<eos> as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?

They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.
Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?
You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...
And for this, I salute you.<eos> - No!<eos> - (WOMEN SCREAMING)<eos> - MERCIA:<eos> If you're the king...
If you're the king...<eos> - No!<eos> ...declare yourself.<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.
Raise that sword!<eos> I thought not.<eos> This man cannot be allowed to bring discord to our flourishing nation.<eos> MAN 1:<eos> You're not the king!
You're not the king!<eos> MAN 2:<eos> Off with his head!<eos> MAN 1:<eos> You're no king!
ARTHUR:<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?
Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?<eos> We wanna be careful.<eos> - (YELLS) - (WHINNIES)<eos> That's a neat trick.<eos> You'll have to teach me how to do that.
Put him back on his horse.<eos> (EAGLE CALLS)<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?<eos> You're good with animals, aren't you?
You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.
Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.<eos> Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> You know he was the third most wanted man on the Blackleg's list?
They've been trying to catch him for some time.<eos> Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.<eos> I told you, you were in safe hands.
I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?

I don't think so, mate.<eos> So I'm not going anywhere, am I?<eos> Where exactly were you thinking of going?<eos> You have no more home. It was razed days ago.<eos> You've no more life to go back to.
You've no more life to go back to.<eos> Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.<eos> Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.
Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits.<eos> You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.

Welcome to the Darklands.<eos> That's the Darklands?<eos> That's the entrance.<eos> He needs to take the sword to the tower.<eos> You must touch the sword to the altar stone.
And he has to go alone.<eos> (EAGLE SCREECHES)<eos> He can't survive the Darklands alone.<eos> (HISSING)<eos> - Are you scared?

The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.<eos> Now, the sword is yours.<eos> MERCIA:<eos> It seems his people have been found by the Resistance.<eos> You have 10,000 men under your command for the purpose of maintaining public order.
ARTHUR:<eos> It's all yours, son.<eos> I warn you, it's got quite a bite.<eos> What they done back home?<eos> You really wanna know?
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off. You'll say something along the lines of, "What were you gonna do
There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.

You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.<eos> You seem to have found your way very quickly.

Are the boys yours to give?<eos> Do you really consider your faith better served by a rumor?<eos> Or by the word of the conqueror of this island with an army of 100,000 souls behind his sword?<eos> I meant no disrespect, Great King.<eos> You asked to see me, Father?
I still can't control it.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> You pick it up.<eos> Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?<eos> Where?<eos> In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?

It's a 50-yard shot. I can do that easily.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Tell him.<eos> Tell you what the problem is, mate.<eos> When you say the building's right, I know the man that owns that building. And he's not interested in letting anyone in.
What's the problem?<eos> Tell him.<eos> Tell you what the problem is, mate.<eos> When you say the building's right, I know the man that owns that building. And he's not interested in letting anyone in.<eos> How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?
- I'd hang?<eos> - Probably.<eos> The three exits are actually only one.<eos> 'Cause once the alarm arrow's fired, the gates will be shut within two minutes, and they're six minutes away by foot.<eos> Unless you can run like a Neapolitan stallion, I'd forget them.
So, you have one exit remaining. And that has a tavern 20 yards from it. There's always more Blacklegs in the Two Hot Cocks than there are rats on the street.<eos> Why don't you use the other building? The one back here?<eos> Because it's 175 yards away.<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> And how far can you shoot, Back Lack?
Well, whatever it is, that's not what we're here for.<eos> - Is it, Goosefat?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> They've arrived.<eos> Maggie, I now realize what an important member of my household you are.

Sit down.<eos> Till recently, I didn't recognize what a powerful tool you can be in the right hands.<eos> I thought you were simply a pawn.<eos> Turns out you're a far more significant piece.<eos> And it would be witless of me not to use that to my advantage, given how effectively you've been used against me.
Stop looking around and look at me.<eos> I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us.<eos> They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.

Hello, boys.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> BLACKLEG 2:<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Where are you going? Stop.
This way!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> (GROANS)<eos> Can you make it?
- Fight!<eos> - Second rank!<eos> You two, down here.<eos> It's a straight run to the river.<eos> You go first.
We don't have time to argue, Bill.<eos> Some of us will make it out in time.<eos> Some of us won't.<eos> Well, better some than none!<eos> You go first.
Don't like rats, boss.<eos> Dell.<eos> Scared of the dark.<eos> Really?<eos> George, will you tell them?

What about Back Lack and Blue, Art?<eos> We'll wait until dark.<eos> (PEOPLE SCREAMING)<eos> BLUE:<eos> Where you been, Dad?
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Just got to get to the safe house.<eos> Can you make it?
MAN:<eos> Down with Vortigern!<eos> - (HORSE WHINNIES) - (BARKING)<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.
(CROWD CLAMORING)<eos> Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> People have seen what you can do.
Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> People have seen what you can do.<eos> You're no longer a myth.
Certainly sounds like it.<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> People have seen what you can do.<eos> You're no longer a myth.<eos> You're starting to mean something.
THE MAGE:<eos> They are fighting in your name.<eos> I don't wanna wear that.<eos> (DOOR OPENS)<eos> Is that you, Blue?
(DOOR OPENS)<eos> Is that you, Blue?<eos> BLUE:<eos> Yes, boss!<eos> Did you find your father?
Come on.<eos> I'll need a little breather.<eos> Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.<eos> No, you won't.
Give 'em a hand.<eos> I'll be all right, mate.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> Come on, Blue.<eos> You carry this.
No, follow him.<eos> The blood he followed was from a man who killed one of my sergeants today.<eos> A man who fled the scene of an assassination attempt on me.<eos> On me, no less.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where that man is, would you?
The king of all England himself has made the effort to visit a commoner.<eos> A man from nowhere, and today, my last day.<eos> You look well, and I feel poor.<eos> But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?
Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Good boy.<eos> So you don't know him?
(MISCHIEF JOHN CHUCKLES)<eos> No!<eos> (SIGHS) Always wanted a boy.<eos> - Argh!<eos> - You bastard!
(INAUDIBLE)<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept<eos> this sword.<eos> (SCREAMS ECHOING)<eos> Only you can prevent this.
He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.<eos> (YELLING)<eos> Apparently you have something to tell me.
Where's the Mage?<eos> She's back at the cave.<eos> All right.<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?
I'm not gonna hear the end of this from my wife.<eos> It was my turn to cook tonight.<eos> I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."
Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.<eos> Anything that you do to me will be repaid 10 times in kind.<eos> Now, you're a big man. Now, let's see you move.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.<eos> But you'll need its protection.
(HISSING)<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> You will feel it for a few hours.
(ROARS)<eos> (TOLLS)<eos> (ALL CLAMORING)<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You know the price.
Father, what's happening?<eos> Leave.<eos> Why is there blood on your face?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.
(YELLS)<eos> (YELLING)<eos> (ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING)<eos> (ALL CLAMORING)<eos> VORTIGERN: (IN DEMONIC VOICE) You have won, nephew.
(YELLING)<eos> (ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING)<eos> (ALL CLAMORING)<eos> VORTIGERN: (IN DEMONIC VOICE) You have won, nephew.<eos> You have won.
Run, son!<eos> - Brother...<eos> - (PANTING)<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.
- Brother...<eos> - (PANTING)<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.
- (PANTING)<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.<eos> You don't need to look away.
The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> (GASPS)<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?
Take it.<eos> (GASPS)<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.
You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> (GROWLS)<eos> You cut me on the streets.
(GROANS)<eos> I am here now because of you.<eos> (GROANING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> You created me.
I am here now because of you.<eos> (GROANING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.
(GROANING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.<eos> You make sense of the devil.
We expect to leave here with 10,000 young men as agreed.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so, mate.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, "I don't think so, mate."<eos> We've been wondering what you were doing in here.
GEORGE:<eos> I know.<eos> It's a dance floor.<eos> PERCIVAL:<eos> And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?
I know.<eos> It's a dance floor.<eos> PERCIVAL:<eos> And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?<eos> But how did you get it through the door?
It's a dance floor.<eos> PERCIVAL:<eos> And once you finish it, how are you supposed to get to the middle?<eos> But how did you get it through the door?<eos> Did you carry it in? Or did you roll it in?
Sir Bedivere, if you would?<eos> I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.
I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.
No.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.<eos> You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.
You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> Arise, Sir George.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> So you have a choice.
BEDIVERE:<eos> Arise, Sir George.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> So you have a choice.<eos> You can now kneel to England...
So you have a choice.<eos> You can now kneel to England...<eos> BEDIVERE:<eos> Arise, Sir Tristan.<eos> ...or I'll step off this throne, and you can deal with me as the man you previously met.
It's a consequence of what happened here centuries ago.<eos> About that, there's no data available, no records.<eos> Just a quarantine ordering all vessels to stay clear of this sector.<eos> And this planet isn't on any known chart.<eos> It's a good thing you got the coordinates I sent you.
Stories I was told it was merciless and sinister but ruthless will work.<eos> When they rediscovered this planet, they quarantined it.<eos> But some have ignored the quarantine.<eos> They come here to conduct their... business beyond prying eyes.<eos> - People like you.
- I am Sinjin!<eos> But you, along with all living creatures need only call me Master!<eos> Warriors?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> - You got a problem?
Warriors?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> - You got a problem?<eos> - I don't trust you.<eos> - You don't know me.
Records indicate his entire team was lost during the Saurian invasion on Mars.<eos> Saber Raine was the sole survivor.<eos> Subject was sent into deep cover to gain intelligence on the Saurians.<eos> Weeks into his mission subject disappeared, believed dead.<eos> But you didn't perish, did you?
- You don't want to know!<eos> After you.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> Bad move.<eos> On this planet, you always have backup.
What have we here?<eos> Aresians.<eos> Traveling in some elite circles, I see.<eos> Yeah, we're old pals.<eos> That's good, cause you haven't got many 'round here.
Say one power cylinder.<eos> I've heard many tales in my line of work and the stories of the Aresian power cylinder have always intrigued me.<eos> Just stories.<eos> Then I'm afraid I can't help you.<eos> You better know something.
I was flying near the outland mires, my ship lost power, crash landed.<eos> Had four on board, only two survived.<eos> Where are the other survivors?<eos> I don't know, we were separated.<eos> And you?
You look strangely calm!<eos> Universe has a plan for everyone, kid.<eos> I'm just waiting to see what it has planned for me.<eos> The power cylinder, it's a mana stone, isn't it?<eos> And you're not concerned with giving one to Jax?
Besides, it's a very unstable substance.<eos> Are you saying my friend could blow himself up?<eos> - Now let me ask you something.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Tell me why you betrayed your people.
- Now let me ask you something.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Tell me why you betrayed your people.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You seem like a man of honor.
- Alright.<eos> Tell me why you betrayed your people.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You seem like a man of honor.<eos> So there must be a reason why you assisted the Saurians.
I couldn't have that on my conscience.<eos> Crotalus gave me information that let our forces penetrate their defenses on Erobus Two.<eos> She's the reason we won the war.<eos> My government didn't want the rest of the galaxy to know that we couldn't do it on our own so they wanted her silenced.<eos> And you turned on your own to protect her.
We must've entered the mire.<eos> Your power sources won't work here.<eos> Guess my gas propelled projectiles don't look so bad now, do they?<eos> Just saying.<eos> You knew this would happen?
- We're the cavalry.<eos> My legs, they're going numb.<eos> I think it was some sort of toxin.<eos> We did not need to engage these creatures at close range.<eos> You could've dispatched them from a distance!
I'm sorry, they're doing this to you to get to me.<eos> No matter what they do, you cannot give them what they seek.<eos> We will find a way out of here, and get back home.<eos> And we will return to this planet with a vengeance.<eos> Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!

Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!<eos> You must lead our people.<eos> I can't let them put their hands on you again.<eos> I don't matter!<eos> - You've always been so strong.
- You've always been so strong.<eos> - We must fight to protect what is ours.<eos> I know Father never said it, but he is proud of you.<eos> Your passion for xeno archeology your drive to understanding a greater universe. A mind like yours cannot be lost.<eos> You do matter.
Your passion for xeno archeology your drive to understanding a greater universe. A mind like yours cannot be lost.<eos> You do matter.<eos> I will give them what they want.<eos> In return for your safe passage back to Ares.<eos> - You will lead in my stead.
This is madness, there must be another way.<eos> Even if they have it, they would have to acquire raw material build a refinement facility.<eos> It would take a great deal of time.<eos> More than enough time for you to bring back our forces, and eliminate the threat.<eos> Either way, you would surely die.

Knowing that you'll live.<eos> Caliope, please, as you said we must protect what is ours.<eos> You know. That's a pretty good plan.<eos> Just might work.<eos> How do you know he would honor your request?
Caliope, please, as you said we must protect what is ours.<eos> You know. That's a pretty good plan.<eos> Just might work.<eos> How do you know he would honor your request?<eos> We will have a code word a word that you will give to those that return you to safety.
Now, look kid!<eos> What I say now is for my sister's ears only.<eos> Recovery drones offline.<eos> Easy.<eos> You've been poisoned.
His body?<eos> We must build a pyre.<eos> I'm not certain that that's a wise choice.<eos> I fail to see how igniting a blaze will assist us in remaining undetected in dangerous territory.<eos> I hope you brought some more ammo.
Be wary, he's not to be trusted.<eos> Yes, investigate.<eos> Your sister's freedom for the information I seek.<eos> I will consider your offer.<eos> But before I decide, do you have any idea who I am?
I will consider your offer.<eos> But before I decide, do you have any idea who I am?<eos> One of the many would be conquerors of the universe who seeks to steal the secrets of the mana stone.<eos> The way your race has used technology to unleash its power is impressive.<eos> What do you know of the mana stone?
What do I know?<eos> I know it did not originate on your planet.<eos> I know it was stolen in battle centuries ago!<eos> And horded it to build your own empire.<eos> And how do you know this?
- Yes, you do.<eos> When your ancestors allied themselves with my ancient enemy the ensuing battle decimated this planet.<eos> Only through my power I was able to protect a small piece of Goros.<eos> At the moment of my greatest glory... - ... I was betrayed from within.<eos> - You're mad.
No.<eos> This is how it is supposed to be.<eos> But our world.<eos> Our family!<eos> Don't you understand?
Our family!<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Sinjin is our family.<eos> Our oldest ancestor.<eos> You can't believe what this creature is telling you!
A supply of refined mana stone provided.<eos> Sinjin controls the power of the mana stone with telepathy.<eos> We manipulate it with technology.<eos> Together, we will establish a new power in the universe.<eos> Now you have a choice to make.
Together, we will establish a new power in the universe.<eos> Now you have a choice to make.<eos> - There is no choice.<eos> - There's always a choice, brother.<eos> I was hoping you'd understand.

Understand?<eos> You had us brought here. Allied yourself with an abomination from our past!<eos> You tricked me into revealing the resonance frequency...<eos> - ...and you have a delusion of conquest?<eos> - It's not a delusion if you can do it!
You had us brought here. Allied yourself with an abomination from our past!<eos> You tricked me into revealing the resonance frequency...<eos> - ...and you have a delusion of conquest?<eos> - It's not a delusion if you can do it!<eos> - This isn't like you!
In studying the universe, there is one constant.<eos> War.<eos> At any given moment, there are dozens of planets engaged in battle.<eos> Empires rise and fall.<eos> And you believe such chaos can be controlled?
Yes.<eos> The universe needs to be cleansed.<eos> - Re-shaped.<eos> - Now I understand.<eos> You were the oldest, yet Father chose to pass his mantel on to me.
- Re-shaped.<eos> - Now I understand.<eos> You were the oldest, yet Father chose to pass his mantel on to me.<eos> He must've recognized what I did not.<eos> You are unworthy!
Ares will not see this coming!<eos> Soon I will return home devastated by the loss of my brother.<eos> Soon after Father will die, and I will assume the throne.<eos> Ares and Goros will reunite and history will once again be rewritten.<eos> You are demented, sister!
Ares and Goros will reunite and history will once again be rewritten.<eos> You are demented, sister!<eos> No, no, my friend.<eos> She is a woman about to become a goddess.<eos> And you will live to see my ascension.
She is a woman about to become a goddess.<eos> And you will live to see my ascension.<eos> I'm Fade.<eos> I didn't get a chance to thank you.<eos> You saved us all.
And I lost a brother.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> All Aresian families serve together.<eos> It assures the highest level of loyalty.<eos> You were tracking us?
You were tracking us?<eos> Following, at Saber's request.<eos> He has rather a large bounty on him that many find hard to resist.<eos> He's very careful.<eos> So you and Saber?
Yeah, we must be in they eye of the mire.<eos> Something tells me we're about to walk into something much more dangerous.<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Hey, guys, can we talk about this?<eos> Did you get a look at those things?
Organized.<eos> Soldiers.<eos> They're protecting something.<eos> A good sign.<eos> If you say so.
Say what?<eos> It's always gotta be the hard way.<eos> Now we can proceed.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Why, you!
I think I know what happened to the rest of my crew.<eos> It's synthetic, but I can feel it.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Yeah, about that, I brought you a present.<eos> Can you travel?
We have to get out of here.<eos> Yeah, about that, I brought you a present.<eos> Can you travel?<eos> I'd like to, but I don't think so.<eos> - You have to save your sister.
I will return to Ares soon enough.<eos> But first we must honor my brother with a funeral pyre.<eos> I am far from dead!<eos> - Well, that was unexpected.<eos> - You said he was dead!
Lorthos!<eos> You're still on the wrong side, I see!<eos> That's Lorthos?<eos> From your stories I expected more.<eos> You'll make a nice pair of boots!
- Make it hurt!<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> Split up!<eos> Draw their fire!<eos> - Control, are you getting this?
Control, destroy all hostile targets.<eos> We're in pursuit of the heirs.<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Who exactly are you?
Who exactly are you?<eos> Saber Raine.<eos> A mercenary.<eos> I prefer adventurer.<eos> Well, you've stumbled into quite the adventure this time.
I prefer adventurer.<eos> Well, you've stumbled into quite the adventure this time.<eos> Always seems to happen that way.<eos> Turn around.<eos> You really don't understand what's happening here.
Always seems to happen that way.<eos> Turn around.<eos> You really don't understand what's happening here.<eos> I... I think I do.<eos> You teamed up with some bad guys tried to kill your brother. Some sort of plan for world domination, blah blah blah.
You really don't understand what's happening here.<eos> I... I think I do.<eos> You teamed up with some bad guys tried to kill your brother. Some sort of plan for world domination, blah blah blah.<eos> My job was to find you.<eos> I'll let you sort the rest out with your people.
I'll let you sort the rest out with your people.<eos> - So you're for hire?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Damn, I guess that does make me a mercenary?<eos> But if you're thinking of making some sort of counter offer, don't even bother.
This changes everything.<eos> I am now open for negotiations.<eos> My prices are extremely reasonable.<eos> Kneel.<eos> You need me to profess my undying loyalty, I can do that. I can do that.

You handled that well, kid.<eos> I need their help, but I cannot tell them what I learned about our dark origin.<eos> I know.<eos> Your people have risen from the ashes of the past.<eos> Been reborn. You will lead them to greatness.
With men like you and Saber by my side, we can build a brighter future. - We can.<eos> - I trust all is prepared?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Find her.<eos> You clean up nice.
- I trust all is prepared?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Find her.<eos> You clean up nice.<eos> You look amazing.
You look amazing.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's been a long time since I've seen a real city.<eos> Walked among people without feeling like a target.<eos> Well you're safe with me here.
We save the universe.<eos> What are they?<eos> A long forgotten army.<eos> My army.<eos> To control them you will learn to manipulate the mana stone, as I have.
My army.<eos> To control them you will learn to manipulate the mana stone, as I have.<eos> - Will I...<eos> - Yes.<eos> You'll go through a transformation.

YOU HAVE SET ME FREE.

We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.<eos> Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.
Then again, there might be a rainbow.<eos> But rainbows are dumb.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> I love rainbows.<eos> You're not very good at this, are ya?
Just kidding.<eos> I love rainbows.<eos> You're not very good at this, are ya?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.

That's a lie.<eos> You're really, really good at it.<eos> Hi, Brainy.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Thank goodness you're here.
It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.<eos> Super strength.<eos> Which I distill into this.<eos> I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.<eos> Here, you can try it first.

All clear!<eos> Yeah, you see, when you say things like "all clear," it makes me not want to...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hi, Clumsy.<eos> You're just in time to witness scientific history.
If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.<eos> Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.
Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.<eos> Probably something to do with the fact that you're not a real...
My plan is simple.<eos> Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs, drain them of their magic and, finally, use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world!<eos> Look at me with hair.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Come on.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, who are you?
Don't go.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, who are you?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.
I have a bad feeling about this.<eos> Do you?<eos> Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.<eos> You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.

A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?<eos> I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."<eos> - I would never call you that.<eos> - Your loss.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you hiding?
- I would never call you that.<eos> - Your loss.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Hand it over, you pseudo-Smurf.
What do we have here?<eos> A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.<eos> - Where did you get it?
- Fine. Don't tell me.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Stupid reverse psychology never works.<eos> Who cares?<eos> You've already given me what I need.
I'm a genius.<eos> Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.<eos> Prepare my trail mix.<eos> Smurfette, congratulations.<eos> You've just led me to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.
And I'll be like...<eos> And they'll be like... "Run!<eos> No!<eos> Run, run, run!"<eos> You evil little genius.
- But, Papa, but...<eos> - Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going. Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.
No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going. Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.<eos> - What?<eos> You're right.
Exactly. I couldn't agree more.<eos> Right, guys?<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - What are you talking about, Smurfette?
- Come on, guys.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - Okay, I'm moving.<eos> - What's your endgame here?<eos> Did you get pecked on the noggin, Smurfette?
And then, just for good measure, we'll think about it some more.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Great talk, Papa.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> Hefty, I know that's you.
I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> Hefty, I know that's you.<eos> 'Sup, Smurfette?<eos> Brainy.<eos> How did you do that?
How did you do that?<eos> And, I assume, Clumsy.<eos> - All good.<eos> - What are you guys doing out here?<eos> We knew you were up to something.
Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?<eos> I'm seeing stars.<eos> Good work, Clumsy.<eos> You may have discovered a new subspecies of flying insectoid.
Watch it!<eos> Let me go!<eos> These nests are made of some material I've never seen before.<eos> You know, I think I've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day.<eos> Hey! What are you doing here?
Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?<eos> You are never going to find that village, Gargamel.
- Get 'em, Azrael!<eos> - Smurfintine!<eos> - Smurfintine! - Smurfintine!<eos> Smurfintine!<eos> Hey, you.
- Smurfintine!<eos> - Smurfintine! - Smurfintine!<eos> Smurfintine!<eos> Hey, you.<eos> You're the clumsy one, right?
It's not really happy times right now!<eos> - Just stay in the light, Clumsy.<eos> - Too late.<eos> I'm walking into the darkness!<eos> What are you...
That is it!<eos> I'm punching us out of here.<eos> It's collapsing.<eos> Hefty!<eos> Put those fists away before you get us killed!
- Bucky?<eos> - Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.
Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...<eos> You shine.
You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...<eos> You shine.<eos> So, anyway, we're smurfy?<eos> I think you and the boys have been grounded long enough.
I think you and the boys have been grounded long enough.<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Okay. I'm opening the door.<eos> And I'm walking in to talk more.<eos> You there?
- Don't be weird.<eos> - You don't be weird.<eos> We can camp here for the night.<eos> I'll start us a fire.<eos> Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?
Yeah, sure.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> Well, not tons of fun, but it's had its moments.<eos> Kind of.<eos> You know what I'm trying to say.
It hasn't been that much fun.<eos> Well done, Hefty. Well done.<eos> All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it. You're spitting on it.
All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it. You're spitting on it.<eos> That's odd.<eos> Perhaps the wood you collected was damp, Hefty.
According to my manual, it should spark right up.<eos> Hey, I've got an idea.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, no! No! No, no, no.<eos> You know, you're right, Brain Man.
- Say, "Blue cheese." - Blue cheese!<eos> According to the map, we should be arriving at a river.<eos> Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.
Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> You can do it.
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Clumsy, pull the lever!<eos> Seriously?<eos> But you said not to.
- Help!<eos> - Forget that guy.<eos> My cat can't swim.<eos> We gotta help him.<eos> - Are you crazy? Why?
Correction.<eos> This is your fault, too.<eos> Leave her out of this.<eos> Hefty, I don't need you to fight my fights for me.<eos> Wait, now you're mad at me, too?
That's it, Brain Man.<eos> It's time for you to earn your manners badge.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Take cover!<eos> Who are you?
- Look at that hair.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - And that dress.<eos> It's you.<eos> You're a girl.
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.
Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.<eos> She's the best at that kind of thing.<eos> Right, Stormy?<eos> That means "yes."<eos> Have you ever seen a rainbow?
So, what does this Gargamel look like?<eos> You know, he's your typical wizard.<eos> Long black robe, lives alone with his cat and his bird.<eos> It's sad, really.<eos> You're coming with me.
You know, he's your typical wizard.<eos> Long black robe, lives alone with his cat and his bird.<eos> It's sad, really.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> You can point him out.
Yeah.<eos> From a lump of clay.<eos> Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.
From a lump of clay.<eos> Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.<eos> She's just like you, but nice.
That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!<eos> Here, you fly.<eos> That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?
That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Well, then how do you know it's not your thing?
Oh, no.<eos> See?<eos> I told you...<eos> Put a cork in it, Smurfette.<eos> The way I see it, you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us.
He doesn't seem so tough.<eos> Yeah, Gargamel!<eos> That's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove.<eos> - Gargamel?<eos> What are you talking about?
- 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?
Look, you four are coming home with me.<eos> Now.<eos> Not so fast, Papa-thing.<eos> "Papa-thing"?<eos> Are you the one in charge here?
That's right.<eos> I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.<eos> I'm afraid that's quite impossible, because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs.<eos> Whatever you say, Papa-thing.<eos> Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?
I'm afraid that's quite impossible, because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs.<eos> Whatever you say, Papa-thing.<eos> Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?<eos> Well, if the thing fits...<eos> By the way, where'd you learn those moves?
- No!<eos> - Three more for pickup.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> My little creation.<eos> You finally did what you were made for.
You finally did what you were made for.<eos> No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?
No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?
Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.
Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.
No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.<eos> Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.
Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Smurfette? How could you do this to us?
When I'm through with these Smurfs, I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!<eos> Almost all the power.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Smurfette, what a lovely surprise.<eos> Are you done crying in the woods?
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - She can't be serious.<eos> No, no, no, she would never.<eos> Even if I did believe you, which I don't, what could you possibly offer me that I don't already have?
A tiny little massage that I can't even feel?<eos> How about the rest of the Smurfs?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Just think of all the power you'll have once I reveal the location of Smurf Village.
One hundred more Smurfs, that's ten times the power...<eos> No. If you carry the one...<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's a lot more power.<eos> Now, why are you doing this?
- Poor little bro.<eos> I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Hefty, not you, too.
Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> I won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> You never cease to amaze me.
- What's going on in there?<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> Say, "Blue cheese!"<eos> Blue cheese!<eos> I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.
I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.<eos> I knew I should have gotten a dog from the shelter.<eos> I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?<eos> I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.
I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean.<eos> That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.
You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean.<eos> That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.
That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.<eos> I demand an apology.<eos> You were going to learn this one way or another, but I am not your real father.
They had masks on.<eos> I got close to one.<eos> It was a male, about six feet.<eos> And he had this tattoo wrapped around his neck that I told you about.<eos> You know, you find the tattoo artist...
You know, you find the tattoo artist...<eos> - You find the criminal.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> That's what I told them.<eos> Okay. I'm sure you're not supposed to be talking about all of this.
(CLEARS THROAT)<eos> G-52.<eos> If I ever get that bad, shoot me.<eos> Oh.<eos> Did you get one of these?
Did you get one of these?<eos> It came certified mail.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You ever get good news that needed a signature?<eos> You contact anybody down at the plant?
We're watching our waistlines.<eos> Plus we're shit broke.<eos> Okay. Well, don't tie up my table all day. I gotta make a living here.<eos> Did I tell you those guys in the bank had machine guns?<eos> You told us six times already!
Okay. Well, don't tie up my table all day. I gotta make a living here.<eos> Did I tell you those guys in the bank had machine guns?<eos> You told us six times already!<eos> Yeah, well, it keeps going in my head.<eos> Over and over, you know?
Did I tell you those guys in the bank had machine guns?<eos> You told us six times already!<eos> Yeah, well, it keeps going in my head.<eos> Over and over, you know?<eos> Maybe you're having a stroke.
JOE:<eos> I'm going home and sort out my pills.<eos> Tomorrow, gents.<eos> That was a great meal tonight.<eos> What you can do with frozen fish is admirable.
What?<eos> We'll be all right?<eos> Sure, we will.<eos> It always works out in the end.<eos> And then you die.
(COMPUTER CHIMING)<eos> WILLIE:<eos> Hello?<eos> KANIKA:<eos> You get your presents, Boppa?
WILLIE:<eos> Hello?<eos> KANIKA:<eos> You get your presents, Boppa?<eos> You send something?
Boppa.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> All right.<eos> Let's see what else is down in here.<eos> You're getting real big, K.
(SAXOPHONE PLAYING OFF KEY)<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Ezra!<eos> Ezra!<eos> You gotta stop this.
Ezra!<eos> You gotta stop this.<eos> I can't listen anymore.<eos> I've been practicing!<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't matter 'cause you get worse every week.
You gotta stop this.<eos> I can't listen anymore.<eos> I've been practicing!<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't matter 'cause you get worse every week.<eos> It's kind of a miracle. I don't know how you do it.
I've been practicing!<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't matter 'cause you get worse every week.<eos> It's kind of a miracle. I don't know how you do it.<eos> So what's the point?<eos> You're no good, you don't like it, you're not gonna be a professional.
Yeah, but it doesn't matter 'cause you get worse every week.<eos> It's kind of a miracle. I don't know how you do it.<eos> So what's the point?<eos> You're no good, you don't like it, you're not gonna be a professional.<eos> You wanna end up like me, working in a factory?
So what's the point?<eos> You're no good, you don't like it, you're not gonna be a professional.<eos> You wanna end up like me, working in a factory?<eos> And every two months you're getting a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?<eos> You don't want that.
And every two months you're getting a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?<eos> You don't want that.<eos> I don't even like this thing.<eos> No!<eos> And it doesn't like you, either.
I'll go find your grandma.<eos> She's still got to pay me for the session.<eos> You gotta think of it like putting down a horse.<eos> Sometimes, it's the kindest, most ethical thing you can do.<eos> Well, thank you for being so honest with me.
- Yeah?<eos> I never told you this, but I've seen you perform a few times.<eos> - In the West Village with Stan Getz, 1977.<eos> It was stunning.<eos> You saw me play with Getz?
- In the West Village with Stan Getz, 1977.<eos> It was stunning.<eos> You saw me play with Getz?<eos> Sure did.<eos> What are you, following me?
Another day, another A.<eos> Well done, kiddo.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,
Well done, kiddo.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,<eos> "You get straight A's, you get a puppy."
- One can't get enough time. - Oh.<eos> Take a look at that cute picture.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My little K.<eos> When you die, you can will it to her as a memento.
They're taking my house.<eos> I've got 30 days.<eos> Who's taking your house?<eos> The bank.<eos> They're taking your house and you didn't tell us?
They crushed a lot of people's dreams.<eos> And nothing ever happened to them.<eos> We hit a bank, we get away with it, we retire with dignity.<eos> Worst comes to the worst, we get caught, we get a bed, three meals a day and better healthcare than we get now.<eos> You... You're talking about us?
Worst comes to the worst, we get caught, we get a bed, three meals a day and better healthcare than we get now.<eos> You... You're talking about us?<eos> Us and you?<eos> Yeah, I mean, if a gang of thugs can do it, it can't be that hard.<eos> You're out of your frigging mind.
You... You're talking about us?<eos> Us and you?<eos> Yeah, I mean, if a gang of thugs can do it, it can't be that hard.<eos> You're out of your frigging mind.<eos> You have spent 20 years waiting to die, Al.
I want to see my family more than once a year.<eos> And from here on in, I want to have a piece of pie whenever the hell I want a piece of pie.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> (CHUCKLES) Hear, hear.<eos> You were serious today.
- Huh? - Pick up the phone!<eos> Who died?<eos> Nobody died, it's Joe.<eos> I don't talk to criminals.<eos> You heard that?
Hang up.<eos> I'll call him back.<eos> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> What do you want?<eos> The thing is, what do you want, Al?
I'll call him back.<eos> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> What do you want?<eos> The thing is, what do you want, Al?<eos> You want to drift off into the sunset, or do you want to go out with a bang?
You're both out of your minds.<eos> Sleep on it, Al.<eos> I don't need to sleep on anything.<eos> I'm not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, or you, Willie.
I'm not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, or you, Willie.<eos> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> What?<eos> Why did you pick up the phone?
(TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> What?<eos> Why did you pick up the phone?<eos> Because it was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.
What?<eos> Why did you pick up the phone?<eos> Because it was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.<eos> What are you, my psychiatrist now?
Because it was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.<eos> What are you, my psychiatrist now?<eos> More like a psychic.<eos> Well, then you know I'm going to hang up now.
Don't insult me.<eos> Huh. Nice hats.<eos> We got business here, Al.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you mean?
We got business here, Al.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Give me that list.<eos> What are you doing?
What are you doing?<eos> Wait here.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing with my list?<eos> Why did you rip up my list?
(SCOFFS)<eos> Ah, welcome to Value...<eos> Hello, Al.<eos> Hi, Annie.<eos> What are you shopping for?
The whole thing?<eos> The whole damn thing.<eos> You're the boss.<eos> Annie, just let me have the thing.<eos> Come on, you have your own work to do now.
There's no problem.<eos> Let's see.<eos> There's a double coupon in the flyer.<eos> It costs about the same as thighs but, see, these are breasts.<eos> And breasts are better than thighs, don't you think?
So good.<eos> Do you like ham?<eos> Okay.<eos> This will go perfectly with...<eos> I mean, if you want company. It's a big bottle.
Okay.<eos> This will go perfectly with...<eos> I mean, if you want company. It's a big bottle.<eos> Yeah, listen, I got to tell you.<eos> You're a terrific person, but I know what you're doing.
Where the fuck is my basket?<eos> Willie, Willie.<eos> Al's gone.<eos> I got a new getaway car.<eos> Where the hell did you get that thing?
I got a new getaway car.<eos> Where the hell did you get that thing?<eos> I stole it.<eos> Jump in the basket.<eos> Who the hell do you think I am?
Halt! (COUGHING) Stop!<eos> (LAUGHING)<eos> I think we can make the light.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're not going to make the light, Joe.
(LAUGHING)<eos> I think we can make the light.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're not going to make the light, Joe.<eos> You're not gonna make the light.
You're not going to make the light, Joe.<eos> You're not gonna make the light.<eos> SECURITY GUARD:<eos> Hey!<eos> No, Joe, you can't make the light!
You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.<eos> We never asked you to do anything.<eos> I drive you there. I drive you back.<eos> That makes me a getaway driver.<eos> Oh, don't flatter yourself. You drive like my grandmother, and she drove a horse and buggy.
Oh, don't flatter yourself. You drive like my grandmother, and she drove a horse and buggy.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Just for that you can walk home.<eos> Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.<eos> You're not going to make us walk!
(BUZZER BUZZING)<eos> MURPHY: (OVER INTERCOM) Uh...<eos> No habla Inglés.<eos> I know it's you, Murphy.<eos> (SIGHS) What are you doing here, Joe?
MURPHY: (OVER INTERCOM) Uh...<eos> No habla Inglés.<eos> I know it's you, Murphy.<eos> (SIGHS) What are you doing here, Joe?<eos> I've come about the child support you're not paying.
Right now, anxiety.<eos> Listen, Joe, not to be uncool to family and such.<eos> Ex-family.<eos> As you say.<eos> But, what do you want from me, man?
What kind of project?<eos> Oh, well, we'd rather not say.<eos> Well, that makes it harder for me to help you.<eos> We need to find the type of people who do bad things.<eos> What makes you think that I would know people like that?
My kind?<eos> Entrepreneurs?<eos> No. Lowlifes. Deadbeats.<eos> Gangster types.<eos> See, I'm sure that you could point us in the right direction.
He's thinking.<eos> WILLIE:<eos> Looks painful.<eos> I know it looks it, but I've seen him do it before.<eos> It's the drugs, you know?
Oh, this stupid bitch.<eos> I wish I could tase his old ass.<eos> Here comes an eggplant.<eos> Eggplant.<eos> Hey, you.
Eggplant.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> - Hi, Annie.<eos> - Hi!<eos> You're here every day.
Hey, you.<eos> - Hi, Annie.<eos> - Hi!<eos> You're here every day.<eos> Don't you get a day off?
You're here every day.<eos> Don't you get a day off?<eos> No, every day.<eos> - Man, tough schedule. - Mmm.<eos> What are you going to do with this eggplant?
I was thinking about a ratatouille.<eos> I like to slice it paper thin for parmesan.<eos> You know, it soaks up all the juices.<eos> Okay. Sounds good.<eos> You will never, ever taste a better one.
You know, it soaks up all the juices.<eos> Okay. Sounds good.<eos> You will never, ever taste a better one.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive.
Okay. Sounds good.<eos> You will never, ever taste a better one.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - Oh, you think I'm attractive.
You will never, ever taste a better one.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - Oh, you think I'm attractive.<eos> - You're a lovely person.
Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - Oh, you think I'm attractive.<eos> - You're a lovely person.<eos> I think that's wonderful.<eos> But you're not looking for a relationship.
I think that's wonderful.<eos> But you're not looking for a relationship.<eos> Is that right?<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> Well, you have made that perfectly clear, Al.
What do I have to do?<eos> I just don't think you hear me!<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> I hear you real good.<eos> You know what I think?
I have my own place. (CHUCKLES)<eos> (BOTH PANTING)<eos> - Annie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You make a hell of an eggplant parmesan.
Thank you.<eos> Scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns, toast and coffee, please.<eos> MITZI: "Good morning, Mitzi.<eos> Your hair looks nice today."<eos> "Did you get your hair cut?" "Oh yeah, Al, I did."
Scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns, toast and coffee, please.<eos> MITZI: "Good morning, Mitzi.<eos> Your hair looks nice today."<eos> "Did you get your hair cut?" "Oh yeah, Al, I did."<eos> "And you know what I'm in the mood for?" "I don't know, Al. What?"
MITZI: "Good morning, Mitzi.<eos> Your hair looks nice today."<eos> "Did you get your hair cut?" "Oh yeah, Al, I did."<eos> "And you know what I'm in the mood for?" "I don't know, Al. What?"<eos> Mitzi, you look gorgeous.
Mitzi, you look gorgeous.<eos> You smell fantastic.<eos> Now go get me some food, because I'm starving to death.<eos> All right. That's more like it.<eos> Didn't think you'd be joining us today.
You want to take it home? For go?<eos> No! No, leave it here.<eos> Nobody's taking anything from me anymore.<eos> You know something, Al?<eos> You're complicated today.
Now, I don't know you from Adam.<eos> How does Jesus know you're cool?<eos> No, we're cool.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What do you think of these guys, huh?
How does Jesus know you're cool?<eos> No, we're cool.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What do you think of these guys, huh?<eos> What do you think?
What's the matter?<eos> What do you think of these guys, huh?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - (WHINING)<eos> - What do you think, huh?
You tell me.<eos> Good or bad?<eos> Aw, can I hold him?<eos> Can I?<eos> Do you want to go with him?
"Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just give it a go."<eos> You could get life!<eos> Which I guess for you, isn't that long.<eos> But you better think, old man, and you better know.
Hey.<eos> You mind?<eos> Take 'em both.<eos> Okay.<eos> How much time do you think you've got, Willie?
I don't know.<eos> Take a guess.<eos> Two, three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> You look great!
Two, three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> You look great!<eos> Just a feeling.<eos> You asked.
What about you, Al?<eos> I have bad luck.<eos> I'll probably live to be 100.<eos> (JOE AND WILLIE LAUGH)<eos> Then you can do both eulogies.
Who's on the door?<eos> I'll handle that.<eos> Stand guard.<eos> Keep watch.<eos> You know how to handle a gun?
He's getting laid.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I remember what that was like.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> You feeling good?
Give or take.<eos> (INDISTINCT YELLING ON TV)<eos> Get some sleep, young man.<eos> All right.<eos> You too, young man.
(ALARM RINGING)<eos> JOE:<eos> Don't let the omelet touch the fruit.<eos> She likes a separation.<eos> You do this every day?
- No shit.<eos> Yes shit.<eos> I wish my dad did this for me.<eos> So does your daughter.<eos> What are you doing here?
He's just not much with the follow-through.<eos> Give him a shot, babe.<eos> For me.<eos> Sure, Joe.<eos> But only because you're my best friend.
For me.<eos> Sure, Joe.<eos> But only because you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> You're going to do it all.
But only because you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> You're going to do it all.<eos> What's going with you today?<eos> Do you have cancer or something?
I guess I deserve it.<eos> Mostly.<eos> That's one of the smartest things you ever said.<eos> Listen, Joe.<eos> Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.
Listen, Joe.<eos> Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> My business is my business, kid.<eos> Forget that you know it.
Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> My business is my business, kid.<eos> Forget that you know it.<eos> And if in the end, I don't come back, it's on you.
My business is my business, kid.<eos> Forget that you know it.<eos> And if in the end, I don't come back, it's on you.<eos> I can't cover for you anymore.<eos> You're her father.
I can't cover for you anymore.<eos> You're her father.<eos> You got to step up to the plate.<eos> Act like a man.<eos> Even if you have to fake it.
Hang here for one minute.<eos> I got to go to the karaoke thing.<eos> (STUTTERING) I can't.<eos> I got to check in to the cotton candy booth.<eos> Milton, that's where you are right now.
(STUTTERING) I can't.<eos> I got to check in to the cotton candy booth.<eos> Milton, that's where you are right now.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're better off not knowing.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I can't breathe when I wear masks, neither.<eos> WILLIE:<eos> You're so sweet.
You're so sweet.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> JOE:<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Can you make it out of here?
I'm working on one.<eos> Put your hands up and drop the money.<eos> Okay, in three seconds, I'm going to shoot you.<eos> JOE:<eos> You're going to do what?
Yeah, more champagne.<eos> Champagne it is.<eos> (ALL SINGING)<eos> (GROANING)<eos> Whoa, no more booze for you.
Keep it down.<eos> We're not out of the woods yet.<eos> So, what's going on, Willie?<eos> ALBERT:<eos> You don't come to us, you don't tell us you're sick.
So, what's going on, Willie?<eos> ALBERT:<eos> You don't come to us, you don't tell us you're sick.<eos> We're your friends, man.<eos> We're all you got.
We're all you got.<eos> It's my business, guys.<eos> Your business? Your business.<eos> Talk to him, Joe.<eos> I can't... You're a selfish old bastard.
Must be bringing me a kidney.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> UMPIRE:<eos> Strike three!<eos> You're out!
Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Right over here.<eos> Line them up.<eos> I want you to start with that man over there, okay?
Yep.<eos> I'm positive.<eos> I got a great memory.<eos> Hey!<eos> You want to have another look?
You mind?<eos> Uh, he might be sleeping.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I won't wake him.<eos> Oh, good heavens, aren't you just the cutest little thing?
Yeah, come over here.<eos> - (DOG GROWLS, BITES)<eos> - Ah!<eos> - (DOG WHIMPERS)<eos> - You little son of a bitch.
I'm a very sensitive person.<eos> I'm going to be honest with you.<eos> I don't really want to die today.<eos> That's a new one.<eos> But, if I do, I just want to say that you've been a terrific roommate and friend for... 25 years.
But they don't have my good looks.<eos> Or your discretion... Old friend.<eos> And in international news, 2.5 billion dollars earmarked to aid the nation of Nigeria has apparently gone missing.<eos> Newly elected president Ezekiel ibaka has vowed to find the missing funds or resign.<eos> - Did you watch it?
- Yes, it's hardly news.<eos> Just another corrupt dictator stealing from his people.<eos> No. I trust him.<eos> I think he's just been trusting the wrong people.<eos> And you know this because...
And you know this because...<eos> A hunch.<eos> A little digging I've been doing on my own.<eos> How very entrepreneurial of you, darling.<eos> Better watch my back or you'll have my job.

How very entrepreneurial of you, darling.<eos> Better watch my back or you'll have my job.<eos> No, you can keep it, darling.<eos> I like being the brains of the operation.<eos> Is that what you are? So what does that make me?
No, you can keep it, darling.<eos> I like being the brains of the operation.<eos> Is that what you are? So what does that make me?<eos> The muscle, love.<eos> You're all muscle.
So you admit it?<eos> There's nothing to admit, sir.<eos> You caught us. Which would have never happened if you'd stuck to the plan.<eos> You were supposed to miss a few answers on purpose.<eos> Why would you steal an exam paper?
There's nothing to admit, sir.<eos> You caught us. Which would have never happened if you'd stuck to the plan.<eos> You were supposed to miss a few answers on purpose.<eos> Why would you steal an exam paper?<eos> You don't need to cheat.

Why would you steal an exam paper?<eos> You don't need to cheat.<eos> You're a templar.<eos> You have a responsibility.<eos> I expect you to conduct yourself in a certain manner in this world.
I appreciate the distinction.<eos> But why, Simon?<eos> I wanted them to like me.<eos> I wanted to be... A part of something.<eos> - You are a part of something.
I wanted to be... A part of something.<eos> - You are a part of something.<eos> - A part of what?<eos> A family of rich snobs no one likes?<eos> Do you have any idea how this family acquired its fortune?
- You are a part of something.<eos> - A part of what?<eos> A family of rich snobs no one likes?<eos> Do you have any idea how this family acquired its fortune?<eos> Do you even know what it is i do for a living?

That is a very interesting question.<eos> See, a long time ago, in 1119, just after the end of the first crusade...<eos> A small band of knights were traveling back to their kingdom...<eos> You did good, Coop.<eos> Why don't you take some time off?

He's an international thief.<eos> He's wanted for money laundering, computer fraud, smuggling...<eos> - This the guy from Russia?<eos> Coop, look...<eos> You're the kid genius and all, but the director feels we went way out of our comfort zone for you last time.
He compromised an active anti-terrorism operation, and we're what?<eos> We-we're gonna let him walk?<eos> He's not our problem.<eos> The bureau won't back you on this.<eos> - No, but you... - I...
- No, but you... - I...<eos> Won't back you.<eos> Speaking of interpol, - that ever check out?<eos> - What?<eos> In your report, you said this "Saint" set off a homing device alerting interpol to the nuke.
What's your point?<eos> So maybe he wasn't really the bad guy in the situation.<eos> What about the gold?<eos> He took off with most of the bullion, didn't he or what?<eos> What, you think he gave it to charity?
What about the gold?<eos> He took off with most of the bullion, didn't he or what?<eos> What, you think he gave it to charity?<eos> Agent Cooper... I don't wanna hear you talk about this "Saint" again.<eos> And you know what, no more field trips for a while.

She's being unreasonable.<eos> I'm eighteen years old, daddy.<eos> I can go out when I want.<eos> Zooey, I didn't say you couldn't go.<eos> I just said you couldn't drive my car.

I'm not talking to you, Katherine!<eos> Why did you marry her anyway?<eos> She's not even mom's age.<eos> It's totally gross.<eos> God! Why do you always have to be so mean?
Please...<eos> We... her wellbeing is entirely in your hands.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Because I like you, you've got 48 hours.<eos> Patricia, I knew you missed me.
Desperately.<eos> Really just thought you might be interested in something I picked up at brunch.<eos> - One of the waiters.<eos> - Ha. Cute.<eos> Actually, no. But you know that missing aid money for Nigeria?
Well, I've found it.<eos> All of it.<eos> In accounts managed by a private banker.<eos> - Arnie valecross.<eos> You know him?
My girlfriend used to date a guy in the international ops division who'd probably love to help out.<eos> Yeah? Who?<eos> Special agent John fernack.<eos> - Fernack?<eos> And you wanna know why?
And you wanna know why?<eos> She says he's been chasing your Saint for years.<eos> Really?<eos> Fernack.<eos> Please tell me you're hear.
Fernack.<eos> Please tell me you're hear.<eos> "Is valecross here?" Is the more important question.<eos> He is.<eos> Well, if he tries to leave, i expect you to use your many charms to keep him there.

This will be fun.<eos> - Pool side?<eos> - Whenever possible.<eos> Lovely day.<eos> What exactly are you wearing out there?
What exactly are you wearing out there?<eos> Oil...<eos> - Using any protection?<eos> - Always.<eos> You know me.
Hey, there's a guard right behind the adjoining door.<eos> Sorry, my friend.<eos> Nothing a decent bloody Mary won't fix.<eos> Um, my favorite sound.<eos> Well, hello, you promising little box.
Sorry, my friend.<eos> Nothing a decent bloody Mary won't fix.<eos> Um, my favorite sound.<eos> Well, hello, you promising little box.<eos> You are a part of something.

You are a part of something.<eos> You've seen this before, haven't you?<eos> That is the symbol of the knights templar.<eos> - What is it, Simon?<eos> - What did you find?
I can fix this.<eos> Yes, well, I sincerely hope so.<eos> Simon!<eos> Simon?<eos> Why didn't you answer when you heard me call?
Simon!<eos> Simon?<eos> Why didn't you answer when you heard me call?<eos> I'm sorry, I was reading.<eos> I have someone i want you to meet.
Well, I should leave you to it.<eos> Leave us to what?<eos> I think I'll let Xander explain that.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I've heard you've been having some troubles at school.
That's crazy.<eos> A helicopter attack in broad daylight.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna sleep with my shoes on.<eos> There's never a dull moment when Simon templar comes to la.<eos> How's all that gear working out for you?
A helicopter attack in broad daylight.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna sleep with my shoes on.<eos> There's never a dull moment when Simon templar comes to la.<eos> How's all that gear working out for you?<eos> I can see why you're Simon's go-to for local transport and op-tech.
I think that is what detectives would call a clue.<eos> Looks like a diamond.<eos> - It's synthetic.<eos> - Doyle, does this house we're squatting in have a DVD player?<eos> With all due respect, you are as beautiful as you are tech friendly.
Looks like a diamond.<eos> - It's synthetic.<eos> - Doyle, does this house we're squatting in have a DVD player?<eos> With all due respect, you are as beautiful as you are tech friendly.<eos> - Where did you find her?
I need the right frequency to decrypt the data and a password or a key.<eos> Before he died, valecross said the key is in the nomad.<eos> A nomad is a digital file, it doesn't live on a computer. But in separate packets, on multiple servers.<eos> Not here.<eos> I love it when you talk nerd.
I love it when you talk nerd.<eos> So we need to find this nomad, get the key, read the crystal, swap it for the girl, and Bob's your uncle.<eos> - So where the devil do we start?<eos> - The valecross home?<eos> Doyle, have you checked the garage?
I only got a partial trace. Not enough to get his exact location.<eos> The money?<eos> Can you get the money?<eos> Rayt's waiting for it, which means we have a bit of time, but we need to get moving.<eos> If I don't see the money, you'll die just like your daddy.
All we need to worry about is not losing sight of him.<eos> Doyle, corner of grandview and lake.<eos> That's Arnie's data facility. - Can you hack into it?<eos> - I'm testing their firewalls.<eos> Hard to imagine you and rayt marius having much to talk about.

- How are you a detective?<eos> Guys, the firewall is too heavy.<eos> Gonna be really interesting. I think we're being tailed.<eos> Bloody hell, it's fernack.<eos> Darling... Can you run in those heels?
I lock 'em up.<eos> Not me, my friend.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Sorry I'm late. -You're not late, darling.<eos> You're on Simon time.
I'm thinking some queijo minas with pinhao in a half-moon pastels. And maybe some cuscuz branco.<eos> So what happened in rio?<eos> Before your time, darling.<eos> Sonali, good to see you.<eos> You used to be happy to see my face.
Sonali, good to see you.<eos> You used to be happy to see my face.<eos> Remember breakfast in bed at the copa palace?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, tranquilo,<eos> You clip me, i take out your boss.
Remember breakfast in bed at the copa palace?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, tranquilo,<eos> You clip me, i take out your boss.<eos> Sonali, I know I'm not your favorite person anymore, but we need your help.<eos> You burned my super note deal, i lost everything.
You clip me, i take out your boss.<eos> Sonali, I know I'm not your favorite person anymore, but we need your help.<eos> You burned my super note deal, i lost everything.<eos> The ink, that copier built to federal specs.<eos> Look, we had a wonderful time together but I simply couldn't let you destabilize the global economy.
- A bait box?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> I think I'm good.<eos> Are you not at all concerned about Simon?
- Yeah.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> I think I'm good.<eos> Are you not at all concerned about Simon?<eos> You're a big boy.
- Sorry about your guy.<eos> - He's not my guy.<eos> We're associates.<eos> He has never made love to you?<eos> Are you recommending it?
Are we done here?<eos> Very good.<eos> Sonali.<eos> - Ciao.<eos> I thought you said you weren't one to take a punch.
It's all pretend.<eos> How are we for time?<eos> The server resets in 40.<eos> Your point of entry is the emergency exit.<eos> Simon, are you sure you can muster the strength for a midnight heist?
- Okay.<eos> I am not going to let an innocent girl pay for the sins of her father.<eos> Saintly courage worthy of a templar.<eos> The templars are nothing but a boy's own bedtime story, of medieval knights gone bad.<eos> And yet you go, charging to the rescue, heart on your sleeve.
Was it fair to the Japanese at Hiroshima?<eos> Or what about the Jews in Poland?<eos> "Fair" is something created by the weak, because they know they can't defeat the strong.<eos> But what about honor?<eos> I know you love your templar knight stories, Simon, but at some point you'll have to realize that they're just... Stories.
But what about honor?<eos> I know you love your templar knight stories, Simon, but at some point you'll have to realize that they're just... Stories.<eos> It is survival of the fittest out there.<eos> Your enemies will seek out any and all advantages they can.<eos> You must be prepared.
You must be prepared.<eos> How do you prepare for the unexpected?<eos> By expecting everything.<eos> I'm at the outer access door.<eos> You need to disable the alarm.
All right, the best way into the server room is through the vault door.<eos> Careful, it's rigged with explosive bolts, and if these are touched an alarm is triggered, and a set of secondary doors are released.<eos> You're going to have to leave those hinges in place.<eos> Now, the floor behind the escape hatch is made up of pressure sensitive floating tiles.<eos> These must be frozen before you can step on them.
These must be frozen before you can step on them.<eos> The tiles will thaw in ten seconds. So be quick.<eos> I'm at the biometric scanner.<eos> You, give me a hand?<eos> You are now Sidney felzberg...
Finish the job, or I finish you.<eos> That's not how you talk to a lady.<eos> I talk to my wife any way I please.<eos> Ex-wife!<eos> Were you gonna mention this?
That's not how you talk to a lady.<eos> I talk to my wife any way I please.<eos> Ex-wife!<eos> Were you gonna mention this?<eos> You didn't ask.
You didn't ask.<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> You're gonna be okay, but you cannot make a sound, okay?<eos> -Okay. Let's get this off you.<eos> Come here, you little bitch.
Who killed my parents?<eos> You, Simon templar, are just a pawn in a bigger game.<eos> How you doing?<eos> She just used him. Took him for everything he had.<eos> You should know, your father was a very brave man.
How you doing?<eos> She just used him. Took him for everything he had.<eos> You should know, your father was a very brave man.<eos> He risked his life trying to return money stolen from people who desperately need it.<eos> If you like you can finish what he started.
It's taken me an unusually long time to find you.<eos> Looking for this.<eos> I'm getting too old for this.<eos> Hello, Simon.<eos> - I have someone - I want you to meet.
And I'm ashamed of that.<eos> A war story can't be true unless it's got some shame attached to it.<eos> Hey!<eos> Ocre!<eos> What do you think?
This place will be a ghost town. Ticktock, ticktock.<eos> Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, if I don't see you for the rest of the war, be safe.<eos> You too.
That a boy, Enzo.<eos> Get it!<eos> I'm telling you guys, I'm gonna be on the cover of men's health, fuckin' two big-old-tittied chicks on each arm, waves splashing on my pecs and shit.<eos> Chutsky, we're gonna see you on the cover of out magazine with a dick in each hand and shame in your eyes. Like this.<eos> Hey, you smell that?
- Why would it smell like pussy?<eos> Oh, hey, ocre.<eos> What's up?<eos> We were just talking about you.<eos> You look like shit.
- Yeah.<eos> Shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Third floor, southeast corner.<eos> - You say third floor, southeast corner?
Good.<eos> All right, motherfuckers, it's ready.<eos> Let's get it moved.<eos> Hey... shut up, motherfucker.<eos> Burton! Do you remember Steph bertolini?
How many times we gotta go over this shit?<eos> It was, like, a leg thing or, like, she had, like, a baby foot or something...<eos> Oh, my god, it... It couldn't have been polio,<eos> - 'cause they cured that in fuckin' 1957.<eos> - And why do you know that?
Oh, my god, it... It couldn't have been polio,<eos> - 'cause they cured that in fuckin' 1957.<eos> - And why do you know that?<eos> Because, asshole, I looked it up.<eos> Yeah, you looked it up 'cause you thought your girl had polio, so...
Get in the fucking back.<eos> Oh, he pulled rank on your ass!<eos> - You're gonna love it.<eos> - You got no jokes now, huh, boy?<eos> All right. You can touch him.
All right. You can touch him.<eos> - Just keep below the waist.<eos> - Yeah, great. He's gonna touch his hajji peepee.<eos> Oh, Enzo, yo, came up with a nickname.<eos> You can't come up with your own nickname, man.
- Hold up!<eos> - Open up! He moved!<eos> He's not dead!<eos> Calm the fuck down.<eos> What are you talking about?
Calm the fuck down.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - He's fucking moving'.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What the hell you talking about?
Will you put the gun down?<eos> It's 113 degrees, all right?<eos> He's thawing out.<eos> That's why he's jumping around like a catfish.<eos> - You sure? - Will you chill out?
And now you want us to go to some place we don't control. For what?<eos> A photo op?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Christ.<eos> You look like you went swimming.
Nah. Nah, you couldn't pay me enough to ride the turret.<eos> We hit shit, all the fire's coming your way, buddy.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> But when we get home, I'll remember the breeze, sunshine.<eos> Like you'll remember sitting in the dark, sweating your ass off.
That's true.<eos> Look, guys, I don't want anybody who's not fully on board.<eos> Okay?<eos> You don't want in, you let me know, and I'll get you replaced.<eos> Oh, I think you should take the tampon out of your ass. All right?
I'm tired of this whole green zone shit.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I fuckin' knew it.<eos> Hey.<eos> You go, I go.
I fuckin' knew it.<eos> Hey.<eos> You go, I go.<eos> You want that on your conscience?<eos> Are you a grown man?
And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> You can't come out here and outsource your decision to me.<eos> If you're in, here's the sat phone. You got a call to make.<eos> You ain't gotta look good.
- Clear, sergeant.<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> Enzo?<eos> Clear, sergeant.<eos> Okay, you can step back in your car now.
We... I want you to be real clear about this.<eos> We will not leave. We will not leave until the problem is solved.<eos> He say those people you say are bad will not hurt us unless we help the Americans.<eos> He wants us to leave.<eos> Listen here, you piece of shit. I hope you get shot and fuckin' die.
They're just scared.<eos> What is that, some kinda fuckin' excuse?<eos> - We're all fuckin' scared, ocre.<eos> - Yeah, well, give it time.<eos> You know what? You need to crawl out from behind your faggotty little rainbow.
I'm waiting for a fuckin' head.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Get moving!<eos> - You got him?
Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> We're making progress.<eos> At a goddamn snail's pace, sergeant.<eos> Tell him, Burton.<eos> Tell him what you said to me.
At a goddamn snail's pace, sergeant.<eos> Tell him, Burton.<eos> Tell him what you said to me.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Speak the fuck up and tell him what you said to me.
Can't come soon enough.<eos> All I'm looking forward to...<eos> Is getting back home to the frisky kitty buffet.<eos> - Hmm? Getting me a...<eos> - Who do you wanna see?
Will you say it?<eos> - Shit, sorry.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> - No, man, You're good.<eos> Will you just say it even if you don't mean it, Anne? Just say it.
- No, man, You're good.<eos> Will you just say it even if you don't mean it, Anne? Just say it.<eos> No, never mind.<eos> Okay, Anne.<eos> You take care too.
I'm just fuckin' scared, man.<eos> My hands shaking and shit, like...<eos> - Now look at me.<eos> Look at me. - A little bitch.<eos> Now you drive this motherfucker.
Look at me. - A little bitch.<eos> Now you drive this motherfucker.<eos> And I shoot anything that gets in the way.<eos> You understand me?<eos> You keep me safe up there.
Eagle six, this is eagle four.<eos> Blocking position three is set.<eos> Roger that, eagle four.<eos> All positions are set.<eos> - What you got up there, brother?
Shit!<eos> Ah, fuck! Ah, shit! Shit!<eos> - Are you good?<eos> - No, man! The son of a bitch shot me!<eos> Where are you fuckin' hit? Where are you hit?
All right?<eos> Yeah, that's right. Breathe.<eos> Come on, baby, breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> You got it. Fuck is he?
- Right here.<eos> Right here.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - You're gonna be fine, Burton.
Right here.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - You're gonna be fine, Burton.<eos> You need to wake up, man.
- I'm sorry, sergeant Harper.<eos> - Enzo, you're all right.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> We'll see you soon, Enzo.<eos> You just watch Burton!
- Enzo, you're all right.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> We'll see you soon, Enzo.<eos> You just watch Burton!<eos> You watch Burton, okay?
You just watch Burton!<eos> You watch Burton, okay?<eos> You're gonna be good!<eos> We'll see you soon!<eos> You fuck!
Mm mmm something smells scrum-diddly-icious.<eos> How was school?<eos> Legalized torture paid for by the American taxpayer.<eos> - Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?<eos> Jodi, you're graduating this year. I think it's time you figured out where you're headed.
If we approach her like confident, mature adults, she will respect us and then we can coexist in peace.<eos> (squeals)<eos> (yells) (rattling) (banging) - What the?<eos> But it's this or suffer from abject humiliation for the rest of the year.<eos> - So I said to her if you don't stay away from Rick,
How's it going, guys?<eos> - Well we haven't been roofied yet so. - Wow.<eos> Aren't you enchanting? - This is her trying to be nice.<eos> - (scoffs) I'm hoping to get time off from this conversation for good behavior.<eos> - You're funny, Wellesley.
- Mindy like...<eos> - Like Mindy.<eos> - Like Mindy, cool.<eos> Any reason it would be awkward for me not to know your name?<eos> - Not unless you're an avid follower of the piccolo section in the school marching band.
- [Boy] Who's Jodi?<eos> (keyboard clattering)<eos> (lighthearted flute playing)<eos> ♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪<eos> Yow! (laughter) Oh you're such a good kisser.
- Jodi, wait!<eos> (upbeat pop music)<eos> - How epic was prank eight?<eos> - If you're going to be in power next year, this is your new Bible, the 48 Laws of Power.<eos> I suggest you heed law number one.
Science-fiction is about what could be.<eos> - Yeah, the Matt Smith years completely turned the series around.<eos> - Completely.<eos> - Tell you what, give me the title of one Neal Stephenson novel, just one, and I'll join your little group.<eos> - You think skinny, anemic fanboys have a monopoly on the one fictional genre where women and people of color get to exist outside of backwards societal norms and traditional confinements?
- You're just so unapologetic for who you are. - That's been a recurring problem.<eos> - I rub people the wrong way too.<eos> I mean, I haven't actually yet. But I want to someday.<eos> First I have to figure out how to tell them.<eos> - That you're rude and obnoxious?
- But then in ninth grade, the Young Astronomers Association selected me for the Rising Star Award, which I accepted despite the lazy pun and then in 10th grade I won second prize at the state science fair for my project anisotropic versus isotropic materials.<eos> - Okay Mindy, it's clear that you're a really talented scientist.<eos> Great grades, great test scores.<eos> But what makes you tick?<eos> What makes you special?
First of all, I'm sorry. I had no idea that was gonna happen.<eos> What's going on in American Psycho Barbie's head?<eos> Do you have a song about rickets for my grandad? He's got rickets.<eos> - I don't, I don't get it.<eos> I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul.
But what am I supposed to do?<eos> Not all of us have the guts to stage a full-scale rebellion.<eos> - Mindy's the brains behind the operation. - You just write the theme music?<eos> Look um, for what it's worth,<eos> I'm glad you didn't transfer schools.
I call it Lipschitz and giggles.<eos> - You're right, I do have the vague urge to laugh.<eos> - Oh Dan, right? - Dave.<eos> - Dave, Dave like.. - Like Dave.<eos> - Like Dave. - So do you know anyone who can get me into the Whitney protection program?
- I'm going to cut right to the chase.<eos> I intend to rule this school next year.<eos> But the only way you become the best is by working for the best.<eos> I'm the only one who knows how to wield a sword effectively. - Whoa whoa whoa. I thought we were letting Colin win so we could prank him.<eos> - No, we never went over that. - Um no, you're not gonna be king, I'm gonna be king.
(yells)<eos> - And the prom queen is...<eos> The lovely Miss Claire Stuart.<eos> - That's you, go. - Congratulations.<eos> Oh wow, you look lovely.
("Green Equals Go" by The Phantoms) - [Mindy] No!<eos> (chuckles)<eos> - Where have you been? - In Europe, proms don't start until 11.<eos> - Say you're sorry! - Why couldn't you just be happy for me?<eos> - Because you were too busy exploring your sexuality to attend to my emotional needs.
(feet squeaking)<eos> - Jodi Shallenberger, is it Jodi? Jodi Shallenberger! Oh my god!<eos> I couldn't. - What are you doing here?<eos> (exhales heavily)<eos> - I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
- [Mindy] We had tried so hard to tear down the entire system that we lost sight of what our high school really was, people, people on the inside, people on the outside,<eos> people learning who they are.<eos> - [Jodi] Who they want to be.<eos> - [Mindy] Who they don't want to be.<eos> - [Jodi] Because no matter who you are.

It's not for junkies who need to score.<eos> So that was me.<eos> No job, no money.<eos> No access to the little fella.<eos> And then you went back on the heroin.
It's not in my interest to squeeze you too hard, and it's not in your interest to provoke me.<eos> So let's meet in the middle.<eos> 10% of your salary per annum.<eos> Paid monthly on a rolling, indefinite basis.<eos> You disgusting shit!
Franco?<eos> Franco.<eos> Come on in.<eos> All right?<eos> - You ready?
Come on in.<eos> All right?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Aye.<eos> You got it?
All right?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Aye.<eos> You got it?<eos> I hope you've not been fucking drinking.
Bit of blood. - No damage. All right?<eos> - Right. No bother, Franco.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, do it.<eos> - Are you sure?
All right.<eos> All right, do it.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Just fucking do it.<eos> You fucking prick!
All right, do it.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Just fucking do it.<eos> You fucking prick!<eos> - You've stabbed us in the liver.
Slap it. Slap it.<eos> Shit!<eos> Don't fucking touch her!<eos> Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> You in this with her, are you?
Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> You in this with her, are you?<eos> You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, Cunt, you fucking die.
You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, Cunt, you fucking die.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> - Where were you?
Well, calm down, okay?<eos> Worked the first time okay, didn't it?<eos> - I'm going back to work for Doyle.<eos> - Doyle?<eos> No, no, no, you're not doing that.
- Why not?<eos> - Doyle's a gangster.<eos> In the sauna, no man would dare to hurt a woman.<eos> Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay?
I don't like to think of you working there, okay?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I fuck men?<eos> How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.

I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!<eos> What did you think I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?<eos> I was a fucking junkie!<eos> Aye, suppose you were.
I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I missed you, man.<eos> Don't go trying to kill yourself again, eh?<eos> No. Not while I got my friend in town, eh?<eos> You see old Simon?
You see old Simon?<eos> Simon?<eos> No, no.<eos> He's probably too busy.<eos> You got to see old Simon, man.

I did an accounting course.<eos> I work for a small business.<eos> Stock management software for the retail sector.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Well, as you can see, I'm running my old auntie's pub.
But there we go, eh?<eos> - My lot in life.<eos> - I see.<eos> £16,000!<eos> You thieving fucking bastard!

- I see.<eos> £16,000!<eos> You thieving fucking bastard!<eos> You missed a trick! That's what hurts, isn't it?<eos> That I had the brains and the fucking balls to steal the money and you didn't!
Fucking get off me.<eos> - Fucking hell!<eos> Shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> You fucking bastard.
What I'm gonna do, Veronika, is I'm gonna draw him back in as my friend, my very best friend, my partner, and then I'm gonna hurt him.<eos> I'm gonna hurt him in every way that I can.<eos> - £200 short.<eos> - I owed someone.<eos> Yeah, you bought cocaine.
Shut it.<eos> Veronika...<eos> I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What's the fucking matter with you?
Veronika...<eos> I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What's the fucking matter with you?<eos> Frank, is that you?
Frank, is that you?<eos> Who the fuck else it gonna be?<eos> But the police might be watching.<eos> Well, that's why I came in the back window, woman.<eos> Do you still got my kitbag?
Well, that's why I came in the back window, woman.<eos> Do you still got my kitbag?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> Frank, you're bleeding.
Ya fucking beauty.<eos> But, Dad...<eos> That's right, son.<eos> I'm home.<eos> But what are you gonna do?
But what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.
I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching fucking telly all day. That's for sure.<eos> - Frank, what if...<eos> - No, no, listen.<eos> You and me, son.<eos> You and me.
- What?<eos> - I'm doing a diploma in hotel management.<eos> Good one.<eos> Fucking... Fucking had us there.<eos> Seriously, son, you and me, you and me.
Look at him, June. Look at our boy.<eos> He cannot fucking wait.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Never mind, Frank.<eos> It's just great to have you back.
Spud. "Detox the system."<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's not getting it out of your body that's the problem. It's getting it out of your mind.<eos> You are an addict.
So be addicted.<eos> Be addicted to something else.<eos> Like running until I feel sick? Yes.<eos> Or something else.<eos> You've got to channel it. You've got to control it.
You've got to channel it. You've got to control it.<eos> People try all sorts.<eos> Some people do boxing. - Boxing?<eos> - Well, it's just an example.<eos> I don't... I don't mean you should...
People try all sorts.<eos> Some people do boxing. - Boxing?<eos> - Well, it's just an example.<eos> I don't... I don't mean you should...<eos> So, what did you channel it into?
- Well, it's just an example.<eos> I don't... I don't mean you should...<eos> So, what did you channel it into?<eos> Getting away.<eos> Do you remember, Mark... You remember that girl, Sharron?
Your very first sexual encounter.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember shoplifting in Woolworths together and you got caught, you gave my name?
- How about this one?<eos> Warm day, sunny afternoon.<eos> Two young lads, and we clubbed together and bought our very first hit off Swanney.<eos> Our very first bag of heroin.<eos> - Do you remember that?
And we went down that park, back of Banana Flats. - Dog shit park.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And we shared a needle.<eos> Shared a needle, yeah.<eos> You went first.
And we shared a needle.<eos> Shared a needle, yeah.<eos> You went first.<eos> Your blood runs in my veins, Mark.<eos> Would you stop looking at your fucking watch?
Would you stop looking at your fucking watch?<eos> - I have a flight to catch.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> So you're Plan B.
- Shit.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.
Is he doing that a lot?<eos> As often as he can.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Gone.<eos> Gone? How could you let him go?
- Gone.<eos> Gone? How could you let him go?<eos> Simon.<eos> Simon!<eos> How could you let him go?
I'm not finished yet. I'm not finished with him!<eos> The fuck are you staring at?<eos> Cunt robbed me of £16,000.<eos> I'm getting divorced.<eos> You just came back to tell me that?
- And the children?<eos> - There aren't any.<eos> - None?<eos> - No.<eos> So when you said wife, two kids... James and...
- No.<eos> So when you said wife, two kids... James and...<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Laura, that wasn't strictly true? - No.<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?
And the no-kids thing, was... Was that a problem?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Yes, it was a problem.<eos> It was a fucking big problem.<eos> - All right? That make you happy?
Sauna, please.<eos> - A brothel.<eos> - Well...<eos> The sad thing is... The most pathetic thing of all is that I can't think of anything better.<eos> So you're gonna help me? Find the money?
- She's not here.<eos> She doesn't really like staying over.<eos> She complains that it's a mess, all that sort of thing.<eos> - Does she?<eos> - Not why you stayed, is it?
What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Grab anything you can carry.
What the fuck's going on down here?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Ya Cunt, you!<eos> You fucking beauty, you!
Hey. Bring in the telly.<eos> Who's this, then?<eos> This big handsome bastard is none other than my son.<eos> Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.<eos> - So you're teaching him the trade?
This big handsome bastard is none other than my son.<eos> Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.<eos> - So you're teaching him the trade?<eos> - He's a little bit to learn though, eh?<eos> Well, you're in the right hands, son.
But if nothing else, history has shown us very clearly these are people whom it is unwise to provoke.<eos> You aren't from 'round here, are you, lads?<eos> You not gonna give us a song?<eos> I-I-I-I can sing. I'll just... I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.
You not gonna give us a song?<eos> I-I-I-I can sing. I'll just... I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.<eos> I can't play the fucking piano.<eos> You know those two chords.
You cannot go with me dressed like that.<eos> See, I don't really think, you know, I'm into it.<eos> - He doesn't want to go, Frank.<eos> - Doesn't want to go?<eos> Where else you gonna go?
Well, that's a blow and no mistake, no two ways about that.<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!
Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!<eos> Hotel fucking management.<eos> You put him up to this.
- I see it now.<eos> - No, Frank.<eos> - Dad, leave it. - "Leave it"?<eos> I don't want to fucking leave it!<eos> What if I don't want to fucking leave it? What you gonna do about that, eh?
Tell you what... Free pop.<eos> - No, Frank!<eos> - Shut it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stick one on then, you Cunt.
Stick one on then, you Cunt.<eos> Take a fucking swipe at me.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.
Take a fucking swipe at me.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.
Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.
